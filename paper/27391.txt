What Does and Does Not Correlate with COVID-19 Death Rates

NBER Working Paper No. 27391

JEL No. I1,Q5,R4

                                           ABSTRACT

We correlate county-level COVID-19 death rates with key variables using both linear regression
and negative binomial mixed models, although we focus on linear regression models. We include
four sets of variables: socio-economic variables, county-level health variables, modes of
commuting, and climate and pollution patterns. Our analysis studies daily death rates from April
4, 2020 to May 27, 2020. We estimate correlation patterns both across states, as well as within
states. For both models, we find higher shares of African American residents in the county are
correlated with higher death rates. However, when we restrict ourselves to correlation patterns
within a given state, the statistical significance of the correlation of death rates with the share of
African Americans, while remaining positive, wanes. We find similar results for the share of
elderly in the county. We find that higher amounts of commuting via public transportation,
relative to telecommuting, is correlated with higher death rates. The correlation between driving
into work, relative to telecommuting, and death rates is also positive across both models, but
statistically significant only when we look across states and counties. We also find that a higher
share of people not working, and thus not commuting either because they are elderly, children or
unemployed, is correlated with higher death rates. Counties with higher home values, higher
summer temperatures, and lower winter temperatures have higher death rates. Contrary to past
work, we do not find a correlation between pollution and death rates. Also importantly, we do
not find that death rates are correlated with obesity rates, ICU beds per capita, or poverty rates.
Finally, our model that looks within states yields estimates of how a given state's death rate
compares to other states after controlling for the variables included in our model; this may be
interpreted as a measure of how states are doing relative to others. We find that death rates in the
Northeast are substantially higher compared to other states, even when we control for the four
sets of variables above. Death rates are also statistically significantly higher in Michigan,
Louisiana, Iowa, Indiana, and Colorado. California's death rate is the lowest across all states.

1    Executive Summary
    We correlate county-level COVID-19 death rates (death per thousand people) with key variables
using both mulitple linear regression and negative binomial mixed models, although we focus on
linear regression models, the standard statistical tool used by economists. We include four sets
of variables: county-level socio-economic variables, the modes of commuting, county-level health
variables, and climate and pollution patterns. The socio-economic variables included are percentage
of residents that are African American, Hispanic, white and other, the poverty share, the percentage
of residents that are over 65, the percentage of people living in owner occupied housing, and the
median home value. Our commuting mode variables include the share of workers driving, taking
public transit, biking, walking, working from home, and not commuting at all (i.e., not working).
Our health variables measure the share of smokers, diabetics, and uninsured in the county, obesity
rates, and the number of ICU beds per capita. Finally, our climate and pollution variables include
the average summer and winter temperatures and the level of air pollution, measured by the average
amount of P M2.5 in the air.
    It is important to understand that this study, and other observational analyses like it, only
identify correlations: these relationships are not necessarily causal. That is, one cannot read this
study, or others like it, to imply that changing one of the variables in our model would change
death rates; we can only say how the death rates and the variables analyzed move together. We
take much care in stressing this throughout the note. While causal relationships are often needed
to base policy upon, the correlations we identify may help policy makers identify variables that
may potentially be causally related to COVID-19 death rates and adopt appropriate policies after
understanding the causal relationship. Additionally, it is important to note the potential gap
between true COVID-19 deaths and the deaths data that is available and consequently used in this
study. This gap, which is a result of a county’s ability to capture or miss deaths, quite likely varies
between each county as well, depending on different testing capacities. As a result, some of the
correlations we uncover may reflect correlations between the variables in our model and reporting
errors.
    The multiple regression framework used in our analysis does, however, allow researchers and
policy makers to better focus their attention on potential causal mechanisms that might be driving
the correlations we uncover. The way to interpret the correlations we estimate is that these are the
correlations between death rates and a given variable, say the share of residents that are African
American, after controlling for the other variables in the model. So, for example, if we find a
positive relationship between African Americans and death rates, we can say that this relationship
is not driven by income and/or health insurance disparities because we control for income and
health insurance in the model. The causal mechanism has to be some factor that is not already
in our statistical model. Therefore, our framework can not only say what is and what is not
correlated with death rates, but also allows policy makers to eliminate potential channels driving
these important correlations.
    Our analysis studies county-level daily death rates from April 4, 2020 to May 27, 2020. We

                                                  1
estimate separate statistical models for each day and show the patterns of correlations over time.
We note that we omit the five counties that comprise New York City in our main analysis. We
include the results that include these counties in the Appendix.
   We estimate linear regression models both with and without what are known as “state fixed
effects.” State fixed effects are a set of indicator (dummy) variables, one for each state, that allow
each state to have their own baseline death rates. These differences in baseline death rates capture
variables that are common across counties within the same state. Which state we choose as the
comparison state is arbitrary and does not affect the relative death rates across any two states.
We choose Alabama. Because these measure the relative death rates across states after controlling
for their socio-economic variables, health variables, commute patterns, and climate and pollution
patterns, one can interpret these as whether a given state is fairing better or worse in terms of
death rates, conditional on these variables.
   The inclusion of state fixed effects also changes the interpretation of the other variables included
in the model. When state fixed effects are not included, the correlations are measured using
variation in death rates and the variables included in the model both within a state and across
states. However, when the state fixed effects are included, only variation across counties but within
the same state, is used to measure the correlation. The correlation patterns across these two models
are important because often one might find two variables correlate with each other across states,
but not within. In cases like these one should worry that the former correlation is driven by other
factors, common to a given state, not accounted for in the statistical model.
   In the models that do not control for the state fixed effects, A higher share of African Americans
rates are correlated with higher death rates; this correlation remains positive when we control
for the state, but is no longer statistically significant. To give a sense of the magnitude of the
correlation, the coefficient (without state effects) at the end of the sample implies that deaths per
1,000 people are, on average, 1.262 higher in a county that has all African American residents
compared to a county that has no African American residents. The average county-level death rate
at the end of the sample is 0.119 (omitting New York City). One useful thought experiment is to
consider the death rates in two “average” counties one with an African American share of the lowest
county in our data (0%) and one with an African American share equal to the largest we observe
(87%). Our results suggest that moving between these two counties would be associated with an
increase in the death rate of 1.10 per 1,000 residents, nearly a 10-fold increase. The coefficient
with fixed state effects implies more than a tripling in the death rate; however, we stress that this
is not statistically significant. Given, the importance of this issue, we encourage policy makers
and researchers to investigate the causal relationship between death rates and the share of African
American residents.
   As noted above, this correlation is not driven by any combination of the other variables in our
model. For example, a natural instinct among policy makers may be to think this correlation is
because of income disparities. It is not. We control for income in our multiple regression model,
so any income disparities between African Americans and other races would be additional to the


                                                  2
correlation we uncover. Similarly, we control for health insurance status, diabetes, poverty rates,
obesity, smoking rates, and public transit use. Therefore, the correlation we uncover between death
rates and the share of African Americans cannot be driven by these other variables. That is to
say, the reason why African Americans face higher death rates is not because they have higher
rates of uninsured, poverty, diabetes, etc.; it must be some other mechanism. For example, it could
be because the quality of their insurance is lower, the quality of their hospitals is lower, or some
other systemic reason. Our analysis can hopefully allow policy makers to focus on a narrower set
of potential causal links.
   We find higher rates of diabetes in the county is correlated with higher death rates whether we
control for the state or not; however, this relationship is no longer statistically significance when
controlling for state, but remains positive. A higher share of elderly in the county are correlated
with higher death rates whether we control for the state or not, although the statistical significance
is marginal. Finally, we find that counties with higher home values, higher summer temperatures,
and lower winter temperatures have higher death rates.
   A striking and robust relationship is found between death rates and public transit use. We find
higher rates of commuting via public transportation is associated with higher death rates compared
to all other modes of commuting, including not working, whether we control for state fixed effects
or not. This correlation is statistically significant when comparing with telecommuting. Counties
with a higher share of workers driving and walking, relative to telecommuting, also have statistically
significantly higher death rates. Taken together, these results suggest that counties with high levels
of telecommuters have lower death rates.
   The magnitude of the public transportation correlation is large. The share of people commuting
via public transportation ranges from 0 to 20.6 percent across the counties in our sample (again,
omitting New York City counties). The coefficient from the model with fixed state effects implies
that a 20.6 percentage point increase in public transportation use (relative to telecommuting), the
range in public transit use in our data, is associated with a 0.99 increase in the death rate per 1,000
people. This increase is nearly 10 times the average death rate across all counties of 0.119.
   One can speculate as to what might be driving these correlations. We uncover two stylized
facts. First, the mode of commute correlated with the highest death rates is public transit. Second,
depending on which model we focus on, there is evidence that all modes of commutes, other
than biking, are associated with higher death rates relative to telecommuting. A scenario that
is consistent with both of these stylized facts is that some of higher death rate associated with
public transit use is coming from public transit itself. And, some is coming from the day-to-day
interaction with others as part of the types of jobs those workers taking public transit do. This
second effect is also present for those walking and driving to work and the reason they face higher
rates; these workers also have more interaction with others compared to telecommuting. Combined,
if this speculation is correct, it may point to a greater need to disinfect and socially distance public
systems and a greater need for social distancing at work.
   This story does not explain the positive correlation between death rates and the “other” mode


                                                   3
share, which represents those not working—elderly, children, and the unemployed.1 It is not likely
the higher death rates associated with other is because of elderly given that we control for the
share of elderly in the model. Therefore, this positive correlation is likely the result of a greater
number of children and unemployed. Perhaps, for example, the causal link is do to those counties
with greater children have larger social networks and, thus, higher exposure rates, and the stress
of unemployment is an additional causal mechanism.
        Also importantly, we do not find that death rates are correlated with local pollution, obesity
rates, ICU beds per capita, or poverty rates. The lack of a correlation with pollution levels contrasts
with recent work by Wu et al. (2020). We explore what is driving this difference in section 4. This
analysis suggests that once additional health and commute mode variables are included, the size of
the pollution correlation falls and statistical significance goes away, suggesting that the correlation
between death rates and pollution may be spurious.
        Our model that looks within states yields estimates of how a given state’s death rate compares to
other states after controlling for the variables in our model; this may be interpreted as a measure
of how states are doing relative to other states. We find that death rates in the Northeast are
substantially higher even when we control for the four sets of variables above. Death rates are also
statistically significantly higher in Michigan, Louisiana, Iowa, Indiana, and Colorado. Accounting
for the variables in our model, California has the lowest death rate compared to all other states.


2        Data and Methods
        We discuss the data sources and methodology here. The COVID-19 deaths are collected from
the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at
Johns Hopkins University. County-level data and the source of the data can be found in Table 12 .
        Our county-level variables fall into four general categories:

        • Socio-economic Variables:            Percent of population below the poverty line, percent of
          residents that are African American, percent white, percent Hispanic, percent old, percent
          owner occupied housing, log(median house value), dummy variables for five income bins,
          dummy variables for four education levels, dummy variables for four population density bins.
        • Commute patterns: Share of people that drive, use public transit, bike, walk, and work
          from home
        • Health: Percent smokers, obese, diabetic, ICU beds, uninsured
        • Climate and Pollution: log(mean summer temperature), log(mean winter temperature),
          mean P M2.5
    1
     Specifically, our data on mode choice give the number of people using each mode (driving, public transit, walking,
biking, and telecommuting) for commuting purposes. We take this number and divide by our population variable to
capture the share of the population that is using this commute mode. We define “other” as the difference.

     We are grateful to Wu et al. (2020) for collecting much of the county data we use. We thank the authors for
providing their code and data aggregation process online.

        The sources for the data are reported in Table 1. We have data for 3,033 counties. For our main
analysis, we omit the five counties that comprise New York City, which leads to a total of 3028
counties after taking out New York City. For those that are interested, replicates of the Figures
in the main section that include New York City can be found in the Appendix section.3 The data
have cumulative deaths at each given day between April 4th and May 27th.


3        Results
3.1       Transportation, health, socio-economic, climate and pollution
        We present the results in table and figure format. Figures 3 through 6 in Section 5 plot the
coefficients of interest across the four sets of variables in the regression models. The left panel plots
the coefficients for the model without fixed state effects, while the right panel plots the coefficients
when we include fixed state effects. We estimate the regression model each day; the dark blue line
representing the coefficient estimate and blue shaded area the 95-percent confidence interval. Table
2 in Section 6 reports the regression results for three specific days, April 4, April 30, and May 27.
        Prior to getting to the specific results, we again stress that these are correlations; they do not
necessarily imply that the relationships are causal. That is, our analysis and those like ours that
focus on observational data, can understand how death rates move with certain variables, but that
movement does not imply that the variables we analyze cause higher or lower death rates. Other
variables, not in the analysis, may be the causal link. However, we do feel that the correlations
that we uncover may help policy makers know where to focus when trying to determine causal
relationships. Furthermore, the correlations themselves may be important pieces of data for policy
makers.
        We begin by discussing three correlations that have received significant attention: the relation-
ship between COVID19 deaths and the share of the county’s population that is African American
residents, public transit reliance, and pollution.
        We find a positive, statistically significant, and large correlation between death rates and the
    3
    We note that deaths are reported across all five counties rather than individually. Therefore, in the analysis
that includes New York City we take a weighted average of the variables included in the model, weighted by the
population of each county, and just include one additional observation.


                                                                   5
share of residents that are African American in the model without state fixed effects, but the
correlation is no longer statistically significant when we include fixed state effects. To give a sense
of the magnitude of the correlation, the coefficient (without state effects) at the end of the sample
implies that a 10 percentage point increase in the share of residents that are African American is
associated with an increase of 0.126 (0.1·1.262) in deaths per 1,000 people. Considering that the
average death rate at the end of our sample is 0.119, this is a more than doubling in the average
death rate. Another useful thought experiment is to use the range in the share of African Americans
that we observe in the data. Within our data, the African American share ranges from zero to
87%. Consider the death rates in two “average” counties one with an African American share of
the lowest county in our data and one with an African American share equal to the largest we
observe. Our results suggest that moving between these two counties would be associated with an
increase in the death rate of 1.10 per 1,000 residents (0.87·1.262), nearly a 10-fold increase.
   It is important to note, however, that the statistical significant of this correlation goes away
when we control for fixed state effects. The coefficient with fixed state effects remains large,
implying more than a tripling in the death rate, but the lack of statistical precision means we
cannot rule out there is no relationship. This makes the relationship between death rates and the
share of African American residents more nuanced. In particular, this suggests that the correlation
in the model that does not account for state effects is driven by differences in death rates and the
share of African Americans across states and not within states. That is, once we account for the
state within the statistical model, the share of African American residents is no longer associated
with death rates. For example, our results are consistent with the scenario where states with a
higher share of African Americans have higher death rates than those states with a lower share,
say Louisiana versus Tennessee, but those counties within Louisiana that have a higher share of
African Americans do not have higher death rates compared to those counties within Louisiana
that have a lower share of African Americans. These conflicting results underscore the importance
of fully understanding the causal relationship between race and death rates.
   We next turn to the use of public transit. Higher public transit use is correlated with higher
death rates in both the models without fixed state effects and the models with fixed state effects.
The omitted commute mode is telecommuting, so the correlation between public transit use and
the death rate should be interpreted as relative to the scenario where those taking public transit
instead work from home. We also remind the reader that we have omitted the five counties that
comprise New York City from the analysis. Including them makes this correlation much stronger.
   The magnitude of these correlations is very large. At the end of our sample, the coefficients
associated with this variable are 12.114 and 4.822 in the models without and with fixed state
effects, respectively. Therefore, a 10 percentage point increase in public transit use, relative to
telecommuting, is associated with a 1.21 (0.1·12.11) and 0.48 (0.1·4.82) increase in deaths per 1000
people in the model without and with state fixed effects, respectively. Public transit share ranges
from zero to 20.6% across counties. Using the same thought experiment as above, consider two
“average” counties one with a public transit share of zero and one with a public transit share of


                                                  6
20.6%. Our results suggest that moving between these two counties would be associated with an
increase in the death rate of 2.49 per 1,000 residents (0.206·12.11) and 0.99 per 1,000 residents
(0.206·4.83), respectively; an increase of over 21-fold and 8-fold, respectively.4
       We note that there is also a positive relationship between driving to work, walking to work,
and not commuting at all (“other”) and deaths per 1,000 people when we look across states, but
the correlation is no longer statistically significant for walking and driving when we look within
state. Taken together these results suggest that telecommuting is correlated with lower death rates,
compared to most other modes of commuting and that public transit use is associated with the
highest death rates.5 We discuss this further below.
       The role of pollution in COVID-19 deaths has received significant attention in the popular
press.6 We do not find a statistically significant effect of pollution on death rates. Furthermore, in
the model without fixed state effects, we find a negative (but statistically insignificant) relationship.
Given the analysis of Wu et al. (2020), we explore what is driving the differences in the results in
Section 4.
       Our results confirm a number of correlations that have been noted by public health officials. In
the model without fixed state effects, by the end of the sample there is a statistically significant
positive correlation between the share of diabetics in the county and death rates. Similar to the
coefficients associated with the share of African Americans in the county, when we control for the
state, this relationship is no longer statistically significant. The share of the population that is
above 65 years of age is also positively associated with death rates; this association is marginally
statistically significant (at the 10% level) in the model without state effects and not significant in
the model with state effects.
       Interestingly, the median house value is positive associated with death rates. We remind the
reader that we are also controlling for average income in the county, so one should interpret the
positive correlation with home values as: when comparing two counties with similar incomes, but
different home values, death rates are higher in the county with higher home values. We also
find statistically significant correlations between a county’s climate and death rates. In particular,
higher average summer temperatures are associated with higher death rates, but higher average
winter temperatures are correlated with lower death rates. This holds even within a state, so the
correlation is not capturing, for example, the tragic loss of life in the Northeast or any other specific
region.
       We do not find clear patterns with any of the additional variables included in the analysis.
These include: obesity, uninsured, poverty rates and the number of ICU beds per capita.
       Summary of correlations

York City with coronavirus doubling rates.

     We can reject, statistically, that each of the coefficients associated with each of the other commute modes equal
the coefficient associated with public transit use.

included in the model. We follow the calculations discussed above for each variable. Specifically,
we take the range of each variable observed in our data across counties and multiply that range
by the coefficient associated with that variable. The left bar represents this calculation for the
model without state effects, while the right bar represents the calculation for the model with fixed
state effects. The standard errors of the calculations are also shown. We order the variables by
the magnitude of the calculation in the model without state effects. Viewing the coefficients in this
way illustrates the strength of the correlation with public transit. The magnitude of the association
with the share of diabetics is also large. The share of people not commuting to work, which likely
represents retirees and children, and the share driving to work are also strongly correlated in both
models.
   Combined the mode of commute correlation pattern may help policy narrow in on potential
causal mechanisms. Our results are consistent with two stylized facts. First, for a given percentage
point change in its value, the mode of commute correlated with the highest death rates is public
transit. This comes directly from Table 2. Second, depending on which model we focus on, there
is evidence that all modes of commutes, other than biking, are associated with higher death rates
relative to telecommuting. While this is speculative for the reasons we discussed above, one scenario
that is consistent with both of these stylized facts is that some of higher death rate associated with
public transit use is the result of public transit use itself. And, some is the result of what these
workers are exposed to after they get to work. This second effect explains why those walking
and driving to work also face higher rates; these workers also have more interaction with others
compared to telecommuting. Combined, if this speculation is correct, it may point to a greater
need to disinfect and socially distance public systems and a greater need for social distancing at
work.
   What, then, is the reason for higher death rates among counties with higher shares of “other”
mode share, which represents those not working—elderly, children, and the unemployed? We
control for the share of elderly in the county, so it is unlikely driven by this. Therefore, this
positive correlation is likely the result of a greater number of children and unemployed. Perhaps,
for example, the causal link is do to those counties with greater children have larger social networks
and, thus, higher exposure rates, and the stress of unemployment is an additional causal mechanism.
   The correlations with weather conditions are interesting and may warrant further investigation
to understand their causal relationships with the virus. Higher summer temperatures and lower
winter temperatures are correlated with higher death rates. This is true even when we look within
a state.
   We again point to the importance of understanding the causal relationship between death rates
and the share of African Americans living in the county. While the magnitudes of this calculation
are not as large as some of the other variables, and the correlation is statistically insignificant in
the model with state fixed effects, the magnitude of the correlation in the model without state
effects, implies a county with the highest observe share of African Americans is associated with an
almost 10-fold increase in their death rate, relative to a county with the lowest share of African


                                                  8
Americans. Understanding what is driving this correlation is an important public policy issue.
   As noted above, this correlation is not driven by any combination of the other variables in our
model. For example, a natural instinct among policy makers may be to think this correlation is
because of income disparities. It is not. We control for income in our multiple regression model,
so any income disparities between African Americans and other races would be additional to the
correlation we uncover. Similarly, we control for health insurance status, diabetes, poverty rates,
obesity, smoking rates, and public transit use. Therefore, the correlation we uncover between death
rates and the share of African Americans cannot be driven by these other variables. That is to
say, the reason why African Americans face higher death rates is not because they have higher
rates of uninsured, poverty, diabetes, etc. it must be some other mechanism. For example, it could
be because the quality of their insurance is lower, the quality of their hospitals is lower, or some
other systemic reason. Our analysis can hopefully allow policy makers to focus on a narrower set
of potential causal links.

3.2   Relative death rates across states
   As noted above, the estimated coefficients on each state indicator variable measures how the
average death rate in counties within a particular state compares to the average death rate across
counties in Alabama, after controlling for the variables included in the model (e.g., the four sets of
variables included). While the coefficients directly measure how a state compares to Alabama, one
can take the difference between any two coefficients to compare any two states. These coefficients
are plotted for the last day of our sample in Figure 2 along with confidence intervals. Perhaps not
surprisingly, our results suggest that death rates are higher in the Northeast relative to other parts

                                                  9
of the country even after controlling for the variables in our model. In addition to the Northeast,
we find higher death rates in Michigan, Louisiana, Iowa, Indiana, and Colorado as well.
        The magnitude of these coefficients is large. For example, the Connecticut coefficient suggests
that controlling for the variables included in our model, death rates in Connecticut are 0.9 higher
than death rates in Alabama. Given an average county-level death rate of 0.12, this is a significant
difference.
        Across all states, California has the lowest death rate, after accounting for the variables included
in the regression model. The coefficient implies deaths per 1000 are 0.16 lower in California,
compared to in Alabama, once you control for the variables in the model. Figure 7 plots the state
fixed effect coefficients over time. They are extremely stable in terms of their relative values. They
will naturally increase in magnitude because death rates are increasing over this time period.

4        Comparison of our results with Wu et al. (2020)
        Wu et al. (2020) has had two main versions to our knowledge, which will be referred to as the
April 4 and April 24 versions. From these versions, we will only look at their main model, but note
that they have run many variations of their model in both versions. Our analysis differs from Wu
et al. (2020) in a number of ways. First, the number of counties differs from both their versions.
The April 4 version’s main analysis restricts the model to 1,785 counties, their updated analysis
runs on 3,089 counties.7 Our final analysis uses 3,028 counties.8 Second, Wu et al. (2020) focuses
    7
    We use counties and boroughs interchangeably.
    8
    We are forced to drop 62 counties because of a lack of data on diabetic, ICU beds, and/or older population.
Additionally, due to the fact that the 5 boroughs in New York are aggregated into NYC, we drop the 4 boroughs and
drop NYC for our main analysis.


                                                       10
on the number of deaths, while we focus on deaths per 1,000 people. Because of their focus on
deaths and the presence of a number of low numbers in some counties, Wu et al. (2020) estimate
a Negative Binomial Mixed Model (NBMM). Fourth, the variable differ between the two sets of
analyses.9 Fifth, the analysis of Wu et al. (2020) ends on May 5, 202010 , while our’s continues
to May 27, 2020. Finally, within the regression models we estimate, we weight counties by their
population. Within our data the county-level population varies from 63 to over a million (ignoring
NYC). Not weighting the county-level observations by population treats all counties equally.
       Table 3 is our attempt to understand what is driving the differences in the results with respect to
the P M2.5 variable. In particular, we vary the differences with Wu et al. (2020) on a one-on one-off
basis to do this. We report the estimate and the 95% confidence interval of that estimate for the last
day of our analysis. The first row in the table reproduces the results in the April 4 version of Wu
et al. (2020). The next row reproduces the results in the April 24 version of Wu et al. (2020), which
adds more counties to the analysis by changing the covariates used in the analysis. The updated
version’s estimate is lower, but still significant. In the third row, we use our baseline control
variables.11 Here, the size of the coefficient falls significantly compared to the April 4 version and
is similar to the April 24 version, but somewhat smaller and not statistically significant. Next, we
add both our additional health and transport variables. The coefficient becomes even smaller and
remains statistically insignificant (i.e., zero is not contained in the confidence interval). Combined,
these results suggest that when we continue to define the dependent variable as deaths and estimate
the same statistical model as in Wu et al. (2020), the statistically significant relationship between
pollution and deaths no longer exists when we move to our setup which in its final form adds
additional variables.
       The remaining set of rows show the estimates from linear regression models using both total
deaths as a dependent variable (for the Wu et al. (2020) versions) and deaths per 1,000 estimates
for our main setup. In the first four rows, we do not weight counties by their populations; the next
four rows do. We start with the same set of counties and covariates as in the April 4 version of
Wu et al. (2020). When we estimate this, pollution is negatively correlated with death rates; it
is positively correlated with the April 24 version. When we add our additional control variables
and health and transport variables, as well as the additional counties, the correlation is no longer
negative, but remains statistically insignificant. Weighting the counties by their population tends
   9
     The variables that are in our model as well as the April 4 version of their analysis are: P M2.5 , mean summer and
winter temperatures, poverty share, share of owner occupied homes, share of residents that are white and African
American, population, share of elderly, mean home value, household income, smoking rate, and education. Their
April 24 version adds the obesity share. Our models include the following variables not in their analysis: the commute
mode variables, share uninsured, diabetes share, ICU beds per capita, and state indicator variables. Their analysis
includes the following variables that we do not: summer and winter average humidity levels, number of hospital
beds. Their April 4 version also includes total tests, and BMI, while their April 24 version includes days since the
stay-at-home order was announced, days since the first case, share of the population between 45 and 64, and the
share of the population between 15 and 44. We take the natural log of income, mean home value, and the summer
and winter temperatures, whereas they keep the level. Finally, we include a set of dummy variables for population
density, while their April 4 version includes the continuous version of population density.

     This was the most recent analysis on their GitHub repository as of this writing.

     The baseline setup is our socio-economic plus climate and pollution variables.

to make the correlation more positive for the April 4 version, but more makes the result negative
for the April 24 version. In both cases this does not change the statistical insignificance of the
results.
   Taken together, this analysis suggests that the positive correlation between pollution and deaths
documented in the April 4 version of Wu et al. (2020) may be driven by the omission of variables
that are correlated with both pollution and deaths, not a direct link between pollution and COVID-
19 deaths. The point estimates of the April 24 setup using NBMM are close to those found in our
setup, but significance does not seem to hold in our setup. These contrasting results suggest that
the correlation between pollution and COVID-19 deaths is not clear and that one should be even
more cautious interpreting these correlations as causal relationships.

Notes. The dependent variable is deaths per 1,000 people. Each regression includes fixed effects for popu-
lation density quartiles, five income bins, and five education levels. The first three columns do not include
fixed state effects, the last three do. The five boroughs that comprise New York City are omitted. Standard
errors are clustered at the state level. ∗ p<0.1; ∗∗ p<0.05; ∗∗∗ p<0.01
