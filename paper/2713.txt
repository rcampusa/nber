                 THE EARLY HISTORY OF PRICE INDEX RESEARCH


                                   ABSTRACT



     The paper discusses five early approaches to the price (and quantity)

index number problem. The five approaches are:    (1) the fixed basket

approach; (ii) the statistical approach; (iii) the test or axiomatic approach;

(iv) the Divisia approach and (v) the economic approach.

     The economic approach makes use of the assumption of optimizing behavior

under constraint and the approach is discussed under four subtopics:      (i)


basic theoretical definitions; (ii) the theory of bounds; (iii) exact index

numbers and (iv) econometric estimation of preferences.

     The paper also discusses several topics raised by Jack Triplett in a

recent paper, including:   (i) the merits of the test approach to index number

theory, (ii) the chain principle and alternatives to it; (iii) the substitution

bias and (iv) the new good bias.

     Although the paper is for the most part an extensive historical survey,

there are a few new results in section 8 on multilateral alternatives to the

chain principle. Also in section 6.3, it is shown that the Paasche, Laspeyres

and all superlative indexes will satisfy the circularity test to the first

order.

1. Introduction


     In order to limit the size of his paper, Jack Triplett has chosen to

concentrate on the history of price measurement research during the last

three decades. The purpose of this paper is to discuss his survey and

augment it by presenting a brief overview of the ancient history of price

measurement.

     Basically, Triplett takes the economic approach to index number theory

as being the correct approach. He distinguishes three main variants of the

economic approach: (I) the cost of living index; (ii) the output price

index and (iii) the input cost index.

     Most of Triplett's review concentrates on three topics: (i) the likely

size of the substitution bias (which occurs when we use the Paasche or

Laspeyres price indexes to approximate the underlying true economic index);

(ii) the appropriateness of using either a Divisia (1926) index or a chain

index and (iii) the appropriate treatment of quality chanze in the

construction-of price and quantity indexes, which is otherwise known as the

n&       problem. The largest part of the Triplett paper is devoted to the

last topic. This part of the paper is extremely interesting in its own

right and is also valuable from the viewpoint of the history of the subject

since Triplett was not only an active researcher in hedonic quality

adjustment techniques1, but he was also (and still is) a civil servant and

thus was well positioned to comment on Statistical Agency reactions to new

measurement techniques.

     My overall impression of the paper is quite favorable. Jack Triplett

is an empirically oriented economist who knows the underlying theoretical

literature very well. He has presented us with a survey of lasting value.
                                           2

      At this point, I would like to list some of his insights that I found

 paticularly interesting or worthy of strong endorsement (points of

 disagreement will be discussed later):

      (i) .   With the exception of housing, consumer durables are treated as

if they were entirely consumed within the year of purchase. This treatment

is appropriate in the production accounts but it is not appropriate in the

consumer accounts. Along with Triplett, I believe that statistical

agencies should make available a rental price treatment of all major

categories of consumer durables as supplementary information to their

present series. A rental price treatment of purchases of new durable goods

would also affect our measure of savings: a consumer's purchase of a

durable should be decomposed into a user cost portion and a savings portion

and the latter part should be added to conventional savings.2

     (ii) .   I    am basically sympathetic to his treatment of the continuous

time Divisia index. Triplett (1988, 32) points out that we have to

approximate the continuous time index by a discrete time approximation.

The problem is that there are many discrete approximations that are

available but Divisia's theory gives us no guidance as to the specific

functional form for the discrete approximation. I shall elaborate on this

point in section 5 below.

     (iii).    I   strongly endorse Triplett's (1988, 30-82) comments on the

inadequacies of existing data on wages.3

     (iv). Finally, Triplett's (1988, 77) comments on the problems caused

by inadequate documentation of official data series deserves to be

stressed.
                                      3

     We conclude this section by presenting art outline of the remainder of

this paper.

     At least five distinct approaches to price and quantity measurement

(or index number theory) can be distinguished in the early literature on

the subject (i) the tabular standard (or the commodity standard or the

fixed basket approach); (ii) the statistical approach; (iii) the test

approach; (iv) the Divisia index approach and (v) the economic approach.

We shall discuss the history of each approach in turn in sections 2-6

below.

     In sections 7 to 11 below, we shall discuss a number of issues that

are raised by a reading of Triplett's paper -   issues that are perhaps
somewhat controversial. Section 7 briefly discusses the merits of the test

approach to index number theory while section 8 presents an extended

discussion of the chain principle.   Sections 9 and 10 discuss the possible

magnitudes of the substitution bias and the new good bias respectively

while section 11 asks whether the theory of the cost of living index has

been exhausted.

     Section 12 concludes with a list of recommendations directed towards

Statistical Agencies.


2. The Fixed Basket ADoroach

     The essence of the fixed basket approach or the tabular standard may

be explained as follows. Suppose that there are N goods that consumers in

a location can purchase during two periods. In periods 1 and 2, the

relevant price vectors are p1 —
                                          p)    and 2 —           p)
respectively. Suppose further (unrealistically) that the quantities

purchased of the N goods are constant during the two periods, with the
                                       4

constant vector of purchases being defined as q a                 Then a
                                                    (q1
natural measure of the average level of prices in period 2 relative to

period 1 is p2.q/p'.q where pt.q Z1 pq is the inner product of the

vectors Pt and q.

      The above approach to price measurement has been independently

proposed by many people. The earliest known proposer of the method was

William Fleetwood, the Rishop of Ely, who wrote the book Chronicon

Preciosum in l7O7. The constant basket of goods he used to compare the

value of money (or conversely, the level of prices) for an Oxford student

of 1707 compared to an Oxford student of 1460 was 5 quarters of wheat, 4

hogsheads of beer and 6 yards of cloth.

      Perhaps the next independent discovery of the tabular standard was

made by the Legislature of Massachusetts in 1780. An account of this

discovery is given by Willard Fisher (1913). A tabular standard was used

to index the pay of Eoldiers fighting in the Revolutionary War (a massive

inflation had drastically reduced the real value of the fixed nominal pay

of the soldiers). The constant quantity basket was S bushels of corn, 68

and 4/7 pounds of beef, 10 pounds of sheep's wool and 16 pounds of sole
           5
leather.

      Joseph Lowe (1823,316) was not an independent discoverer of the

constant basket index number formula


  )            p •q/p •q,


since he explicitly refers to Fleetwood's book. However, he developed the

concept in such detail that he should be considered the father of the

consumer price index. Lowe was well aware that the constant basket of
                                      5

commodities q could vary across demographic groups; on page 332, he

presented some representative family budgets for cottagers and for the

middle class. On page 97 of the Appendix, he noted that price indexes may

be required for other classes of consumers or producers such as farmers and

miners while on page 336 of the main text, he advocated the construction of

separate "standards" for the labouring class, decomposed. into unmarried

labourers and married labourers dth 2,3, or 4 children. Finally, Lowe

(1823,33) also envisaged a national "table of reference" which would price

out a constant national consumption vector at the prices of each year t and

on pages 94 and 95 of the Appendix, he constructed two such hypothetical

tables.

     How would the constant vector of commodities q in (1) be determined?

Lowe (1823, Appendix 95) answered this question as follows:

          "As to quantity, a variation can take place only with increase of

     of population or change of habits, and any alteration of that

     kind must be so gradual, that we run very little hazard in

     assuming a similarity of amount during a given period, which for

     the sake of precision, we shall suppose to be five years."

     Lowe (1823,334) also proposed that the national government should fund

the collection of the relevant price and quantity statistics, but if this

was not done, the Lowe felt that government agencies should at least

provide what data they had at their disposal "on the demand of any

respectable association."

     Lowe (1823,335-343) listed a host of applications for his proposed

tables of reference, including the following: (i) wages, salaries and rents

could be indexed to eliminate the anomalies arising out of unforeseen
                                               6

 fluctuations in the value of the country's currency, (ii) they would

 facilitate salary negotiations, (iii) they could be used to index long term

 agricultural leases and (iv) bond holders could be paid in real terms if
                                         -

 they wanted that option.

      Lowe (1823346) concluded with some pertinent observations on why his

proposal had not been implemented up to his time:

            "This has, we believe, been owing to two causes; the

     unfortunate neglect of political economy in the education of our

     public men; and the interest of governxaent, the greatest of all

     debtors, to prevent the public from fixing its attention on the

     gradual depreciation of money that went on during the half

     century to the late peace.

     Scrope (1833,406-407) followed in Lowe's footsteps but was the first

to use the term tabular standard to describe the price index defined by

(1). However, his treatment was not nearly as detailed as that of Lowe6,

so we will pass on to list others who have endorsed the tabular standard.

     If quantities were to remain constant during the two periods under

consideration, a whole host of authors endorsed formula (1) to measure

price change, including Jevons (1865,l22)(1.884,l22), Sidgwick (1883,67-68)

Edgeworth (l925,2l2) (originally published in 1887), Marshall (1887,363),

Rowley (1899)(1901,227)(1928,223), Walsh (1901,540), (1921,543) (1924,544)

and Pigou (1912,38). During this period, the precise specification of the

constant quantity vector q was a problem which was addressed. Thus

Laspeyres (1871) proposed that q should equal q1 —
                                                              (q             qj), the base

period quantity vector, while Paasche (1874) proposed that q should equal
   —
     (q,...,   q), the current period quantity vector. Thus (1) can be
                                                7

specialized to yield the famous Laspeyres and Paasche price indexes,           and

      Given that quantities would not be exactly equal during the two
periods under consideration, various authors started to argue that averages

of (2) and (3) should be used to measure price change. Thus Sidgwick

(1883,68) and Rowley (1901,227) proposed the use of 112L +           (l/2)P
while Edgeworth (1925,214) (originally published in 1887) proposed that the

q in (1) be set equal to the arithmetic average of the two quantity

vectors, (1/2)q1 +     (l/2)q2,     (Edgeworth states that this variant was also

independently proposed by Alfred Marshall). Rowley (1899) suggested the

geometric mean of          and Pr,, which later came to be known as Irving

Fisher's (1922) ideal price index           defined as

                  '   ,q   ,q   a [p 2•q1 p 2•q2/p1 •q1 p1•q21/2



      Walsh (1901,398) proposed that the components q. of the quantity

vector q in (1) should be set equal to the geometric means of the

quantities in the two periods. Thus the Walsh price index is

           P,(p                          (1) itj—l (qq)

      Finally, Pigou (1912,46) suggested PLPPa5 a measure of price change.

Since this price index has rather poor homogeneity properties, Pigou later
                                          8

 modified his measure by taking the square root which yields F defined by

 (4); see Pigou (1932,69).

      At this stage, the fixed basket approach to index number theory merged

 into the test and economic approaches.


3.    The Statistical Approach.

      This approach, which originated with Jevons (1965)(1884), assumed that

increases in the supply of money increased all prices proportionately

except for random fluctuations. Thus with additive errors and a sufficient

number of independent observations, an appropriate price index could be

obtained by taking the arithmetic mean of the price ratios p/p while with

multiplicative errors, an appropriate price index could be obtained by

taking the geometric mean of the price ratios. This second alternative was

advocated by Jevons, and thus we obtain the Jevons price index

                       "i—l


      In addition to Jevons, two other prominent economists who advocated

the statistical approach to index numbers were Sowley (1901,223-

226) (1921,202),(1928,217-223) and Edgeworth (1888)(1896)(l9Ol)(l923)

(1925)8. Edgeworth mainly advocated the median of the price ratios

as the best estimator of price change.

      The statistical approach was criticized by Irving Fisher (1911,194.

196) who explained in an absolutely convincing manner why all prices cannot

move proportionately (due to the existence of fixed price contracts, for

example). Fisher's criticisms were ignored by the profession as were those

of Walsh (1924). However, Keynes (1930,71-81) effectively demolished the
                                        9

naive statistical approach by constructing various tables of index numbers

which showed systematic differences over time and hence the hypothesis of

approximate proportional change in all prices could not be maintained

empirically.9 Bowley (1928;221) also criticized the approach on narrower

statistical grounds by indicating that the price movements were not

statistically independent.

     Although Jevons' naive statistical approach is no longer advocated, as

was indicated in Triplett's (1988) paper, statistical sampling of the

prices of the various components of a price index is still done today. A

problem with many of these sampling procedures is that prices are sampled

independently of quantities. Pigou (1932,77) was perhaps the first to

propose that values should be sampled in the two periods under

consideration, along with the corresponding prices and quantities, and then

the Fisher ideal index       defined by (4) should be used to construct a

measure of price change over the commodities in the sample of values. This

sample price index could then be used to deflate the population value ratio

over the two periods. Pigou's proposal deserves serious consideration by

Statistical Agencies even today.


4.   The Test Ayyroach

     The origins of the test approach are rooted in the more or less casual

observation of the early workers in the index number field on their

favorite index number formulae or those of their competitors.

     Thus Jevons (1884,152) (originally published in 1865) recognized that

his unweighted geometric mean formula (6) gave index number comparisons-

between any two years that were independent of the base year. Edgeworth

(1896,137) gave a clear general treatment of this ka     invariance tesJ°
                                         10

which we can phrase as follows. Let (pO,ptq0,qt) be a generic index

number formula of the type defined by (2) to (5) above which compares the

level of prices in period t to the level of prices in period U, the base

year. Let p and qt be the price and quantity vectors pertaining to year t

for c—UI         T. Let i, s and t denote arbitrary years. With the base

year equal to 0, the level of prices in year t relative to s is taken to be
      0 tOt OsOs If we change the base to year i, then the
P(p ,p ,q ,q )/P(p ,p ,q ,q ).

level of prices in period t relative to s is p(p1,pt,q1,qt)/p(p1,p5,q1,q5),

The base invariance test demands that these tt.,ro numbers be equal; i.e.,

that



(7)         P(pUt
                ,p ,q Ut    Us,p ,qUs
                      ,q )/P(p      ,q )      — P(p
                                                      it     it
                                                      ,p ,q ,q )/P(pisis
                                                                     ,p ,q ,q ).
       Our next test was first proposed by Laspeyres (1871,308), and has come

to be known as the strong identity             if prices in the two periods under

consideration remain constant, then even if the quantities change11, the

level of prices should remain unchanged; i.e., •we should have



(8)         p(ppqLq2) —   1


where P denotes the index number formula or function,
                                                                  (Pi''
denotes the common price vector in both periods and qt
                                                                 (q        q)
denotes the quantity vector in period t for t —         1,2.
       The statistician Westergaard (1890.218-219) formulated what later12

became known as the circularity          the bilateral index number formula

should satisfy the following equation:


(9)
              1212 2323 1313
           P(p ,p ,q ,q )P(p ,p ,q ,q ) — P(p ,p ,q ,q )
                                            11

where Pt and qt are the price and quantity vectors pertaining to periods t

for t —   1,2,3.   The right hand side of (9) computes the price level in

period 3 relative to the price level in period 1 in one step, using the

bilateral index number formula or function P The left hand side of (9)

computes the level of prices in period 3 relative to period 1 in two steps:

in the first step, we use the bilateral formula p(p1 p2 q1q2) to compute

the level of prices in period 2 relative to period 1 and then in the second

step, we use the bilateral formula P(p2,p3,q21q3) to compute the level of

prices in period 3 relative to period 2. The product of these two steps is

supposed to yield the level of prices in period 3 relative to period 1.

       The Dutch economist Pierson (1896) informally proposed two tests: (i)

invariance to changes in the units of measurement (which Irving Fisher

(l911)(1922,420) first called the change of units test and later called the

commensurability test) and (ii) the time reversal test which can be stated

mathematically as follows:



(10)
                2121
             P(p ,p ,q ,q )   — l/P(p   1212
                                        ,p ,q ,q ).


       Up to this point in time, research or the test or axiomatic approach

to index number theory was rather casual and unsystematic. The first

systematic researcher on the axiomatic approach was Walsh

(l9Ol)(192l)(1924) who proposed a number of tests, including the constant

quantities            i.e., if quantities remain fixed at the vector q during

the two periods under consideration, then the appropriate formula for the

price index is



(11)
               12             2    1
            P(p ,p ,q,q) — p •q/p •q.
                                                 12

       Another test proposed by Walsh was the strong proportionality (in

prices)            i.e.,   if A is a positive scaler and prices in period 2 are
                                                                               14
equal to A times the corresponding prices in period 1, then



(12)         P(plAplqlq2) — A.

       A final test proposed by Walsh (1901,389)(l921,540)(1924,506) was his

multiperiod identity test15 i.e., the bilateral index number function P is

to satisfy the following functional equation;



(13)         P(p1212         2323
                 ,p ,q ,q )P(p            3131
                               p ,q .q )P(p 'p ,q ,q )               — 1


Note that    the prices and quantities in period 4 are exactly equal to the

prices and quantities in period 1, p1 and q1 respectively. As we shall see

later, the test (13) will be useful in evaluating the usefulness of the

chain principle.

       The next major contributor to the test approach is Irving Fisher

(l911)(l921)(l922). Since Fisher's contributions to the test approach are

quite well known (in fact, he is often credited with inventing the

approach), we will not review his contributions in any detail. However, we

do wish to make two comments about his work.

       Our first conent is to note that Fisher (1911,403) seems to have been

the first to observe that the choice of a functional form P(p1,p2,q1,q2)

for a price index implicitly determines the functional form for the

corresponding quantity index Q(p11p21q1,q2); i.e., the product of the two

indexes should equal the value ratio for the two periods under

consideration. Thus given P, Q is implicitly determined by the following

equation:
                                         13


(14)
                 1212 Q(p1212         2211
                          ,p ,q ,q ) — p •q /p •q
              P(p p ,q ,q )


Frisch   (1930,399) called (14) the product .at    while   Samuelson and Swarny

(1974,572) called it the weak factor reversal, as•
       Our second comment about Fisher's contributions to the test approach

is relatively unknown. Fisher (1922,140) explained how to 'rectify" an

arbitrary bilateral index number formula p(pl,p2,ql,q2) so that the

rectified formula * would satisfy the time reversal test (10): simply

define '* as follows:



(15)
                  1212
              P*(p ,p ,q ,q )
                                   1212 21211/2
                                (F(p ,p ,q ,q )/P(p ,p ,q .q )]


Fisher's   time rectification procedure indeed does work as advertised: the

*   defined   by (15) will satisfy (10). The only problem is that the

procedure is clearly due to Walsh (1921,542), who was a discussant for

Fisher's (1921) paper which was a preview for Fisher (1922).

Unfortunately, Fisher's (1922,183) historical comments on the rectification

principle fail to mention Walsh at all. However, on the positive side,

Fisher (1922.396-398) generalized Walsh's basic idea by showing how an

index number formula could also be rectified to satisfy Fisher's factor

reversal fl.at16 or be rectified to simultaneously satisfy the factor and

time reversal tests.

       Frisch (1930)(l936,5-7) effectively criticized the test approach to

index number theory on the grounds that it could be shown that no bilateral

index number formula P(p1,p2,q1,q2) could satisfy all reasonable tests or

axioms17 and when some tests were dropped so as to achieve a consistent set
                                              14

of tests, there was no general agreement on which subset of tests should be

dropped. Hence the test approach did not seem to lead anywhere.

       In recent years, the test approach has sprung to life again, largely

due to the efforts of Wolfgang Eichhorn (l973)(1976) and his students and
              18
colleagues.


5.     The Divisia Approach.

       Divisia's (1926,39-40) derivation of the price and quantity indexes

associated with his name can be summarized as follows. Let the prices

pjt) and the quantities q.(t), i—l                   N, be functions of (continuous)

time t and let expenditure at time t be the value v(t)                       p.(t)qjt).

Assuming differentiability, the rate of change of value at time t is:



(16)       dv(t)/dt —           p.(dq./dt)   +         q.(dp./dt).



Divisia then divided both sides of (16) by p(t).q(t)                     pjt)q.(t) and

equated the right hand side of the resulting equation to Q'(t)/Q(t) ÷

P'(t)/P(t) where Q(t) and P(t) are aggregate quantity and price levels

pertaining to period t and Q'(t) and P'(t) denote their time derivatives.

Thus we have:



(17)       —l 1q'(t) ÷                    qp.'(t) —      Q'(t)   + P'(t)
                   v(t)                     v(t)         Q(t)         P(t)


Djvisja then defined Q(t) and P(t) as solutions to the following

differential equations:



(18)       Q'(t) —
                          1
                              (t)q'(t)       ; P'(t) —           q(t)p'1(t)
                     •                                      1
           Q(t)               p(t).q(t)       P(t)               p(t).q(t)
                                               15

       Somewhat surprisingly, virtually the same derivation was made earlier

by the English economist, T.L. Rennet (1920,461), except that he did not

divide (16) through by v(t) —        p(t)'q(t).
       The above derivation of the Divisia indexes is very mechanical and is

unrelated to economics (i.e., choice under constraint). However, later

both yule (1946) and 1-lulten (1973) related the Divisia indexes to economic

price and quantity indexes under the assumptions of optimizing behavior and

a linearly homogenous aggregator function.'9

       Triplett (1988) observes, the problem with the Divisia approach to

price measurement is that we generally cannot observe prices and quantities

continuously. Thus the continuous time Divisia indexes must be

approximated using discrete time data and there are many ways of forming

discrete time approximations to say P(2)/P(1)20, where P(t) is the Divisia

index for time period t defined by (18) (plus an initial normalization).

Diewert (1980,444-445) showed that the Laspeyres and Paasche indexes,

and P, defined by (2) and (3) above, could be regarded as discrete time

approximations to P(2)/P(l) as could the Tornqvist-translog T defined by



(19)            in P(p1p2q1.q2) a     Ef_1 (1/2)(s+ s)ln(p/p})

where the shares
                      t          .
                          are defined as
                                           t   a    tt t t t—l,2
                                                        'q,        and i—l   N.

Since the indexes L'           and T can differ considerably, the Divisia

approach does not lead to a practical resolution of the price measurement
           21
problem.

       To conclude this section on the Zennet-Divisia approach, we note that

Rennet (1920,457) suggested the following discrete approximations to
                                          16

measure differences (rather than the ratios of Divisia) in the aggregate

price and quantity levels:


                — P(2) — P(1) —
(20)
                                  Z1   (1/2)(q+q)(p—pb


(21)            — Q(2) — Q(1) —
                                  -l   (l/2)(pi-p?)(q?—q


Bennet also showed that the difference in expenditures for the two periods,

z1     p?q? —   z p}q},   was exactly equal to AP+LQ, where AP and Q are

defined by the right hand sides of (20) and (2l).22

6.     The Economic Approach.

       The economic approach to index number theory23 relies on the

assumption of optimizing behavior on the part of economic agents: utility

maximizing or expenditure minimizing behavior on the part of consumers and

profit maximizing or cost minimizing behavior on the part of producers.

       The first two papers to use an explicit utility maximizing framework

appear to be by Bennet (1920) and Kon'üs (1924). Bennet's paper drew on an

earlier paper by Bowley (1919) (he used Bowley's notation and data) and may

be regarded as an attempt to determine the approximate magnitude of the

substitution bias using the assumption of an quadratic utility function.

Bowley (1928,226)(1938) was in turn influenced by Bennet and developed his

own quadratic approximations. Bennet's paper was very short and sketchy

and did not have the impact that the KonUs paper eventually had. KonUs

(1924,16-18) not only presented a very clear definition of the true cost of

living for an individual optimizing consumer, he also developed the now

well known Paasche and Laspeyres bounds.24 Kodüs (1924,20-21) also showed

that the Paasche and Laspeyres price indexes, (3) and (2) above, bound the
                                      17

true cost of living index even in the general nonhomothetic preferences

case, provided that we evaluate the true index at a suitable utility level

that is between the base and current period levels.

     To complete our brief survey of the early history of the economic

approach to index number theory, we shall review the economic approach

under four subdivisions: (i) basic theoretical definitions, (ii) the theory

of bounds, (iii) exact index numbers and (iv) econometric approaches.


6.1 Basic Theoretical Definitions

     As Triplett (1988) noted, there are three main branches of price index

theory. (i) For the true cost of living index, see Kcrs (1924), Sarnuelson

(1947,156) and Pollak (1971). For related quantity indexes,, see Rowley

(1928230), Allen (1949), Malmquist (1953) and Pollak (1971).    (ii) For

theoretical definitions of the output price index, see Hicks (1940), Fisher

and Shell (1972), Sainuelson and Swamy (1974;588-592), Archibald (1977) and

Diewert (198Th). For related quantity indexes, see Rowley (1921,203),

Bergson (1961,31-34), Moorsteen (1961), Fisher and Shell (1972,53),

Sarnuelson and Sway (1974,588-591), Sato (1976,438) and Hicks (1981,256).

(iii) The input cost index is defined by Triplett (1983a,274) and Diewert

(1980,459) and corresponding quantity indexes are defined in Diewert

(1980,456-460).

     There is a fourth branch of price index theory not mentioned by

Triplett: (iv) constant utility income deflators. On this last branch of

theoretical index number theory, see Diewert and Bossons (1987).
                                             18

6.2 The Theory of Bounds

       Observable bound to the generally unobservable economic price and

quantity indexes were first worked out by Pigou (1912,44-46)(l932,62-63)

and Haberler (1927,78-92) independently of Kontis (1924,17-19)       o
established the Paasche and Laspeyres bounds for the true cost of living.

For a generalization of these bounds to nonlinear budget constraints, see

Frisch (l936,l8).25 It is clear that a large portion of revealed

preference theory that is often attributed to Hicks (1940) and Samuelson

(1947,157) had already been developed by Pigou, Kon'ds, Haberler and Frisch.

       Other researchers who established bounds on true indexes in the two

observation situation include Leontief (1936,49), Friedman (1938,125),

Allen (1949), Malrnquist (1953), Moorsteen (1961,464), Pollak (1971), Fisher

and Shell (1972,57-62), Samuelson and Swamy (1974,581-591), Archibald

(1975) and Dietert (l9Sl,l57-l79)(1983a,173-2lO)(l983b,l056-lO9O)

       The above theory of bounds all pertains to the two observation

situation. Afriat (1967) (1977) generalized the two observation theory to

cover the many observation case.


6.3 Exact Index Numbers

       Let an aggregator function26 f(q) be given where q is an N dimensional

quantity vector; i.e., q —                        The   function C which is
                                (q1
generated by f may be defined as


(22)       C(u,p) —          (p.q     f(q)   u)
                      minq


i.e., C(u,p) is the solution to the problem of minimizing the cost p•q —

           of   achieving at least the utility (or output) level u, where p
                                          19

                     an exogenous vector of prices facing the consumer (or

producer).

       An index number formula or function P(p,p2,q1,q2) of the type we

considered in section 4 is defined to be exact27 for an aggregator function

f if



(23)
                1212
             P(p p ,q ,q )
                                    2
                               C(u,p )/C(u,p
                                               1




                                                   t                t
for some utility or output level u where q solves (22) when pp for

t=l,2; i.e. •   P   is exact for f (or its dual cost function C) if P equals the

relevant economic index under the assumption of optimizing behavior on the

part of an economic agent using the aggregator function f. The right hand

side of (23) is PK(pl,p2,u), the KonUs price index or true cost of living

index for a consumer that has the utility function f and faces the vector

of prices Pt in period t for t—l,2.

       The English language literature on exact index numbers has its roots

in the theory of quadratic approximations. As we indicated earlier, Rennet

(1920,460) attempted to determine an appropriate index number formula for

the true cost of living of a single "satisfaction' maximizing consumer

under the hypothesis that the underlying utility function f(q) was a

general quadratic function. Rowley (1928,226)(1938) followed up on

Rennet's approach and provided his own second order approximation. Frisch

(1936,27-29) criticized Rowley's index number formula and developed an

alternative formula which he called the double expenditure method. Wald

(1939,329) and Balk (1981,1556) correctly pointed out that Frisch's index

number formula was         exact for a general quadratic utility function.
However, Frisch (1936,29-30) did correctly show28 that his index number
                                                 20

 formula collapsed to the Fisher ideal price index           defined by (4) if one
 assumed    hornothetic quadratic preferences so that f(q) a    !1        a..q.q, a
 q•Aq    where A a   [a.. ] is   a symmetric N by N matrix of parameters that
 characterize tastes. This is an early example of an exact index number
 formula.
        Another early example was given by Raid (l939)(l939,325) who assumed

 the following general quadratic aggregator function:


 (24)        f(q) a a0 +    a'q    ÷ (l/2)q-Aq


where a0, a a [d1                dN] and A a 1a1I are respectively a parameter, a

vector of parameters and a symmetric N by N matrix of parameters.

        Unfortunately, in order to evaluate Raid's general index number
formula    that is exact    for (24), information on income elasticities is

required (we shall not write out his general index number formula since it

is rather complex). However, if we assume hornothetic preferences again

(i.e., the aggregator function is a monotonically increasing function of a

linearly homogeneous function) so that a0 — 0 and a —           in (24)29 then all
of the consuner's income elasticities equal unity and Wald's general index

number formula collapses down to the Fisher price index (4) and again we

obtain the exact index number result of Frisch,3°

        Unknown to the above authors, the Frisch-cjald exact index number

result had already been obtained by KonUs and Byushgens (1926,167-172) a

decade earlier,31 In this remarkable paper, they introduced duality theory

into the economics literature; i.e, they expressed consumer preferences not

only by the direct utility function f(q) but also by the corresponding

indirect utility function g defined as follows:
                                              21

(25)        g(p,y)     max (f(q) : p•q          yl

i.e., the indirect utility function g(p,y) gives the maximum utility

attainable as a function of the prices faced by the consumer p —
                                                                             (p1
       and the income or expenditure y 0 to be spent on the N goods during

the period under consideration. Kon'ds and Byushgens assumed that the

direct utility function f was linearly homogeneous in which case the

indirect utility function g can be expressed as follows in terms of the

unit cost function c(p) a        C(1,p)   where C(u,p) was defined by (22) above:


(26)        g(p,y) —   y/c(p).

Konlls and Byushgens considered three classes of homothetic preferences

which were defined via the indirect utility function g(p,y) or

equivalently, using (26), via the unit cost function c(p).

       The first case they considered had the following unit cost function:



(27)        c(p) a   !1 a.p.      ,
                                      a. > 0,    i—I         N.



       As is well known32, the dual direct utility function is the fixed

coefficient or no substitution f defined as follows:


(28)                         — min.( q./a. : i —         1        N)


Under these conditions, KonUs and Byushgens (1926,162) showed that the

Laspeyres and Paasche indexes, L and                 defined by (2) and (3) above, will -

exactly   equal the true cost of living (defined by the right hand side of

(23) for any positive utility level u), provided that the consumer's direct

utility function is defined by (26) and (27).
                                                       22

        The second case they considered was the case of Cobb-Douglas

 preferences33 which can be characterized by the following unit cost

 function:



 (29)          c(p) a a
                          iif_,1
                                   pi             ,   cz.>O       —l a.— 1


KonUs and Byushgens (1926,165) showed that the generalized Jevons index

 defined by (6) (except that 1/N is replaced by a.) is exact for these

Wicksell-Cobb-Douglas preferences, where the unknown parameters a. can be

determined as follows: a. —         pq/pt.qt                ,   the ith expenditure share, i1,
        N, for any period t.

        In   the final case considered by KonUs and Byushgens (1926,168), the

consumer's preferences were characterized by the following unit cost

function:



                       (p8)1"2 —
(30)          c(p)
                                        (Z':_i   Z1 b..p.p.)1'2
where S a [bi.] is a symmetric N by N matrix of unknown parameters that
characterize preferences. They showed that the Fisher ideal index
defined by (4) was exact for the preferences characterized by (26) and

(30). KonUs and Byushgens (1926,171) also showed that if the inverse of
the matrix 8 existed, say A —           81,      then the direct utility function

corresponding to (26) and (30) was


(31)          f(q) —   (q'Aq)1'2

which is a monotonic transformation of the
                                                                homogeneous quadratic utility
function considered by Frisch and tJald.
                                         23

        Finally, RonUs and Byushgens (1926,171) exhibited both the system of

inverse demand functions, p/y — Aq/q.Aq, and the system of ordinary demand

functions, q —     y8p/p.Rp, that correspond to the homogeneous quadratic
preferences defined by (31). They also suggested that the unknown

parameters appearing in the A or B matrices could be determined given a

sufficient number of price and quantity observations. However, note that a

knowledge of A or B is !32t required in order to evaluate the Fisher price

index

        After the contributions of Bowley, Frisch and Wald to the theory of

exact index numbers, the subject remained dormant until Afriat (1972,44-

47), Pollak (1971,117-132) and Samuelson and Swamy (1974,573-574)

reexamined the subject. All of these authors examined the three cases

considered by KonUs and Byushgens and some other cases as well.
                                                             1212
        Diewert (1976,134) defined a price index function P(p p ,q ,q )     to   be

superlative if P was exact for preferences which had a cost function C(u,p)

—   uc(p)   where c(p) is a unit cost function that could provide a second

order approximation to an arbitrary twice continuously differentiable

linearly homogeneous function. The idea was that a superlative index

number formula P(p11p2,q1,q2), which could be evaluated using only

observable price and quantity data for the two periods under consideration,

would correspond to a flexible functional form for a unit cost function

c(p). For example, P defined by (4) is a superlative price index since it

is exact for the c defined by (30) and this c has the required second order

approximation property. Another example of a superlative index is the

Walsh index P defined by (5) since it is exact for the unit cost function

which is dual to the aggregator function

 q) —                a. .q.1'12 q)"2; see Diewert (1976,132). A third example

of a superlative price index is 'T defined by (19) which is exact for a

translog unit cost function;34 see Diewert (1976,121).

        Unfortunately, Diewert (1976) defined two (infinite) families of

superlative index number formulae and this raised the question as to which

formula should be used in empirical applications. Fortunately, Diewert

(1978) showed that all choices of a superlative formulae gave the same

answer to the second order and hence the choice was usually immaterial.

More precisely, Diewert showed that every known superlative index number

formula P(p1,p2,q1q2) had the same first and second derivatives when

evaluated at equal prices (i.e., p1'-.p2) and equal quantities (i.e.,
 2     35
q ).

        As an interesting footnote to the history of economic thought, it

should be noted that Diewert was not the first to use the above second

order approximation technique; Edgeworth (1901,410-411) used a variant of

it to show that the Walsh index      defined by (5) approximated to the

second order the Edgeworth (1925,213) -      Marshall   (1887,372) index defined

as follows:



(32)         P(p1,p2,q',q2) a (        (l/2)(q÷q)p)/[E71 (l/2)(q}+q?)p].


        The Taylor series expansion technique around an equal price and

quantity point was used again by Edgeworth (1923,347) to show that the

Laspeyres index      defined by (2) and the Fisher index        defined by (4)

satisfy the circularity test (9) to the first order. Since this

Proposition seems to have been forgotten, we sketch a proof of it.
                                              25

          Let the index number function P be either L or P1 and define the

functions £ and g as follows:



(33)           f(p123123            1212
                  p 'p ,q ,q ,q ) — P(p            2323

                                                                  —
                                                                      q3 —   q)   where       —

                      df/dpN] is the vector of first order partial derivatives of £
[df/dp1
with respect to the components of p', etc. The meaning of (34) is that the

functions f and g approximate each other to the first order when evaluated

at an equal price and quantity point. Thus the Laspeyres and Fisher price

indexes satisfy the circularity test to the first order.

          Using the results in Diewert (1978,898) and the results in the above

paragraph, it can be shown that the Paasche, Laspeyres and all superlative
                                          26

 index number formulae will similarly satisfy the circularity test to the

 first order.

      Note that Edgeworth's Proposition helps to explain Fisher's (1922,280)

 empirical finding that      satisfied the circularity test to a very high

 degree of approximation.


 6.4 Econometric Estimation of Preferences

      In this variant of the economic approach to index numbers, the

 parameters   that characterize consumer preferences are estimated.
 Preferences may be represented by: (i)    the   direct utility function; (ii)
 the indirect utility function; (iii) the distance function36 or (iv) the

cost or expenditure function. Once any one of these functions in known,

the other three functions can be calculated, at least in principle. In

particular, the cost function C(u,p) can be calculated and hence the Konlis

price index defined by the right hand side of (23) can be calculated.

     Triplett (1988) gives an excellent summary of most of the post 1948

research in this area; additional references to the recent literature can

be found in chapter 7 of Deaton and Muellbauer (1980).

     It seems appropriate to add a few references to the early history of

this approach to index number theory.

     The   earliest effort at a strategy for determining the parameters which
characterize preferences was made by Bennec (1920,462). He assumed a
quadratic direct utility function and showed how the consumer's system of
demand functions could be obtained in the three good case (although he did
not quite exhibit a closed form solution). He then made some comments on
how many observations would be required in the general N good case in order
                                         27

to determine all 1 + N +   (l/2)N(N+l)   of the parameters of the quadratic
                                          37
utility function f(q) defined by (24).

     We have already seen that Kontis and Byushgens (1926) were contributors

to the econometric approach, since they derived the demand functions

corresponding to Cobb-Douglas preferences and homogeneous quadratic

preferences. Kontis and Byushgens (1926,172) noted that one price-quantity

observation would suffice to determine the parameters of Cobb-Douglas

preferences while (N-t-l)/2 observations would be required to determine all

N(N+l)/2 parameters for the homogeneous quadratic functional forms, (30) or

(31). They also noted that statistical determination of the homogeneous

quadratic preferences would be difficult.

     Another early contributor to the econometric approach to index numbers

was Wald (1937)(l939,325), who assumed quadratic preferences; recall (24).

In addition he assumed that the demand functions regarded as functions of

income (or expenditure) were known functions for the two periods under

consideration. (Alternatively, just a knowledge of the income elasticities

of demand at the two observed price and quantity points would suffice).

With these assumptions, Wald was able to derive an exact index number

formula, so his approach is actually a blend of the exact and econometric

approaches.

     Wald's blended approach seems worthy of further study. However, the

pxg econometric   approach has severe limitations. The problem with the

latter approach is that in order to provide a second order approximation to

general preferences, we require approximately 142/2 parameters in the N good

case. Since N is perhaps equal to 50,000 for a typical consumer (a

supermarket alone has 15,000 to 20,000 separate items), the required number
                                       28

of parameters to be estimated is approximately 1.25 billion, which would

require price and quantity observations for about 25,000 periods.38

     This concludes our survey of the ancient history of index numbers. We

turn now to a discussion of some of the more controversial issues raised by

Triplett.


7.   On the Test Approach to Index Number Theory

     Triplett (1988) does not discuss the test approach to index number

theory and perhaps the reader may well feel that this is quite appropriate

due to the length of his paper. Although I am basically in agreement with

Triplett that the economic approach to index number theory is the most

compelling approach, it should be mentioned that the test approach has some

advantages. In particular, the test approach does not suffer from the

following limitations of the economic approach: (i) the economic approach

is based on optimizing behavior an assumption which may not be warranted

in general; (ii) the economic approach generally relies on separability

assumptions39 about the underlying aggregator functions, assumptions which

are unlikely to be true in general and (iii) in deriving capital rental

prices, the economic approach is usually based on an ex ante expectations

about future prices, expectations which cannot be observed, whereas the

test approach can be based on ex post accounting data, which can be
            40
observed


8.   On the Chain PrinciDle and Multilateral Indexes.

     Triplett (1988) contrasts the chain orincinle with the fixed ka

orincitle    for constructing a series of index numbers which extends over

three or more periods. Given price and quantity data,           i—1,2,3 for
                                       29

three periods and a bilateral price index function P(p1,p2,q',q2) that

depends only on the data for two periods, the fixed ka sequence of

aggregate price levels for the 3 periods would be



(35)
                 1212 1313
            1, P(p p ,q ,q ), P(p ,p .q ,q


while the chain sequence of price levels would be



(36)
                  1212 1212 2323
            1, P(p ,p ,q ,q ), P(p ,p ,q ,q )P(p ,p ,q ,q ).


       Historically, the fixed base principle was the first to be used

empirically. In the English language literature, the chain principle was

first proposed by Alfred Marshall (1887,373)41. basically as a method for

overcoming the difficulties in comparing prices over two distant periods,

due to the invention of new commodities.42

       Irving Fisher (1911,203), who gave the chain system its name, noted

that the chain system was invariant to changes in the base period and he

also saw the advantage of the method in dealing with the new good problem

as the following quotation indicates43:

            "It may be said that the cardinal virtue of the successive base

       or chain system is the facility it affords for the introduction of new

       commodities, the dropping out of obsolete commodities, and the

       continued readjustment of the system of weighting to new commodities."

       (Fisher, 1911,204).

       While it is true that the use of the chain principle has an advantage

in dealing with the introduction of new commodities, it has the following

severe disadvantage noted by Triplett (1988): it does not satisfy Walsh's

Multiperiod Identity Test, (13) above.44 Thus as Triplett shows, if prices
                                      30

and quantities systematically oscillate around constant values, the use of

the chain method will give biased results. This same point has been made

by Szulc (1983) and Hill (1988).

     The above difficulty with the chain method was not adequately

appreciated by Diewert (1978,895) who argued for the use of the chain

principle on the grounds that it would reduce the spread between the

Laspeyres and Paasche indexes, (2) and (3) above, and between all known

superlative indexes, since price and quantity changes will generally be

smaller between adjacent periods than between distant periods. He argued

that the spread between the Paasche and Laspeyres indexes would be greater

than between the superlative indexes because L and P only approximate

each other to the first order, while superlative indexes approximate each

other to the second order (recall our discussion of the Edgeworth second

order approximation technique in section 6.3 above). Diewert (1978,894)

also presented the results of some numerical experiments using Canadian per

capita consumption data for 13 commodity classes over the years 1947-1971.

These results showed that the chain method did in fact lead to a smaller

spread between    defined by (2LP defined by (,        defined    by (4) and

   defined by (19) than when a fixed base year, 1947, was used,

     Although the chain method will give poor results with oscillating

data, Szulc (1983) and Hill (1988) show theoretically that chaining will

tend to reduce the spread between the Laspeyres and Paasche price indexes,

provided that prices and quantities trend monotonically over the time

periods in question. Thus Diewert's (1978,894) empirical results could be

rationalized by the hypothesis that monotonic trends in the data outweighed

oscillatory movements.
                                             31

        While the chain system fails to satisfy Walsh's Identity Test (13),

Hill (1988) shoded that the fixed base system fails to satisfy an analogue

to the Strong Identity Test (8). Consider the base period to be period 0

and suppose that the bilateral price and quantity indexes, P and Q

respectively, are given and they satisfy the Product Test (14). Then under

the fixed base system, price P* and quantity Q* comparisons between periods

t   and t+l are made as follows:


(37)
                 o

                                                                                o tot
                                                                           )/P(p ,p ,q ,q

             Q*(p p ,p       ,q ,q ,q
                                                  C t+l 0 ti-i
                                            a Q(p ,p           ,q ,q
                                                                               0 tOt

The problem is that P* and Q* need not satisfy counterparts of (8) even if

the underlying bilateral indexes P and Q do satisfy (8); i.e., it will not

generally be the case that



(39)
                 0

                                                      if   p
                                                               t — p t+l
Hill    (1988,6-7) cited the fixed base Paasche quantity index, Q(p ,p ,q ,q
                                                                                   0 tot

         /p •q       normally used in the national accounts, as an example of a

fixed base index which generates a P* which fails to satisfy the Hill

Identity Test (39)           Thus both the chain and the fixed base systems fail

to satisfy theoretically appropriate identity tests.

        We turn now to a discussion of possible alternatives to the use to

either the fixed base or chain systems. The first person to propose

alternatives was Walsh (1901,431), but it is convenient to start our

discussion by reviewing some proposals due to Irving Fisher (1922,297-320).
                                         32

     Fisher's (1922,298) first alternative was to list each and every

possible binary comparison and thus the index number user could simply pick

out the binary comparisons of interest. Let us (unimaginatively) call this

the j] binary comparisons method. Fisher actually implemented this method

for his data on 36 primary commodities for 6 years using the Fisher ideal

price index        defined by (4). Thus there were 6(6—1) — 30 bilateral

comparisons. Fisher (1922,301) then used these bilateral comparisons to

determine whether the Base Invariance Test (7) was satisfied to a high

degree of approximation:46 in Fisher's (1922,302) words, "the differences

due to differences of base are trifling."

     However, Fisher (1922,299-305) recognized that it was not practical or

worthwhile to list every possible binary comparison: for twenty periods,

there would be 380 separate index numbers. Thus Fisher was led to other

classes of alternatives to the use of either the fixed base or the chain

systems, which we will call multiperiod systems, or in the context of

regional comparisons, multilateral systems. If there are data for T

periods, these multilateral methods make use of the data for all T periods

simultaneously to construct a series of T price levels and T quantity

levels.

     Fisher's (1922,305) first cnultiperiod or multilateral method was the

blend system, which works as follows. Suppose we have price and quantity

data, Pt —
              (p        p) and qt (q           q) for t—l,2       T and a

bilateral index number formula P(p1,p29q1,q2). Then use each period as the

base to construct a series of T aggregate price levels using the bilateral

function P. Normalize the resulting series so that the first price is
                                               33

unity.47 The resulting T series or normalized price levels may be written

as follows:

Fisher then suggested that the price level for period t, P say, should be
an arithmetic average of the period t price level in each of the T series

in (40); i.e., we have P1 —       1    and for t —   2,3       T;

Note that the multiteriod or multilateral period t agzreate vrice level

defined by (41) is a function of the data for all T periods; i.e.,                     —

       Fishers     (1922.307) second multilateral method was the broadened base

system. In this method, the period t price level pt was defined as

follows:



                                                                         t—l

                                             34

The corresponding quantity levels Qt can be defined numerically using the

multilateral product test relations (42). This method was used by the

Economic Commission for Latin America in the early 1960's. It is described

in Ruggles (1967,185) and is referred to as the market basket method. Note

that (43) is a T period generalization of the two period Edgeworth-

Marshall bilateral formula, P, defined by (32) above.

       Fisher was not the first to suggest the market basket method: Walsh

(1901,431) suggested the same method but called it ScroDe's method ith

arithmetic weights. Walsh (1901,399) also suggested the following system

of multilateral price levels pt which he called Scroe's method

zeometric wei2hts:



(44)        Pt —l (1I. qk)l/T pt                  t—l     T.



The corresponding Qt can be defined by (42) as usual. It is obvious that

(44) is the multilateral generalization of Walsh's bilateral index

defined by (5) above.

       The above multilateral methods construct price and quantity levels for

each period. It is also possible to devise multilateral methods where the

multilateral price index            gives the level of prices in period t relative

to the level of prices in period s and is a function of all of the price

and quantity information for the T periods; i.e., P —
5t     (p    pt,ql          qT)• Thus Walsh (1924,509) defined the following

multiperiod generalization of the Fisher ideal index (4):


            st            t 1 t 2     t T s 1 s 2          s T l/T
(4,              —   [p    q p q        q /p •q p q            q ]   , s,t —1    T.



The corresponding quantity indexes can be defined as follows:

                                                                                                        q ).


Gini (1931,10) also defined the multilateral price indexes ((45) and calle

the method the successive weights system. Both Walsh and Cmi noted that

(45) collapsed to                      defined by (4) if T—2 and s—i and t—2.

       Finally, Cmi (1931,12) did propose a new multilateral method which h

called the circular weight system, because the resulting system of price

indexes pSt satisfied a multilateral analogue to the circular test (9)48•

Given any bilateral price index function P(p11p2,q1,q2), define Cmi's

multilateral level of prices in period t relative to the period s level as

follows:

                                                                p ,q ,q )

for st—i              T. The corresponding Q                        can be defined by (46). This

method was later proposed (using F as the P) by E1tet and K6ves (1964) an

Szulc (1954) in the multiregional context and is known as the EKS system.

       Cmi (1931,13-24) tested out his circular weight system (as well as

some other alternatives) using the Fisher ideal 2F defined by (4) as his

bilateral ?,        for       8 time period observations on 5 Italian cities. Thus

Cmi's computations were both multiperiod (between time periods) and

multilateral (between locations).

       The ratio type price indexes, (45) proposed by Walsh and (47) propose'

by Cmi, can be converted into price levels pt(pl                                    pTql       qT) as

follows: corresponding to (45), define the period t price level pt as


                t             t    1    t 2     t Tl/T
(48)        P         [p•q p'q                   q]             ,    t—l        T
                                                 36

and corresponding to (47), define                as




(49)       P
               t   —
                          it it          2   t        2

                                                           t        tt       Tt l/T
                                                                    ,p ,q ,q )]


In   each case, it      can   be verified-that P
                                                      st      t 5
                                                           — P /P

       If we take the Cini-EKS price levels defined by (49) and divide each

of them through by P1, it can be seen that the resulting normalized price

levels t1l are closely related to Fisher's (normalized) blended price

levels defined by (41): for the Fisher price levels, we take the arithmetic
                                ktkt klkl
means of the numbers. P(p ,p ,q ,q )/P(p ,p ,q ,q ),                k—l,...,      T, while for

the Cini-EKS price levels, we take the geometric mean of the same T

numbers.

       Walsh (190l,399)(l924,509) noted the primary disadvantage of using the

muitiperiod full information price level functions P (p
                                                                     t   1        Ti
                                                                                p ,q
                                                                                            T
                                                                                           q ):

if the number of periods increases, all of the indexes have to be

recomputed.49 This is not necessarily a fatal objection since it is normal

practice for statistical agencies to periodically issue historical

revisions and there is no reason why the revisions could not be

accomplished using multiperiod indexes.

       However, at present, it does not seem prudent to enthusiastically

endorse a multiperiod system of index numbers since not enough research has

been done on the axiomatic properties of the various multilateral or

multiperiod alternatives)0 Moreover, it would be desirable to develop

multiperiod exact and superlative index number formulae and then examine

the axiomatic properties of the resulting indexes. In the bilateral case,

the Fisher ideal price index F emerges as the natural choice of a

functional form since it seems to satisfy more reasonable tests than any
                                       37

other knoc.xn formula and it is superlative as well. We need a multilateral

counterpart to this "ideal" bilateral functional form.

     To sum up: a comparison of the fixed base, chain, all binary

comparisons and multiperiod systems leads to no clear choice at this stage

However, if a definite choice has to be made, I would vote for the chain

system used with the bilateral Fisher ideal index


9.   Is the Substitution Bias Small?

     The substitution bias in the consumer price index is the discrepancy

between the Laspeyres or Paasche price indexes, L and P defined by (2)

and (3) above, and the consumer's true cost of living index, defined by th

right hand side of (23). There is an analogous substitution bias in the

output price index.

     The following quotation indicates Triplett's judgment on the size of

the substitution bias:

          "Though it has long been a staple of economists' educations, the

          substitution bias in a fixed-weight price index for consumption

          is just not very large." (Triplett, 1988,26).

To support the above opinion, Triplett cites the relatively close agreemen

between the Laspeyres and Paasche price indexes for U.S. aggregate

consumption data. Triplett's judgeinent would be correct if in fact these

indexes were true microeconomic Paasche and Laspeyres indexes, but they ar

not: microeconomic samples of price ratios pt+l/pt for various goods i are

combined with base period expenditure shares that are obtained from

periodic consumer expenditure surveys. The resulting aggregate indexes at

not quite L and       defined by (2) and (3) above.
                                        38

       It may well be that Triplett is correct in his judgement, but the

 evidence to support his position has not yet been presented.

      Due to the computer revolution, it is now possible to undertake some

 experiments which could help to determine the extent of the substitution

bias. Retail outlets that have computerized price and quantity information

on their sales could be sampled. Detailed microeconomic price and quantity

vectors Pt and qt could be constructed and the Laspeyres, Paasche and

Fisher indexes defined by (2)-(4) above could be calculated and compared

with corresponding official consumer or producer price indexes that covered

the same range of goods. Such firm    oriented   experiments could provide

use_ui information on the size of the substitution bias.51


10.   Is the Niew Good Bias Small?

      Triplett (1988) has a nice discussion of recent methods for adjusting

for quality change that have been used by d Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In keeping with the historical nature of this extended comment on Triplett,

we shall first briefly review the ancient literature on methods for quality

adjustment.

      Some of the early researchers on price measurement were aware of the

problem of quality change but the pace and direction of the change did not

seem large enough to warrant an explicit treatment.52

      However, by the latter part of the nineteenth century, Sidgwick

(1883,68) realized that not only were improvements in the quality of goods
                                                                              -


leading   to a bias in price comparisons, but also the growth of

international and interregional trade (due primarily to transportation

improvements) led to the systematic introduction of "entirely new kinds of

things" and this too led to a bias in price comparisons. As the following
                                      39

quotation indicates, Sidgwick (1883,68) thought that utility theory would

play a role in eliminating these biases:

          "Here again there seems to be no means of attaining more than a

     rough and approximate solution of the problem proposed; and to reach

     even this we have to abandon the prima facie exact method of comparing

     prices, and to substitute the essentially looser procedure of

     comparing amounts of utility or satisfaction.

Unfortunately, the mathematical apparatus of consumer theory was not

sufficiently developed at that time to enable Sidgwick to make any specific

progress on the new good problem.

     In a brilliant paper, Marshall (1887,373) not only proposed the

tabular standard, the chain system and the Edgeworth-Marshall index number

formula (32), he also made the first real progress on the appropriate

treatment of new goods, as the following quotation indicates:

          "This brings us to consider the great problem of how to modify

     our unit so as to allow for the invention of new commodities. The

     difficulty is insuperable,     we compare two distant periods without

     access to the detailed statistics of intermediate times, but it can be

     got over fairly well by systematic statistics. A new commodity almost

     always appears at first at something like a scarcity price, and its

     gradual fall in price can be made to enter year by year into

     readjustments of the unit of purchasing power, and to represent fairly

     well the increased power of satisfying our wants which we derive from

     the new commodity." (Marshall, 1887,373).

     As the above quotation indicates, Marshall was well aware of the

product cycle and he felt that the early introduction of new commodities
                                       40

into the consumer price index in the context of the chain system would

capture      of   the benefits due to the introduction of new commodities.

As we shall see later, not quite jj of the benefits are captured using

Marshall's suggested method, since his method incorrectly ignores the new

good in the first period that it makes its appearance.

     Marshall (i .373,374) also realized that improvements in

transportation led to the general availability of location specific goods,

such as fish at the seaside or strawberries at a farm. Marshall correctly

felt that these "old" goods that suddenly became available at many

locations should be regarded as "new' goods and treated in the same way as

a genuinely new good. His words on this important observation are worth

quoting:

           "This class of consideration is of much more importance than at

     first sight appears; for a great part of modern agriculture and

     transport industries are devoted to increasing the periods of time

     during which different kinds of food are available. Neglect of this

     has, in my opinion, viated the statistics of the purchasing power of

     many in medieval times with regard to nearly all kinds of foods except

     corn; even the well-to-do would hardly get so simple a thing as fresh

     meat in winter." (Marshall, 1887,374).

     Marshall's suggested treatment of the new good problem was

acknowledged and adopted by many authors including Irving Fisher (1911,204)

and Pigou (1912,47). As we saw earlier in section 8, Divisia (1926,45)

working from his independent perspective also suggested the use of the

chain method as a means of dealing with the new good problem.
                                      41

    The next important contributor to the discussion of new goods in price

measurement was Keynes. Keynes (1930,94) desctibed in some detail one of

the most common methods for dealing with the new good problem: simply

ignore any new or disappearing goods in the two time periods under

consideration and calculate the price index on the basis of the goods that

are common to the two situations. The corresponding quantity index was to

be obtained residually by deflating the relevant value ratio by this

narrowly based price index. Keynes called this method the hizhest common

factor method. This method would be identical to Marshall's chain method

if the two time periods were chosen to be adjacent ones. However Keynes

(1930,105-106) advocated his method in the context of a fixed base system

of index numbers and he specifically rejected the chain method for 3

reasons: (i) each time a new product is introduced, a chain index does not

take into account the benefits of the expanded choice set, and thus over

long periods of time, the chain price index will be biased upwards and the

corresponding quantity index will be biased downwards; (ii) the chain index

fails Walsh's multiperiod identity test, (13) above, and (iii) the chain

method was statistically laborious.

     Keynes' last objection to the chain method is no longer relevant in

this age of computers. Moreover, Keynes was unable to offer any positive

alternative to the chain method for comparing situations separated by long

periods of time as the following quotation indicates:

           "We cannot hope to find a ratio of equivalent substitution for

      gladiators against cinemas, or for the conveniences of being able to

      buy motor cars against the conveniences of being able to buy slaves."

      (Keynes, 1930,96).
                                       42

     However Keynes' first objection to the chain method (which was later

echoed by Pigou (l932,72)) was certainly valid (as was his second

objection). A satisfactory theoretical solution to Keynes' first objection

did not occur until Hicks adapted the analytical apparatus of consumer

theory to the problem.

     When new consumer goods make their appearance for the first time, say

in period 2, their prices and quantities can be observed.    In period 1, the

quantities of the new goods are all obviously zero but what are the

corresponding prices? Hicks (1940,114) provided a theoretical solution:

            "They are those prices which, in the 1 situation, would just make

     the demands for these commodities (from the whole community) equal to

     zero. These prices cannot be estimated, but we can observe that

     between the two situations the demands for these commodities will have

     increased from zero to certain positive quantities; and hence it is

     reasonable to suppose that the 'prices' of these commodities will

     usually have fallen relatively to other prices. This principle is

     sufficient to give us a fairly good way of dealing with the case of

     new goods.'

Of course, in the context of the producer price index, the appropriate

period I shadow prices for the new goods are those prices which just induce

each period 2 producer of the new goods to produce zero quantities in

period 1.

     Hicks' basic idea was used extensively by Hofsten (1952,95-97) who

dealt not only with new goods, but also adapted the Hicksjan methodology to

deal with disappearing goods as well. Hofsten (1952,47-50) also presents a

nice discussion of various methods that have been used to adjust for
                                     43

quality change, similar to Triplett's (1988) discussion of quality change

measurement techniques.

     Frank Fisher and Karl Shell (1972,22-26) laid out the formal algebra

for constructing the period 1 Hicksian "demand reservation prices" defined

in the above quotation by Hicks. Diewert (1980,498—501) used the Hicksian

framework to look at the bias in the Fisher price index F defined by (4)

when the reservation prices were incorrectly set equal to zero and compared

this index to the Fisher price index that simply ignored the existence of

the new goods in the two periods under consideration (which is Marshall's

method).54 Diewert (1980,501-503) also made some suggestions for

estimating the appropriate Hicksian reservation prices in an econometric

framework.

     Is the new good bias large or small? One can only answer this

question in the context of the price measurement procedures used by

individual statistical agencies. In Diewert (1987,779), some simple

hypothetical examples were given which showed that traditional fixed base

procedures could generate much higher measures of price increase than would

be generated using the chain method,55 However, what is needed is

empirical evidence.

     Numerical computation of alternative methods based on detailed firm

data on individual prices and quantities where new goods are carefully

distinguished would cast light on the size of the new good bias. Thus the

firm oriented experiments suggested at the end of the previous section to

cast light on the size of the substitution bias could also be used to study

the size of the new good bias.
                                           44

      Another line of empirical work which would be of interest would be to

collect industry price and quantity data on various major new goods (e.g.,

microwave ovens, video recorders, home computers, satellite dishes, etc.)

and then attempt to rework the relevant price indexes in the light of this

extra data.


11. Has the Theory of the Cost of LIvin Index been Exhausted?

      Triplett (198825) appears to answer the above question in the

affirmative as the following quotation indicates:

              "The CCL index has been subjected to far more research, both

      theoretical and empirical, than any other price index topic in the

      history of index numbers. It seems to me that much of the fruit has

      been picked from this tree."

It seems to me that the harvest is not yet over.

      A large gap in our current statistical system is in the area of the

consumer's allocation of time. Many years ago, Reeker (1965) showed how

the consumer's time constraint could be integrated into traditional

consumer theory and he applied his new framework to cast light on a wide

variety of applied economic problems. Additional applications can be found

in a recent book edited by Juster and Stafford (1985). In order to

implement Becker's theory, information on the consumer's allocation of time

is required, broken up into: (i) time at work561 (ii) time commuting to

work, .   (iii)   time spent shopping, (iv) time spent at housework, and (v) time

spent at various leisure activities. Since many productivity improvements

involve efficiencies in the consumer's use of time (e.g., a new subway.

line, an automated banking machine, electronic scanning of prices at the
                                      45

supermarket, etc.), it seems appropriate for Statistical Agencies to

consider the implementation of a version of Becker's framework.

     Another area of household statistics which requires further

theoretical development and empirical implementation is the area of income

statistics: labour income should be decomposed into price and quantity

components, income taxes should be taken into account in an appropriate

manner and capital gains should be recognized as components of income. The

point here is that most of the household measurement theory has

concentrated on the commodity demand side and there has not been enough
                                                            57
emphasis on the household factor supply and income sides.


12. Conclusion

     Jack Triplett has presented the profession with an excellent survey of

the price measurement literature since 1961. In sections 2 to 6 above, we

augmented his survey by providing an overview of the pre 1961 literature on

price measurement and index number theory in general. In sections 7 to 11,

we discussed various topics where we did not seem to be in close agreement

with some of the views expressed by Triplett in his paper.       In some cases,

we also provided a historical survey of these controversial topics: in

section 8, we reviewed the early literature on the chain principle and

various alternatives to it, and in section 10, we reviewed the early

literature on the new good problem.

     It seems appropriate to conclude by listing three recommendations for

Statistical Agencies where we agree with Triplett and then we shall list an

additional four recommendations where we may be in some disagreement.

     (1). Statistical Agencies should be encouraged to provide users with

adequate printed documentation.
                                      46

     (2). The decomposition of labor income (on the household side) and

labor payments (on the finn sideY into price and quantity components needs

improvement: weighted index numbers should be used for quantities rather

than unweighted manhours and manhours should be disaggregated into various

occupational, educational and demographically homogeneous categories.

     (3). In the context of the cost of living index, the flow of services

concept should be extended to other classes of consumer durables in

addition to housing.

     (4). My preferred method for decomposing a value ratio into price and

quantity components is the use of a superlative index number formula in the

context of the chain method.

     (5). Since it is usually impossible to collect complete price and

quantity information for each value cell in the relevant accounting

framework, it will be necessary to resort to some sort of sampling

principle. The appropriate objects to sample are values within the

relevant cell in the first period. These sampled values would then be

broken up into detailed prices and quantities which would then be observed

in the following period as well. Finally, Fisher ideal price indexes

should be constructed using these sampled values for the two periods and

the corresponding quantity indexes should be constructed by deflating the

relevant population value ratios by these (sample) price indexes. The

entire procedure is explained in some detail by Pigou (1932,75-77).

     (6). The sizes of the substitution bias and the new good bias are

still in doubt. The empirical experiments described in sections 9 and 10

above would be useful in determining the size of these biases.
                                     47

     (7). More empirical and theoretical work needs to be done on the

household supply side; see the suggestions on incorporating Becker's theory

of the allocation of time and on the construction of household real income

indexes made in section 11 above.

 1. For a complementary historical assessment of hedonic price indexes from

another pioneer in the field, see Criliches (1988)

2.   The following quotation from Triplett is particularly insightful:

      "The episode of CPI housing underscores the fact that soundness of a

      government statistical series requires not just good staff analysis,

      but as well the formation of a consensus among users - a conceptually

      correct measurement from the standpoint of economic or statistical

      theory that is not accepted by, or is not understood by, broad user

      groups does not meet all the requirements for a public economic

     measurement." (Triplett, 1988, footnote 15).

3.   See Griliches (1970), Triplett (1983b) and Jorgenson (1988) for a

lengthier discussion of the issues.   It is interesting to note that Bowley

(1901,228) (1928,236-237) anticipated many of the modern objections to the

use of unweighted average wages as the price of labor and unweighted

mathours as the quantity of labor as the following quotation from Bowley

(1901,228) illustrates: "The application of index-numbers to wage

statistics does not involve any fresh principles. It is not permissible to

ignore weights in this case; for an unweighted average would not allow for

the general tendency to increase numbers where wages are rising."

4. A good account of Fleetwood's contributions with extensive quotations

can be found in Ferger (1946).

5. See Fisher (1913,437)

6. Scrope does not refer Lowe (or anybody else for that matter) since as a

Member of Parliament, he seemed to be writing an extended political speech.

However, it seems likely that he knew of Lowe's work since his proposals
                                      49

and terminology were so similar to those of Lowe. Scrope (1833,320) also

proposed a comprehensive system of social security fo workers "when

rendered incapable of labour by illness, age or accident." Another early

proposer of the tabular standard who does not refer to Fleetwood or Lowe is

the American economist Willard Phillips who made his proposal in 1828; see

Jastram (1951) for a description of the contributions of Phillips.

7. Edgeworth (1925,331) called the method the consumption standard rather

than the tabular standard.

8. Bowley was not exclusively an advocate of the statistical approach as

we shall see later. Also, initially Edgeworth took a broader view of the

index number theory (recall his endorsement of the tabular standard if

quantities remained constant), but after this initial broadness, he became

a very strident defender of the statistical approach; in particular,

Edgeworth's (1923) criticisms of Walsh's test approach became quite heated.

9. Keynes (1930,72) also used some rather colorful language to criticize

the statistical approach as the following quotation indicates:   "I have

long believed that this is a will-o'-the-wisp, a circle-squaring expedition

which has given an elusive taint, difficult to touch or catch, to the

theory of price index numbers traditional in England. This is not equally

true of America. Nevertheless whilst the Americans have not worshipped

the mythical creature, they have not (with the exception, perhaps, of Mr.

Walsh) actively combatted him or dragged him out of the twilit cave where

Edgeworth judiciously kept him."

10. Edgeworth mistakenly attributed this test to Westergaard (1890), but

Westergaard's circular test is slightly different as we shall see.
                                     50

11. A weaker identity test would require both prices and quantities to

remain constant. No one could object to this weaker identity test, but it

is certainly possible to object to the strong identity test.

12. See Fisher (1922,413).

13. Alternative names for this test might be the constant basket i.t or

the tabular standard test. Walsh (1901,540)(l921,543) does not provide a

name for this test.

14. Walsh (1901.385) noted that the strong proportionality test implies

the strong identity test; i.e., (12) implies (8).

15. Walsh (1924,506) finally called this test the circular test but it

seems best not to confuse Walsh's test (13) with Westergaard's test (9).

If P satisfies the time reversal test (10), then (9) implies (13)

However, if P satisfies (13), then P satisfies the weak identity test

P(p,p,q,q) = 1 as well as (10) and (9). Upon noting that the index number

formula P(p1,p2q1,q2) a 0 satisfies (9) but not (10), we see that (9) and

(13) are not equivalent tests; i.e., Walsh's test (13) is more restrictive

than Westergaard's test (9).

16. This test postulates that the functional form that works for the price

index P(p1,p2,q1,q2) should also do the job as a quantity index, provided

that the role of prices and quantities is interchanged. This transforms

(14) into Fisher's strong factor reversal
   1212 1212 2211
P(p ,p ,q ,q )P(q ,q ,p ,p ) — p •q /p 'q

17. Frjsch (1930,404-405) tried to show that a bilateral index number

formula P could not simultaneously satisfy the base, commensurability,

determinateness and factor reversal tests while Wald (1937,180,182) and

Samuelson (1974,18-20) showed that P could not simultaneously satisfy the
                                      51

proportionality, circular, and factor reversal tests. Many other

impossibility theorems were obtained by Eichhorn (1976) and Eichhorn and

Voeller (1976).

18. In particular, see Eichhorn and Voeller (1976).

19. Ville assumed the maximization of a linearly homogeneous utility

function subject to a budget constraint while Hulten assumed cost

minimization subject to a linearly homogeneous production function

constraint. Results equivalent to the Ville-Hulten results were also

obtained by Samuelson and Swamy (1974,578-574).

20. Hofsten (1952) appears to be the first researcher who noticed this

difficulty with the Divisia price index.

21. See also Samuelson and Swamy (1974,579) for alternative suggestions on

how to approximate the continuous time Divisia indexes with discrete data.

22. The right hand side of (21) can be regarded as an approximation to the

arithmetic average of the compensating and equivalent variations defined by

Hicks (1942). Thus the measurement of differences in aggregate quantities

led to consumer led to consumer surplus theory while the measurement of

ratios led to the economic theory of index numbers.

23. For surveys, see Frisch (1936), Samuelson (1947,146-163), Ruggles

(1967), Pollak (1971), Samuelson and Swamy (174), Afriat (1977), Deaton and

Muellbauer (1980,167-184) and Diewert (1980)(l981)(Lt..ia)(1983b)(1987).

24. See for example, Diewert (1983a,l71).

25. The English translation of the original Russian article by Kon'is

(1924) did not become available until 1939. Thus Frisch (1936,25) did not

have access to the original KonUs article and he mistakenly attributed the

KonUs limits or bounds on the true cost of living to Haberler (1927).
                                       52

26. Diewert (1976,115) introduced this term to cover both the production

and utility function context.

27. The first mention of the word "exact" in this index number context

appears to be by Samuelson (1947,155). Afriat (1972,45) also uses the term

exact.

28. See Balk (1981,1556) for a clear proof of Frisch's result.

29. With these restrictions, f(q) — q•Aq —   h(g(q)]   where h(x) — x2 and

g(q) s   [q.Aq]"2.   Thus in this case, f is a monotonically increasing

function of the linearly homogeneous function g(q) over the set of q such

that q'Aq    0.

30. For a nice exposition and evaluation of the Frisch and Wald quadratic

approximation results as well as of some proposals by Samuelson (1974,16),

see Balk (1981)

31. The KonUs and Byushgens (1926) paper was published in Russian and non

Russian speaking economists seemed to be unaware of the paper until it was

cited (incorrectly) by Schultz (1939,8).

32. See Pollak (1971,105).

33. The Cobb-Douglas functional form was perhaps first used in the

economics literature by Wicksell (1958,98) in the nineteenth century.

34. The translog unit cost function was introduced by Christensen,

Jorgenson and Lau (1971).

35. Vartia (1978) provided an alternative derivation of this result.

36. Malmquist (1953) was the first to use the distance function in index

number theory.
                                      53

37. Bennet (1920,462) recognized that not all of the parameters of a

quadratic utility function could be identified (due to the unobservable

nature of utility) since he wrote of determining the parameters only up to

a ratio.

38. These perhaps overly pessimistic calculations lead to the following

impossibility theorem: economists will never know the truth, even to the

second order.

39. For a definitive treatment of separability concepts and duality

theory, see Blackorby, Primont and Russell (1978).

40. See the theoretical discussion in Diewert (1980,475-476) and the

empirical results in Harper, flerndt and Wood (1985) on alternative rental

price formulae.

41. Walsh (1901, 207) attributed the chain principle to Julius Lehr (1885)

45—46), who was motivated to introduce the principle in order to deal with

new goods.

42. Divisia (1926,44-47) saw his method as being a variant of the chain

method, with the basic discrete period being one year (which would minimize

seasonal fluctuations). Divisia (1926,45) also thought that the chain

method was the only logical way to make price comparisons over long periods

due to the introduction of new goods and the discovery of new inventions.

As new goods in his time, he mentioned machine guns (to replace the bow and

arrow), submarines, aircraft, the potato and steam engine.

43. However, later Fisher (1922,308-309) preferred the fixed base system.

Pigou (1932,71) criticized Fisher's later position and endorsed the chain

principle for the usual reason: with the introduction of new commodities.

the chain principle is the only way to make comparisons between distant
                                           54

periods.

44. Walsh (1901,401) (1924506) made the same criticism of the chain

systeo. SziXLc (1983,540) also uses Walsh's Test in his evaluation of fixed

base versus chain index numbers.

45. Actually1 Hill (1988,7) uses the more general Proportionality Test,

P*(pO,pt,Apt,qO,qt,qt) —    A   for A   > 0,    in place of (39).          -




46.   Fisher (1922,280-283) also found that           satisfied Walsh's Multiperiod

Identity Test (13) to a high degree of approximation.

47. Actually, Fisher (1922,301) used a slightly different normalization.

48.   In fact, all of the multilateral indexes defined in this section

satisfy the multilateral circularity test.

49. Walsh (1901,399) also made the following theoretical objection:

"Besides, how is a past variation between two years several years ago to be

affected by present variations?"

50. For a start on this topic, see Diewert (1987)(1988).

51. Such firm based experiments would yield information on the

substitution bias in output price indexes. Perhaps some day in the future

when consumers use credit or banking cards to pay for all of their

purchases, we could obtain an accurate paper trail that could be used to

construct true microeconomic Laspeyres, Paasche and Fisher price indexes.

52. Thus Lowe (1823, Appendix 87) states: "In regard to the quality of our

manufactures, we must speak with more hesitation, and can hardly decide

whether the balance be in favour of the present or of a former age; for if

our fabrics are now much more neat and convenient, they are in a

considerable degree less durable."
                                     55

53. Pigou, (1932,71) also has a nice criticism of Keynes' highest common

factor method which was later repeated by Hofsten (1952,59). Pigou also

criticized Fisher's (1922,308-312) later preference for the fixed base

method.

54. The second index has a smaller bias than the first index.

55. Since 1978, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has used a probability

sampling approach in the consumer price index which probably reduces some

of this fixed weight bias, but the bias is not eliminated.

56. Riddell (1983) discusses the issues involved in incorporating leisure

time (defined to be time spent not at work) in measures of the standard of

living and he calculates some of his new measures of economic welfare using

Canadian data.

57. See Diewert and Bossens (1987) for an introduction to these topics.
