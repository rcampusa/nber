                                            ABSTRACT

In this study we examine the importance of assimilation and ethnic enclave residence for smoking
outcomes among United States immigrants. We draw data on over 140,000 immigrants from the Current
Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplements between 1995 and 2011. Several patterns emerge from
our analysis. First we replicate findings from previous studies that show that longer residence in the
U.S is associated with improved employment outcomes while ethnic enclave residence may hinder
these outcomes. Second, we find that assimilation similarly extends to coverage of employment-based
anti-smoking policies such as worksite smoking bans and smoking cessation programs while enclave
residence does not substantially influence these outcomes. Third, we document complex relationships
between assimilation, enclave residence, and smoking outcomes. Lastly, we find no strong evidence
that immigrants reduce their smoking when faced with more restrictive state anti-smoking policies
and find counter-intuitive impacts of tobacco taxes. These findings have important policy implications.

1. Introduction

       This study examines the importance of economic assimilation and ethnic enclave

residence in immigrant smoking outcomes using the Current Population Survey Tobacco Use

Supplements between 1995 and 2011. As such we make several contributions to the economics

literature. First, to the best of our knowledge, no study has examined the importance of ethnic

enclave residence for smoking outcomes. Moreover, only a handful of studies have investigated

the impact of assimilation on immigrant smoking outcomes (Acevedo-Garcia et al., 2005; Angel

et al., 2001; Baluja et al., 2003; Wilkinson et al., 2005) and only one allows for heterogeneity by

birth country (Leung, 2013). Second, our study moves beyond simply assessing the degree to

which assimilation and enclave residence are associated with smoking outcomes, and examines

how these variables may protect immigrants from passive smoking at work and access to

employer-sponsored smoking cessation programs. Thus, we contribute to the broader line of

research that investigates how immigrants integrate into the United States labor market and

extend this line of research to health habits and policies to improve these habits. Lastly, we

consider a more comprehensive set of smoking outcomes and policies than previous studies by

examining the intensive smoking margin and smoking bans in multiple venues.

       Immigrants are potentially an important group to study as the U.S. immigrant population

has increased substantially over time. In 2011 there were over 40 million immigrants living in

the U.S., an increase from 31.1 million (23%) in 2000 (Pew Research Center, 2013). Also, the

type of immigrant who chooses to migrate to the U.S. is changing. During previous migration

waves (e.g., 1890 to 1920) immigrants often originated from Europe while more modern waves

tend to migrate from Latin American and Asia (Pew Research Center, 2013). Unauthorized

immigration from Mexico and Central America further altered immigrant flow composition.



                                                 2
Thus, more recent immigrant cohorts are on average less advantaged than previous cohorts.

Moreover, after decades of integration, residential patterns in the U.S. have become more

stratified along immigrant, racial, and ethnic lines (Cutler et al., 2008).

       Smoking is arguably one of the most important health behaviors to study as it imposes

large external costs on society. Specifically, smoking leads to $119 billion in health care costs

per year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008). Smoking increases health care

costs through increased use of publicly provided health insurance (Zhang et al., 1999), and

higher insurance premiums for smokers and non-smokers (Halpern et al., 2009; Pearson and

Lieber, 2009). The full costs of smoking may extend to the labor market through lower

productivity and increased absenteeism (Berman et al., 2013; Centers for Disease Control and

Prevention, 2008; Sherman and Lynch, 2013). Lastly, exposure to passive smoking can harm

non-smokers’ health (Institute of Medicine, 2010).

       While immigrants have lower prevalence rates of smoking and lower consumption of

tobacco products conditional on smoking than natives, a non-trivial proportion smoke (16% of

men and 7% of women in our sample) and at a level that can plausibly lead to negative

externalities both in terms of passive smoking and financial implications. Importantly, many

immigrants come from higher smoking countries (relative to the U.S.) and thus may respond

differentially to standard anti-smoking polices than native born Americans (Leung, 2013). For

these reasons, we argue that immigrants represent an important group to study.

       We study smoking both because smoking is one of the most hazardous health habits and

as a template for the broader set of health behaviors (e.g., obesity, substance misuse, and

medication adherence) that may increase health care costs among immigrants. Identifying risk

factors and developing policies to reduce these behaviors is timely given the U.S. spends $2.7



                                                   3
trillion annually on health care and these costs have consistently risen faster than the growth of

the overall economy (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2011). Although immigrants

have lower average health care spending than native born Americans (DuBard and Massing,

2007; Stimpson et al., 2010; Stimpson et al., 2013), they contribute $96.5 billion per year to the

nation’s overall health care costs. Legal immigrants have access to public health insurance

(Medicaid and Medicare) and illegal immigrants have access to emergency health care services,

both leading to concern over immigrant health and health behaviors due to financial externalities.

Access to health insurance for legal immigrants is likely to increase with the full implementation

of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Thus, immigrants will likely

contribute a larger share to public health care costs over time.

       We first corroborate labor studies that show as immigrants assimilate to the U.S. they

make gains in earnings and occupational prestige. We find evidence that labor supply attributes

improve with time in the U.S. among women but not men. We also find that residence in an

ethnic enclave may impede employment outcomes for immigrants of both sexes. Next we show

that assimilation into U.S. society also allows immigrants to access employment-based anti-

smoking policies and smoking cessation services. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, we find little

evidence than enclave residence influences access to these programs and services among men,

and some evidence that enclave residence may hinder access among women. We identify

complex relationships among assimilation, enclave residence, and smoking outcomes. Although

smoking ban coverage is extended to immigrant workers, we find little evidence that cigarette

taxes and venue-specific smoking bans substantially impact immigrant smoking outcomes.

       In this section, we briefly review the economic literatures on assimilation and ethnic

enclave residence. Each of these literatures is large and growing, and therefore it is beyond the

scope of this study to comprehensively discuss each. Instead, we aim to highlight the work most

relevant for our study. Moreover, there are likely interactions between degree of assimilation

and the decision to reside in the enclave that we do not address in this review. Lastly, we focus

here on immigration to developed countries only.

2.1 Assimilation

       Economists have historically taken great interest in how immigrants assimilate, or

converge towards natives, in terms of standard employment outcomes, e.g., earnings, occupation.

The term assimilation suggests the extent to which an immigrant identifies with the social norms

in the host country relative to the country of origin (Borjas, 1995). Economists typically model

assimilation as a linear process proxied by the number of years since immigration (Antecol and

Bedard, 2006; Chiswick, 1978; Leung, 2013; Lubotsky, 2007).

       The immigrant literature is tightly linked with the Roy model of worker sorting (Roy,

1951). Chiswick (1978) pioneered this line of research using a Mincerian human capital

framework. In this framework, the decision to immigrate is interpreted as investment in one’s

human capital. Immigrants are viewed as rational decision makers who maximize their lifetime

utility subject to constraints. They decide to invest in their human capital, or immigrate in this

case, when the expected benefits exceed expected costs. Chiswick (1978) predicted positive

selection into immigration based on ability and work ethic for example; more capable workers

could extract higher benefits from immigration, and face lower costs, than less capable workers.

Chiswick (1978) documented that immigrants initially experience worse employment outcomes

relative to natives as their skills may not be perfectly transferable to the host country labor



                                                  5
market, but eventually exceed natives. Multiple studies reinforced Chiswick’s findings (Abbott

and Beach, 1993; Borjas, 1982; Carliner, 1980). However, subsequent work questioned the

extent to which immigrants are positively selected and, in turn, their ability to exceed native

labor market outcomes (Borjas, 1985, 1995). Although there are important and outstanding

questions in this literature regarding the degree of selection and assimilation, on net, the existing

evidence shows some degree of assimilation in terms of earnings for most immigrant groups

(Beenstock et al., 2010; Chiswick and Miller, 2011, 2012; Lubotsky, 2007). What we ask here is

whether the economic assimilation process extends to employment-based anti-smoking policies

and cessation services. These outcomes may proxy for a broader class of employment features

that impact health and, in turn, health care costs and productivity.

       An important and related concept is the “healthy immigrant effect”. On arrival to the

host country immigrants typically have better health than natives. This effect may be attributable

to positive selection on health into immigration, domestic legislative rules on who can

immigrate, and healthier norms in the sending countries (Hull, 1979; Kennedy et al., 2006).

However, immigrant health assimilates towards native health levels over time (Anson, 2004;

Antecol and Bedard, 2006; Hao and Kim, 2009; Hull, 1979; Kaplan et al., 2004; Marmot et al.,

1984; Palloni and Morenoff, 2001; Park et al., 2009). Potential mechanisms for the decline in

health include uptake of host county health behaviors (e.g., smoking, consumption of high

calorie foods, sedentary lifestyles, and substance use and misuse) and under-reporting of health

conditions at migration (Antecol and Bedard, 2006; Biddle et al., 2007; Kennedy et al., 2006).

2.2 Ethnic enclaves

       An ethnic enclave is a physical space with high ethnic concentration and is culturally

distinct from the larger society. Immigrants often live in the enclave as they establish themselves



                                                  6
in the new country (Bartel, 1989; Borjas, 1998). Residing in the enclave at arrival may be a

rational decision for many as shared language, social networks, and cultural norms within the

enclave that may lower the costs (both pecuniary and non-pecuniary) to immigration. As

articulated by Bertrand et al. (2000) enclave residence may impact employment outcomes

through information (e.g., employment opportunity knowledge, job referral networks) and social

norms (e.g., attitudes toward working, self-employment, work effort). Moreover, by reducing

the need to adopt host country-specific capital (e.g., language) residence in the enclave may

further impede immigrant integration and economic assimilation (Chiswick, 1991; Lazear,

1999). Lastly, Chiswick and Miller (2005) argue that immigrants may be willing to accept a

lower wage job if the job is located in an enclave as this lowers the cost to accessing ethnic

goods and services (e.g., traditional food). While a lower reservation wage may increase

employment, it may reduce overall earnings and job match quality. Taken together the impact of

enclave residence on employment outcomes is ex ante ambiguous. Indeed, whether enclaves

help or hinder immigrant employment outcomes depends critically on the quality of the enclave

in terms of shared information, social norms pertaining to employment, and geographic location

relative to good jobs. There is evidence of negative selection into enclaves: less able immigrants

are more likely to reside in enclaves (Damm, 2009). Such selection suggests that enclaves may

not provide high quality information and social norms

       Perhaps not surprisingly, the research on enclaves is decidedly mixed. Residence in an

enclave has been shown to impact immigrant employment outcomes both negatively (Bertrand et

al., 2000; Collins and Margo, 2000; Kondylis, 2010; Liu, 2009; Warman, 2007) and positively

(Bell and Machin, 2013; Damm, 2009; Edin et al., 2003). Further complicating analyses,

immigrant characteristics (e.g., skill level, country of origin, vintage of enclave members, and



                                                 7
popular occupations) may determine whether enclave residence impacts these outcomes (Åslund

and Fredriksson, 2009; Beaman, 2012; Borjas, 2005; Patel and Vella, 2012).

       Turning to health outcomes, if shared information and social norms provide protection

against unhealthy American practices, then residence in an enclave may improve smoking

outcomes for residents. Of particular relevance for our work are several studies that suggest

living in communities with higher proportions of individuals who speak the same language or

share ethnic background may allow individuals to better access health and social services

through sharing knowledge of service availability and steps to access these services (Aizer and

Currie, 2004; Aslund and Fredriksson, 2009; Deri, 2005; Devillanova, 2008; Gresenz et al.,

2009). Extrapolating from these studies suggests that enclave residence may allow residents to

better access health information related to smoking (e.g., effective and low cost cessation

products) and may be more likely to retain their lower smoking rates.

       However, if residence in the enclave impedes immigrants’ ability to obtain high quality

jobs (e.g., high wages, workplaces that ban smoking, and employer-sponsored smoking cessation

programs) we might expect enclaves to lead to worse smoking outcomes (in terms of smoking

and passive smoking) for residents. Moreover, if immigrants who reside in enclaves work in

low quality jobs that lead to job-related strain, residents may self-medicate through smoking and

use of other substances. And indeed, recent studies suggest that immigrants work in more

hazardous occupations than native born Americans (Davila et al., 2011; Hersch and Viscusi,

2010; Orrenius and Zavodny, 2009). Lastly, if residence in an enclave provides immigrants with

access to lower price smoking products (e.g., if sellers do not enforce taxes) then enclaves may

lead to worse smoking outcomes via price effects.

3. Data and empirical model



                                                 8
3.1 Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplement Data

       We draw data on employment and smoking outcomes from the Current Population

Survey (CPS) Tobacco Use Supplements (TUS). The TUS was administered as a supplement to

the basic monthly CPS in 1992 to 1993, 1995 to 1996, 1998 to 1999, 2000 to 2003, 2006 to

2007, and 2010 to 2011. Beginning in 1994, all CPS respondents were asked about their country

of birth. Thus we restrict our sample to the 1995 to 2011 TUS surveys which include 199,681

immigrants. We exclude proxy respondents and immigrants younger than 18 years as TUSs

fielded after 2006 do not include respondents below age 18. After making additional sample

exclusions necessary for our research design our final analysis sample includes 149,735

immigrants as described in a later section of the manuscript.

3.2 Outcomes

       We examine three sets of outcomes: standard employment outcomes, access to

employment-based anti-smoking policies and cessation services, and smoking outcomes. Not all

variables are available in all TUS and Appendix Table A reports variable availability by year.

3.2.1 Employment outcomes

       A limitation of our study is that the TUS is administered as a supplement to the basic

monthly CPS survey and thus we do not have access to the rich income and employment

variables that are contained in other supplements e.g., the commonly utilized Annual Social and

Economic Supplement that is fielded in March. We select the most appropriate employment

outcomes, but they likely do not fully capture all important aspects of the economic assimilation

process: any employment at the time of the survey (coded one if the respondent is employed, and

zero otherwise), annual family income (converted to 2011 dollars using the Consumer Price




                                                9
Index [CPI]), and an indicator for employment in white collar job (coded one if the respondent

reports a professional or managerial occupation and zero otherwise).1

3.2.2 Access to employment-based anti-smoking policies and cessation services

        We next construct a set of separate indicator variables that measure 1) access to

employment-based anti-smoking, formal, full office smoking ban; 2) working in a job with an

un-enforced smoking ban2 (a firm may have a ban on the books, as many states regulate smoking

in the workplace, but may chose not to enforce the ban); and 3) working in a job that offers a

smoking cessation program to employees. The employment-based variables are asked only of

respondents who report working.

        Employment at a worksite that bans smoking protects against passive smoking via

exposure to secondhand smoke and may increase the hassle cost of smoking. Access to

workplace smoking cessation programs can reduce the costs (both monetary and non-monetary)

of smoking cessation. Moreover, medical evidence suggests that well-designed worksite

smoking cessation programs are effective in promoting cessation (Volpp et al., 2009).

3.2.3 Smoking outcomes

        Our first smoking outcome is an indicator for any cigarette smoking use (coded one if the

respondent reports smoking at the TUS interview, and zero otherwise). Next, we measure the

number of cigarettes smoked in the past 30 days among current smokers. Past 30 day smoking

information is obtained in a multiple variable sequence. All respondents who report smoking

100 cigarettes in their lifetime are asked whether they currently smoke no days, some days, or

every day. Someday smokers are asked the number of days smoked in the past 30. We assume


1
  Specifically, we use 2-digit CPS primary industry codes 1 (management, business, and financial occupations) and
2 (professional and related occupations).
2
  The question wording is “During the past two weeks has anyone smoked in the area in which you work?” The
question is asked to those workers who report an official smoking ban in the workplace.

                                                        10
that every day smokers smoked on all of the past 30 days. All smokers are asked the number of

cigarettes they smoke per day. We construct cigarettes smoked in the past 30 days by

multiplying the number of cigarettes smoked per day by the number of days smoked.3 Lastly, we

examine past year smoking cessation. Survey administrators ask a retrospective question on

smoking patterns one year ago to both current and former smokers. We code as ‘past year

quitters’ respondents who report smoking one year prior to the survey and not smoking at the

survey as one, and zero otherwise.

3.3 Assimilation

         To proxy for assimilation, we follow the economics literature and construct a linear

measure of years since migration to the U.S. Respondents are asked for the year in which they

entered the U.S. This variable is categorical, and we assign the mid-point year to each interval.

When the mid-point year is not an integer (e.g., 1966.5) we round up to the nearest integer. An

exception is when entry date is truncated. For example, in the 2003 TUS, the earliest value is

“before 1950” and we assign immigrants an entry year of 1950. This imputation underestimates

the years since migration for early arrivers. We then subtract the year of entry from the survey

year to determine the years since migration. A limitation of this variable is that it does not

incorporate reverse migration and overestimates years in the U.S. for those immigrants who

return to the home country at some point between the reported year of entry and the survey year.

3.4 Ethnic enclave

         We use data from the 1990 and 2000 5% file of the U.S. Censuses and the 2005 to 2011

American Community Surveys (ACS) to construct our ethnic enclave measures.4 Both data sets

were extracted from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (Ruggles et al., 2010) and

3
  Results are consistent if we use the logarithm of cigarettes smoked to address skewness.
4
  We do not utilize earlier ACS data sets (2001 to 2004) as they do not contain metropolitan statistical area of
residence. As detailed later in the manuscript this information is necessary for our analysis.

                                                          11
contain detailed information on birth country. We limit the sample to the top 50 sending

countries in the 1990 Census as sample sizes for particular countries become small outside this

range. These countries comprise over 86% of immigrants in the TUS. Appendix Table B lists

the top 50 countries, the number of respondents from each country in our analysis sample, the

smoking rate in these countries in either 2006 or 2009 from external sources (Leung, 2013;

World Health Organization, 2013), and the smoking rate for each country based on our analysis

sample. An interesting feature of this table is that many immigrants in our sample arrive from

countries with higher smoking rates than the U.S. For example, the smoking rate in Greece is

52%, roughly double the U.S. rate. However, TUS sample smoking rates are lower than the

country rates for all countries suggesting positive selection into immigration on smoking.5

        We construct our proxy for ethnic enclaves as the proportion of individuals from the

same birth country in the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) of residence. MSA information is

available for roughly 70% of the TUS, and we exclude respondents with missing MSA

information. For example, if a respondent reports that he was born in Ireland and resides in the

New York City MSA (NYC), we assign him the following value:

    . See the Data Appendix for more details on construction of this variable.

        Although it may be appealing to define the enclave at a smaller geographic level (e.g.,

census track), the finest geographic unit available for a substantial proportion of TUS

respondents is the MSA.6 We view our MSA-level measure as a proxy for access to enclaves.

Put differently, an immigrant who lives in an MSA with a higher proportion of own-ethnics

likely has better access to an enclave than an otherwise similar immigrant.


5
 The exception is Puerto Rico which is a location used in the sample even though it is not a separate country.
6
 The TUS contains county of residence for roughly 30% of the sample, but our sample sizes become too small to
estimate our regression models and we choose not to utilize this information in our study.

                                                       12
3.5 State anti-smoking policies and characteristics

       We include two standard anti-smoking policies in our regression models: the state

cigarette tax in dollars (Orzechowski and Walker, 2012) and a venue-specific smoking ban index

(Centers for Disease Control and Prenvetion, 2012). We convert the cigarette taxes to 2011

dollars using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Our venue-specific smoking ban index includes

information on bans in government worksites, private worksites, restaurants, shopping malls, and

bars. The variables indicate the severity of the smoking ban (range: 0 to 3) and higher values

indicate more restrictive bans. We sum across these 5 venues to construct an index of smoking

ban severity, and the allowable range for the summed variable is 0 to 15. We include policies in

all regressions for consistency, although results are robust to their exclusion. We expect these

policies to be most relevant for our smoking outcomes. Lastly, we include the state

unemployment rate as both employment and smoking outcomes may respond to changes in the

business cycle (Ruhm, 2005).

3.6 Other control variables

       In all regression models we include age (25 to 34 years, 35 to 44 years, 45 to 54 years, 55

to 64 years, and 65 and above years, with 18 to 24 years as the omitted category), race/ethnicity

(African American, Hispanic, and other race, with white as the omitted category), educational

attainment (high school, some college, college graduate, and post college, with less than high

school as the omitted category), and marital status (divorced, separated, or widowed, and never

married, with married as the omitted category).

3.7 Empirical model




                                                  13
       In this section we describe our empirical strategy for identifying the association between

economic assimilation and ethnic enclave residence, and the outcomes described above. Our

core model is a regression that takes the following form:

(1)

              is an employment or smoking outcome for individual i born in country b residing

in MSA m in year t. We utilize a linear probability model when the outcome is binary and least

squares when the outcome is continuous. The key explanatory variables are                (number of

years since migration) and        (percent of MSA own-ethnic).         is a vector of state policies

and characteristics, and        is a vector of personal characteristics.    ,    , and     are vectors

of birth country, MSA of residence, and year fixed effects.

       Inclusion of birth country fixed effects controls for difficult to observe characteristics that

are correlated with birth country and our outcomes. Moreover, inclusion of these fixed effects

partially addresses non-random selection into migration that may vary by birth country. By

including MSA fixed effects in our regression models we utilize within MSA variation in our

predictor variables to estimate relationships. As noted by Borjas (1985) years since migration

and survey year linearly determine the year of arrival in a pooled cross-sectional analysis as

utilized here. Thus, the survey year fixed effects control for cohort effects (e.g., changes in

cohort quality over time). Moreover, the year fixed effects capture national trends in our

outcomes.         is the random error term. We cluster standard errors around the birth country,

although our results are robust to clustering at the MSA level. All models are estimated

separately by sex given different labor market patterns across men and women.

4. Results

4.1 Summary statistics


                                                 14
       Tables 1A (men) and 1B (women) report summary statistics for both the immigrant

sample and the native born samples, the latter is included for comparison purposes. On average,

immigrants have worse employment outcomes than native born Americans. They are less likely

to be employed, have lower family income, and are less likely work in a white collar job

(p<0.01). An exception to this pattern is that immigrant men are more likely to report being

employed at the survey than native men. This difference may be due to the fact that immigrants

are more likely to be of working age than the native born population.

       Turning next to our measures of employment-based anti-smoking policies and cessation

services, we find a similar pattern: immigrants are less likely to work at a worksite that fully bans

smoking in working areas and are less likely have access to a worksite smoking cessation

program. Interestingly, immigrant men are slightly less likely to be employed at a worksite that

does not enforce its smoking ban (8% vs. 9%) while a comparable proportion of immigrant and

native women report this outcome (5%). Consistent with healthy immigrant theories, our sample

of immigrants is less likely to smoke than the native born population of adult smokers (16% vs.

22% among men and 7% vs. 18% among women) and smoked fewer cigarettes in the past 30

days (306 vs. 500 among men and 287 vs. 413 among women). Immigrant and native men are

equally likely to report quitting in the past year (9%) but immigrant women are more likely than

native women to report a past year quit (10% vs. 9%).

       The average number of years since migration to the U.S. among immigrant men and

women is 18.77 and 19.72 respectively. Immigrant men and women live in MSAs with 2.85%

and 2.60% of the population from their country of birth respectively. Immigrants tend to reside

in states with more restrictive smoking policies as measured by cigarette taxes and venue-




                                                 15
specific smoking bans, and higher unemployment rates. Other personal characteristics suggest

that immigrants are on average less advantaged than natives.

4.2 Employment outcomes regression results

       Table 2 reports selected results from regressions of our standard employment outcomes

(labor supply, earnings, and occupation) on measures of assimilation, ethnic enclave residence,

and other controls. Among men, we find little evidence that either assimilation or ethnic enclave

residence predicts the probability of employment: for each the coefficient is small and

statistically indistinguishable from zero. Turning to women, we find evidence that longer

residence in the U.S. is associated with a higher probability of employment. Specifically, 1

additional year residing in the U.S. is associated with a 0.3 percentage point (0.6%) increase in

the probability of employment. Among both men and women we find that assimilation into U.S.

society allows immigrants to move up the employment ladder: the more years an immigrant

resides in the U.S. the higher is his/her family income and the more likely he/she is to work in a

white collar job (relative to a blue collar or service job). For example, an additional year in the

U.S. is associated with a 0.24 percentage point (1%) and 0.31 percentage point (1%) increase in

the probability of working in a white collar job among immigrant men and women respectively.

However, residence in an ethnic enclave may impede these transitions: residence in MSAs with

higher proportion own-ethnic is associated with lower family incomes among both men and

women. A higher percent own-ethnic is associated with a lower probability of white collar work

among men: a 1 percentage point increase in the percent own-ethnic is associated with a 0.21

percentage point (1%) decrease in the probability of a white collar job.

       We include our state anti-smoking policies in these regressions for completeness not

because we believe that that they should influence these outcomes. Somewhat surprisingly, we



                                                 16
find that among women, cigarette taxes are positively associated with the probability of working

in a white collar job while the smoking ban index is negatively associated with family income.

These associations likely capture residential sorting rather than true causal effects. For example,

cigarette taxes are typically higher in states with more highly skilled workers (e.g., California,

New York). We do not observe these relationships in the male sample.

4.3 Access to employment-based anti-smoking policies and cessation services regression results

       In Table 3 we assess whether the associations between our immigration measures

(assimilation and ethnic enclave residence) and standard employment outcomes (Table 2) extend

to employment-based anti-smoking policies and cessation services. We find strong evidence that

the positive links between economic assimilation into the U.S. labor market are associated with

improved access to anti-smoking policies and smoking cessation services through employment

among both men and women. For example, among men, an additional year of residence in the

U.S. leads to a 0.2 percentage point (0.2%) increase in the probability of working at a job with a

full smoking ban in work areas and a 0.2 percentage point (1.8%) increase in the probability of

having access to a worksite smoking cessation program. Findings among women are consistent,

and, in addition, assimilation is negatively associated with the probability of an unenforced

worksite smoking ban (we observe a similarly signed coefficient among men, but the association

is imprecisely estimated).

       Turning to our proxy for ethnic enclave residence, percent own-ethnic in the MSA of

residence, we find a different pattern of results. Among men residence in an ethnic enclave is

not a strong predictor of our employment-based anti-smoking policies and cessation services

variables. Among women, we find some evidence that residing in an enclave is associated with a

higher probability of an unenforced worksite smoking ban: a 1 percentage point increase in the



                                                 17
percent own-ethnic in the MSA of residence is associated with a 0.08 percentage point (1.6%)

increase in the probability of an unenforced smoking ban. This coefficient is only marginally

statistically significant (p < 0.10), however.

       We find evidence, particularly among men, that state venue-specific smoking bans and

the protection they provide from passive smoking are passed through to immigrant workers: the

state smoking ban index is positively associated with the probability of reporting a worksite

smoking ban and negatively associated with the probability that the worksite smoking ban is not

enforced (the former association is imprecise among women). For example, a 1 unit increase in

the smoking ban index (recall that the mean of this variable is 6.8 on a scale that ranges from 0 to

15) is associated with a 0.32 percentage point (0.4%) increase in the probability of an office

smoking ban and a 0.23 (2.9%) reduction in the probability of an unenforced ban among men.

4.4 Smoking outcomes regression results

       We next consider smoking outcomes. We identify sex-specific relationships between

assimilation and the probability of being a current smoker: longer residence in the U.S. is

associated with a lower (higher) probability of smoking among men (women). Our findings

suggest that an additional year in the U.S. is associated with a 0.07 percentage point (0.4%)

decrease in the risk of smoking among men and a 0.07 percentage point (0.9%) increase in the

risk of smoking among women.

       This seeming gender inconsistency may be explained by something akin to regression to

the mean. Immigrant women smoke at a rate of 39% of that of native women (7% vs. 18%) but

immigrant men smoke at almost 73% of the rate of native men (16% vs. 22%.). Thus for

women, assimilation may lead to immigrant women behaving more like native women as they

reduce the larger discrepancy in smoking behavior. The smoking rates by gender are much more



                                                 18
equal in the U.S. by gender as compared to other countries (World Health Organization, 2013).

This pattern of gender-specific results is consistent with recent work by Leung (2013), however.

       Interestingly among both male and female smokers, additional years in the U.S. is

associated with a higher number of cigarettes smoked in the past 30 days: 1 additional year of

residence is associated with 1.7 (0.5%) and 1.3 (0.4%) additional cigarettes smoked in the past

30 days among male and female smokers. The increase in the number of cigarettes smoked with

assimilation may be explained by the relatively light immigrant smokers being those most likely

to quit. Assimilation is not a strong predictor of successful quits among men, while more years

in the U.S. is positively associated with a successful quit in the past year among women (an

additional year is associated with a 0.09 percentage point, or 0.9%, increase in this outcome).

This latter finding for cessation is consistent with the increase in number of cigarettes smoked

with time in the U.S. among immigrant women documented earlier in this manuscript.

Moreover, perhaps immigrant women are better able to access and successfully utilize smoking

cessation services once they integrate into the U.S. labor market than immigrant men.

       The relationship between enclaves and smoking outcomes appears to be sex-specific:

residence in an enclave may protect men against smoking but may hinder women who smoke in

their attempts to quit. Consistent with recent work (Leung, 2013), and troubling from a health

policy perspective, we find little evidence that increases in cigarette taxes or implementation of

more restrictive venue-specific smoking bans are associated with the risk of smoking or

probability of quitting. The coefficients on these variables are generally imprecise and often

counter to our predictions. Moreover, we find only weak evidence that smoking policies are

associated with changes in smoking patterns on the intensive smoking margin (i.e., the number

of cigarettes smoked in the past 30 days). Among male immigrant smokers a $1 increase in the



                                                19
state cigarette tax is associated with 22 fewer cigarettes (7%) smoked in the past 30 days, and the

implied tax-elasticity is -0.07. Surprisingly, for women the findings suggest that increases in the

cigarette tax are associated with increases in the number of cigarettes smoked and this

association is arguably both statistically and practically significant: a $1 increase in the cigarette

tax is associated with 24 more cigarettes smoked in the past 30 days (8.2%). We suspect that this

latter finding is likely attributable to residential sorting of immigrant women into high cigarette

tax states rather than true causal effects. The coefficients on more restrictive venue-specific

smoking bans are significantly indistinguishable from zero for both sexes.7

5. Robustness checks and extensions

         We next examine the robustness of our findings to a number of sensitivity checks to

assess the stability of our findings and extensions to the core analysis.

5.1 Defining the enclave at an alternative geographic level

         In our core regressions, we construct our measure of the ethnic enclave at the MSA level.

However, this requires that we exclude respondents that cannot be linked to MSA of residence

information. Moreover, respondents that cannot be linked to MSA information are more likely

to be rural thus this exclusion may impose sample selection bias. We next re-construct our

enclave measures at the state level. The tradeoff here is that the state is likely an even cruder

level at which to model the enclave than the MSA. The benefit, however, is that we do not

exclude rural respondents and sample selection concerns are minimized. Moreover, we are able

to utilize additional ACS surveys, specifically the 2001 to 2004 surveys, in our enclave

construction algorithm as all ACS surveys contain state of residence information (as noted earlier



7
 In unreported analyses we interacted the assimilation variables with the anti-smoking policy variables. We also
separate the smoking ban index by venue (i.e., bans in restaurants, bars, government worksites, private worksites,
and shopping malls). No clear patterns emerged from these analyses. These results are available on request.

                                                         20
in the manuscript, this is not true for MSA of residence). Thus less imputation is required to

construct the enclave measure. More details on variable construction are available on request.

       We re-estimate Equation (1) using our state-level enclave measures. Our results are

presented in Appendix Tables C (employment outcomes), D (access to employment-based anti-

smoking policies and cessation services), and E (smoking outcomes). Importantly for our study

the results are broadly consistent with the core model results presented in Tables 2, 3, and 4.

5.2 Mexican immigrants

       Mexican immigrants represent the largest group of immigrants in our sample and receive

a fair amount of attention in policy debates. In unreported analysis, we re-estimate our models

for respondents born in Mexico only. In these regressions we remove the birth country fixed

effects and cluster standard errors around the MSA. The findings are broadly consistent with

those reported earlier this manuscript. However, the coefficient estimates generated in the

smoking outcome regressions are generally smaller in magnitude and less precisely estimated

than those generated in the full sample. These findings suggest that Mexican immigrants are

even less responsive to standard anti-smoking policies than the broader group of immigrants.

5.3 State anti-smoking policy dynamics

       Smoking is an addictive habit and it may take time for smokers to adjust their smoking

outcomes following a price increase (either monetary as measured by the cigarette tax or non-

monetary as measured by venue-specific smoking bans). We include contemporaneous anti-

smoking policies in our core regressions and this may mask the policy impacts if such dynamics

are present. In unreported analyses, we re-estimate our regressions using a one year lag in policy

variables. Results are generally consistent in sign but show even weaker associations between

the policies and smoking outcomes.



                                                 21
5.4 Addressing between state unobservables

        In our core models we control for MSA fixed effects as we construct our measure of the

ethnic enclave at this level. We measure our state policies at a higher level of aggregation,

however. To better address difficult-to-observe characteristics that are correlated with both the

state policies and our outcome variables we replace the MSA fixed effects with state fixed

effects and re-estimate our models. The findings, available on request, are consistent in terms of

sign, magnitude, and statistical significance to the results reported in this manuscript.8

6. Conclusions

         In this study we provide new and policy relevant evidence on the roles of economic

assimilation and enclave residence in immigrant smoking. We first confirm findings from earlier

studies that show assimilation allows immigrants to achieve greater economic success in terms of

labor supply, earnings, and occupational prestige. We then extend this perspective and show that

assimilation similarly conveys better working conditions in terms of coverage by workplace

smoking bans and access to smoking cessation programs. In contrast however, residence in an

enclave may impede these outcomes. We find mixed patterns of results for smoking outcomes

with differing patterns by sex. Specifically, both assimilation and enclave seem to reduce the

smoking rates of men. But for women, assimilation increases the smoking rate. This seeming

inconsistency by sex is likely to different male and female smoking rates in the sending

countries: male (female) immigrants tend to arrive from countries with relatively high (low) male

(female) smoking rates (Leung, 2013). Thus, males experience healthy assimilation while

females experience unhealthy assimilation (at least in the context of smoking). The smoking rate

by sex is much more equal in the U.S. as compared to the comparable rate in other countries.

 We attempted to utilize an instrumental variable framework following Bertrand et al (2000), but our IVs were
underpowered and we chose not to present these findings.

                                                        22
Moreover, the increase in the number of cigarettes with assimilation may be explained by the

relatively light immigrant smokers being those most likely to quit. Some of these findings are

difficult to explain fully and likely relate to a complex structure of conflicting impacts. More

detailed data are needed to more fully understand the structure of these relationships.

       We find evidence that assimilation increases coverage of immigrants by workplace

smoking bans. Even if all bans are not strictly enforced, this is likely beneficial for immigrants.

The benefits can be of two kinds. The direct impact of a smoking ban would be to reduce

smoking, but we do not find this in our results. We do not have any measures of the indirect,

beneficial impact of reducing exposure to the passive smoking of other workers. Unfortunately

our data set does not contain direct measures of passive smoke exposure, such as cotinine levels.

That cigarette taxes are statistically indistinguishable from zero in participation and quitting

behavior regressions is surprising given the vast literature on this topic (Chaloupka and Warner,

2000), however it is consistent with recent work by Leung (2013). Perhaps living in an enclave

allows tax avoidance by obtaining cigarettes from non-taxed sources. We find some evidence

that higher taxes reduce the number of cigarettes smoked in the past 30 days but only among

men. More work is needed to understand these null findings for public policy effects.

       While we extend the literature in multiple dimensions and use a rich and extensive data

set, the study has several limitations. Although we address selection into migration, at least

partially by including birth country fixed effects in our regressions, it is unlikely that we are able

to address all sources of bias. Moreover, we are unable to adequately account for compositional

changes among the immigrant population over time (inclusion of survey fixed effects addresses

this concern to some extent). Our measure of assimilation is vulnerable to both rounding error

and recall bias, and does not capture reverse migration. Also, although we rely on self-reported



                                                  23
smoking outcomes which probably contain error, self-reports have been shown to be valid for

statistical analyses (Patrick et al., 1994). Lastly our proxy measure for financial success is

family income, not personal earnings or wages.

       Our also study provides new information on the effectiveness of a standard health policy

lever in a growing segment of the U.S. population at a critical time. The federal government is

currently proposing to increase the federal cigarette tax by 94 cents, nearly doubling the current

rate ($1.01). Our results suggest that this tax increase, although the largest increase in the federal

cigarette tax history, will not lead to substantial reductions in smoking among the majority of

immigrant smokers. Instead, the tax may be regressive and crowd out consumption of other

goods and services, or the enclave may protect them from bearing the full tax due to tax

avoidance (Busch et al., 2004; Colman and Remler, 2008).

       Importantly, what we learn in this study for tobacco regulation could inform regulation of

other health behaviors such as obesity and substance misuse. For example, obesity has reached

an epidemic level in the U.S. with just over 35% of the adult population being obese (Flegal et

al., 2012). A ‘fat tax’ has been suggested to fight obesity (Allais et al., 2010). Our findings

suggest that living in an enclave may shelter immigrants from taxes and other policies, while

assimilation may expose them to such public policies. That is, the healthy immigrant may not

only adopt the harmful U.S. behaviors but may be prevented from being helped by public health

policies. This suggests that to help some of the immigrant groups, other ways to motivate

smoking cessation must be used (Sindelar and O'Malley, 2013). In order to fully understand the

heterogeneity in the impact of public health policies, the behaviors of immigrants should be

better understood as they represent an increasing segment of our society.

Data Appendix: Construction of ethnic enclave measures

       We use data from the 1990 and 2000 5% file of the U.S. Censuses and the 2005 to 2011

American Community Surveys (ACS) to construct our ethnic enclave measures. Both data sets

were extracted from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (Ruggles et al., 2010). The

Census is fielded every ten years to enumerate and collect demographic information on the

population. The 1990 and 2000 5% files of the Census include approximately 12.5 million and

14 million individuals respectively. The ACS is a large-scale nationally representative survey

which is designed to replace the decennial long-form Census. Each ACS provides data for over

three million individuals.

       Both the Census and ACS contain detailed information on country of origin. We limit

the sample to the top 50 sending countries in the 1990 Census as sample sizes for particular

countries become small outside this range. These countries comprise over 86% of immigrants in

the TUS. We delete observations in which the specific birth country cannot be determined.

Examples include Africa (not specified) and Americas (not specified).

       We construct our proxy for ethnic enclaves as the proportion of individuals from the

same birth country in the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) of residence. MSA information is

available for roughly 70% of the TUS, and we exclude respondents with missing MSA

information. For example, if a respondent reports that he was born in Ireland and resides in the

New York City MSA, we assign him the following value:                                            .

       Because we do not have full overlap between the TUS data, and the Census and ACS

surveys we must impute our enclave measure for non-Census and non-ACS years (i.e., 1995,

1996, 1998, and 1999). Moreover, not all years of our Census (recall that we rely on the 5%

sample) or ACS surveys contain the universe of MSAs in the U.S. Thus, we must impute


                                               35
enclave measures for missing MSAs. Since MSAs are at a much finer geographic level than the

state, many of the birth country-by-MSA-by-year cells are small or empty, however. In total, we

must impute information for 57% of our MSA/birth country/year cells. To provide enclave

values for all MSAs in all years we utilize prediction equations that regress the percent of

residents from each of the 50 included birth countries on birth country, MSA, and year fixed

effects, and birth country by state fixed effects using least squares. The adjusted    from this

regression is 0.98, suggesting that our prediction model has reasonably good fit.

       The MSA coding in the TUS (and the CPS more broadly) changed substantially between

the 2003 and 2006/07 supplements (specifically, the CPS switched from using the Office of

Management and Budget’s June 1993 to June 2003 geographic area identification system). We

match MSAs between the two classification systems, and achieve a match rate of 95%. More

details on our matching procedure are available on request.
