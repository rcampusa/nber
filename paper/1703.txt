                                  ABSTRACT



    We analyze the pattern of growth of a nation which borrows abroad and which

has the option of repudiating its foreign debt. We show that the equilibrium

strategy of competitive lenders is to make the growth of the foreign debt

contingent on the growth of the borrowing country. We give a closed-form

solution to a linear version of our model. The economy, in that case, follows a

two-stage pattern of growth. During the first stage, the debt grows more

rapidly than the economy. During the second stage, both the debt and the

economy grow at the same rate1 and more slowly than in the first stage. During

this second stage, the total interest falling due on the debt is never entirely

repaid; only an amount proportional to the difference of the rate of interest

and the rate of growth of the economy is repaid each period.

1.   Introduction

     When borrowers have an option to repudiate their debts, the interactions of

borrowers and lenders over time presents a strategic situation of enormous

complexity. Consider the case of a sovereign borrowing country, raising loans

from the world capital market. Following Eaton and Gersovitz (1981), suppose

that repudiation of the debt results in financial autarky and a loss of

productive efficiency of the defaulting country. An indebted country must

balance these costs with the direct costs of debt repayment, in considering the

option of repudiation. In turn, credit rationing will emerge from the lenders'

decision to limit their exposure to a level low enough to render debt

repudiation an inferior option to the borrowing country.

     It turns out that the lenders' strategy is not easy to compute. The simple

maxim is to lend freely to the point where the country is indifferent between

debt repayment and repudiation. But what point is that? One of the incentives

for debt repayment is the option to borrow again in the future. But the value

of that option depends on how much lenders will lend -in the future. That -in

turn will depend on the future lenders' assessment of the point of indifference

of the country between repayment and repudiation, which in turn will depend on

the capacity of the country to borrow in the still further distant future. Thus

we have a problem of infinite regress, and the method of dynamic programming is

needed to solve the lenders' problem.

     In this paper, we examine a growth model -in which sufficiently many

linearities allow us to give a closed form solution to the lender's and

borrower's strategies. We also describe an algorithm and a suitable numerical
                                      —2—


technique to solve for borrower and lender behavior in more complex, non-linear

settings. In the analytical version of the model, the borrowing country goes

through two borrowing stages:   (1) a stage with unconstrained borrowing and a

rising external-debt-to-GDP ratio, with the rate of GOP growth falling

progressively; and (2) a stage with a constant, low rate of GOP growth and

constrained (rationed) borrowing. During the second stage (which always occurs

after a finite time), the country never repays the full amount of interest

falling due but only the fraction which is necessary to make the debt grow at

the same rate as the GOP of the country.

     Section 2 sets out the model. Section 3 analyzes the optimal lending

strategy when default is an available alternative to the borrower, and presents

analytical results in the linear version of the model. Section 4 briefly

discusses the use of numerical techniques for more general models. Finally,

section 5 examines the sensitivity of the equilibrium to alternative lending

strategies. A conclusion summarizes the paper. All technical derivations are

presented in four appendixes.



2.   The Model

     We study a discrete-time growth model of a small country which has access

to an international capital market. We assume that the consumption, investment

and borrowing decisions are made by a social planner maximizing an intertemporal

utility function. The numeraire (both national and international) is a good

which serves for both consumption and investment. The international rate of

interest is assumed to be a constant, r. In this paper we do not deal with
                                         —3—


the important distinction between traded and non-traded goods. This will enable

us to use GOP as a measure of the potential foreign-exchange revenues of the

country. In a more general framework, one should be careful to use the

production of traded goods as the measure of the revenues which enable the

country to repay its debt (see Cooper and Sachs (1984) and Oornbusch (1983)).


a.     Technology and Capital Installation

       The technology available to the country is described by a linear production

function with only one input, capital:


                =
(1)                 aK

      is GOP at time t, and Kt installed capital.   (In section 4, we briefly

examine the case of more general technologies.) Installed capital depreciates

at rate d, so that the net increment to installed capital is:


(2) Kt+i =          + (1_d)Kt

where I is the flow of newly installed capital. If there were no installation

costs, a social planner able to borrow at a world interest rate r would choose

either to invest or disinvest at an infinite rate depending on whether r is

less than or greater than a -    d.   In what follows, we shall assume the inequality


(3)          r<a—d
so that the planner would choose to invest at an infinite rate. in fact, we

shall also assume that installation of capital is costly. Following Abel and
                                                 —4—


Hayashi, we let J, total investment expenditure, and I, the flow of new

installed capital, be related by the functional form


(4)           =   [1   +


The unit cost to install capital is therefore (1/2)(It/Kt). which increases

with the rate of capital accumulation. With this formulation, the planner will

always choose to invest at a finite rate.


b.    The Wealth of the Country

      We shall define the productive wealth W of the country as the discounted

value of current and future production net of the investment expenditure, using

the world interest rate as the discount factor:


(5)       Wt =    =t(14T)(t)(aKi_Ji)
It is easy to show (see Appendix 2, equations (A2.5) to (A2.1O)) that the wealth

so defined is maximized by selecting a fixed rate of capital accumulation


          x* =
(6)
                  It/Kt

Capital stock growth is then given by;


(7)



From now on, we shall assume that the value of g* satisfies g* c r so that the

infinite sum in (5) is meaningful. We show in Appendix 2 (A2.9) that the value

x* maximizing W and satisfying (3) is

(8)       x* =    (r+d)[1   -   Yt   —
                                         (2/4)(a-d-r)/(r+d))
This value of x exists under the condition
                                        —5.-




(9)         $ > 2(a—d—r)/(r÷d)


(9) says that installation cost must be sufficiently large so as to make the

maximum rate of capital accumulation lower than the rate of interest. We

henceforth assume that (9) holds.


c.     Optimizing Behavior of the Country

       We shall assume that the country is governed by a social planner maximizing

a time—separable utility function of the form


(10)        U =


The choice of logarithmic utility helps to preserve key linearities necessary

for a closed-form-solution.

       When the constraint on foreign borrowing is not binding, the optimal

consumption path will satisfy


(11)        C,÷1/C =   (1+r)

From now on we shall assume


(12)        $(1+r) -c I +


which guarantees that the planner discounts the future sufficiently to desire to

be a net borrower.


d.     Foreign Borrowing

       The international capital market is assumed to be competitive, and to

supply loans at a fixed interest rate r (though in a rationed quantity, yet to
                                                  -6-



be determined). All loans are for one period, with Dt denoting the principal

repayments due at time t, and rD the interest payments due at time t. The

balance of payments equation is:


(13)               =
                       (1+r)O   +   + It''    +
                                                   ($/2)(I÷/Kt)]
                                                                   —




In   general, as described in Section 3, new borrowing will be limited by a

constraint of the form              h(K1). The goal is to characterize the h(Kt÷i)

function, and to study optimal borrowing under that constraint.


d.     The Threat of Repudiation

       We shall assume that the planner has the option of repudiating the

country's external debt. If it does so, it suffers two penalties. First, the

country permanently loses its access to international capital markets so that it

is forced into financial autarky. Second, there is a direct penalty on

production following debt repudiation (due, for example, to a loss of efficiency

following increased difficulties in foreign trade) so that the productivity of

capital becomes a(1—A) for some Xe[O,1). GDP hence becomes


(14)           =
                   a(1—A)K

Given these constraints, a defaulting country can reach an autarkic

intertemporal utility level, which we name vD(Kt). Note that this utility level

is a function of the stock of capital in place when the decision to default is

taken. We show in Appendix 1, equation (A1.8), that V°(Kt) is of the form:


(15)       VD(Kt) =     log(Kt)/(1_$)   +   Constant
                                      -.7—




The constant term is a decreasing function of A. We shall assume full

information of both creditors and debtors of the value of A, as well as of the

level of the capital stock. Given this absence of uncertainty, default will

never happen: the lenders will select a supply of credit such that the borrower

will never find it profitable to repudiate its debt. The main purpose of

Section 3 will be to find this loan supply and to derive its consequences for

the growth of the country.



3.   Equilibrium with Repudiation

     We now examine the consequences of a threat of debt repudiation on the

strategies available to the lenders, and on the rate of growth of the borrowing

economy. At each point of time, the country has built up both external debt and

productive capital. In order to decide whether to default or to repay the debt

coming due, the country has to compare the autarkic utility level V0(K), which

is a function of installed capital only, with the utility it can derive by

servicing the debt and at least postponing the decision to default. The

subtlety of the problem is that the country's decision depends in part on the

future credit lines it expects from the lenders, who must relate their l!nding

decisions to the country's present and future choices. Technically, the

solution must be obtained by backward recursion. Given the constraints on

lending that the country is expected to face in the future, present lenders must

keep their exposure to a level which keeps the country from defaulting an its

current debt.

     Solving the problem in its full generality is a hard task and
                                          —8-


simpi-ifications are needed to find a closed form solution. An example is solved

in Eaton and Gersowitz by assuming a fixed cyclical pattern to the country's

output, and no capital accumulation. In our previous work (1984, 1985), a

three-period horizon allowed us to solve a model with uncertainty via backward

recursion. In the model here, the many linearities which we imposed on consumer

tastes and on production technology enable us to give a closed—form solution to

the problem in an infinite-horizon model with capital accumulation. Before we

solve our specific model, we first set the problem in its general form.


a.      Finitely-Lived Economy

        In order to show how backward recursion is used to find the optimal

decision rule of the lenders, we first assume that the horizon of the country

ends at some finite time 1.

        Let us assume that the country has not defaulted before the last period and

that it has accumulated by then a capital stock Kr and an external debt D1 (with

debt D1, the country owes (i+r)D in the last period). During the last period,

the decision to repay or to default is straightforward since the country has

only to compare the costs and benefits of defaulting in one period. We define

(following Eaton and Gersovitz (1981))


(16)        VT(KT.OT) =   max{V(K1,D).   V?(K1);
with

                                 -
(17)        V(KTIDT) = log[aK1       (l÷r)D]
and

(18)        V(KiiDr) = log[(1-A)aK1.]

where      denotes the utility that the country can reach by repaying its debt at
time T, and       the utility it can reach by defaulting at 1. VT                        the maximum

of      and 4, and is thus the maximum utility achievable at time T.                       We assume

that when repudiation andrepayment yield exactly the same utility (i.e.                             = yR)1

the country repays the debt. Let us call hT(                        ) the lending limit which keeps

the country from defaulting at 1. h1 is defined implicitly by the condition:


                  h1(K.1.) <=>         V(KTVDT) )

From (17) and (18), hT is simply:


(19)        hT(KT) =    XaKT/(1+r)

Thus, the country will repay DT if and only if DT                       h1(K1) = XaK1/(1+r).
       Let us now analyze the problem at time 1-1. We define 41(DT 11K1                             as

              R
(20)       VTI(DT1IKTI) =                     max       (logc1 + $VT(KTIDT)I
                                        C1 l'1T IT
            subject to
            (2) K1 =               +
                                        (1—d)K11

            (4) J1 =     [1+(1/2)(I1_1/K1_1)]l1_1
                                          +         +           +                    —
            (13) D1 =    (1+r)01_1            C11       1Tit1       (/2)(IT_IKT_P]       QT_l

            and
                        h1(K.1.)




V1(K11JD11) is the utility that the country can reach by repaying the debt,

       when it faces a new supply of credit which is constrained py D.,.
                                                                                                h1(K1).
       Let us finally define:


(21)       VT1(DT1IKT1) = max (Vl(KTltDTl)i v°(K,)}
                                         -10—



with Vl(KT_l) the utility level that the country can reach by defaulting on the

debt         VT_I is the best outcome that the country can reach at time t given its

ability to repudiate the debt. We now define h11(           )   as the rule which will

keep the country from defaulting at time 1-1. We want:


(22)
            01_i    hTl(KT1) <> VT1(KTlIOTi)             V1(K1)           H


       By backward recursion, we can clearly define a sequence of lending rules

                             such that (22) holds for all t         1, and v, vD, and Vt
{h1( ).hTi( ),...,h0( )}
defined analogously to the expressions in (20) and (21). Equation (22), when

generalized for all t, is the condition for the country to repay its debt

0 falling due at time t when it expects at time t,. . . ,T, the lending rules

ht       hT to apply.

       It is interesting to consider the case when X = 1, i.e. when all output is

lost in the event of default. In this case, a default at time t results in C

= 0 for all i      0. Thus, A = 1 is tantamount to assuming that the country has

no option to repudiate. It is easy to see that the planner will always choose

to service the debt as long as it is feasible to pay (1+r)O out of net exports

at time t plus new borrowing. At 1-1, therefore, lenders limit loans D.. such

                                                       repayment in period I is not
that (1+r)D1       aKT (clearly, for (l+r)D >    aK,
feasible, as there is no lending in T +    1).    At T—2, lenders require that

(l+r)O11 C max(aKT_l_JT_l#0T)P such that 0T            aKT/(1+r). Thus, (l+r)011
max[aK11Ji1+aK1/(i+r)]. In other words, (i+r)D1_1 will be kept less than or

equal to the maximum productive wealth at time 1-1; By induction, it is easy to

prove this result for all t C T:
                                          —U—


(23)        (1+r)D 4 max T=t(aKi_Ji)(1+r)it)
            subject to (2), (4)

or, using earlier notation:

(24)        (1+r)D 4 max


To sum up, when A =   1,   borrowing is limited only by the maximum productive

wealth of the economy.


b.     A Digression on the Precommitment of Capital Installation

       In the maximization problem which we set in (20), we implicitly assumed

that the investment and borrowing decisions are made simultaneously, since the

lenders at time t can condition their loans on the investment decision of the

country. The loan at time t,            is therefore made a function of the capital

stock that will be in place at time t+1.      If the lending decision must be made

before     is observed, there is a moral hazard problem. The country, even if it

wishes to precommit itself to investing a certain amount I in light of the

borrowing constraint Dt+j      ht+i(K+i). may find it profitable not to do so

after after the loan has been granted. In such situations, the lending strategy

by the banks should be written



           Dt 4 ht(Kti)

and the borrower will typically reach a lower level of utility because of this

lagged relationship. In all that follows, we shall ignore this problem by

assuming that the loan can be predicated on the investment decision each period.

We refer the reader to our previous work (1984) for further discussion.

c.      Infinite-Horizon Economies

        When one lets the time horizon of the economy go to infinity, the

definition of the lending rule remains the same except that the time subscript

may be dropped, since h(Kt) will be the same for all t. An equilibrium will be

defined by the four functions vD(Kt), VR(Kt,Dt), V(Kt,Dt) and h(Kt). such that:

(25)                         =        max
              VR(Dt,Kt;h(                       [logCt + $V(D+iKt+j;h( ))]
                                 t'    t' t+1

              subject to (2), (4), (13) and            4 h(Kti)


              V(DtiKt) = max{VR( v )}

                 4 h(K1) <> VR(Kt,Dt;h( ))
                                                    V0(K)
h( )    is   therefore a stationary rule such that if future lenders are to apply it

as a criterion for future lending, it will also be used as a criterion for

current lending.

        Before proceeding to the specific solution for V0. yR. and h in the case

of A < 1, it is useful to make one small amendment to (25). Though             equals

log C, +            and V1 = max (V11V÷1), the lending constraint

h(Kt+i) guarantees that V1                  as long as the debt is repaid at time t.    In

other words, as long as the debt is repaid once, borrowing constraints will

guarantee that all future debts will also be repaid (this is true only in a

model without uncertainty). Therefore, yR in (25) will also satisfy:



(25')
              vR(ot,Kt) = max[loC + $VR(Otl,Ktl)]

where        replaces V on the right hand side.

        One case of (25) is easily solved: for A = 1. As noted earlier,

exports aKt -        and new borrowing Dt+i. i.e. as long as (1+r)D max

 (aK_J+D+1). Of course,                is limited by Dt÷i ( h(Kt+i). Thus, the

borrowing constraint is defined by a stationary h function, such that h(K) =

[max(axt_Jt+Dt+i)J/(1+r),       with        h(K41). Upon substitution, for Dt+i w
have h(Kt) =                                   The solution to this functional
                 max[aKt_Jt+h(Kt+i)]/(1+r).
equation is:


(26)        h(K) = max(y7_t(1+r)_(1_t)(aK._J4]/(1+r) = max
                                                           W/(1+r)

Thus, as in the case of finite 1, the borrowing constraint when A =       1   is simply

that D(1+r) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of national

productive wealth.

       For A =1, the problem in (24) reduces to the standard borrowing problem

without repudiation risk:


(27)       max rt         log   C
           subject to (2), (4), (13), and for all t,

           D(l+r)        maxy_t(aKi_Ji)(1+r)_(1_t)
           and      =   0, K0 given.

       It is a standard exercise to how under these circumstances that the

optimal production decision and the consumption choice can be separated. Given

the international rate of interest, investment is chosen to maximize the

productive wealth of the country. Given the path of productive wealth, the

planner theli selects an optimal pattern of consumption, subject only to the

constraint that          max W is satisfied. We show in Appendix 3 that the

equilibrium will be characterized by the two following conditions:
                                          —14—


      Proposition 1: When A= I (i.e. the country can never profitably

      repudiate its debt)


      1)      GOP grows at the fixed rate 9* (equation (8)) which maximizes

              productive wealth


      2)      Consumption grows at a rate 0 =   (1+r)   —   1.


 The initial value of consumption is defined so that the discounted value of

 the infinite sequence of consumption is equal to the wealth of the country.

      Under the assumption (12), consumption over GOP tends to zero in the

 stationary state. This says that in the long run all GOP goes to repayment of

 the debt. When the country has the option to repudiate its debt, even at a

 substantial loss, a path in which consumption
                                                   asymptotically approaches zero as
 a fraction of GOP can never be an equilibrium, since the
                                                                    option to repudiate
would eventually be exercised. Lenders will restrain their lending so that in

the limit only a fraction of GOP goes to the repayment of the debt, and so that

consumption does not tend to zero in the long run.

     One additional feature of the equilibrium is the
                                                                 following. The productive
wealth of the economy W is maximized by the investment path, and it grows at

the same rate as GDP, i.e. at the rate g*. Since g* C r (by our earlier

assumptions on the technology parameters), and since
                                                            (1+r)O W by the lending
rule, we see that O must grow less rapidly than rate r in the long run.

Therefore, the path of (1+r)O satisfies the so'-called
                                                                 "transversality
condition":

Let us define RPt as the net repayment of debt each period, given by the

difference of (1+r)D and new borrowing

                             —
(29)        RPt =   (I+r)O
Since                        =                -
        (29) implies             (1÷r)t00         Zo(1+r)(t_)RP1,
we have Ot+i/(1+r)t =                -
                          (1+r)D0           0(1+r)1RP..       Then,: taking limits and

applying the transversality condition, we have:

(30)        (1+r)D0 =   17..0(1+r)RPi
In effect, the transversality condition is a zero—profit condition for the

sequence of loans:      it guarantees that the discounted alue of repayments equals

the outstanding debt payment due at time t, (1+r)D.

       We have found the transversality condition to.be implied by the market

equilibrium. If lenders expect (1+r)D+1 W for all I > 0, they will impose

(1+r)O÷1 (          in period t.         In some models, the transversality

condition need not be an implication of market equilibrium (see Cohen and Sachs

(1985) as an example). Later in this paper, -in Sectiob 4, we will need to

impose the zero-profit condition (30) directly, rather: than finding it as an

implication of the model.


d.     Market Equilibrium with Repudiation Risk

       We now turn to the case of A < 1, and show that the lending rule h(Kt) is

linear in Kt. The equilibrium path, when A <             1   is described by the following

proposition:
                                               -16-


       Proposition 2: Lending in each period is governed by a linear credit

       constraint:


(31)               h*K

       where h* is a constant which depends both on the technology of production

       and on the taste parameters of the intertemporal utility function. Given

       this constraint, a country with no initial debt selects a path with two

       stages:


       Stage 1: The constraint (31) on the debt is not binding. The rate of

       growth of the economy is high initially, and declines progressively, and

       the debt—to-GDP and debt—to-capital ratios increase.

       Stage 2: The constraint on the debt is binding, the economy and the debt

       grow at a same rate n, which is lower than the growth rates in Stage I

       and below the rate of growth, g*, which maximizes productive wealth.



       According to Proposition 2, the threat of repudiation forces the economy

into an equilibrium with productive inefficiency, since the rate of growth in

stage 2 is below the level g* which maximizes productive wealth. With debt

growing at rate n1 we have             =              Also,    (1+r)D - RPt. where
                                           (1+n)Dt.
RPt is the amount of repayment at time t. Thus, RPt =                   or:
                                                              (r—n)D.
(32)       RPt =         with   e =   (r-n)h*/a

One sees that the repayment is always less than the amount of interest falling

due, rD. so that the lenders always refinance some interest payments. Despite
                                            —17—


this property, the discounted value of debt repaymentsequals (1+r)O, i.e., the

zero profit condition in (3) holds. (We know this to be true, since with debt

growing at rate n <    r,   the transvérsality condition in (28) is satisfied.)

     Once the binding debt-to-capital ratio, h*, has been reached, the only way

the lenderscan keep the country from defaulting is tocontinue to lend

according to the sane rule. If they cease to do so, and demand, for

example, the repayment of all interest falling due, then the country will

default. (Proof: The rule 0* ( h*K, when it is binding, leads by construction

to    = yR. Any tighter lending rule will then have V0 >        R,   and the country

will default.)

     The proof of Proposition 2 is given in Appendix 3. Here we sketch the main

steps of the proof. First, we guess a function for hOC) and solve the optimal

borrowing problem under the constraint             h(K), assuming no debt repudiation.

The optimal borrowing problem yields an optimal consumption plan, denoted

where the superscript R      stresses   the dependence of the optimal plan on the

assumed borrowing constraint. We then define the value of the optimal program

(under Fi)   as v'(KtDt) = rsa t1log (C11). By construction, vh satisfies

the equation (25'): Vh(Kt,Dt) = max log(C) +                         such that
                                                     Vh(Kt+l,Ot+l)
     '               Then, we prove for our    choice h that     (   h(Kt÷1) if and

only if vhl(Kt,ut)      V(IC). Thus, we have found a solution to (25), with

yR = vi', h = h, and V0 = V0. Using            we then prove the part of the

proposition concerning the two-stage growth path.

     Specifically, we prove that the linear credit rule in (31) satisfies the

market equilibrium in (25). The properties of the borrowing equilibrium under
                                          —18—




       h*Kt are easy to calculate, a shown in Appendix 3. We solve the optimal
Dt

control problem for foreign borrowing subject to the constraint that O.
                                                                                 h*Kt.
The result is the two—stage growth process described in Proposition 2. Starting

U0 =   0, there is an initial period of rapid but declining growth, with D/K
rising to h*. Once the constraint is binding, 0/K remains equal to h*, and

growth remains equal to xh*, where xM is the root of equation (A3.8) in

Appendix 3. This growth rate is less than g*, the grovth rate that maximizes

       (Remember that g is achieved when A = 1, i.e. when there is no viable

threat of repudiation.)

       In Appendix 3, we present the non-linear equation (A3.12) that defines h*.

It is straightforward to show that h* is: increasing in a, , and A; and is

decreasing in r.     In words, the sustainable debt per unit of capital rises with

capital productivity, the discount factor, and the penalty for default, while it

falls with the world interest rate. By a simple transformation, the maximum

debt-GNP ratio is a similar function of these variables, since D/GNP =        O/(aK-rD),
whidh must be less than or equal to h/(a-rh) when U ( HK. In Table 1, we

calculate the maximum debt—GNP ratios for alternative values of a, , A, and r.

       It is also instructive to compare the equilibrium growth paths for GOP

under alternative borrowing assumptions, as is done in Figure 1. The dashed

line, which increases most rapidly, is for GOP in the absence of repudiation

risk (i.e. for A =   1);   the solid line, which shows intermediate growth, is for

GOP with repudiation risk (specifically, A =     0.4),   with 0/iC initially below h*;

the dotted line, with the slowest growth, represents the case without foreign

borrowing (either a closed economy, or open economy with A =       0).   There are two

notable aspects of the figure. First, it is apparent that productive-wealth

is reduced by the option to repudiate. Second, we see the point of inflection

(in period 17) in the intermediate growth path, which according to Proposition 2

is reached when the constraint Dt         h*Kt begins to bind.



4.       Equilibrium with Repudiation in Nonlinear Models

         We have been able to derive a closed—form solution for the growth path in

                =                                       is separable in K and U (see
the case            aKt because the value function

          but different      will differ only in scale. With U/4

     =                  2 will simply follow a path in which all variables
          4, economy
                                        times the values in economy I (Ct, IJ, 4,
(C, D, K, GDP) are equal to                                                            GDP).
         Once the linear production technology is abandoned, an analytical solution

appears out of reach. Now, a rise in K is more than a scale change, since

output does not (by assumption) rise in the same proportion. For a standard

neoclassical production technology, Q        = F(Kt),   with Ft > 0, F'' C 0, a rise in

     lowers the marginal product of capital and reduces the incentive to invest.

It is not surprising, therefore, that the maximum            associated with Kt will not

rise in equiproportion with Kt.        In other words, the h function giving Ut

h(K) will be less than unit elastic in Kt.

     In order to investigate this case, we resort to numerical dynamic

programing methods (designed by Mr. Atish Ghosh in conjunction with the

authors). Specifically, the value function V°(Kt) is calculated numerically for

a grid on Kt varying between 0 and 10.0, with steps of 0.1. Then, v(Kt,n) is

calculated using the backward recursion methodology outlined in Section 3. The

   function is analyzed on a grid of 0 to 10.0 for Kt. and 0 to 2.0 for IJ., both

with step sizes of 0.1. Once               and           are calculated for a period of T—t,

as in section 3, the optimization in (20) is carried out by a numerical search

procedure over I and C, using step sizes of 0.05 for these variables. The

backward recursion procedure is repeated until                   and       converge to

steady—state functions within the specified tolerance.

     An example of this numerical exercise is shown in Figures 2 and 3. We

adopt a Cobb—Douglas production technology                     3K3.    The other parameter

values are a =   0.27,   r =   0.11,   =   0.5,      =   0.85,   and   =    0.3.   Figure 2 plots

the maximum Debt/GOP ratio as a function of GOP. (Note that the jagged nature

of the curve results only from the discrete step—sizes tised in the programming

algorithm. These minor blips are unimportant quantitatively. A smoother curve

could be achieved by a finer grid size, but at the cost of much higher computing

time.)1 In the linear case, of course, this maximum ratio is a constant (h*/a),

independent of the level of GOP. In the case of Cobb—Douglas technology,

however, the maximum ratio declines as GDP increases. This is for a

straightforward, yet illuminating reason. At low levels of GOP, the marginal

productivity of capital is very high and the investment incentives are

consequently strong. The returns to borrowing abroad are large, as are the

costs of debt repudiation (which would freeze out new borrowing to finance

further increases in K). As the capital stock deepens, the incremental returns

to investment fall, and the costs of debt repudiation as a fraction of GOP are

reduced pan passu. Thus, a capital—poor country will be allowed a wide

latitude in foreign borrowing, while a capital—abundant economy will be much

more restricted (as a proportion of GDP). The allowable debt rises as GOP rises

but less than proportionately.

     As shown in Figures 3 and 4, this feature of the h( )   function   has

important implications for the growth path and for foreign borrowing. As in the

linear model, growth and foreign borrowing start out high and then fall sharply

as the debt constraint is hit (in this case as of period 2). Figure 3 shows the

GDP growth rate and the current account deficit as a percentage of GOP.

Figure 4 shows the actual and maximum debt/GOP ratios for periods 1 through 15.

In each period, the maximum rate is calculated as h(Kt)/GDPt where Kt is the

level of Kt on the equilibrium growth path. In the first period, actual

as shown. Note that the Debt/GOP ratio jumps sharply between periods 1 and 2,

and then declines over, as the country becomes wealthier (i.e. as the capital

stock deepens). The decline reflects the already observed fact that

h(Kt)/GOPt is a declining function of Kt.

5.   Alternative Lendinn StrateQies

     In this section we return to the linear version of the model in order to

examine lending and repayment strategies which differ from the market

equilibrium described above. In the first subsection, we assume that the

lenders and the borrower can act cooperatively to decide upon a path of future

debt, consumption and investment, subject only to the zero profit condition in

(3) and to the condition that the country keep its sovereign right to repudiate

the debt at any time and to suffer the penalty thereafter.              (If the country can

also credibly promise never to repudiate, it reaches the equilibrium of

Proposition 1.) Is there any contractual scheme between the lenders and the

borrowers that can dominate the market equilibrium and still keep the country

from defaulting? The answer is no, as we show in the proof of Proposition 3.

     In the second subsection, we analyze a repayment scheme which has been

suggested by some analysts. We have seen that when              =           in stage 2 of the
                                                                    h*Kt,
market equilibrium, the country repays every period a fixed fraction e of GOP,

as in (32). What if the lenders simply demand that RPt =                    rather than
                                                                     eQ.
sticking to the rule    =             It turns out that when the borrower expects to
                            h*Kt?
face the rule RPt =     rather      than the rule   =
                                                        h*Kt,       the incentives for

growth are changed, in a way that undermines this alternative lending rule.


a.   Contractual Agreements Between the Lenders and the Borrower

     In this subsection, we assume that the borrowing country and its lenders

can design a path of future debt, investment and consumption such that:

(i) the loan satisfies the zero—profit conditon (30); and (ii) the country

never finds it profitable to repudiate its debt. The path is set once and for
                                         —23—


all at t =   0.   Surprisingly, such a contractual arrangement cannot dominate the

market equilibrium:


       Proposition 3: The market equilibrium yields the optimal pattern of

       growth that a country can reach, subject to the constraint that it never

       prefers to default.


The proposition says, among other things, that there is no way to avoid the

slowdown of growth described in Proposition 2. This slowdown is an inherent

implication of the option of repudiation; there is no way that the country can

credibly promise to grow at 9* forever.

       To prove Proposition 3, we first define the new utility function Q which

would be attained if the country can design in advance its path of consumption

and investment subject to (3) and the constraint that it never prefer to

default.


(33)        Q[001K0] =     max
                                 y10t
                                   —  log C

            subject   to

(34)       rt_5) log C V0(K5)
            and subject to (2), (4), (13), (30).

           transversality condition (16).


Note that (34) guarantees that the country will never choose to repudiate the

debt. A priori, Q does not coincide with the utility V achieved in the market

equilibrium. V was defined as the fixed point of problem (25). Q is defined
                                        —24—


directly by an optimizing problem. They in fact are equal, as we show in

Appendix 4. the crux of the argument is to show that inequality (34) can be

written O.,   h*K, as -in the market equilibrium case.


b.   Repayment of a Fixed Fraction of the Revenues Each Period

     Let us assume that the country has already entered stage 2 of its pattern

of growth. Each period, it repays a fixed fraction of its revenues to the

lenders in order to equalize the growth of debt and the growth of GOP. These

repayments can be written RPt =
                                  ((r_n)h*/a]Q,   with n =   21*   -   d, where
xM is the investment rate in Stage 2.
                                                                                        -

     Now, let us assume that the lenders ask to be repaid some fraction é          of
GOP, instead of sticking to the original rule of lending 0             h*K. B may or may

not equal (r_n)h*/a. We prove the following:

     Proposition 4: When a country has reached the stage 2 of its pattern of

     growth, the lenders cannot get repayment of their loans by abandoning the

     rule      h*K and by asking instead to be repaid a fixed fraction of the

     country's GDP each period. By doing so, they would either induce the

     country to default, or they would get repayment of only a portion of the

     outstanding debt (i.e. the zero profit condition in (3) would not hold).



     The proposition stresses the importance to the creditors of stating

correctly the rule governing their lending. In the market equilibrium, the

lenders are ready to increase their exposure at the rate of GDP growth. By

doing so, they create an incentive for the country to grow. Any slight
                                                            -25-


modification of the rule which reduces this incentive to grow yields a

sub-optimal result. A repayment scheme as in Proposition 4 creates an incentive

that is adverse to growth, since debt repayments are made an increasing function

of the output of the economy.

       To prove Proposition 4, assume that the country is asked to repay a fixed

fraction ö   of     its GDP. It will select an optimal rate of growth by

solving:


(35)              = Max log[a(1-ë) -             x(1   +    +x/2)]/(1-$)          +


                  + log     K0/(1—p)


       (see equation (A1.8) where aO is substituted for X)


Let Xe be the solution to (36). We can compute the value of this repayment

stream by noting that RP+. =                                =               =                    Thus, the

discounted value of repayments, which we denote by P is given as:


                                             =
(36)        Pt =     =1P1(1÷r)1                  [aKte(1.ir)]/[r+d_xe]

       Now, suppose Ô        is    selected so that                    =
                                                                           (1fr)D7    i.e. so that the debt is

repaid in present value terms. Call the selected value 8. Since                                      =
                                                                                                         h*Kt by
assumption, we must have                 =                            Thus, from (36) we must have the
                                             h*(1+r)K.
equality h* =       ae/[r   + d     -
                                        xi]. From          (35) we then see that:


(37)            =    log[a    -
                                  h*(r+d_x)
                                                  -
                                                       x(1+$x/2)]J(1-$)
                +                                      +        log
                    $[log(1+x-d)]/(1-$)2                               Kt/(1_$)


Now, we prove that                c V0. as asserted in Proposition 4. That is: we prove
                                                     —26-


that the country would default if required to pay B GDP, for e high enough to

yield      =                    By definition of xh* and h* (at which the country is at
                (1fl')Dt.
autarky utility in the market equilibrium), we can use (37) to write


(38)           V° =     log[a   -
                                    h*(r+d_2*)   —

                                 h*        2
                    +   $[log(1+x -d)]/(1—$) + log          KtI(1_$)


Note that the RHS of (38) is the same as the RHS of (37) but with               replacing
               h*
x. But x maximizes the RHS of (37) for given h*, so it must be 0V >
                                                                                  V.      If

the creditors are to be repaid, the borrower is driven below the autarky level.




6.     Conclusion

       We have constructed a model with endogenous growth and endogenous credit

ceilings. We have shown that the equilibrium path for the country is one with

initially rapid growth followed by a permanent slowdown. The equilibrium

strategy of the lenders makes the growth of debt contingent on the growth of the

borrowing country. In the linear version of our model, under the equilibrium

lending rule, the evolution of the debt follows two stages, a first stage in

which debt grows faster than the economy, and a second stage where both the

economy and the debt grow more slowly, and at the same rate. Along this path,

the interest due, rD, is never repaid in full; only an amount equal to the

difference between the interest due and g*D (the growth rate times the debt)

should be repaid. This permanent refinancing of part of the interest is the

only way to reach the optimum pattern of growth consistent with no default by

                                  Optimal Growth Under Autarky



The optimal growth problem under autarky is:

(A1.1)     V(Ko) = max      70tlog(c)
           such that

                  =           +
                      K(1d)
           aK =         +      + (I2)UtIKt)];          given
To solve this problem, we define c =                               Note that
                                             C/K,      x =
Kt+i =   Kt(lt)i        so that K =
                                       K0fl(1-d+x.),     and log K =

log K0 ÷ log(1-d+x.). Since c = Ct/Kt. log C = log                 Ct + log Kt•

Hence,    fitlog(C) =       ' log     Ct + 7°   t.1og K =    tlog c + );$tlog     +

                             After a bit of manipulation, 70     $t[rilog(1_d+x)]     can be

rewritten as 0[pt+l/(1_)]lOg(1_d+x). Thus, the original problem (A1.1) can

be rewritten as:


(A1.2)    VA(K0) = max 70 $t{log c + log K + [$/(1_$)]log(i_d÷x)}

          such that
          a =
                c     + x1 + (41/2)xtJ


Note that we have solved out for Kt in the objective function, so we no longer

need to include Kt+i =
                            Kt(1_d+xt) among the constraints. Now there are no
longer any real dynamic constraints in the problem, so that we need only to

maximize{log c + ($/(1—$)]log(1-di-x)J each period, subject to a = c. +

x(1+$x/2). This maximization leads to a fixed A and xA (i.e. optimal c and

x under autarky) for all t, with xA given by the largest root of
                                                            -28-


(A1.3)      (1-$)(1+$x)(1-d+x) -                a     +   $x(1+4ix/2) = 0.

   is then given as:


(A1.4)         = a —    xA[l    +




Note that since c' and                  are invariant to I(, we have from (A1.2) that

VA(xK0) -   I(K0)   =   r $tlog(XK)                   -
                                                          $log       K0 =    log X/(1—$). Thus,


(A1.5)      VA(XK0) = V°(K0) +             log       X/(1-$)

     By substitution of (A1.4) into (A1.2), we find the explicit

solution for


(A1.6)      V(K0) =     r $t{log[a               —
                                                      xA(l+$xA/2]    +   log K0 + [$/(1_$)]log(1_d+xA)}

                    =   log[a       -
                                        xA(l+$xA,z)I,(l_s)           +   log(1—d+i)/(1R)2            +   log   K0/(1-$)


     The-solution for the default utility V0(K0) is the same as for VA(K0) except

that a(1—X) replaces a in the equation for the growth rate (A1.3). That is,

   is the largest root of the equation


(Al.?)      (1—)(1+$x)(1—d+x) —                 a(l—X)       +   x(l+4x/2)       =   C




Then, as in (Al.6), we may write:


(A1.8)      VD(K0) =    log[a(1-X)          -
                                                 x0(1+x0/2)]/(l-)            +           log(l-d+x0)/(l-)2
                    +   log K0/(1-)

It is easy to show that x0 c xtk, and V0(K0) <.VA(K3).

        The planner solves:

If one calls        the Lagrange multiplier associated with (A6), one finds

and

(A2.8)      q1(1+r) = q(l—d)               + a +



      The optimal path is obtained by selecting the unique value of q0 which

satisfies the transversality condition. Here, q0 is such that all             will stay

constant, so that x is also a constant, x*, which solves

The solution, x, which we look for is the smaller root of (A9) (the other

solution can be ruled out by the second-order conditions of the optimization

problem). The solution is shown in equation (8) in the text. We let 1 +                                         g*

(A2.1D)           Kt =    K0(1÷g*)t

The productive wealth of the country is now defined by

                     = Ea -


Net wealth (subtracting foreign debt 0) is defined by NWt:

                                 —
(A2.11)           NWt =      W           (1+r)O

At initial time,                     =   0,   so that NW0 and W0 coincide.

         The law of motion of the debt is given by

(A2.12)                  =
                             (1+r)D           +     - [a      —

Since C =                            =                  -                 we have

Now, define dt =                              Note that                   =                   =

by dividing both sides of (A13) by Kt we can write:

        We   begin with d0 =       0.   The country becomes and remains a net debtor as long

as (1÷r) c (1+g*). This condition, which we assume, is more likely to hold

when: the world interest rate r is low; the future is heavily discounted
                                                                                      (
small); investment is highly productive (a large); and the adjustment costs in

investment, •,       are      small.

        By solving (A2.14), starting from d0 = 0, we find:

Note that as t-., dt asymptotically approaches d =                [a
When dt =     d, we have (1+r) = 1.          Thus, consumption over GOP asymptotically

approaches zero.

     Consider the following optimization problem:

such that

             with         hK0 and D01K0 given


Define the following variables:




                E
                    I/K
Then, the problem in (A3.1) can be rewritten as;


(A3.2)                    = max
                                      =otl09          c       +   Y t3log K
such that;

             (i_d+x)dt+j = (1+r)rJ            +   c       +          +          -a

             with d01K0 given, and d0 C h

Using the same method as in Appendix 1, (A3.2) may be rewritten again as:


(A3.3)       vh(K0,00) = max     g0tiog c + (log                 K0)/(1-$)

                         +   YX[pt+l/(1_$)]log(1_d+x)
such that;

             (1_d+x)dt+i =       (1+r)d    +
                                               c x[l (/2)x]
                                                   +         +               —    a


             dt+j c h


Note that we no longer need the equation of motion for K, since Mt is no longer

part of the objective function.

       The optimal policy for                  in (A3.3) is clearly independent of K,.,, for a

given d0 (= D0/K0), since the objective function is additively separable in K0,

and the dynamic constraints do not depend on K0. Thus, Vh(AKQ,AD0) - v1'(K01D0)

= (log   AK0)/(1-) - (log K0)/(1—fl = log A/(1-$).

       Rearranging, we have



(A3.4)       vh(xK0,Ao0) = Vh(K0,D0) +           log   A/(1-gS)



as asserted in Lemma 1.

       Now, choose A =               so that we find V1'(1,D0/K0) =                           -
                             1/K0,                                               vt'(K0100)
(log   K0)/(1-). Since we already know from Appendix 1 that VD(K0) = V0(1)                        +


                 we see that


(A3.5)       V'(K0100) () VD(K0)
                                         if and only if
                                                                 vh(1,D0,K0) () V0(1)
                                                                —34-


       It is easy to show that V is strictly decreasing in its second argument

(more debt is strictly worse than less debt). Thus there is at most one value

h =         (   h such that vh(l,h) =                  vD(l),      and if such h exists, then

v'(1,o0/K0) () V0(1) as b0/K0 ()
                                 h.                              From (A3.5), the same h is such that

v'(K0,D0) ()        V(K)     as D0 () hK0.
       Now, suppose we find an h* such that Vh*(l,h*) =                            V0(1).    Then, Vh*(K0100)
 >     D                                  h*           0
() V (K0) as D () h*K0.                  V     ,   V       ,   and h* then constitute an equilibrium

of the capital market, as defined by (24) in the text with                                   =


We now derive the equilibrium h*.

To these first-order conditions we add the budget constraint from (A3.6):

        (d) (1—d+xt)dt+i =              (1+r)d        +
                                                           c          +          + +xtJ2]       —    a

Solutions to (a) through (d) are given by Constant values of c, X, x, and ji,

with    dt = h for all C Using (a), (b), and (d) we find the optimal

capital is a constant along the optimal path. We now plug c and                                                back into

the utility function in (A3.6) to get:


(A3.1O)       vh(l,h) =   r flth ÷ y0[t+l/(l_$)]lOg(l_d÷xh)
or'



(A3.11)       V'(l,h) =   log[(xhr_d)h           +       a    -
                                                                  xh(l        +   xh/2)]/(j_ft)      +


                          log(1_d+xh)

The last equation is found by substituting (A3.1O) into (A3.11). Note that

d[V'(1,h)]/dh =      Vu/ah        +   (aVh/axh)axh/ah                =   aVh/ah. where the last inequality
follows from the envelope theorem (i.e. from the fact that with an optimal

choice of x, av"tax =         0).      Thus, sign(dV'/dh) =                           sign(xh_r_d)       c 0, so
         h
that             .
        V (1,h) is strictly decreasing in h.

        Now, it is easy to prove that there exists a unique h* such that

VI*(l,h*) =    V0(j).     First, V0(1,O) =               VA(j),              since h = 0 implies no borrowing

at all. But VA(l) >          VD(l),     so that v1'(l,h) >                    VD(l)      for h =   0.     Now, consider

             w!ere d is the limit of D/Kt in the no—repudiation case of Appendix I

Since c equals zero in the limit in that case, Vd(l,d) =                                      - c V(l).        Thus,
since V0(1,0) >      V°(i)    >   vd(l,a),   and since vh(l,h) is strictly decreasing in h,
                                                         -
there must exist an h* between U and d, such that V (1,h*) = V (1).
                                                                                       h*
                                                                                                                   In

particular h* is the unique root of the equation:


(A3.12)      log{(xh_r_d)h + a -          xh[l       +   (t/2)xhj}                +


              log(ld+xh)     =     log tad-A) -              x°[i        +                  + [(1-)jlog(1-d+x0)
where        is the positive root of (A3.B) and x0 is the positive root of (A1.7).

       We can readily establish various properties of h*. By total

differentiation of (43.12), we have:


(43.13)   dh*/da =         — 1(1—X))/[2(r+d—x')]            >    0

          dh/dA =                              > 0

          dh*/d =
                     1og[(1_d+xh)/(ld+xd)]/[(l)22(r÷d_xh)]                    0

          dh*/dr =                         C   0

where

             =   [a(1-X)   —
                               xd(l+A/2)]_l          >


             = ((xh_r_d)h      + a -   xh(l+xh/2))_l        >    0


Finally, let us show that


(#3.14)   h < 1 +


This inequality can be derived directly from equation (#3.8). Another way is

as follows. Equation (#3.8) can be derived from

(#3.15)   Maximize vh(l,h)



(43.15) says that x1 maximizes the utility which is reached when the constraint

on the debt is binding. The first order condition (using the definition of

in equation (43.11)) yields:

(#3.16)   (1+4x-h)(1+x—d)(1—) = $[h(x—r-d)               + a —   x(1+4x/2)]

The RHS is positive (it measures consumption per unit of capital). Therefore,

(1+$x—h)(1+x—d)(1—$) is positive, so that (#3.14) follows. (A3.16), when

developed, yields (#3.8).

b.     Two—staged Growth

       Now that we have characterized the lending strategy by Dt ( h*Kt, we can

describe explicitly the optimal pattern of growth. From equations (A3.7), we

can write


(A3.17)     (1+$x1)(i+r) = (a        +
                                         qx/2    +
                                                      (1_d)(1+$x)][1_71]       +
                                                                                       dt(1+r)71
with        =
                utI(Xt_i(1+xt_i_dfl

when the constraint Dt ( hKt is not binding, the shadow price T_1 is zero, so

that the dynamics of the system can simply be written


(A3.18)     (1+$x_p(1+r) = (a +          •x/2    +
                                                      (1_d)(1+$x)]

Let us call I the time when the constraint on the debt is first binding (i.e.

the first period for which Dt =                      For t   T-2, we have          =   0, while for
                                         hxt).
t ) 1—1,        >   0.   After time T, the value of           will be constantly held to Xh.

All that we need in order to find the entire sequence {x} is the value x1_1 and

to define the sequence {xt}t<T_2 by backward application to equation (43.18).

       At time T—1, equation (A3.17) can be written


(A3.19)     (l+x12)(l÷r) = (a        +
                                         4x/2    +
                                                      (i+$xh)(l_d)](l_TTi]     +
                                                                                    hy1 1(i+r)

(Note that we have substituted Xh =                     In order to find the equilibrium value
                                             xT.)
of XTI and TI_i, we need only to consider one more equation in                               and VT_i.

From the system (A3.7), we can derive:


            (ch(l)'Il)]/r(1+r)) = h          -                +                        —
(A3.20)
                                                 [(1÷r)d1_1       xT1(i+$xTI)              a]/[i+x_1_d]

Equation (A3.20) can be shown to be as H1_1 in diagram 1.                   It is an upward

sloping line for the values of x1_1 which are above h. When dt_i = h, equation
                                                        —39—


 (43.20) is a modified version of the current account equation when the constraint

on the debt is binding; the line                         would pass through (xh,yh), with Th the

stationary state value of               when the constraint is binding. One can also check

that a lower value of dti yields a higher value of

        The system (43.19), (43.20) defines the equilibrium value of
                                                                                     (xT_IPYT1).
Here, we shall prove that (43.19) defines a downward sloping line as depicted by

rT_l in diagram 1. To see this, one need only to check that


(43.21)      h(1+r) <       (l_d)(l+$xh)      +   a +
                                                        $x.
We    already know that


(43.22)      h <   1   +


so that we only need check that

             (l+r)(l+$xh) <       (l_d)(l+$xh)          + a +


or,    equivalently, that


(43.23)                —
                           (r+d)4xh   + a —   r   — d      0


To see this, it is enough to write equation (43.17) when t = T+1.                     Both values

      and XT+l are equal to the stationary state value h. Since h < 1                   +

equation    (43.17) can be rewritten to yield the inequality in (43.23).

       We can now represent equation (43.19) as a downward sloping line such as

        in diagram 1.        Its intersection with HT_l defines the equilibrium value of

                   Since HT_l is below Hh (defined by dt_i =             h),   this shows that

       is greater than

       We can now depict, in diagram 2, the full dynamics of the system. First,

note that equation (43.18) shows that                     is lower than x*, the optimal rate of
                                        -40-


capital accumulation (see diagram 3). Second, note that                is below x* (from

equation (A3.19)), and equation (A3.21):         (1+x._1)(1÷r) c a +         +
             <a   ÷       +   (1++x*)(i_h)   =   (1+x*)(1+r);   SO   that        <   x*.
XTI takes therefore some intermediate value between           and x* and the dynamics
are as in the diagram.

                                       Proof of Proposition 3



         Let us prove that Q coincides with V in 5 steps.


 Step I

         First, we show:


 (A4.1)       Q(xc0,x}c0) =                  +   log   A/(1-fl.
                                  Q(001K0)

 The argument is as in Appendix 3.
                                                  If (C,Ij is an optimal solution to

 Q(D0,K0), {xc1xIJ is an optimal solution to
                                                                  Q(AD01AK0).

Step 2

         In the constraint (34), we can write (O5,K) in place of
                                                                                                log c
The proof uses a standard argument of dynamic programming. If the RHS did not

coincide with U (which is the maximum one can reach at time s), then one could

increase Q(00,K0) by changing (C..,I}> to the solution {cI!>, which

maximizes Q(DiK5). Clearly this change would not violate inequality (34).
Thus, (33) can be rewritten as:


(A4.2)       Q[O 0,K0] =      max
                                  -

Step 3

     There exists an hQ such that                            V0(K} <=> 0
                                              Q(D01K0)                          hK0. The argument
is as in Appendix 3 when (A4.1) is acknowledged.
