        Housing Behavior and the Experimental Housing Allowance Program:

                              What Have We Learned?



                                    ABSTRACT



     The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the Experimental Housing

Allowance Program (EHAP). My focus is on what the experimental data have

taught us that could not have been learned from more traditional sources

of information. I review the major problems that confronted investigators

using non—experimental data, and for each problem discuss whether or not

it was mitigated by the availability of EHAP   data.   I conclude that if

the goal was to obtain improved estimates of the behavioral response to

housing allowances, a social experiment was not necessary.

I.      Introduction


        In   the United   States   and nanv other   countries, attempts have   been

made to augment the rea] incomes of the poor by increasing their               con-

sumption of housing. Such schemes have taken a number of             forms;    for
examole, provision of public housing, construction subsidies, etc. It
has been suggested that a better method would be to give poor people

financial allowances which could be used to upgrade their housing stand-

ards. The success of such a program would depend upon the answers to

several questions. Two of the most important are: Would low income

families respond to financial incentives to increase their housing con-

sumption? To the extent they do, would housing prices simply be driven

up, resulting in windfall gains for landlords?

        To obtain answers to these important questions, in 1970 the Depart-

ment of Housing and Urban Development authorized a social excerimont,

The Experimental Housing Allowance Program (EHAP). The first part of

EHAP, the "demand experiment" was designed to predict households' re-

sponses to housing allowances. In this experiment members of a random

sample of low income households were granted housing allowances and.

their   behavior compared to a control group without allowances. The
second   part, the "supply experiment" was designed to examine markot ef-

fects of ucusing allowances. All low income families in two communities

were eligible to receive allowances, and. the response of the overall

level of prices in each community was carefully monitored. (The pro-

cisc provisions of the programs are discussed in greater detail below.)

 economists. The 9urpose of this paper is to discuss what ncw insights
 EllA? has provided concerig proktble responses to various typc-s of
 housing    allowances.     Sttcificafly, I intend to focus on what experinental
 data   have taught us about these responses that could not have been learned
 from more traditional sources. This is admittedly a narrow                   , bccause
 E}IAP produced a number of "... serendipitous findings that had nothing to
 do with the research objectives used to justify them"         (Aaron,   1979, p.43).
 For   example, much of value appears to have been learned concerning effic-

 ient techniques for administering welfare programs. Nevertheless, the

prediction     of behavioral responses lies at the heat of EHAP, and it is
fundamentally on the basis of new knowledge about them that the experi-
ment must be judged.
       The existence of numerous studies which      have used conventional data
to   answer questions similar to those studied in EHAP       suggests    a natural
way to organize this paper. I will review
                                          the major problems that con-
fronted previous investigators, and for each problem discuss whether or

not it has been mitigated by the
                                        availability of experimental data. I
should emphasize      that it is   not icy intention to suggest that   the   EHAP in-
vestigators    were   unaware of the fact that for some problems, experimental

observations offer no particular advantage. Rather, their work has shown
keen s.ansitivity to thQ liaitations of their data.

II. The Demand_Experiment


        The   main purpose of the dcmanJ cxpernents was to              obtain   odicLi•:ns

of households' resnonses to various types of housing allowances. I begin
this section by describinc the exS:eriment' s structure. This is followed
by a    discussion of problems that users of conventional data hove faced

in analyzing housing behavior, and the extent to which experimental data

alleviate these problems.


                                                             2
        A.    DescriptIon of the Demand Experiment

        In the demand experiment, a set of randomly selected low income

households received allowances, while mcmbers of a control group did not.

There were two basic types of allowances. Under the first, the payment

received was the difference between the cost of 'adequate"housing estab—

lished for the program (C) and some fraction b of household income3

(Y)



  (1)                              M =   C —   bY


where M is the size of the payment.                  (   C   was determined by a panel of

housing experts, which considered both household size and the site in

making its decision.) Equation (1) is referred to as the "housing gap


formula." Under the second scheme, known as the "percent of rent

formula," the payment was some fraction ()                       of the gross rent )

paid    by the family:


                                         M =   CiR
          Essentia].lv, the demand experiment consisted of confronting dif—

     ferent fonilies with varici;   ]us of        ,   b   ,          C   , and then com-
 paring their    housing decisions to those of the            control oroup.      In
 addition, some of te nousing gap nousenolas were tolo that their apart-
 ments      had to satisfy certain minimui standards before they               would be
 eligible for payment. For example, plumbing and kitchen facilities

 had to meet certain specifications; roofs, ceilings and walls had to

 be in good repair, etc.      (Friedman and Weinberg 1978, p. A-3l

         In practica,value3 for b of 0.15, 0.25, and 0.35 were employed;

 the parameter o. took on values that started at 0.2 and were increment-

 ed by 0.1 until they reached 0.6.      C varied between 20% below and 20%

 above the levels set by the experts. The experiment was conducted for

 three years beginning in 1973 at two sites, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
                                                                                  4
and Phoenix, Arizona. At each site about one thousand low income

 families participated in the experiment, somewhat under half of which

were included in the control group. Only renters were eligible.




B.      Problems in Predicting the Demand Pesponse to Housing Allowances

        Presumably, by appropriately comparing the responses of the control

and treatment groups, one can infer the impact of the various types of

allowances upon h'using behavIor. However, suppose for the moment that

experimental    data were not available, and an       investigator were asked to

predict    the. effect thot allowances would hove     upon }ousing behnv4or.
                                         —3




 fast likely the investigator would begin by noting that the
                                                           houcig gap
 formula is ese'ntiaily an ncrease in ricome, and the ercent ci rent
 formula Inpresents a chance in the price of housing services from some
price P to (l—n)P .         Therefore
                                given income and price elasticities of
housing demand, one can uredict an individual's response to the housing
allowances.0     These considerations suggest the following strategy: employ

multiple regression techniques (or some variant thereof) to estimate the
demand for housing    services,     employing either cross-sectional or time

series data. This yields a set of the relevant elasticities. Then, as—

suisincj that people would react to the price and income
                                                                   differences gener-
ated by a housing allowance program in the same way as those generated

"naturally," use the elasticities to estimate the program's

impact on housing demand.

      I now discuss some problems that face the investigator who wants

to implement this strategy, and whether or not the problems are eliminat-

ed when experimental data are available.




 1.      Specification of a Model


         Users of conventional data typically begin by specifying a model

 that relates the quantity of housing services demanded for the 1th ob-

 servation (Q)      , to   some function f(S) of price           (P.) ,   income   (Y.)

 and a 'ector of demographic variables Z              that   theoretical considera-

 tions   suggest might be re evant:

 (3                             1
                                    =   f(P.,Y.,Z.)
                                           1  1  1
                                             —6-



 In Some cases      f ()    is   slecified in an ad hoc but      convenient form such
 as   log-linear (e.g., Polinaky and Eliwood 11979] , Rosen
                                                            f1979bJ ,          while
 other times it is derive2 from maximization of
                                                             an explicit utility func-
 tion     (Abbott and Ashenfelter [1976])

           Equation (3) is deterministic, so the next step is to assume that

 even observations with identical right hand side variables may have dif-

 ferent           because of random errors. Usually, an error term is ap-

 pended additively.        (For an exception see King [1980).)        Now, given a
 set of observations on Q.         '     '        and    Z. and the stochastic speci-

 fication, the model's parameters can be estimated using a variety of

 econometric techniques. The parameter estirriates can then be used to

compute behavioral elasticities;6 indeed, in the case of log linear

demand curves, the parameter values themselves are the elasticit15

      There are several major drawbacks with this standard procedure.

First, economic theory puts very few constraints on the form of              f(•)

so the investigator must make an essentially ad hoc choice with respect

to the specification of either the demand or utility function. Second,

it must be assumed that f() is identical across individuals.7 (When

time series data are used, the analogous assumption is that f() does

not change over time.) Finally, and perhaps most crucially, it              must be
assumed that the fit(ed relationship will continue to
                                                      apply when a right
hand side variable for a given observation changes, For example, if the

investigator finds that                  is less than one, it does not imply that

increasing a    particular   family' s   incomepercent will increase its
                                                   ten

housing   consumption by a smaller percentage. All that one has really
learned   is that in the data, poorer families
                                                devoUe a larger frt on              of
 their income to housing than richer families, ceteris oaribus. Only by
 assumt that poor families would act lika the richer ones if their in--
 comes were increased, and vice versa,    can one give any behavioral signi--
 ficance    to elasticity estimates from regressions.

         In contrast, the situation facing the investigator with experimental

 data   appears   simple. There is no need to specify f()   ,   or   to make pos-

 sibly invalid behavioral assumptions. As Hausman and Wise [1981]        note,

 provided that the experiment is designed properly, all that is necessary

 is to compare the behavior of individuals in different treatment groups

with each other, and with the control group. Indeed, EHAP investigators

 Friedman and Weinberg [1978] do exactly this. In a series of tables

 they exhibit information on housing expenditures for both the experi-

 mental and control groups at the time of enrollment and at two years

 after enrollment.
                       cSee, for example, pages 8, 13, 14, A—54, A—55.)

 Interestingly, however, only a small portion of Friedman and Weinberg's

 lengthy (and excellent)9 report on the demand experiment is devoted to

discussion of such results. Most of the document concerns the specifi-

cation of models like (3), and their estimation with data from the ex-

periment. But as Hanush-ek and Quiyley 11979h] observe,such 'reoression

estimates ... do not arise from experimental payments of
                                                         income, but
rather from the 'natural' experiment
                                         arising because 'otherwise identi-
cal' households of (e.g.] varying income are observed to have made dif-

ferent   choices" (p. 20). ln short, the experimental nature of the data
is ignored, so that all the model spccificatjon problems associated with
converitiona] data must be confronted.

        Why is this the case? The main rcason, I think, is the possibility

 that sco of the key pararote-s    the t onvern   hou-ing 1:--:avior dcoJ opon

 variables that can change over time. For example,        tiere   is   cooc evidence
 that   the price elasticity o denanl for housing is a function of income
 (Rosen 11979aJ). Thus, to the extent the economic environment changes,

 the value of simple comparisons between control and experimental groups

 will be diminished.10 In contrast, a properly estimated structural model

 would allow an investigator to deal with such a situation.

        Additional reasons are provided by Stafford's (1981] discussion of

the general circumstances under which experiment-i results are likely to

be more useful than those from structural models.       First, there must he

reasonable certainty that the programs examined in the expericnt are

the ones which will eventually be considered by policy makers. This is

because by its nature, an experiment can generate information only about

the specific treatments being examined (or interpolations between          them).
Second,   there must be some agreement on the relevant time horizon.         Other-

wise the experiment may not be long enough for one to observe all its ef-

fects upon the population.

     The application of Stafford's criteria suggests that in the case of

housing allowances, a structural approach is required. A multitude of

housing programs have been considored in the past (see Aaron [1972])

there is no reason to believe that society has settled into a consensus

on the particular programs and parameters studied in EHAP.        Furthermore,
 'Ising decisions are evidently made by   families   within a long run frame—

  f-k, hut the irecise amount of time required is not known. As noted in
                                         —9—




Section 5,     below,   the problem of        lag lengths is not caav in
                                         estimating

structural models, hut at least sortie interesting results have been oh—
tamed.

          For all these reasons, it   is   almost inevitable tnat Fried-ran   and

Weinberg, as well as other investIgators using the experimental data,11

eventually turn to models of the kind used in the analysis of conventional

data. Of course, it may be the case that there are other features of ex-

perimental data that make them especially useful, an issue to be discussed

below. But in an area like housing, they do not relieve
                                                                  investigators
of the burden of constructing theoretical and statistical models.




2.        Definition   of Holsing Services


          Given that analyses of both experimental and conventional data re-

quire the construction of models, the important question becomes wnether

or not the experirrertal data better facilitate their i.mplementation. Con-

sider, for example, the problem of making operational the left hand side

variable of the equation, "housing services." Housing is intrinsically

a multidimensional commodity -- a dwelling is characterized by its number

of   rooms, their size, the quality of construction and plumbing, etc. It

is therefore very difficult to summarize in a single number the          quanti--
ty   of   housing services generated by a given dwelling.       Usually t
is   assumed that the amount of housing services 5 proportional to the
rent paid, or, in the case of an owner—occupied dwelling, to the value
of the house. (See, e.g., Polinsky and Ellwood [l979]. The
                                                             difficulty
                                         - 10   —




 here is that the rental value of a dwclling at a given time may reflect

 characceristics of the market that have nothing to do with the euar.tity

 of housing services actually generated. As King [1980] points out, for

 example, the special income tax treatment of rental income will general-

 ly influence market values.

        An alternative tack would he to abandon the possibility of sunanar-

 .izing housing services i.i a single variable, and instead to estimate a

 series of demand functions for various housing attributes. An ianiediate

problem is the absence of observable market prices for attributes.
                                                                          Recently,
Witte, et. al [1979] have implemented, the suggestion of Rosen [1974] that attri-

bute demand equations be estimated in a two step process: (1) estimate the implicit

attributeprices from an hedonic price equatiorJ2 for housing, and (2)

use these prices as explanatory variables in regressions with attribute

quantities as the dependent variables. However, Brown and Rosen [1980]

have shown that major statistical pitfalls are present in this procedure,

and that the validity of Witte, etal's results is therefore in question.

Although some progress is being made in dealing with these problems (see

Quigley [1980]), the approach that continues to predominate is the use of

rent as the single measure of the quantity of housing services.

        Do the EHAP data allow the construction of more meaningful measures

of housing services? The simple answer is no. Friedman and Weinberg

[1978]   ,    for   example, struggle with the problem of measuring housing   ser-
vices    1°   very much the same way as users of non-experimental data    (pp. 92—

94). Similarly, Hanusk anP Quigley's [l979a] analysis of EJIAP data

uses housing expenditures as the dependent variable in the demand equations.

Experimental data do not remove this        important   stumbling b1oc.

  3.     Price of kousing kervices

         Imagine an irLvec ti g tor with     (nonexperimcijta1)     cross—sectional obser-
 vations on a •stup of re tors         all   of whom coma from     a aarticuIr comr-onity.
 If the housing    market jE     competitive, ii:     seems   reasonable to assume that all
 individuals face the     same   price of housing services. However, in the ahoence
 of any    arice variation, it is impossible to estimate the price elasticity of

 demand. investigators with conventional data therefore often ana3yze ohscr-•

 vations across cities. Of course, the problem of measuring inter—city hous-

 ing price variation still remains.               Becausa the price of housing services
is housing expenditures divided by the quantity of housing services, the

above noted difficulties in measuring the latter are bound to create prob-

lems in measuring price. Several possible Solutions are found in the litera-

ture. A popular arproach is to estimate hedonic rice equations for dif-

ferent cities, an usa them as the bases
                                                     for a housing price index. However,
Alexander 11975] has pointed out several problems with this approach. One

of the most important is that the selection of a set of attributes to be

included    in the hedonic price index must be          decided on ad hoc grounds, but
the    substantive implications of the estimates often depend upon the choice
made.

        The user of EHAP data has an advantage in
                                                  dealing with the problem
of measuring price diffcrence:s
                                       across observations. Recall that in a
community the effective price of

 of    the   variance generated in P. by the          C;.   , the   fact that   P

 identical across individuals in the community no longer precludes estima—
 tion of a price         ressonse, P     can   be normalized at an arbitrary        vaiLle

 and    then     (4) used as the price term. This approach is used by Friedman

 and Weinberg      [1978],and Hanuskek and Quigley 11980].
        A    potential problm is the possibility that the before-treatment

price of rental housing may not be constant within a city. Polinsky and

Eliwood [1979, p. 199] show that even if the market is comcetitive, vari-

 ation in land prices s.ithin the community will lead to differences in the
                                  13
price of housing services.             However, Hanuskek and Quigley [1980]

argue convincingly that such differences in P0 are unlikely to be of

much imortance in the EHAP samples.                It seems safe to conclude, then,

that the eoerirnental data confer distinct benefits in estimating the

price elasticity of demand for rental housing.14 Ironically, the price

elasticity per se is unlikely to be of much use in designing a housing

allowance program. A percent of rent formula offers such attractive

opportunities      for mutually beneficial       fraud on the part of landlords

and   renters that is hard to imagine it ever          being implemented.



4.     Shift_Variables


       Consider now the shift (i.e. ,non-price) variables of equation (3)

Standard theoretical considerations suggest that for income, Y , a

permanent rather than annual measure should be              used. Previous investi-

     for h.sve   dealt   with he prohern of computing porrnanot income in
varius ways. Carliner 11.973] and Rosen [1979a] analyzing longitudinal
                                                              ,
                                     — 13 —




data, take an average of several year ' s worth of annual income. Polinsky
and Eliwood      [1979], using Federal Housing Administration (F1i) data, as-

sume   that the FH.A's estimate   of "effective income is    a proxy for Derrna—
nent income. Struyk [1976] uses the fitted value of a roaression of in-
come an a set of personal characteristics as his permanent income measure.
     Turning now to the vector Z of other shift variables, note that
investigators with conventional data have to make arbitrary decisions with
respect to which ones to choose, their measurement, and how they interact

with the other variables. Typical candidates for inclusion are race, sex

of head of household, age, numer of children, etc.

       In an experimental framework, proper randomization removes the need

for specifying the shift variables (Hausman and Wise [1981]). However,

to the extent that structural models are required to obtain useful re—

suits (see Section 13.1 above), users of EHAP data are at no particular

advantage when     it comes to choosing shift variables, and defining them
appropriately. For example, Friedman and Weinberg's permanent income

measure (p. 54) is constructed using the same kind of averaging discus—
            16
sed above. Similarly, their selection of demooraphic variables is made

on an ad hoc basis (p. 81).


5.     Disequilibrium

       Most of the studies using cross—sectional data to examine housing
                                                                                   17
demand iplicit1y or explicitly assume that all agents are in equilibrium.

Were this not the case, then a regression of housing services on price,

income, and demographic variables could not be interoreted as a demand

couation.    On the other hand, analyses of   longitudinal   and time   series
data   often allow for the possibility that at a given point in time, houce—
                                       -- 14   —




hoads   may not be at theIr   long   run equilibrium positions beca;o adjust—
mont    costs make it prohibitively expensive to respond immediately      to

changes in economic environment. It is usually assu:.ed that eu:h a dis--
equilibrium is    eliminated over time as households    move qradualJy   to their

equilibrium    positions18 (e.g., Rosen and Rosen [1980]) .     It   •;wcll—knoe-n

that    such models lack a strong choice-theoretic foundation, but a tract-
able alternative is lacking.
       The equilibrium assumption is just as crucial to the analysis of EHAP

data as to conventional data. Even simple comparisons of the behavior of

the control and treatment groups are less meaningful unless both groups

are observed in equilibrium positions. It is for this reason that Friedman

and Weinberg [1978, p. 71] devote a considerable amount of time to separate

analysis of those households which changed dwelling during the course of

the experiment -- movers are assumed more likely to be in equilibrium than

stayers.     (This, however, creates an important self selection problem which

is discussed in the next section.)

       In addition, Friedman and Weinberg utilize the typical partial adjust-

ment model to study dynamic behavior.10 They find rather rapid adjustments
in housing behavior (p. 125) .       Hanushek and Quigley [1979a] present an in-

novative method to estimate adjustment lags in the EHAP data; but their

technique could just as well have beerL implemented using a convc•ntional

set of longitudinal data. Contrary to Friedman and Weinberg, they find

rather sluggish adjustments: only about one-fifth to one—third of the gap

between desired and actual housing consumption is closcd in each year.

       One aspect of the EHPP makes proper modelling of disequilibria especial-

ly imoortant. 'or some treatment groups, individuals were ineligible for

housing    allowances unless their   housing met certain quality stenderd. (See
                                              -


 Section          II .A, ae3v .) In other words, indiidaj5 wre               coristrainei to con—

 sujne minimum         aoount of certain housinq attributes. To the extcn that any
 of these          constraints   were   binding,   then  functions for otbr

 attributes          of the housing bundle would depend not only on prices of the
 attributes,          but          of the

                                                       the

 is clearly a complicated matter. Unfortunately, given the paucity of
 work on estimating attribute demands in the relatively simole unconstrain-

 ed case (see Section II.B.2 above), one cannot expect that the more compli-

 cated disequilibrium problem will be solved soon. Such work may provide an

 interesting use for EHAP data in the future.



6.      Selectivity Bias


        In recent years econometricians have devoted a substantial amount

of effort to the study of statistical problems that arise when the sample

used in a regression analysis is non—random (see Heckman l979].) It has

been shown that if selection into a sample is non—random, then unless cer-

tain corrective measures are taken, parameter estimates may be inconsistent.

For example, it is common to estimate separate demand ecscations for renters

and homeowners. However, since individuals self—select into their tenure

modes, the sample selection process is not random, and inconsistent coef-

ficients may result.             (Rosen [1979a].) Similarly, if separate          regressions
are estimated for aovcrs and stayers, sample selection bias is a threat.

        As       Friedman a d einbcrg      11979, p.    130] point out, although    a random

sample    of low—income households was offered enrollment in the                 Percent   of
Rent plans, the demand functions were               est. mated     from a ncr—rcnor- schsample;
viz.,        .   .housoholds   that accepted the enrollment offer, were verified to
                                   — 16 —




be   within the income eligibility limit, remained in   the   experiment, and
moved sometime between enrollment and two years after enrollment.' Each
of these criteria introduces the possibility of sample selection bias.
Of course, users of EHAP   data can take advantage of various statistical
techniques   to cietermine whether or not selectivity bias is present, arid

if so, to correct for it (Hausman and Wise £1981]). In experimental data,

then, selectivity bias is not eliminated ——   it merely appears in new forms.
7.    Participation in, and Percection of, the Proaram


      To predict the aggregate response to a housing allowance progra:i,

one needs to know the nurber of eligible families, and the proportion

of those who would choose to participate. Presumably at least rough in-

formation on the first item could be obtained from census or similar

figures on the income distribution. It is hard to imagine how non-experi-

mental data could be used to illuminate the participation issue. Although

some conventional data sets have information on participation rates in

existing welfare procrams (e.g., foodstamps), probably one cannot reliably

infer from them what the patterns of participation in a quite different

program would be.

      A related question concerns individuals' perceptions of the program.

In order to use results from conventional data to predict the effect of

housing allowances, one must first of all assume that people would under-

stand the program. Furthermore, it must be assumed that percent-of—rent and

(unconstrained) housing gap payments are perceived as equivalent to price arid incore

changes,   respectively. Although one can test for rational cerception of
                                           — 17




 the provisions of existing welfare programs (e.g., williams Ii975)
 there is no reason necessarily to expect such results to carry over to
 the housing         allowances case.

        with   respect to both the participation and perceotion cuesticns,
 the experinental data proido interesting insights, but no defn:te con-
 clusions. Clearly, EHAP investigators can observe whether or not indivi-
 duals participate in the experiment, and correlate participation with

 various economic and demograrhic variables. The main problem is that the

 results may be affected by the individuals' knowledge that they are involved

 in an experiment, the "Hawthorne effect." To the extent that people act

 differently when they know that their behavior is being observed as part

 of an experiment, it will confound attempts to predict participation under

 a universal regime An additional difficulty is that participation rates
                                                                     21
 may be affected by the knowledge that the program is only, temporary.

        Friedman arid. Weinberg 11978] attempted direct investigation of the

perception     issue. Fa nilies in the percent of rent experiments were asked
 in   what direction their housing allowances would move if their rent were

 increased by $10. Only about a half understood that their allowance would

 increase. However, when separate demand functions for both those who

 understood and those who did not were estimated, the hypothesis that their

parameters were the same could not be rejected. Friedman and Weinberg

[1979, p. 139] conclude that, even for the people who answered the question

incorrectly,     "
                      ... their   response to the allowance payment can be analyzed

as i they      understocd."
                                     —18--




     A more convincing test ould have henri possible if there wore van--
ation in the pro—treatment rce of housing services. Suppose that the
effective Price P appears in logarithmic form on the right hand side
of the demand equation. 'ote that


                           nP.1 = n(l-a.)
                                       1
                                          + nP 01


where P. is the pre—reatment price and o. is as defined above.
Thus, if 2n(l-c.) an 9nP, are entered           separately into the reqres-

sion, a natural way    to confirm correct perception is to test whether or
not   their   coefficients are equal. Equality would suggest that individuals

perceive      treatment induced changes in price the same way   as   those Tlnaturalivu

induced. The advantage of such a test is that it does not rely on a direct

question addressed to the participants. Unfortunately, as noted in Section

II.B.3 above, in the EHAP samples there is probably not enough variation in

the pre-treatrnent prices to make an attempt to calculate them worthwhile.

       Another way to   examine the perception issue would be to compare param-
eter estimates of structural models generated by data from different programs

in   the experiment (and the control 9roup) .   If selection into the various
groups were random, and if individuals perceive program parameters correctly,
then the underlying behavioral parameters should be about the same. Of course,
to the extent that the particular specification of the structural model in-
fluences the results, they are rendered incbnclusive.

115.         Sienul" Exernc:nt




       In    most analyses of housing demand using both       conventional   cross-
sectional and EPP      data,   it   is   assumed that the yre-treatment crice of
housing      is constant. In effect, each household faces a cerfeotlv slastic
supply      of housino services. From an econometric point of view, this

assumption is justified, because each household is sufficiently small
                                         22
to be regarded as a price taker.              However, sole reliance on such do—

mand estimates to predict the overall behavioral response to housing

allowances is potentially hazardous. If a considarable number of

program participants increase their demand for housing services, then

to the extent the supply of housing services to the community slopes

upward, the pre—treatment price will rise.

       Considerations such as these led, to the so-called Supply Experiment.

In two communities, all individuals who met certain income qualifications

were made eligible for housing allowances. The idea was to see whether

or not the allowances would induce increases in prices or any other impor—

tant disruptions in the housing market

       In this Section I begin by summarizing the provisions of the supply

experiment, and then, as before, discuss whether or not EHAP data provide

substantial     improvement over those from conventional sources,        As might

he   expected, many of the issues that were important on the demand side are
also   present here. Such issues therefore receive only cursory discussion.

        A.   Description of the Supoly_Exnerinon
        The supply experiment began in 1973—74, with a planned duration of
10   years. In the two sites chosen, Green say, Nisconsin and Scuth lend,
Indiana, enrollment in the procrari was open to every eligible nouSenold.
All payments were made according to the "housing gap formula" (ecuation
(1)),   with b , the imolicit tax rate on income, set at 25. In      order    to

qualify for the payments, housing had to meet certain minimum standards.

Unlike the demand experiment, homeowners as well as renters were allowed

to participate. Perhaps the key methodological difference between the de-

mand and supply experiments is that for the latter, there was no control

group.

        After four years of observation at both sites, it became clear that

"The experimental progra:l ... had virtually no effect on housing prices,

either marketwiae or in the market sectors most heavily populated by

program participants' (Earnett and Lowry 11979, p. 1].) There eie two

principal explanations for this phenomenon:      (a) Because the income

elasticity of demand for housing services apparently is quite low     for program
              25
 participants,   (about 0.3 for renters, according to I4ulford [1979,

p. 31]) the housing allowances did not shift the market demand curve

very much, and (b) The demand changes that did take place were spread

ut over time due to adjustment lags. Since both of these phenomena were ob-

served in the demand experiment, some critics [Brookings, 1979] have argued that    the
supply experiment should not have commenced until the demand    results_wera.in.
overthe1ess,    it is useful   to assess the benefits that the availability
                       26
Cf   experimental   data will confer upon future researchers of housing

sur)rly.

       B.   Problems in_Predicting the Su:1y    Response

                        to Housing T-dlcances

1.     Snecfcation of a Model

       Investigators who   wadt   to estimate housing SUiY functio:s geocrel—
ly begin by trying to use economic theory to     specify an estimable model.
A popular approach is to assume some housing production function, estimate

its paramete,and use them to infer the shape of the suoply function'

For example, Ingram and Orun [1977] asme that housing services are a

constant elasticity of substitution (C.E.S.) function of "quality capital"

and "operation inputs" (p. 284). Polinsky and Eliwood (1979] also posit

a C.E.S. production function, but assume that its arguments are land and
capital. Field tundate] uses a transcendental logarithm production func-

tion with three inputs, land, capital and labor. Poterba 11980] eschews

selection of a specific form for the production function, and instead

starts by postulatiric a supply function that is log linear in the price

of   housing, input costs, and credit availability (p. 10).    COf course, duality

considerations suggest that one can work backward from the supply cu:c'.'e to the

-underlying production function.)
       The specification of the underlying technology can sometimes pre-

determine substantive results. For example, since Eliwood and PolinskyIp79]

assume constant returns to scale (p. 201) the iriplied long run scpply

curve of housing services is perfectly elastic, regardless of parameter

estimates?8     Postulating such    a techno].cgy then, guaroritec che result

that   housing allowances will have no effect on the pre—treatment price
                                        — 22   --




  of   housing, at least as long as in:ut   prices      remain unchanged. The in-
  teresting   questions then   become bow high      do prices rise in the short run,
 and how much time is required to reach long run equi1ibriup? These is-
 sues are discussed below in the section on dynamics; they are rtioned
 here to emphasize once again the importance that model specification plays
 in analyses of conventional data.
         The presence of   the supply "experimental' data does not remove the
  necessity   for some kind of modelling,
                                               particularly since there is no
  control group.     Barnett 11979], for example, provides some simple

comparisons of the increase in rents in the test sites relative to those

in other U.S. cities (. 13).
                                   Even such relatively straightforward compari-

sons, however, require an implicit model of the determinants of housing

costs, so that 'other' costs can be Subtracted out to find the 'pure

housing allowance effect. Rydell 11979] constructs a rather involved model

of monopolistic competition in housing markets in order to assess the

market impact of allowances. He simulates the model with experimental

data, but this could have been done just as well with numbers from conven-

tional sources.

2,3     Defi   ning Housnq Services and Their Price

        The problems in defining housing services and tneir price are of
course as central to supply as demand. Those studying the supply c
housing with conventional data have made exactly the same sort of as-
sumptions in constructing teir price and quantity variables; see
Poterba [1980], Ingram and Cron      11977] or Rothenberg 11977]

        In   this regard, the numbers    generated   by the supply experiment arc no

better than conventional data. Indeed, the difficulties associated

with         the multidimensional nature of housing are particularly vexing

here,          because one of HAP's mandates was to find out what combination

of rehabilitation of existing units, construction of new units, and irn—

provement of neighborhocd quality would be induced by houing allowances

(Allen, at. al, [1979, p. 141). To answer this question, one would need

to   quantify these attributes, compute their implicit prices, and then es-

timate supply curves or each. As noted above, researchers have still

not solved completely the problems associated with estimating demand and

supply schedules for characteristics, and nothing about experimental data

per se makes this task any elsier.



4.     Shift Variables


       In a cornpetit3.ve model, the supply of housing services depends not

only upon their orn price, hut upon inpuL prices as well, so thee are

important shift variables. Housing studies using conventional

data face      serious difficulties in   obtaining   operational measures
of   housing input ccst. For example, Poterba [1980] usos the Poeckh

index   of the price of inputs    for a new one family structure to
                                     — 24    —




measure construction costs. Although this is a comonlv used index, it.
is well—known that it is deficient because fixed weights arc used in its
connotation. Inoram and Oran ld17j use the fuel component of the can-
sumei-'s price index to account for the price of all onerating inputs, nut

as Rothenbcrg [1977]   points out,   it is not clear that    this iricko cantures
all the needed information.

       With respect to measuring the prices of housing inputs the experi-

mental data provide no particular advantage. For example, Rydell [1979,

p. 36] must make calculations regarding the costs of components of gross

rent similar to those who use conventional data. It should be noted, however,

that these appear to be some of the most careful computations available.



5,6 Disequilibrium and Dynamic      Issues
       As suggested above, many models of housing supply begin with        a   pro-

duction function which exhibits constant returns to scale in the inputs.

Given this specification, and assuming constant input prices,the long run

supply of housing services is infinitely elastic. Thus, any demand shift

induced by a housing allowance will leave unchanged the long run price of

housing services. Fowever, the question of supply response is still in-

teresting, because the production function does not indicate the length

of   time required to reach long run equilibrium, or the path     of   prices

during the transition. To understand the supply response, t is

crucial to model noth the process of adjustment to the new       equilibrium,
and the presence cf any   factors   which might impede the   market    from achiev-

ing equilibrium.

      Thus, for axample, in one of their models Ingram and Oron 11977, p.

292] assume tba the most a landlord can invest     each   period i     limited to
                                     —25-



the amount of cash generated by the existing investment, even if this is
insufficient to close the qap bet eon the desired and actual :riosing
stock. Poterba 11980] argues that conditions in the credit market may
affect    the supply of housing, and he proxies these by the flow of savings
deposits received by savings and loan associations. Poterba also assumes
a delayed supply response to changes in all right hand side variables,

which are entered in polynomial distributed lags (p. 10).

        The designers of the supply experiment clearly were aware of the

importance   of lags in the housing supply process, as witnessed by the

fact that the experiment was given a ten year duration       (although only
five    years worth of data were collected). Because there was no control

group, however, there are no simple comparisons that one can make in

order to learn how movements toward the final equilihriinrt take place.

My guess is that even if there had been a control group (call it '8outh

Bend Prime"), structural models would still be more useful than experimen-

tal comparisons for determining the lag structure. By the time a decade

had lapsed, it is quite possible that a number of variables whicn in-

fluence adjustment patterns would have changed,so comparisons of south

Ber and "South Bend Prime" would not be      very   informative.



7.      Market Environment

        In the demand experiment it was unnecessary to study market environ—

ment,    since   the key question was how micro units   reacted    to exogenous

changes    in their budget constraints. But to understand ovora.JJ effects,
the question of market structure is crucial —— the       impact of the    housing
allowances   on pre-treatment price clearly will depend mutatis mutandis
                                          — 26 —




upon  the degree o coupetitiveness in the market, the amount
of slack existing when the program is initiated, the extent o:E housing
market     segmentation, etc.

       The standard assumption is that competition prevails. As de Leeuw

arid Struyk [1975] and Poterha [1980] note, however, even given comoetition,

complications arise because two markets have to be equilibrated by the

price of housing services; the market for existing houses and the market

for new construction•                 The situation is even more complicated when

one takes into account the multiplicity of tenure modes. Each type of

housing is traded in its own submarket, and each of these (interre1ated)

markets has a market clearing price. If the housing market is non-competi-

tive, the question of supply effects is even more difficult because of the

absence of a generally accepted theory of price determination. Theoreti-

cally, one can imagine examining a group of cities that are identical ex-

cept for housing market structure, and comparing the results when              they
are   subjected to housing allowances.           (Indeed, something of this   notion
was behind the selection of Green Bay and South Bend as the experimental
sites.)         In practice, such a course would be prohibitively expensive,

even if it were possible to find an appropriate group of cities. Again,

construction of structural models appears to be the more viable methodol-

ogy. For example, using data from the supply experiment, Rydeli [1979]

attempts to explain the insensitivity of housing prices to apparent vari-

ations     in   market tightness by   recourse   to a theory of monopolistic compe--

titiori.     This is an    interesting   approach, but the availability ef experi-
mental     data provides ro special advantage when it comes to testing its

va1idi ty.

IV.   Conclusion

      The EJDerirnental Housing Allowance Program has generated a rich and
valuable set of data on the housing behavior of lower   income   Americans.
These data anpear to have been analyzed carefully and creatively by     the

EHAP investigators, although it is doubtless that their conclusions will

be challenged as the numbers are studied by other investigators.
                                                                    2   The

issue discussed in this paper is the extent to which the experimental

nature of these data per se enhances their vaiue Specifically, are the

problems faced by investigators who have used conventional data to pre-

dict behavioral response to housing allowaices in any way mitigated

by the availability of experimental data?

      With the possible exception of experimentally induced variations in

housing prices, it seems that the experimental data offer no particular

advantages. Fundamentally, this is because housing behavior is so complex,

and the policy environment so uncertain, that simple comparisons of experi-

mental and control groups are unlikely to be of much interest. Rather, the

data must be interpreted with the help of theoretical and statistical models.

Thus, if the goal was to obtain new and improved estimates of the behavioral

response to housing allowances, a social experiment was not necessary. The
                                                                              30
money would have been better spent on augmenting conventional data sources.

*        I   would like to thank Joseph Friedman, Jerry Hausman, Ed:in Mills,

      Mitchell Polinsky and David Wise for useful conversations.



1.    A more fundamental question, perhaps, is why housing allo'ances

should   be considered at all when direct income transfers would probah1y

be preferable from th point of view of the poor. We            will   take it   as
given, however, that the public policy goal is to increase their welfare

in some manner tied to housing consumption.



2.    This sub—section is based upon Allen, etal. [l979 ,             especially
pages 28—30.



3.    The definition of Tthousehold income" was essentially post tax 'in-

come less a $300 deduction for each worker in the family.



4.    For example, in 1973 a Phoenix family with        three   or four members

would be eligible only if its income were less than $8150; for Pittsburgh,

the limit was $6250.



5.       This assumes that individuals' choices are unconstrained by quality

standards.



6,       For examnic, the nrice elasticity of dnan is                   where    P

and 2        arc   (usually) evaluated at their mean vnlne;.
                                       — 34 —




7.       Note that this need not imply   that   the elasticities be identical

across    individuals;   such will be Lhe case only for the very simple Cobb—

Douglas specification. One can also specify a random coefficients model,

which allows for a distribution of elasticities across peopic. See

Hausmsn and. Wise [i9O]



8.       This point is further developed in Mosteller and Nosteller [19791.



9.       Friedman and Weinberg of Abt Associates bring together a wealth of

information on the demand experiment: the economic theoip behind it,

sample design issues, statistical analysis of the data, and more. It is

a pity that no similar major report has been issued by the Rand Corpora-

tion for the supply experiment.



10.      One can rescue the experimental approach from this criticism by

building income-price interactions into the experimental design. How-

ever, as Hausmnan and Wise [1981] point out, the more treatment groups,

the less convincing are the results, ceteris paibus.



11.      See, e.g., Hanushek and Quigley D979a1,Milis and Sullivan 979,

or Hausman ac1 Wise 980.



12.      A regression of the prlce of a commodity R on its characteristics

(a vector X )     is   the basis of an hedonic price index for the commodity.

The implicit price of the th characteristic is R/X. .              See Rosen

[19741
                                      — 35 -




13.     If housing services include accessibility to the work place and

the usual competitive asshmptiOnS ho'd, then the before treatment once
of housing services would be constant. But in this case, the     dependent

variable should be housing     expenditures plus conmuting costs. Pote also

that    if owner—occupied housing were being considered (as it 15 Ifl   the   sup-

ply    experiment)   an additional complication would arise because the effec-
tive   price of housing services depends upon the individual's marginal

federal income tax rate. See Rosen [l979a]or King '980]



14.      However, the value of these benefits is lessened to the extent that

the program induced price reductions are perceived as transitory.



15.      Of course, neither the necessity of using a permanent income mea-

sure nor the types of solutions just mentioned are unique to the study of

housing; they appear throughout the literature on the      estimation   of demand


functions.



                                                it is not clear how to convert
16.      An additinnal problem arises because

the monthly EHAP payments, which are known to be temporary, into changes

in permanent income.



         An important exception is the work of King 98OI, who   considers
 17.

 rationing   between different tenure modes in the United Kingdom.




 ie.     This differs from the use of the tnm    "disequilibrium"   in much of

 theacrceconoriC 3 iterature, where it refers to a situation in which
 markets fail to clear because of some constraint(s). See, e.g., Eanro
 and Grossman ft9711
                                            — 3o   —




19.     Unfortunately, as Friedman and Wcirberg a978, p. 127 ]ncoo, dynamic
patterns      niqhL   be   affected by the limited duration of the exj:crir:iena.


20.     Of course, Hawthorne effects can           be   used. to brin9 into    cucatica tbc

results      coancrated by all social exuerimonts.


21.     Particoation was         orohably also influenced by        the existence of minimum

housing      standards. Some critics of EHAP have claimed greater variation in

these standards would have provided useful information on the extent to

which they influenced participation.               See Brooking Intitution [1979,

p. 10].



22.     For many homeowners, the federal income tax generates an endogenous

price for housing services.



23.     Barnett and Lowry ft979, p. c] discuss some predictions of the

market effects of housing allowances that were made prior to ERA?.



24.     This subsection is based upon Allen, et. al. ,               [1979],


25.     In addition, only about half the eligible renters and 30% of the

eligible     homeo,mers had enrolled after four          years   (1len, et.ai., [1979,
p.    35).

26.     Several researchers have used data from the supply experiment to

O5tllCtC demand for housing schedulos ,            e.g. , 1ulford   p.979 .    T'cc   wiJ I

27.    Given the production function and input prices, one can dv: the
marginal cost schedule which, under competition, is the sunpl'y cu::v.


28.    The assumption of a horizontal supply curve is quite comnori, e .   .
see   dLeeu and Struyk [1975, p. 15]. Of course, to the e:ent that :n•ut
prices change with the size of the housing industry, the long mn su'Tply
curve will have a non—zero slope.


29.    For example, Mills and Sulljvan [1979] have su;gested that problems
with econometric technique lead the EHAP investigators to underestimate
income elasticities from the demand experiment.


30.    A similar conclusion is reached by Hanushek and Quigley L1979b, p.

68]
