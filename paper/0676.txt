              Quantity and Elasticity Spillovers Onto the Labor Market:
                         Theory and Evidence on Sluggishness



                                         ABSTRACT



     FirmsT beliefs that they may   be   unable to sell as much as they would

like at the market price leads not only to a quantity spillover (even when

prices are flexible) but also to a spillover of product demand elasticity

onto the elasticity of labor demand. Hence, optimal firm behavior can be

expected to produce a negative correlation between the (absolute value of)

the wage elasticity and the unemployment rate. This hypothesis is tested

on three sets of data.    1) For low—skilled workers in the United States

in 1969 there is weak support for this hypothesis; 2)         In time—series

data for the U.S. there is no evidence for the hypothesis (there is essen-

tially   no cyclical variability in the elasticity); and 3) In time—series
data for the United Kingdom there is fairly strong evidence supporting it.
We also find that, in both the U.S. and the U.K., the demand elasticity

for labor decreased in the 1970s to an extent that does not appear to be

explained by changes in other factor prices.

        Theories that view unemployment as a non—market—clearing or non—Walrasian
phenomenon assign a central role to spiliovers from product markets onto the
labor market. Consider a profit—maximizing firm which faces a constraint on the
amount of output it can sell. This constraint in turn affects its demand for
lahor, with decreased product demand spilling over onto decreaned demand for
labor. Unemployment results if the constrained demand for labor is less than
desired supply.
        Jhy, however, don't unemployed workers respond to constraints on demand for
labor by offering to work at lower wages? The effectiveness of such a response
will depend on the elasticity of demand for labor which workers face. For the
quaritity constraint on the output market to appear in the labor market in the
form of unemployment, the elasticity of demand for labor must be low. In short,
if   we are      to explain unemployment in terms of a spillover of product market con-
ditions        onto the labor market when prices are not fixed, a fall in the elasti-

city    of demand for labor must accompany an observed increase in unemployment.
        ifl    this paper we presenit theoretical and empirical results supporting
simultaneous movements of the elasticity of labor demand and the unemployment
rate.         We begin   theoretically by   considering a representative firm that faces

constraints on the amount it can sell, but that is able to lower its selling

price in the attempt to "loosen" these constraints. Optimal behavior has two

imp]!cations.        First, the extent to which an adverse shift in demand conditions
facing        the firm actually shows up in lower sales (and     hence lower iuantity of labor

demanded) will depend on the elasticity of demand. With prices flexible, quantity

spillovers clearly depend on a low elasticity of product demand. We also show that,

for a firm facing a downward—sloping demand curve, there is a positive relation between
                                              —2—


its elasticity of demand for labor and the elasticity of product demand that it
faces. Analogous to a quantity spillover there is an "elasticity spillover."
       Taken together these results imply that a low elasticity of product demand
will   yield both a low level and a low elasticity of labor demand. We call this

the variable employment elasticity (VEL) hypothesis. High unemployment will he

accompanied by      a   low elasticity of demand for labor. The labor market con-

ditions   which    imply the ineffectiveness of wage cutting in response to

unemployment      themselves result from the dependence of factor demand on demand
for   output.

        In the second through fourth sections of the paper we present           empirical
evidence to test our theoretical consiusions. Cross—section data on low—
skilled workers in the U.S. are examined first; then time—series evidence on
labor demand in the U.S. and the U.K. is considered. As part of these last
results we examine whether there has been a structural change in the elastLcity
of demand for labor.
I. The Theory of Derived Demand for Labor in a Non—Wairasiari World
       For a profit—maximizing seller,       what    is   the relation between conditions in

the    output   rriarket and   demand for labor?    If, following the basic quantity—
constrained models, we assume that prices are exogenously fixed at a level which
is not market clearing, the answer is simpleJ Suppose that at the given price
desired demand for output exceeds desired supply. Actual sales will be               deter-

mined by the minimum of these two, and any resulting constraint on output and
production      will Imply a cutback in demand for labor. In such a model the
elasticity of labor demand has little meaning: Labor demand is determined solely
by the exogeneously determined demand for final output.
                                             —3—


       As has often been pointed out, a firm which can hold inventories will not

have a mechanical relation between current sales and current production.

However, the basic result of a spillover should continue to hold for two

reasons. First, an increased constraint on current sales may lead the firm to

expect increased constraints on future sales. Second, even with unchanged

future sales expectations, the value of inventories will he concave in their

level, meaning inventories will not         increase   sufficiently to   make up for a
decrease     in current sales.

       it is unreasonable to assume, however, that a seller facing a constraint on

product demand will not consider cutting price. Hore likely, he will lower his

selling price relative to •the price he sees in the market in            an atteopt to
increase sales. The amount by which he lowers price will depend on              the demand

curve   he faces.
       The standard theory of the competitive firm views each seller as facing an
infinitely elastic product demand for his own output, since a small cut in price
will induce an arbitrarily large increase in quantity demanded. If this were
the case, then sales constraints in the sense discussed above could not be an
ecluilLbriwa     phenomenon.   Individual   behavior   would always lead to a situta—

tion   where price equalled marginal cost. Nor would the notion            of unemployment

caused by spill—overs      onto labor demand make any sense, since the firm could
always sell as raich as it       likes at the going market price.

       For   a   number of reasons, it may be unrealistic to assume that sellers face

an infinitely elastic demand curve for their product in the short run. This may
be due to the monopoly power that a seller enjoys with respect to his current
                                          _)4_



customers, possibly arising from spatial separation (see Hotelling, 1929); or
one may argue that, because information about price changes diffuses only over

time, an individual seller may   charge   a price above or below that which other

sellers of the same product charge, without his market share going to zero or

one instantaneously. (The optimal pricing policy for an atomistic seller in a

world where customers are gained or lost only slowly in response to price dif-

ferentials was studied by Phelps and Winter, 1910.) In the short run the impli-

cation of slow diffusion of   price   information is   that   the individual firm acts

like   a monopolist facing a downward sloping demand curve. The firrnt s demand
curve will depend on the industry demand curve and on the technical specifica-
tion   of customer flow between firms.

       Consider the employment decisions of a firm which, because of the sort of

frictions mentioned above, faces a downward sloping demand curve. What will be

the relation between the elasticity of this demand curve and the level and

elasticity of demand for labor? Other things equal, the steeper is the product

demand curve, the more an inward shift of the curve will be reflected in a fall

in desired level of output implying a fall in employment. The less effective

are price cuts in response to a fall in demand, the more this fall in demand

will be reflected in quantity produced.

       This basic result lies at the heart of the concept of quantity spillovers

when prices are flexible. In a world of fixed prices, adjustments in quantity

of input demanded are the only possible response to a fall in product demand.

Flexible prices add a second margin of adjustment. The firm will find it opti-

mal to use both margins, and the degree to which quantity spillovers appear will

depend on how elastic is the demand curve that firms face. A necessary con-

dition for spillover unemployment to appear is that firms act as if they face

inelastic demand curves.
                                          —5—


       One   can make a further statement which is somewhat less obvious. Suppose
that, when the level of demand for output falls, the elasticity of demand for
output falls as well. This will tend to reinforce the quantity spillover
effect.      The greater is the simultaneous movement in the level and elasticity of

product demand, the more a fall in demand for output will he reflected in a fall

in demand for labor, and the less in a fall in price.

       Why might one expect a reduction in the elasticity of product demand to

coincide with a fall in demand? When demand falls, price cuts may lead to a

reduetion in the expected rate of inflation; expected real interest rates rise.

Thus   a price decline, by   reducing the expected rate of future price increases,

could lead to an actual reduction in quantity demanded.

       Why else might one expect this? Phenomena such as pessimism about future

income streams may lead demanders both to cut their current consumption and to

become less responsive to price cuts by sellers. Consider a consumer whose

employment is constrained in the current period and who has a subjective proba-

bility distribution over the amount of labor he will be able to sell in the

future. One can show (Drazen, 1980b) that, if his utility function displays

decreasing relative risk aversion, an adverse shift in the distribution of

future income will cause both the level of consumption and the price elasticity

of demand to fall. That is, if the utility function is such that saving

increases with uncertainty about future income, lower expected future income

causes saving to rise and causes the consumer to be less sensitive to price cuts.

       Some rough intuition for this result is as follows. Since a fall in income

increases risk aversion, the individual requires a larger premium to undertake a

given risk. Because future income is risky, increasing consumption today
                                                       —6—


increases the       risk   associated with future utility due to the implied                    fiture

income      streaci, ?herefore, a larger decrease in price (which may be seen as                         a

risk    premium in this case) may he necessary to induce an individual to increase
his consumption by a given amount. In other words, the price elasticity of out-
put    demand falls.

       To    derive the relation between product market conditions                       and the elasticity

of    lahor demand, uc turn to a formal model. Consider a firm which                          produces a

single      product that may either be sold in the current Ieriod or stored (without
stor'age costs) and sold next period. For simplicity we assume all produetLori takes
place    in the current period, though this assumption could easily be relaxed

without affecting the basic results.                   Output          is a function of two factors of

production,       £ (labor)    and m (a corposite of other factors), combined according

to f(9.,u). The firm faces          downward sloping demand curves in eacb period, each
of    which is a function only of that period's price. (This simplification could                             also

be relaxed). This period's demand function is x(p), and next period's
is x(),       where p is    the current discounted value of next period's price.
        The firm's    decision problem can then be written:
            ax
            p,p,,ra
                              px(p) + px(p)        —
                                                       w       —
                                                                   wmra,                           (I)

wz and Wa are       the prices of the two factors, which                     the   firm takes as given. The

        To     evaluate equation (8)            further    consider       a specific functional form,      the
constant elasticity demand function, x hp, where                                   h is a   constant. a is then
equal     to                ,    and (8) becomes:


                                = (1—a)o + a 1KT1 + (i —         K)fl I                             (9)

When    x" and x" are            small relative to x' and x', ax' =                ax'      2, so that (8) becomes:



                             =    (i—a)   + a    f-2   (n —1)   +2-
                                                                 2
                                                                    (          ')]                  (9')




        Equation         (9') gives a complete characterization of the determinants of the

elasticity of demand for a factor in a non—Wairasian world. This elasticity

is the weighted sum of the elasticity of factor substitution arid the

elasticity of product demand.2 The latter is in turn a weighted sum of product

demand elasticities in current and future periods. If output price were exoge—

nously fixed, such that the elasticity of product demand were zero, the second

term in (9) would drop out, leaving only                        the   standard substitution elasticity

term, (1 —         a).
       When prices are flexible, the elasticity of input demand is always

higher than in the fixed price world, as indicated by the presence of the second

set of terms in (9).               The influence of current product demand elasticity will

depend on the fraction of output going to current sales. As is intuitive, the

longer the horizon the firm has, the less a low value of current product demand
                                            —9-.

elasticity will affect demand for inputs. For given values of K, the elasticity
of   factor demand will be higher the larger is n         in   the region of possible price

changes. The firm    will   be   more responsive to offered wage        cuts   by labor   the
more able it is to sell the output which would be produced by the extra labor

hired    (or, more precisely, the more able        it is to sell the output without, the

necessity of a large price cut).

       Our argument here may     be summarized as follows. The amount by which a firm
increases   the quantity of labor demanded in response to a wage cut will depend
on the value of the output which would be produced. This output has two uses,

current sales and inventory. If the firm's sales prospects worsen, and if the

value of inventory is concave in inventory, the firm            will   require a larger fall

in   wages to induce it to increase output by a given amount. That is, the larger
the price cut necessary to sell the increased output, the larger the wage cut

necessary to induce the firm to hire more labor.

       We have attempted here to bring together a number of relatively obvious

points to come to some not so obvious conclusions. Facing constraints on sales,

a firm will choose an optimal point along a downward sloping demand curve. The

factor demand functions of the firm will depend heavily            on the elasticity of
this demand curve. A low elasticity of product demand (which, for reasons
discussed above, may be reasonable to expect when aggregate demand is low) will
lead   to both a low level of factor demand and a low          elasticity of factor demand.
Hence,   if the firm is in a non—Wairasian environment in product markets, we

might expect high unemployment and a low elasticity of demand for labor to

go together. In our empirical work we call this expectation the variable

employment elasticity (VEE) hypothesis. It is worth noting that the assumption

of exogenous wage rigidity does not readily generate any hypothesis about

cyclical variations in labor—demand elasticities.

II.    Cross Section Demand: Low—Skilled Workers, 1969

       In this and the next two sections we turn to empirical testing of the VEE

hypothesis on the demand for labor. The procedure is to take different data

sets   and specify standard labordemand equations including the real wage and
output. To these are added a measure of aggregate slackness and interactions
of this measure and the real wage. The        interaction terms allow the direct

testing   of our hypothesis; they should have      positive effects on employment

demand   to   be consistent with our hypothesis.

       Any data set on a subaggregate of workers to be used in testing the impli-

cations of our hypothesis should meet two criteria. First, the workers should

he affected by market forces; i.e., they should not be in a subrnarket in which

wage determination is almost entirely through collective bargaining. Second,

variations in aggregate activity should be reflected in employment patterns in

this submarket. Employment in this group should neither be so steady and high

that differences in     labor   market conditions do not produce variations in labor

demand   for this group, nor should it be so steady and lOW      that even a low aggre-

gate unemployment rate     is accompanied by slack in the particular submarket.
       These considerations suggest using data on a broad range of low—skilled
individuals; this ensures that the impact of rigidities produced by unioniza-

tion   is minor and allows a sufficient range of occupations so that      variations in

aggregate activity can be expected to produce tightness in some submarkets.

Crandell, MacRae and Yap (1975) estimate a cross—section labor—demand equation

for the low—skilled (service, private household workers and nonfarm laborers) as

part of a larger supply—demand      system. Their data cover 43    states and com-

binations of states. The wage and employment data are from the March 1969

Current Population Survey; the output data are based on Bureau of Economic

Analysis estimates of income originating by sector. The unemployment         variable
which    we have added is the deviation of the total unemployment rube in 1969 in
the   state from its average value    for l96O—l969. This measure, UDEV, captures
the labor market disequilihium implicit in the theoretical discussion Lctber
that would the current unemployment rate.
      The first column in Table 1 presents instrumental estimates       of a simple

demand    equation for hours    worked by low—skilled labor. WL is   the log of the
average   wage, calculated as the ratio of'   labor   income to hours worked by low—

skilled labor;     QNPR is the log of nonfariti output other than in industrial sec-
tors (designed to reflect output in sectors that are intensive in low—skilled
labor). The equation was estitiateci using a broad array of demographic variables
as instruments in the prediction of '1L.5  The underlying data we shall use in
examining    how slackness affects labor demand   produce   sensible estimates of this

standard    demand equation. The wage elasticity seems reasonable for low—skilled
workers (see Hamerriiesh—Grant, 1919); and, while the output elasticity is not
consistent with the increasing returns to scale implied by most tine—series
labor—demand equations (see Hamermesh, 1916), it is completely consistent         with

constant    returns to scale.

       In column (2) we present     the results of interacting W1 with UDEV and
including UDEV alone in this equation. Because of the collinearity induced
by the inclusion of UDEV in both simple and interactive form, the t—statistics are
quite small. However, the interaction term is positive, confirming our bypothe—

sis that     factor demand   elasticities are lower where there is greater slack in the
factor     market.   Moreover, it remains pocitive when an additional interacLion

terra,    between output (QMPR) and UDEV, is added to the equation in column (3).
It is also interesting to note that this second interaction is negative:
Increases in output in slack tiraes induce smaller increases in erapboymeni
demand. This is consistent with the view that employers can expand output
during slack times partly by using labor they had previously hoarded.
         To examine the intrasauple variation in the wage and output elasticities
using the estimates in Table I, we      present in   Table 2 their values calculated at
the sample mean and extremes of UDEV. Because the 1960s vere a period of
declining unemployment in the United States, UDEV has a negative mean, and its
raaxirmarn among the states in the sample is   zero. As the first row of Table 2
shows, the wage elasticity varies greatly across states in the sar.iple depending
upon the degree of labor—market slack. Indeed, in the        loosest   labor market in

the sample the elasticity is insignificantly different       from zero. Obversely,
the   elasticity in the labor market whose unemployment rate had fallen most

rapidly during the      1960s is both large and significantly different from the mean
elasticity. There is imich less      variation in the output elasticity as labor—

market tightness varies, as the      second row of Table 2 shows, and the differences
in this elasticity among states are insignificant.
      Though the     interaction terms that explicitly test our hypothesis are them-

selves not significant in the estimates presented in Table 1, there        is a signi-
ficant difference between the wag-c elasticities calculated for the two states

with the highest and lowest temporary unemployment. This suggests that this

cross—section provides at least some weak evidence in support of our proposition

that optimizing behavior leads employers to be less responsive to variations in
factor prices when markets are slack.

III.   Time—Series Labor Demand in the United States, l95—l980


       The plethora of studies estimating labor—demand equations using time—series
data has led to a number of firm conclusions: 1) The elasticity with respect
to output is less than one; there is thus substantial evidence of short—run
increasing returns to scale; 2) The implied wage elasticity is well below one,
though    some recent evidence suggests it may be           as high as .6;   3) The average    lag
of   employment in response to exogenous changes in wages or output demand                 exceeds
that of manhours; 4) Versions of employment—demand equations that constrain the

response of employment demand to relative factor prices to be homogeneous yield

implausibly low estimated elasticities.6 Despite this consensus and the massive

array of studies there have been no estimates of how the wage elasticities

differ at different points of the business cycles.1

       We use aggregate data for United States manufacturing, quarterly for 19514

through 1980:11, to test the VEE hypothesis. In the basic version the equation

to be estimated is:

                     3                     3
          Nt = a +
                     i=0   a11   Wti   +
                                           i=0 a3 Qt—i +
                                                           bt   ,                   (10)


where N = number (manhours) of production workers; W = average hourly earnings

deflated by the FF1 for manufacturing; Q =              manufacturers'   shipments, also

deflated by the FF1. (The variables are written in logs.) Four—quarter distri-

buted lags were used because they produced better fits than did lags of other

length. All equations were estimated using the Cochrane—Orcutt technique for

estimating the parameter p describing a first—order autoregression in the

errors.
                                           —16—




Equation (10) is estimated using quadratic polynomial distributed lags,

without   constraints on the     distant end—points in the lag structure. 'The results

shown    in   columns (1)   and () of Table 3 make clear that the    wage elasticity is

relatively low, though of similar magnitude to that produced in many other time—

series   labor—demand studies. The        coefficients   on the trend imply a somewhat
lower rate of increase in labor productivity than actually occurred, though.8
     In columns (2) and (5)       we   present the estimates of a version of (10) that includes
interactions     between the wage terms and UlI, the unemployment rate of males

25—5-. (This latter variable is also included separately.) The prime—age male

unemployment rate is used to give a measure of labor—market slack that has been

relatively invariant to the changes in labor force participation and population

trends that have altered the meaning of the aggregate unemployment rate, The

sum of the coefficients on the interaction terms is negative, but not significantly

different from zero. In the U.S. time series we fail to find corroborating evidence

for our hypothesis. As we show below, this is not due to our failure to include

other factor prices, such as that of enerr.

     The initial and long—run enloyment—wage and manhours—wage elasticities at

the minimum, mean and maximum prime—age male unemployment rates in the period

l951480 are shown in Table 1. These are based upon the estimated ai and

shown in columns (2) and (5) of Table 3. Not surprisingly, because of the small

and insignificant coefficients on the interaction terms between wages and prime—

age male unemployment, there is relatively little variation in the wage elasti-

cities with changes in unemployment. It is noteworthy, though, that despite the

failure to confirm the VEE hypothesis on this data set, the estimates make sense

in one respect. The initial responses of hours to changes in wage rates are

proportionately closer to the long—run responses than are the employment—wage

elasticities; this is consistent with employers varying hours/worker more

rapidly than they lay off or hire additional workers.

     Though the results are not much different from those in many of the studies

sumniarized in Hamermesh (1916), the labor—demand elasticities are far below

those estimated by Clark—Freeman (1980) using almost the same series but ending

early in 1916. To examine what causes this discrepancy equation (io) was reesti—

mated with the addition of an extra time trend for quarters after 1973:111 and

a dummy variable for that period interacted with both the lagged wage and

output terms. The results are shown in columns (3) and (6) of Table 3. In

addition to the reduced rate of productivity growth implicit in the coefficient

on the post-1973 time trend, we see a large and nearly significant reduction in

the employment—wage elasticity, and a larger significant reduction in the hours—

wage elasticity. Moreover, in estimates not reported in the table, these fin—

dings varied little when the real wholesale price of energy and fuels was added

to the equations. The implied wage elasticities before and after 1973:111 were

—.439 and —.296 for employment, and -.596 and —.429 for hours.   (The coef-

ficients on energy prices were positive with t—statistics slightly

above one.9)   In addition to the well—established reduction in the rate of

growth of labor productivity since 1973, the U.S. has apparently also seen a

decline in the wage elasticity of labor demand, holding output and other factor

prices constant. For some reason independent of the price of energy there was a

structural change in the U.S. economy that increased labor-market rigidity by

reducing employers' responses to changes in real wages.


IV. Time—Series Labor Demand in the United Kingdom, 1960—l98

       Although we failed to find evidence for the VEE hypothesis in the U.S.

times series, it may nonetheless be the case that the hypothesis does better in

describing labor demand over time in other countries. In this section we exa-

mine the evidence for manufacturing in the United Kingdom since 1959. The basic

equation to be estimated is identical to (10); this is done both for com-

parability, and because the four—quarter lags embodied in (10) described the

British data better than did lags of other lengths. As with U.S. manufacturing

the model is estimated using unconstrained polynomial distributed lags and

assuming a first—order autoregression of the disturbances.

      Employment is measured as the number of employees in manufacturing, while

manhours are calculated as employment times average hours worked per manufac-

turing operative. The wage measure is the basic weekly wage rate of manual

workers in manufacturing times the ratio of wages plus employer—paid national

insurance contributions to wages, all divided by the wholesale price index for

manufactured products. Q is measured as industrial production in manufacturing.

The   ratio of unemployed persons other than school—leavers to the sum of
total employment plus unemployed other than school—leavers forms UXL, the
unemployment rate used in this section. Unlike so may time—series studies of
labor demand, these data do not offer the easy task of "explaining" one variable

with a time trend by another with a similar trend: Employment in manufacturing

in the U.K. reached a peak in this period in 1965:IV.

 columns (i) and ()    of   Table 5. The wage elasticities are not dissimilar to

 those found for the United States (over a
                                                   slightly longer time period); and the
 estimated rates of change in productivity grow-th per person or per hour are
 remarkably similar in the two countries. The only difficulty with these estimates

 is that the implied degree of increasing returns to scale is implausibly high.
        In the second and fifth columns of Table 5      we   show the results of esti-
 mating (io) with the interaction of UXL and wages, along with terms in UXL

 itself. The interaction terms are positive and
                                                        significant, providing strong
 support for the VEE hypothesis in these data. How important this effect is can

be seen by examining the values of the initial and long—run wage elasticities
shown in Table 6. The
                      long—run elasticities at the lowest unemployment rate
observed   are over three times those at the highest unemployment rate, both for

employment and for hours. All      the   long—run responses are smaller when

unemployment is higher, though for employment the differences are small.

        As in the previous section, we test here for the existence of an

unexplained decline in the labor—demand elasticity in the
                                                                   early 1910s. Again we
add   a separate time trend after 1973:111 and a dummy variable       for quarters after
then interacted with the lagged wage and output measures. The results

are shown in columns (3) and (6) of Table 5.10         Though the trend term in
the employment equation is essentially zero, we find in this equation too the

presence of a significant decline in the employment—wage elasticity. (When the

real price of fuels and materials is added, the only changes in the estimated

wage elasticities are in the third digit.) In the hours equation, though,

the time trend is positive and significant, suggesting a sharp reduction in the

rate of productivity growth per manhour; and the wage   elasticity   is actually

greater (though not significantly so) after 1973:111. Though the evidence is

weaker here, there is some sign in the U.K. too of an unexplained increase in

the   rigidity of employment demand in response to changes in real wages.

V. Conclusions and Implications
      If unemployment is to be explained by spillovers from product demand onto
labor demand when prices are flexible, the adverse shift in the labor demand
curve   must be accompanied by a low elasticity of labor demand. We have shown

that the existence of constraints in the output market (such that individual

firms act as if they face downward sloping demand curves) can be expected to

lead to similar movements in the level and elasticity of labor demand. This

will appear as a negative correlation between the (absolute value of) the wage

elasticity of demand for labor and the unemployment rate.

      This hypothesis has been tested on three sets of data: i) For low—skilled

workers in the United States in 1969, there is weak support for this hypothesis;

2) In time—series data for the U.S. there is no evidence for this

(there is essentially no cyclical variability in the elasticity); and 3) In

time—series data for the United Kingdom there is fairly strong evidence sup-

porting the hypothesis. We have also found that, in both the U.S. and the U.K.,

the demand elasticity for labor decreased in the 1970s to an extent that does not

appear to be explained by failure to include changes in other factor prices.
                                       —25—

     The   view of unemployment as a spillover due to firms facing downward—
sloping demand curves has strong implications for macro—economic policy (see
Drazen 1980b), and these can in turn be used for labor—market policy. Consider
spillovers in a general equilibrium framework. Workers who expect a constraint

on future sales of labor will cut their current consumption. Firms facing this

inward shift in product demand curves cut labor demand in turn. Hence, indivi-

dual behavior may be seen as generating an externality. If some outside agency

were to act as a t'buyer of last resort,t' this externality would be eliminated,

since individual sellers could then act as if they faced horizontal demand

curves. The novelty is that if   government   announced its willingness to buy at

Wairasian prices, it conceivably need never make good on this promise ——    since
individual competitive behavior would lead to a full employment equilibrium. A

guaranteed jobs program thus takes on a rationale beyond that of income

redistribution. What is important is not that the program provide jobs, but

that it provides a framework that enables the private sector to operate on the

assumption that demand curves are horizontal. It is the expectation that nulli-

fies the   spillovers that may result in an unemployment equilibrium.
     The partial empirical support for the variable employment elasticity (VEE)

hypothesis may be useful in the construction of wage subsidies. Though such sub-

sidies may work well as general macro stimuli, our results suggest they are not

likely to be so effective in times of high unemployment as commonly estimated

demand elasticities would imply. This means that their attractiveness should be

judged on their ease of administration and the speed with which they can be

implemented. One should not expect them to induce much short—run substitution

toward labor when product and labor markets are slack.

2This may be compared to the Hicks-Allen formulation of the determinants of the
elasticity of factor demand (Hicks, 196)4, and Allen, 1938, p. 373). They
assumed that the firm is a perfect competitor, setting price equal to marginal
cost, but that its decisions affect price via the industry demand curve. Yeung
(1972) has derived a formula similar to (9) and analogous to that of Hicks and
Allen, for the case of a monopolist maximizing profits over a single period.

Presumab1y the level of unemployment in the cross—section reflects at least
partly a permanent condition to which the market has adjusted through compen-
sating wage differentials. For some evidence on this see Abowd and Ashenfelter
(1981).

5Used as instruments are variables representing output; age, race and sex com-
position of secondary and primary workers in the state; marital status and   edu-
cational attainment of these two groups of workers; fraction of workers in
urban areas, and number of families in the state. In addition, in the equations
that include the interaction, UDEY is also included in the set of instruments
used to predict WL.

6Hamermesh (1976) infers these conclusions from studies done before 1975;
Clark—Freeman (1980) demonstrate others of these results, and Solow (1980) traces
the development of thinking on this issue.

of variation over time in employment—demand elasticities.


8As in Clark—Freeman (1980) the addition of terms in the price of capital did
not affect the results qualitatively.

9When the equations involving UM were reestimated for 1954—1973:III to avoid
any post—OPEC effects, the results differed little from those in columns (2) and
(5) of Table 3.

'-°The equations that included UXL were reestimated for 1960—1973:111 (1962—1973:
III for hours). The results for the employment equation changed little, but the
interaction term of UXL with W became negative (though with a t—statistic of
—.21) in the hours equation.

     To simplify the first term note that f                =     —         fmm     The first term

becomes:

                        w                                  w
            —r a

Since       = 1 —    and          = 1 —           where   fl =   —
                                                                            and analogously for

f, using the definitions K =       and 1 —        K = - , we         obtain:




               w                  w ax                               ax
