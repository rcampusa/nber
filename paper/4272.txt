                   GENERICS AND NEW GOODS IN
                  PHARMACEUTICAL PRICE INDEXES

                                 ABSTRACT

We examine the issue of new goods and price indexes for the important and
tractable case of generic and branded drugs. By treating generics as entirely
distinct goods and "linking them in" to indexes with fixed weights, the standard
price indexes fail to reflect the substantial welfare gains to those consumers
who, like the FDA, regard generic and branded versions of a drug as being
perfect substitutes. We discuss the treatment of heterogenous consumers in
constructing aggregate price indexes, and then, using detailed data on wholesale
prices of two anti-infective drugs, present calculations of various alternatives
to the official indexes.    These reflect both heterogeneity of tastes for
brandedness, and also the empirically important phenomenon of diffusion of
generic drugs into the market following patent expiration. We find very
significant differences: for one of the drugs studied, the standard price index
rose by 14% over the sample period, while our preferred alternative index fell
by 48%.

 I. Introduction


          This paper discusses the current treatment of the introduction of
 generic versions of previously patented (and branded) drugs into the
 official price indexes and suggests some alternative ways of proceeding.
 While generic pharmaceuticals are the substantive topic, the problem
 discussed is of much wider importance. It is a special and possibly "easy"
 case of the more general problem of new goods and quality change,
 where different quality versions are interpreted as new goods. In trying to
 solve the general quality change problem, official statistical agencies may
unintentionally aggravate and overdo it, by defining commodities too
narrowly and treating each new variety as a new good. Because new
goods are usually "linked-in" rather than compared directly to the
previous versions, the explicit and implicit price declines that consumers
experience as the result of theft appearance do not show up in the official
indexes, ever. And generic pharmaceuticals are just the visible tip of a
very large iceberg. A comparable problem exists, for example, in the
treatment of the changing population of outlets in which various goods are
sold. The whole supermarket revolution and the rise of various discount
and self-service outlets has left almost no trace in the official statistics of
prices and productivity (see, e.g., Reinsdorf (1993)).
         Generic phannaceutica]s represent a particularly simple version
of the "new goods problem". A generic drug is a variety of a previously
existing commodity which a government agency, in this case the FDA,
certifies as being "(bio-)equivalent" to the previously available version. It
differs only in packaging, including the inert matter enclosing the active




                                       I
ingredients, in labelling, and provenance.' At this point two extreme
approaches are possible. The first takes the FDA at its word and says that
a pill, is a pill, is a pill, the relevant price being the average price of all
pills sold for the same purpose. The other extreme, the current position of
the statistical agencies, treats it as an entirely separate commodity, not to
be compared to previously existing versions. The fict that not all
consumers treat them as fully equivalent and switch immediately to the
newly available cheaper variety provides some support for the second
position. But the resulting exclusion of any gains from the appearance of
such new versions of old (and also new) goods leaves the official
measures potentially badly biased in a world where such changes are the
 rule rather than the exception.




     'Federal Drug Administration publishes a list of Approved Drug
 Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, which provides
 definitive therapeutic equivalence evaluations of multisource prescription
 drug products. Equivalence between branded and generic drugs is a hotly
 debated topic. Products certified as therapeutically equivalent" by the
 FDA are: (1) pharmaceutically equivalent, in that they contain the same
 active ingredient(s), are of the same dosage form, are identical in strength
 and mute of administration, and meet applicable standards of purity,
 quality etc.; (2) bioequivalent, in that in vivo or in vitro tests show that a
 product meets statistical criteria for equivalence to the reference drug in
 the rate and extent of absorption of the active ingredient and its
 availability at the site of action; (3) adequately labelled; and (4)
 manufactured in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice
 regulations. Therapeutically equivalent products may still vary in
 characteristics such as shape, color, flavor, scoring, packaging, labelling,
 and shelf life. These apparently trivial factors may still influence the
 clinical effectiveness of the drug insofar as they affect patients' ability to
  distinguish between different tablets and dosages, or their readiness to
  take the medicine at the times and in the amounts prescribed. Therapeutic
  equivalence ratings also do not take into account differences in stability
  under adverse storage conditions, or possible reactions by patients to
  coloring or preservative ingredients.

                                        2
          Let us start with a brief, stylized description of what has been
 happening with generic pharmaceuticals in recent years: When a patent
 expires, several generic versions, certified by the FDA to be "perfect"
 substitutes, appear very quickly, selling at much lower prices, about 30 to
 50 percent cheaper than the original versions. The incumbents, the
                                                                    owners
 of the branded and previously patented version usually do not reduce their
 price, loosing much of their market share in quantities, but keeping a
 respectable share in market revenues. This response is probably optimal
 for them.2 Often, there is additional entry of generic firms and the
 average generic price drops further within the first two years after entry,
 to something around 25 percent of the original price of the incumbent, or
 lower, which is presumably close to the long run marginal cost of
 production and distribution.
         Tables I and 2 show these developments for cephalexin and
cephradine, two systemic anti-infectives from the Cephalosporin family of
antibiotics. These drugs are widely used for treating conditions such as
ear infections and respiratory tract infections. In 1986, the year before
these two drugs went off patent, the wholesale sales of cephalexin
(Keflex) reported in our data were just under $280m, while wholesale
sales of cephradine (Velosef) were just under $40m. By 1989, total annual
wholesale revenues from the sale of cephalexin had fallen to $163m and
cephradine sales were down to $17.4m (current dollars) with the revenue




    2 See Caves et al. (1991). Obviously the above is an oversimplified
version of a much more complex subject. For earlier analysis and richer
detail see Masson and Steiner (1985), Grabowski and Vernon (1992), and
Hurwitz and Caves (1988). The changes in market share and relative
prices in our data are consistent with the results of these studies, which
report on larger numbers of drugs.

                                     3
shares of incumbent firms (Eli Lilly and Squibb respectively) at about
50%.
        Figure 1 plots the numbers for a particular cephalexin
"presentation": a specific formulation of the drug in a specific package.
What is interesting for us in this figure is both the fact of rather large
price differentials between the incumbent and entrants, and that not all
consumers switch to the new cheaper variety, in spite of these
differentials. For the latter to make sense, consumers must differ in their
expectations about the efficacy and quality of such substitutes, despite
what the FDA says, some of them preferring to pay much higher prices
for the branded version.3 It is the presence of heterogeneous consumers
with different tastes which sustains the presence of many such varieties in
the market, but standard consumer theory is rather uneasy with this fact.
We invent the concept of the "representative" consumer, who consumes a
bit of every variety, taking two generic and one branded pill a day. The
more relevant notion of a population of heterogeneous consumers with
 different tastes requires some redefinition of the standard index number
 theory. We turn to this task and a brief discussion of new goods in price
 index theory next.




     'In this paper we are abstracting from the rather vexing problem of
 who is the "consumer" in the medical market. Who makes the decision:
 the patient or the doctor (or pharmacist) as his agent? And also who pays
 for it? Given insurance and reimbursements, it is not clear that standard
 consumer theory applies in this case. But the problem exists also outside
 the medical arena: we pay more for milk at the "convenience" store, and
 established names such as Leica can command significant premia over
 competing products whose quality differentials are rather hard to discern.
 Thus the treatment of such cases is of general interest even though the
 particular application of the theory to pharmaceuticals is somewhat
 ambiguous.

 IL Aggregate Index Numbers


         We start with the "Ideal" price index for individual h:

                                    =   E(p',;°)
                                "
                                        E(p',u°)

 where E(p,u) is the minimum expenditure required by individual ii to
achieve the base utility level it given prices p.4 A comparable aggregate
Ideal price index can be defined as the weighted average of such
individual indexes:

                             E(p',uk°)       =
                                                 zw:Jko
                             Ep0,u)
where w; =      E(p°,u°)       pOq°
                                        is the relative share of individual h in
                  E(p"45       1'°Q°

total base period expenditures. The resulting Ideal aggregate price index
3° gives the minimum amount (relative to base period 0) that a social
planner would need to have so that he could keep every individual on his
base utility level under the new price circumstances.5 Define the

operational Laspeyres price index at the individual level as       =   pq,
                                                                       pqh

and the parallel aggregate Laspeyres price index as P° =          w°P°, then


     ma section borrows heavily from Fisher and Griliches (1992).
    'The resulting index is "plutocratic" rather than "democratic", with
individuals getting unequal weights in the aggregate. See Diewert (1983)
for discussion and references to the earlier literature.

                         :
The same argument also applies to the parallel Paasche computations and
hence P F' where us a comparable Ideal index holding the utility
level constant at is'. This provides some justification for viewing the
standard aggregate price index computations as approximating something
of interest despite the underlying fact of consumer heterogeneity.




m. New Goods, New Varieties, and the Speeinl Case of Generics

          We now introduce the problem of new goods, commodities (or
services) that were not available in period 0, for which we have no
 observations on p° and where q°=O, presumably. The theoretical answer
 to this problem is well known (see Fisher and Shell (1971) and (1972)):
 estimate the reservation price of the new commodity in period zero, i.e.,
 the price in period zero at which the demand for this particular
 commodity (or version) would be zero.' If such a reservation price could
 be estimated, or a reasonable assumption about it could be made, the rest
 would be easy".
          Note that the new goods problem does not affect the calculation
 of the Laspeyres price index, since the base period expenditure weight of
 the new good is zero. However, a better approximation to thef Ideal
 index might still be possible. We shall come back to this point below.



      6
            are discussing the problem of measuring a consumer price
  index. The problem of a producers (output) price index is similar. It is
  discussed in Section XII of the second essay in Fisher and Shell (1972).
  For more recent references on this range of issues see Feenstra (1992)
  and Zieschang (1989).

                                        6
 Having a reservation price does allow us to calculate a Paasche price
 index and also the associated Fisher's Ideal index, the
                                                           square root of the
 product of the Laspeyres and Paasche indexes. One can also calculate the
 "superlative" (in Diewert's terminology) Divisia-Tornqvist index, where
 the percentage price decline from the reservation price will get a weight
 of half of the share of the new good in the comparison period. In general,
 however, if the new good is introduced into the price index early enough
 then, except in special cases, such as we will discuss below, its weight
will be very small, and the whole argument is de ,ninimis. Such a
procedure assumes, however, that the market is in equilibrium and that
everyone who would have liked to switch to the new commodity had the
opportunity and the knowledge to do so in the first minute or month of its
existence. If, in fact, the introduction and diffusion of new goods into a
market takes some time, as does the learning of consumers about its
actual and putative qualities, then the theoretical prescription "introduce it
early and you will minimize the problem" may be all wrong, and so also
the procedures outlined above. One cannot really escape the diffusion
problem. In some form one has to face it head on and discuss what are
the relevant points in time for which such computations are indeed
sensible. We will, therefore, get back to this problem below. But first we
shall deal with the related questions of estimating the reservation price and
dealing with taste heterogeneity.

        Assume, for the moment, that we know the reservation price p,
for every consumer. Then the aggregate Paasche price index is



                             a
                                    QPb'+Qp



                                     7
where the subscripts b and g refer to brand and generic respectively, and

    =   qp         is the avenge reservation price of those individuals who



bought generics in period 1, weighted by the size of their purchases, with
capital Q denoting aggregate quantities. Other price indexes can be
defined in a similar fashion.
           Assuming that a consumer buys either the branded version or the
generic, we are in a two goods world and we can model the choice
between them in a "linear utility" framework: generics are chosen by
individual h if Pb > O +bk, where bk is the premium required by
individual ii when purchasing generics to compensate him for the putative
loss in security or quality associated with this switch. The associated
component of the utility function that is being maximized can be written

 as q+ (l—bk)q where ô = bk/pb is the premium for 'brandedness"
 relative tOp and p" = Pb — bk differs for each h. Individual h is then
 indifferent between buying the branded version or the generic if for her

 P = Pg' If she switches to a generic, it must be the case that a price
 decline of p, - p, occurred.7
           Given this interpretation, we can construct a better bound for the
 1" Ideal aggregate price index, even though the standard Laspeyres
 formula does not incorporate the presence of the generic since its weight
 in period zero is zero. Knowing that the consumer would have been
 indifferent between consuming the branded item at Pb or the generic at Ph'


        ' The brand premium bk need not be constant over time. It could
 change with the availability of other substitutes or with the passage of
 time as the uncertainty about the quality of generics dissipates.

                                       8
  in the base period, we choose the latter consumption point as our
  reference point, since it is on the same base-period indifference curve,
 and construct a Laspeyres-like index (assuming that total quantities did not
 change with only previous brand variety users switching to the generic):'

                              n QpQp'
 since for each individual the relevant price change 5pb'/Pb° if he did not
 switch and p,'/p if he did. The first set of individuals are weighted by
 the value of their consumption in the base period, while the second, the
 shifters, are weighted by their potential consumption of generics evaluated
 at their reservation prices. Perhaps not surprisingly, the resulting Ideal
 aggregate Laspeyres index turns out to be exactly equal to the Paasche
 index. Given that the assumed utility function is linear, the two indexes
are the same and the aggregate Paasche, in reservation prices, is
 'exact'.9



IV. Reservation Prices




     'This is approximately correct for most of our examples, with the
market expanding effect of the drop in average prices counterbalanced by
the general decline in the overall market for the drug, since patent
expiration comes usually relatively late in the life-cycle of a drug when it
is already loosing market share to newer, more advanced drugs.

     'This equiva]ence holds for the sub-index for the "nest' of these
particular goods. It will not be necessarily true for the overall index,
including other goods since is0 and is' will differ.

                                      9
          The main problem, of course, is where are these reservation
prices to come from? For versions that differ along some measured
characteristics, one could estimate the potential supply price of the new
variety given yesterday's technology, using the hedonic price indexes
approach (see Griliches (1971) and (1990), Suslow (1992)))0 But in the
case of generics all the relevant measurable characteristics are presumably
the same. In our case it is not that the goods differ but that consumers
differ in their perceptions of their relative values, in their L. Since the
probability of shifting to a generic depends Ofl Pb - p, > bb, one can
write the share of generic users in the total ass, F(bJ, whereF() is
the cumulative distribution of reservation prices (for a fixed Pb).

Assuming that bh 0, i.e., that bh is a non-negative random variable, no
consumer being willing to pay more for a generic version than for a
branded one if the branded one is available, the average reservation price
for the switchers is bounded between Pb and p, and depends on the shape
of Fe'))' It is possible either to assume a reasonable shape for F() or
try to infer it from the observed relationship between prices and market
 share.
           Suppose that the distribution of brand preferences is constant and
 exogenous, and that equilibrium is reached instantly. As the price
 differential widens, the entrants' market share should just trace out the


      tO The hedonic approach does not give, however, enough credit to the
 appearance of new varieties if their prices fall on the old hedonic price
 line. On this see Trajtenberg (1990).

     "In this, the generics case differs from the more general "another
 variety" case in being hierarchical and asymmetric. In a sense, generics
 are perceived, at least to some extent, as lower quality versions. If we
 allowed bk to take negative values, we would be in the more general but
 also less informative case.

                                       10
  shape of FQ. 12     If F() is uniform the relationship will be exactly
  linear. Other possibilities are unimodal distributions such as the normal or
  logistic, implying the familiar S-shaped c.d.f. On the other hand, the
  distribution could be bimodal (u-shaped p.d.f.) such as the arcsin or other
 variations on the beta distribution, with most
                                              consumers having a very
 weak or very strong preference for the branded version, implying an
 'inverted S' shape for FQ. The simplest assumption for F() is the
 uniform distribution: then the average reservation price for those that
 shifted is just halfway between Pb and p,. To the extent that the uniform
 distribution over-estimates the tails of the normal or logistic, we will be
 over-adjusting the price indexes. On the other hand, if the true
 distribution is bimodal (u-shaped) we will be under-adjusting.
           Unfortunately, our ability to distinguish between these
 alternatives is limited by several factors. There is the question of
 diffusion: in most of the cases examined so far the entrants rapidly gain
significant market share in the first few months after patent expiration
without a concomitant movement in the price differential. From a
practical perspective, it is also clear that the curvature of the c.d.f.'s of


    12
         The size of the initial price differential and its evolution
                                                                      over time
 are presumably determined by the outcome of some game between the
 incumbent and the entrants. The standard vertical differentiation models
 (e.g. Shaked and Sutton (1982) are greatly simplified here: "quality" is
 either zero or one, and (at least for some drugs) it is not unreasonable to
 assume that all consumers have to buy either the brand or the generic,
 which makes moot the issues relating to 'finiteness' and coverage of the
 market discussed in the theoretical literature. But the implications of
 alternative assumptions about the distribution of preferences for
brandedness for the equilibrium in these models are difficult to draw out.
Exact closed form solutions for even the simplest game are very difficult
to obtain except for the uniform case. The most tractable alternative
seems to be to simply segment the market into two distinct elastic and
inelastic segments, see Frank and Salkever, (1991).

                                        11



                                                                                  A
plausible distributions is very similar over the range of price differentials
that we actually observe. The initial price differential is normally quite
large, so that we rarely see the left hand tail of the distribution (which is
in any case confounded with the diffusion effect) and entrants' prices
rarely fall far enough for us to see the extreme right hand tail. The
portion which is actually observed by us is approximately linear for most
candidate distributions. In these circumstances we settle upon the unifonn
distribution as a "reasonable" assumption.
         An alternative approach, which comes out of the recent literature
on preferences for variety and differentiated product markets (see Dixit
and Stiglitz (1977), Spence (1976), Grossman and Helpman (1991), and
Feenstra (1992)), takes the reservation price as infinite but assumes a CES
form for the utility function over varieties and produces a finite consumer
surplus calculation arising from the introduction of a new one. It can be
 shown (see Anderson et al. (1992)) that the linear random utility model
 with varying tastes across individuals is observationally equivalent to a
 representative individual CES utility function, though the welfre
 implications can differ. In our case, and also in the case of the
 introduction of a new shirt or cereal variety, the assumption of an infinite
 reservation price seems both unreasonable and unnecessary. More
 generally, however, if the functional form of the demand structure over
 the various varieties can be estimated, then a reservation price could be
 computed, and the implicit utility function could be derived to produce the
 appropriate "exact" price indexes. (See also Berry (1991) for a more
 general approach to the estimation of the unobserved "quality" of a
 particular variety using the information contained in its market share.) We
 shall try to illustrate such approaches below, using both the CES and the
 addi-log demand structures.

  V. Official Indexes and Mteniatiyes


            There are a number of problems with the treatment of generics in
 the official price indexes:
  I.        Generics belong to the more general class of "new goods" which
            are introduced relatively late in their life cycle into the official
            market "baskets". Even when baskets are changed more often,
            e.g. currently in the PPI and CPI on a four-five year rolling
            basis, this turns out to be too long a lag in many dynamic
           markets, especially because new goods tend to experience
           significant price declines in the earlier part of their life cycle."
 2.        Because of the fixed weight aspect of the official indexes and the
           growing market share of generics, they are underweighted even
           when included.
3.         Because they are linked-in, rather than compared directly with
           the previously existing versions, and treated as entirely "new"
           goods, none of the direct price decline experienced by those
           consumers who switch to generics is reflected in the official price
           indexes.


           Problems one and two are 'standard" and well known, though
nonetheless very important. It is the last problem which forms the main
topic of this paper
           In Figures 2 and 3, we plot a selection of possible price indexes
for the drug cephalexin, which went off patent in April 1987. (Figures 4
and 5 plot the same indexes for cephradine. The basic data are given in

the top and bottom lines of this figure: the price series for
brand and generic versions
                            of this drug.'4 The "BLS" index attempts to

approximate the outcome of the official PPI procedures. The
was based on a basket of drugs chosen in 1981. It was rebased in January
1988, using information collected in 1987 (and earlier) on value shares to
sample individual products (see Bemdt et al. for details). Thus we "link-
in" generics at 88.01 into a Laspeyres type index, with a relative weight
of 0.27, their revenue share during the first quarter of their availability in
 mid- 1987.15
          The "ELS" index is to be compared to a "standard" Tornqvist-
 Divisia index given next, which maintains the spirit of the official
 approach, by treating generics as new commodities without making any
 direct price comparisons, but brings them in the second month after their
 entry and keeps shifting their weight as they gain market shares. Note that
 the "EU" index departs from it both because it is late in including


       '4These already represent a significant summary of the data. The
  incumbent's series are a Tornqvist-Divisia Price Index based on 28
  distinct "presentations" of this drug at the monthly level. The generics
  price series is computed similarly, but with information from a changing
  number of manufacturers (3 in the month after the patent expired, rising
   to an average of about 30) selling between them 27 distinct presentations
   used in the calculation of the price index. This index is linked in at 87.05
   using the average price differential between generic and branded versions
   at that date in the presentations where both were available, weighted by
    the total market shares of these presentations. The final numbers are not
    very sensitive to the fine details of this construction, as a look at the
    particular version of this drug, in Figure 1, indicates.

         This is probably already an overestimate of what EU mighthave
   been able to do at the time, both because actual lags in the availability of
   information are likely to be longer, and because the establishments
   sampled were most likely based on lists collected in 1986 or earlier, and
   may not have contained generics producing plants, to the extent that they
   were new, rather than a re-direction of the output of an existing plant.

                                        14
generics and because later on, when the incumbent raises its prices, it gets
inordinate weight in the fixed weight version. (The specific numbers for
these indexes for selected time periods after the entry of generics are
given in Tables 3a and 3b.)
         The average price index is a price index that takes the FDA at its
word and treats all sourves of the pill as equivalent. It is constructed by
weighting the price series for the incumbent and entrants by their
respective quantity shares. The distance between the Tornqvist-Divisia and
this average price index provides, in a sense, a measure of the size of the
"purC generics problem: the problem raised by not comparing the new
goods to some appropriate base period price. As can be seen, it is quite
wide, with the average price index being about one-third to 45 percent
lower one to three years after entry.
         In making an adjustment for the introduction of generics, two
decisions are crucial: (1) how is the reservation price to be computed, and
(2), what is to be done about diffusion, about the fact that spread of the
generic takes time and that today's switchers to the new versions are still
reacting to the existence of the differential itself, that they would have
switched even if prices had remained unchanged in the particular month.
         As discussed above the uniform distribution is the simplest
assumption that one can make about the unobserved tastes for
 brandedness", and appears to be reasonably consistent with the data. It
implies that average reservation price for wswitcherc is the avenge of the
generic and branded prices)6 The Paasche index based on this
calculation is denoted "Paasche (u)' in Table 3 and Figures 3 and 5. It
turns out that this is roughly equivalent to using the branded price in i-i


    16 For logical consistency in the index number computations, we take
the average between the brand price in t-I and the generic in t.

                                      15
alone as a reservation price in a formula such as Fisher's Ideal or the
Tornqvist-Divisia price index, where the base period share of generics is
zero, and its effective weight is one-half of its comparison period share.
That is, either taking the actual price-difference at one-half of its value, or
giving generics one-half of their ultimate weight, gives essentially the
same result. (See the relevant rows of Table 3, and Figures 3-5.)
         That the diffusion problem is important can be seen from Figures
6 and 7, which plot the market share of generics (in quantity units) as a
function of the price differential (relative to the branded prices)

       =   Pb 1•   Since the price differential widens more or less
            Pb

 monotonically with time, these figures can be thought both as describing
 diffusion and as an estimate of the cumulative distribution of the taste for
 "brandedness." Note the significant upward movement in the share of
 generics in the first six months to a year after entry, without much of a
 change in the price differential.
          Tables 4a and 4b gives the results of a number of regressions
 relating the share of generics in cephalexin and cephradine to current and
 past price differentials and lagged shares and compares several functional
  forms. A number of things are worth noting about these results (and
  associated computations):
  1.         Lagged response is important. The avenge price differential
             during the previous six-months comes in significantly, as does the
             lagged share, indicating that diffusion is still going after six
             months.'7



     "Similar results can be gleaned from the Huzwitz and Caves, and
  Grabowski and Vernon papers, where "time since introduction" is an
  important explanatory variable for the market share of generics.

                                          16
2.       The linear version, implying a uniform distribution for F(ap),
         fits   marginally better than semi-log or the log-log (not shown)
         versions.
3.       The logit version gives a direct estimate of the elasticity of
         substitution between the branded version and generics. It is about
         2.1 for cephalexin and 3.4 for cephradine. This estimate, or the
         log price-ratio versions which are consistent with a separable
         addi-log demand structure (see Hausman et al. (1992)), can be
         used for an alternative construction of the reservation price,
         which is explored below.
4.       Instrumenting the current price differential (and also the lagged
         share), using a time trend (linear and quadratic), the overall
         medical CPI and the number of generic entrants, does not change
         these results significantly.


         Tables 3a and 3b show the main results of using the various
possible approaches. In addition to using different index number formulae,
one can also allow for diffusion in two different ways: either one can
make the link later in the story, six months to a year later, allowing
thereby much of the early diffusion to be completed before evaluating the
direct contribution of generics (lines 9 -   12   in Table 3), or the index
number formula can be adjusted to reflect the assumption that those
shifting later on to generics, do so from the branded good, with an
average reservation price which is half-way between the branded and
generics prices (lines 6 and 7)I8 Both procedures drop the computed

than the first. These indexes are also plotted in Figures 3 and 5, where

question is of substantive importance, accounting for about one-third in
our total adjustment of the "official' index.
         These regression results also allow us to examine the implications
of the remaining two approaches to the generics problem discussed above:
a CES utility function assumption, and the imputation of reservation
prices from an estimated demand equation. Feenstra's (1992) approach to
the treatment of new goods assumes a CES utility or production function
 for the separable nest of differentiated goods, and a reservation price of
 infinity for goods not yet available. The CES functional form produces a
 finite gain in consumer surplus from the introduction of a new commodity
 (variety) despite the infinitely high reservation price. This approach
 requires knowledge of the elasticity of substitution between the old and
 new varieties. Applying this apparatus to our problem and using the
 estimated elasticities of substitution in Table 4 of 2.1 for cephalexin and
 3.4 for cephradine, yields estimates (listed in line 13 of Tables 3a and 3b)
 which are below our average price index.'9 That is, the Feenstra index
  shows even more of a price decline than is implied by the assumption that



  where the assumption is made that total quantities are the same in both
  periods, and j,f = (p + p5I2. That is, "shifter? from the branded
  version to the generic version are assumed to have experienced a price
  decline of one half of the branded-generic differential also in periods
  subsequent to the initial appearance of generics.

         This computation is based on formula 4' in Feenstra and Markusen
  1992. Formula 4 leads to nonsensical results. The computations are quite
  sensitive to the particular assumption for a and the date at which the value
  shares are evaluated.

                                         18
generics are perfect substitutes for the branded versions? Thus our
approach is conservative relative to the CES functional form approach.
        Finally, the estimated demand relationships in Tables 4a and 4b
can be used to infer the reservation price, i.e. the price ratio that predicts
                                                                            in
a zero share for generics, by extrapolation. Since most of the estimates
Tables 4a and 4b are based on samples which include the initial point
(generic share=O, relative pricel), it is not surprising that the linear
versions of the equation yield an answer for the reservation price close to
the brand price (a price ratio of I). The equations using the log of price
 ratios yield reservation prices somewhat higher than that, e.g. 1.3 for the
 first estimate on the cephradine section of the table. Dropping the first
 observation and re-estimating without it does not change matters much:
 the estimated reservation prices are somewhat higher, i.e. above the brand
 price. This implies that our suggested procedure of taking the reservation
 price at the midpoint between the brand and the generics is conservative.
 Both our attempt to estimate the reservation price from the data by
 extrapolation of the share equations, or the use of the CES approximation
 yields price indexes that would decline by even more than our suggested
  compromise procedures.


           We can summarize this section by noting that we effectively
  partition the distance between the consequences of the two "extreme
  treatments of generics (the BLS assumption of generics being different
  goods and their belated introduction with fixed weights, and the
  alternative extreme assumption of complete equivalence) into roughly four
  parts. For cephalexin, the single largest part, slightly over 42 percent (by

the end of three years after entry) is due to "standard" index number
problems - late inclusion of generics with too low and too fixed a weight.
The remaining 58 percent, the distance between linking in generics
without giving the transition from branded items any weight (line 2) and
the full weight treatment implicit in the average price formula (line 8) is
divided roughly in half by the suggested treatment of generics, with the
correct linking in of generics at the beginning accounting for about one-
third, and the estimated role of subsequent diffusion for two-thirds (lines
2-3, and 3-7). The other half, the distance from our "best" and lowest.
index (line 7) and the average price is consistent with the assumption used
in our calculations, that the "correct" reservation price is not the actual
price of the branded good, but the mid-point between it and its generic
rivals. The story for cephradine is similar but the magnitudes are
somewhat smaller, reflecting a smaller original price differential and the
lower market share of generics. The mnin point of this section is that the
correct treatment of generics is empirically important, not just at the
moment of their appearance but also through the later stages of their
diffusion.

     VI. Interim Conclusions


        This is an interim report from an ongoing project. Only two
episodes of patent expiration and entry by generics are examined in detail.
We are currently assembling a significantly larger number of such
episodes, which should provide us with more variability in the price
differential at entry and thus give us a better chance to infer something
more specific about the shape of the underlying distribution of tastes for
"brandedness". Efforts are also underway to use some of the implications
of theoretical models of incumbent and entrant interaction to infer the
shape of the unobserved portion of this distribution. We are also planning
to explore the question of entry and diffusion at the more detailed level of
particular presentations of a drug. While incomplete, our analysis to date
does indicate that the problems raised here may be both pervasive and
 important, and hence worthy of further attention. Consider cephalexin: the
 "IBLS" approach gives an increase in the wholesale price index of about
 14% over the 45 months observed in our data; the opposite extreme,
 assuming that branded and generic versions are perfect substitutes, gives a
 price decline of 53 %; and our preferred "adjusted Paasche" index falls by
 48%. These are very substantial differences.
        Official agencies could improve the accuracy of their price
 measures by moving towards a more current sampling of new products,
 faster introduction, and more current weighting. As an alternative
 compromise to existing procedures, new "gaining" varieties and outlets
 could be introduced by comparing them directly to the incumbent ones,
 with at least half of the apparent price difference being taken as "real".




                                       21
 Appendix: Data Sources

The primary source of data for this study is audits of wholesale
transactions conducted by IMS America mc, a market research firm.
Sales revenues and quantities are derived from two sources: invoices of a
panel of purchasers, and information provided by wholesalers. We
examine only 'systemic anti-infective" drugs for which the incumbent
firm's patent expired in the period of time covered by the machine-
w'1'ble ifie.

Individual items in the file are identified by

(a)       "manuftcturer", which may be the actual producer of the drug,
         or a firm specializing in distribution
(b)      'product name', either the brand name or the generic name of
         the drug
(c)      "description", a brief summary of the dosage, formulation, and
         packaging of the item

Correspondences between brand names and generic names were checked
using Drug Facts and Comparisons, a standard reference source used by
pharmacists.

          For each drug, all items were classified using this information
into a "product" code, within which items are identical in terms of active
ingredient, formulation, dosage, and packaging. For cephalexin, there
were 38 distinct 'products', for example "250mg Tablets, 100 count", or
 "Suspension, l2SmgISml, 250ml, x 6". In a small number of cases, there
appear to be errors and ambiguities in labelling, making it difficult to
classify these items. For the two drugs examined here, this was not a
serious problem, and we are confident that our classification is accurate.
For other drugs, particularly those administered parenterally, there are
serious problems in assigning items in the IMS file to homogeneous
"product" codes.

Within each product manufacturers were classified as "incumbent" or
"entrant', being careful to recognize that some "firms" are in fact
subsidiaries or divisions of a parent company. The total amount of the
active ingredient in each package was also computed, which when
multiplied by the number of packages on the invoice gives an alternate
measure of quantities.

 flgure 1: Notes


 The figure plots monthly data for one of the most popular presentations of
 cephalexin, a bottle of 100 250mg capsules, for the period October 1984
 to September 1990. The patent for cephalexin expired in April 1987. The
 data are broken down by incumbent, and two classes of entrants: "majors"
 i.e. large R&D-performing firms, and "other", which are firms
 specializing in the production of generics and performing little product-
oriented R&D. (This 3-way classification is not used elsewhere in the
paper. As the figure indicates, there is very little difference in the prices
charged by the two kinds of entrants, and the two groups are combined
into a single "entrants" class.)

The solid line represents the incumbent, the broken line represents the
"majors", and the dotted line represents the "other" group.

Panel (a) plots the revenue shares of the three groups over time

Panel (b) plots the price per bottle for each group over time (in current
dollars)

Panel (c) plots quantities for each group over time (in lOOs of bottles)

Panel (d) plots the number of firms in each group over time
