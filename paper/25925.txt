                                         ABSTRACT

We study how adverse economic shocks influence political outcomes in authoritarian regimes in
strong states, by examining the 2013-2015 export slowdown in China. We exploit detailed
customs data and the variation they reveal about Chinese prefectures' underlying exposure to the
global trade slowdown, in order to implement a shift-share instrumental variables strategy.
Prefectures that experienced a more severe export slowdown witnessed a significant increase in
incidents of labor strikes. This was accompanied by a heightened emphasis in such prefectures on
upholding domestic stability, as evidenced from:(i) textual analysis measures we constructed
from official annual work reports using machine-learning algorithms; and (ii) data we gathered on
local fiscal expenditures channelled towards public security uses and social spending. The central
government was subsequently more likely to replace the party secretary in prefectures that saw a
high level of "excess strikes", above what could be predicted from the observed export
slowdown, suggesting that local leaders were held to account on yardsticks related to political
stability.

1       Introduction
Negative economic shocks that adversely impact labor markets and the well-being of citizens
often have repercussions for domestic political outcomes. The resulting citizen discontent can
naturally translate into decreased support for the government, and in extreme cases, even give
rise to public unrest that threatens the stability of the incumbent. How then do political leaders
respond to the domestic pressures that are likely to arise following such shocks?
    This question has been studied extensively in the context of democracies, with a vast litera-
ture demonstrating how weak economic conditions can translate into setbacks at the ballot box
for incumbent politicians (e.g., Lewis-Beck 1988, Duch and Stevenson 2008). It has also been
explored in the setting of weakly institutionalized polities, where economic shocks can lead to
civil unrest and violence that pose an immediate existential threat to the regime in power (e.g.,
Haggard and Kaufman 1995, Miguel et al. 2004, Br¨        uckner and Ciccone 2011). Much less is
known, however, about the impact on political outcomes in a non-democratic context where
state institutions are relatively strong, so that citizens can neither vote an incumbent out, nor
reasonably expect to remove him/her from office by force.
    China, a prominent example of a non-democratic regime with relatively strong levels of state
capacity, provides an opportune setting to explore this issue, especially as it has gone through a
well-documented decline in its export performance.1 While Chinese merchandize exports grew
at a rapid average annual rate of 18% between 1992-2008 (Hanson 2012), this has gone into a
sharp reversal since 2012 (see Figure 1). China's manufacturing exports even contracted 8.5%
between 2015-2016, in line with the weak performance of trade flows in the rest of the world
following the global financial crisis.2 This slowdown has naturally sparked concerns regarding
its potential impact on labor markets, given the prominent role that exports have played in
driving China's economic development since the early 1990s.3
    Indeed, at the same time as export manufacturing orders have declined, reports have
emerged of a rise in layoffs and the shutdown of factories; in several instances, factory man-

     China is classified as an "autocracy" in the widely-used Polity IV Project dataset, and is ranked at the
8th percentile (from the bottom) in "Voice and Accountability" in the 2017 edition of the World Bank's World
Governance Indicators (WGI). In contrast, it is at the 68th percentile in the WGI's "Government Effectiveness"
score, which is above the average position of its "upper middle income" country peers (51st percentile).

     Calculated from UN Comtrade data; the corresponding decrease in the nominal value of exports from the
rest of the world to all destinations excluding China was 3.7%. While there has been a recovery in China's export
growth since 2016, the trade disputes between the US and China triggered in 2017 have cast a further dampener
on the prospects for China's exports. Our analysis will focus on the period up to 2016, given constraints on the
data after 2016 on labor strikes and the political response measures.
   3
     As an illustration, in a State Council executive meeting on 21 Apr 2016, Premier Li Keqiang emphasized the
need to stabilize China's exports amid the "harsh" foreign trade environment, as this was of concern not only to
GDP, but also to a large volume of employment (http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2016-04/21/content 5066423.htm).
More formally, Feenstra and Hong (2010) have found that export growth accounted for employment growth of
7.5 million workers per year in China between 2000 and 2005. See also Los et al. (2015) for a related exercise
that arrives at even larger estimates of the importance of exports for China's employment.

agers were even alleged to have fled and absconded with company funds. This in turn has
triggered localized strikes over job losses and unpaid wage arrears.4 As we will show, these
events have been spread out geographically across China, and their occurrence has shown few
signs of abating. This has led to concerns that the cumulation of such labor-related "events"
could undermine domestic political stability.5
    We present formal empirical evidence linking the slowdown in China's exports to a rise in
incidents of labor unrest. Building on this, we then show that the export slowdown prompted a
range of political responses, from local party leaders (in terms of the heightened attention paid
to enforcing public security on the ground), as well as from the central government (in terms of
how closely local leaders were held to account for their performance in maintaining stability).
Throughout the paper, we study these developments within China at the local level, specifically
at the prefecture level (a sub-provincial administrative unit). Our empirical design thus exploits
the substantial variation in the severity of the export slowdown both across prefectures within
provinces and within prefectures over time.
   4
     To give but one example, several hundred workers reportedly staged a peaceful march on 30 April and 1
May 2015 along the streets of Dongguan prefecture, a major manufacturing hub in Guangdong province, when
the apparel factory where they were employed shuttered overnight and the factory manager became untraceable.
See https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/yf1-05012015100541.html. Dongguan has been
a particularly hard-hit prefecture during the export slowdown (New York Times, 20 Jan 2016).
   5
     This is aptly captured in the following quote from Eli Friedman, a Cornell University scholar on Chinese
labor relations: "This is probably the thing that keeps Xi Jinping up at night. Governments are not swimming
in money the way they used to be, and there's less room to compromise" (New York Times, 14 Mar 2016). The
assessment that incidents of labor unrest have been on the rise is consistent with media reporting (e.g., New
York Times, 14 Mar 2016), as well as analysis by China political watchers (e.g., Tanner 2014).



                                                                                           2
    Given the tight state control of news and information within China, it is by nature challeng-
ing to obtain systematic data on labor-related incidents and the government's response to these
events, particularly at the local level. We overcome this hurdle through a combination of both
conventional and novel sources. The core data on labor strikes comes from a non-governmental
organization (the China Labor Bulletin, or CLB) that monitors developments on labor rights
issues in mainland China. Importantly, the CLB data allow us to map the location of incidents
to prefectures within China. We have moreover corroborated the credibility of this data source
by correlating it against official figures (albeit at the more aggregate province level) on labor
dispute cases formally raised for arbitration or mediation.
    We first establish a robust relationship from the slowdown in exports to a rise in the number
of CLB-recorded labor unrest events per worker, using a prefecture-level panel dataset of annual
observations from 2013-2015. To support the claim that this relationship is causal in nature,
we adopt a shift-share (or Bartik) instrumental variable (IV) for the severity of the export
slowdown. This exploits the fact that prefectures differ in the initial product composition of
their export baskets, which generates variation in how inherently exposed each prefecture would
be to shocks to global trade flows across products (c.f., Autor et al. 2013). Such shift-share
IVs are valid to the extent that movements in rest-of-the-world trade flows are being driven by
forces exogenous to developments within China. We draw support on this front from studies
such as the 2016 IMF World Economic Outlook, which found that the world trade slowdown
was accounted for largely by weak global demand, with supply-side forces and trade frictions
playing smaller roles in comparison (Aslam et al. 2016). Moreover, our findings do not appear
to be driven by shocks to domestic demand or output within China, when we seek to directly
control for these using measures constructed at the prefecture level.
    Our preferred IV specifications indicate that, were a given prefecture to experience a one-
standard-deviation more severe contraction in exports, this would be associated with 0.27 more
recorded labor events per million workers ­ a sizable effect, given that the median strike intensity
in our dataset is 0.96. We confirm that this effect is driven by labor events in the manufacturing
sector, and where the underlying cause recorded was "wage arrears". These findings are robust
under a battery of sensitivity checks, including exercises that speak to recent Bartik IV best-
practice recommendations, in terms of validating the case for causal identification (Goldsmith-
Pinkham et al. 2018, Borusyak et al. 2018) and improving the statistical inference drawn (Ad~     ao
et al. 2018). On a related note, we obtain a consistent picture of the adverse impact of the
export shock when examining other contemporaneous economic outcome variables, such as the
manufacturing share of employment and average wages at the prefecture level.
    We then turn to the political responses that the export slowdown has triggered, in the
face of this increase in labor strife. First, we confirm that the export slowdown has raised
the attention paid to the issue of public security. To gain empirical traction on this, we rely
on the observation that there are phrases ­ most notably, "weiwen" ("") or "maintaining


                                                 3
social stability" ­ that have been adopted by the party establishment in China as watchwords
to communicate the importance of domestic law and order as a political priority (New York
Times, 2012).
    On the part of the general public, we demonstrate via an event study empirical specifica-
tion that occurrences of CLB strikes are accompanied by a significant increase, in the weeks
thereafter, in Baidu internet search engine queries related to "weiwen" () originating from
the prefecture in question. On the part of local political officeholders, we undertake a textual
analysis of prefecture work reports ­ an official speech delivered annually by the highest-ranking
local party official ­ to construct measures of the degree of "weiwen" emphasis in this policy
document. This includes a basic keyword count measure, as well as scores obtained from more
sophisticated machine-learning algorithms, namely the Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) and
Support Vector Machine (SVM) procedures, that have been used for the purposes of classifying
text passages. Across this range of textual analysis measures, and using a similar shift-share
identification strategy as above, we indeed find that a more severe shock to a prefecture's ex-
ports is associated in the subsequent year with a discernible rise in the emphasis placed on
"weiwen" in the annual work report.
    Next, we marshal evidence on the increased attention paid to domestic stability from data
on prefecture governments' fiscal expenditures, put together from disparate local statistical
yearbooks. In line with the above emphasis on "weiwen," we find that a more severe export
slowdown led to a subsequent rise in expenditures directed towards public security uses and
social spending, which can be viewed as measures to bolster stability by curbing unrest and by
ameliorating worker grievances respectively. We moreover find that younger local party secre-
taries were inclined to raise both forms of spending more, consistent with their having stronger
career concerns tied in with their performance in delivering stability. Interestingly, we detect
evidence that prefectures with stronger initial fiscal capacity were less inclined (relatively speak-
ing) to raise public security spending and more willing to expand social spending, suggesting
that the latter measures require a more sustained and intensive use of fiscal resources.
    As a final piece of evidence on political consequences, we examine patterns in the turnover
of local party secretaries (the highest ranked official at the prefecture level), using information
on career histories collected from their curricula vitae. We find that a more severe export
shock raised the likelihood of incumbent turnover, specifically that he/she would be laterally
re-assigned early in his/her tenure (before the three-year mark), leaving a dent on his/her
eventual promotion prospects. This was especially so in prefectures that also witnessed a high
level of "excess strikes", namely in excess of the level of labor events that would be predicted
from observed local economic conditions (including the extent of the export shock).
    These features are consistent with a simple model of political accountability "with Chinese
characteristics" that we develop, in which local officeholders can be removed by an upper-level
government who cares primarily about regime stability. This framework helps to organize our


                                                 4
set of findings on the political economy consequences of negative economic shocks in China and,
more broadly, in nondemocratic polities that feature strong state institutions. At the level of
the individual politician, the response measures adopted are similar to those which one might
observe in either a democracy or weak autocracy, entailing a combination of "carrots" (to shore
up support) and "sticks" (repression). Where the strong autocracy is distinct, though, lies in
the nature of how political accountability is exercised, namely within the system from above, in
contrast with democracies and weak autocracies, where the accountability often comes from the
ground, through the ballot box or violent removal respectively. We show that the distinction
has meaningful implications: It entails for instance that in strong autocracies, it is the local
officials with brighter prospects who are more likely to respond through repression. Moreover, a
key takeaway is that a central government who wants to properly incentivize local incumbents
in the face of negative economic shocks would indeed assess them by a relative benchmark
("excess strikes"), rather than against an absolute standard (the level of strikes).
    The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature. Section 3 describes
our main data sources, before Section 4 discusses the estimation framework and identification
strategy. Section 5 presents the main findings on the effects of the export slowdown on labor
strikes. Section 6 lays out a model linking export shocks, unrest, and incumbent behavior.
Sections 7 and 8 then report our empirical findings on the political emphasis on domestic
stability and on incumbent turnover. Section 9 concludes. Appendix A documents further
details related to the data, while Appendix B reports additional results and checks.


2       Related Literature
The empirical approach and the substantive findings in our paper engage three strands of work
in the literature.
    First and foremost, it connects with a broader set of studies on the political implications of
weak economic conditions. In the context of democracies, it has been argued that an incum-
bent's response to economic shocks can reveal information about his/her quality (e.g., Fearon
1999), and the threat of electoral punishment for a bad response can in turn be a powerful
incentive that shapes incumbents' behavior (e.g., Barro 1973, Ferejohn 1986).6 On the empiri-
cal side, this has led to an extensive body of work on "economic voting", to examine whether
voters do in fact hold politicians accountable for a weak economy at the ballot box (see for
example, Lewis-Beck 1998, Duch and Stevenson 2008).7 As a cautionary note though, this line
    6
     The systematic manner in which economic conditions can influence incumbent's decisions would also raise
the possibility of political business cycles (see Persson and Tabellini 2000).
   7
     It has been further argued that the nature of the relationship between economic weakness and voting
patterns would vary depending on the presence of an independent media (Besley and Burgess 2002), on other
local institutions (van der Brug et al. 2007), and on culture (Nunn et al. 2018). See also Healy et al. (2017)
who examine data on the motivations that drive economic voting at the individual level.


                                                      5
of research has also uncovered evidence that voters can mis-attribute negative economic shocks
to poor incumbent performance, resulting in their being punished by voters for what amounts
to bad luck that is out of their control (see the survey by Healy and Malhotra 2013).8
    On the other end of the spectrum, there is also a substantial literature on the impact of
economic shocks in weakly institutionalized polities. Bad economic times are seen to reduce the
opportunity cost of conflict, as well as generating dissatisfaction ("grievances") with incumbent
performance, both of which can translate into anti-incumbent political action. In the context of
weak states, such unrest can pose an immediate threat to the government of the day. Negative
shocks have been linked to political instability (e.g., Haggard and Kaufman 1995, Alesina et
al. 1996, Burke 2012), conflict (e.g., Miguel et al. 2004, Hendrix and Salehyan 2012, Bazzi and
Blattman 2014), coups (e.g., Dube and Vargas 2013, Kim 2016), and even democratic change
(e.g., Burke and Leigh 2010, Br¨ uckner and Ciccone 2011).9
    Less is known, however, about contexts in which governments are authoritarian, and thus
need not worry about electoral accountability, yet are sufficiently stable that they do not face
an immediate existential threat. China is a paramount example, though not an isolated case
in light of the recent "democratic recession" that appears to have increased the number of
authoritarian regimes around the world (Diamond 2015).10 The role of social protest in the
Chinese system has been investigated in its many facets (e.g., Chen 2012), but as far as we
can tell without a systematic quantitative assessment of the impact on incumbent behavior
at the local versus upper levels of government. Related to this, Lorentzen (2013) has argued
that protest in China, far from signaling regime weakness, is actually used as an information
extraction device by higher levels of government. Our findings are consistent with this view, and
moreover suggest that the higher-level decision-makers draw a distinction in their evaluation
of local leaders between incumbent performance and the impact of negative shocks that are
beyond the incumbent's control.
    Our paper relates to a second strand of literature on the labor market and worker effects of
exposure to international trade, on which we draw in our use of a shift-share IV strategy. While
many of these existing studies have focused on the consequences of an increase in exposure to
imports (Topalova 2010, Autor et al. 2013, Acemoglu et al. 2016, Dix-Carneiro and Kovak 2017,
Dix-Carneiro et al. 2018, etc.), we instead study the effects that shocks to export opportunities
can have on a key developing country.11 Along these lines, we also contribute to a growing
body of work that has explored how exposure to trade has affected political outcomes, including
legislative voting (Feingenbaum and Hall 2015), electoral voting (Jensen et al. 2017, Che et al.
   8
      For specific examples, see Achen and Bartels (2004), Leigh (2009), and Cole et al. (2012).
   9
      Interestingly, this link from economic setbacks to civil conflict has been studied for several historical episodes
in China when state institutions were weaker (see Jia 2014, Braggion et al. 2018).
   10
      Cases like Russia provide illustrations of the broad relevance of strong-state authoritarianism. See Levitsky
and Way (2015) though, for pushback on the extent of this democratic recession.
   11
      See McCaig (2011) for an exception in this regard, that explores how Vietnam's entry into export markets
affected poverty at the provincial level.

2018), political polarization (Autor et al. 2017), support for extremist parties (Dippel et al.
2018), and support for cross-border economic integration (Colantone and Stanig 2018).
    Last but not least, our study is related to the literature on China's political system, specifi-
cally the management of its cadres. The existing work has identified several salient determinants
of the promotion probability of government officials, including local economic performance (Li
and Zhou 2015), political connections (Jia et al. 2015), social ties (Fisman et al. 2015), and fac-
tions (Francois et al. 2016, Shih and Lee 2018). We complement these studies by showing that
the relative performance in maintaining social stability is a crucial determinant of the career
prospects of local officials. Our paper is thus linked to the literature on the career concerns
of politicians and how this can affect the allocation of public resources; see for example, Pers-
son and Zhuravskaya (2016) and Chen and Kung (2016, 2018) who study this in the context of
China. These papers focus on how promotion criterion based on economic outcomes has swayed
the use of fiscal resources towards spending that has a short-term effect on boosting economic
growth (such as construction projects). Our paper instead studies how economic shocks can
induce a shift in fiscal resources towards uses aimed at bolstering social stability.


3      Data Sources and Measures
We turn now to describe our empirical setting and key data sources. We describe in this
section the data on exports, labor strikes, and other local economic variables that we use to
first establish a relationship between export performance and incidents of labor unrest. We
postpone a discussion of the measures of political response and turnover to Sections 7-8, where
we will encounter those variables at greater length. Further details about the data construction
are provided in Appendix A.
    Throughout this paper, the unit of our analysis is the prefecture; this is an administrative
division in China that is smaller than a province, but larger than a county. All prefectures
in China are included, with the exception of Tibet due to data limitations. There are 333
prefectures in our sample, with a median land area of 12,980km2 and a median population of
3.25 million in 2010.12


3.1    Exports
We focus on the performance of manufacturing exports as our key local economic shock variable.
For this, we draw on trade data from China's General Administration of Customs, which
covers the universe of China's exporters and importers. For each trading firm, the customs

Note that k indexes HS 6-digit codes, and we include all products k that map to the manufac-

year 2010; this data are from the China Population Census, and includes all individuals both
with or without residency rights (hukou). Our analysis will be based on a panel that covers
the period t  {2013, 2014, 2015}, and we will consider the annual change in exports ­ defined
as ExpShockit = Exportit - Exporti,t-1 ­ as our main explanatory variable. By construction,
ExpShockit measures the change in manufacturing exports in 1000 USD per worker.

                                                Prefecture-Level Export Shock


   Figure 2 shows the distribution of ExpShockit across prefectures in the years leading up
to 2015.14 There is considerable spatial and temporal variation in this measure of the per
worker export shock. The export slowdown was particularly marked in 2015, with a mean
decline across prefectures of 373 USD per worker from the year before. More importantly,
there was substantial variation in the severity of the export shock; in 2015, for example, the
  13
     We use all HS product codes that map to SIC manufacturing industries, namely SIC industries with lead-
ing digit equal to 2 or 3. The mapping to SIC is from the World Integrated Trade Solutions (WITS) at:
https://wits.worldbank.org/product concordance.html.
  14
     For the purposes of this figure, the data have been top- and bottom-coded at the 5th and 95th percentile
values respectively across prefectures in any given year. Given the long tails in the export shock measure, we
take care to verify in the later regression analysis that our results are not driven by potential outliers.

standard deviation of ExpShockit across prefectures was 949 USD per worker (as reported in
the summary statistics in Panel A of Table 1).
    We will later verify the robustness of the results to using alternative export shock variables,
such as when excluding firms that are pure intermediaries, or when focusing on exports by firms
across ownership types (namely, privately-owned versus state-owned enterprises), these being
distinctions that are relevant in the context of China's export activities. Likewise, our findings
continue to hold when we work with an export shock variable that is constructed as an export
growth rate (rather than as a dollar value change).


3.2     Labor strikes
The data on labor strikes are drawn from the China Labour Bulletin (CLB), a non-profit
organization based in Hong Kong which has monitored and logged incidents of collective actions
by workers across mainland China since 2011. Up until 2017 (which includes our sample period),
the CLB gathered this information on a daily basis from online and media sources, including
but not limited to Sina Weibo, WeChat, Tianya, Baidu, and Google.15 In the absence of official
statistics on labor strikes, this data hosted on the CLB Strike Map have been used regularly by
news media outside of China to examine trends in worker actions within China.16 For each labor
event, the CLB records the date, location (at the prefecture level), and a short description of the
incident. For the vast majority of observations (>98%), the CLB provides further information
on: (i) the sector in which the worker action occurred (e.g., manufacturing, construction,
services); and (ii) its underlying cause (e.g., wage arrears, layoffs, work conditions). A total of
5,156 labor events were recorded for the 2012-2015 period, with most of these strikes occurring
in the manufacturing sector (36%), followed by construction (26%). The most common cause
cited ­ in about 60% of the cases ­ was employee demands over wage arrears.
    Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of CLB-recorded labor events across China during 2012-
2015. As is clear from this map, the labor events are spread out geographically, even while the
density of events appears to be higher in coastal regions that are manufacturing hubs, such
as the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta. The summary statistics in Table 1
point to an increase over time in the occurrence of strikes, as measured by the number of labor
events per million workers (with the denominator proxied by the population aged 15-64 in the
2010 Census). That said, there is substantial variation across prefectures in the extent of this
increase: While the average prefecture experienced a rise in strikes per million workers of 1.24
in 2015, the standard deviation associated with this measure was 1.77.
  15
     Starting in 2017, the CLB switched to updating on a weekly or twice-weekly basis, which potentially limits
the comparability of the data pre- and post-2017.

                                     Figure 3: CLB Map (2012-2015)




    Given the manner in which the data are collected, the CLB themselves are careful to ac-
knowledge that they do not have a complete record of all labor incidents. For our empirical
analysis though, what will be more crucial is whether the CLB data are adequately picking up
trends over time and across locations in the occurrence of labor strikes. To corroborate as best
we can this dimension of the data, we have compared the CLB data against official records on
the number of labor dispute cases where the involved parties have filed for mediation or arbitra-
tion, as reported in the China Labor Statistical Yearbooks published by the Ministry of Human
Resources and Social Security (MOHRSS). While this MOHRSS data is only available at the
more aggregate province level (and hence not ideal for a regression analysis), we nevertheless
view it as a useful measure of the frequency of labor disputes that can serve as a cross-check
to the CLB data.
    Panel A of Figure A.1 in the appendix plots the number of CLB labor events and MOHRSS
labor disputes aggregated at the national level between 2012-2015. Note that the total number
of CLB events (right vertical axis) is smaller than the total number of MOHRSS labor dis-
putes (left vertical axis).17 This could be due to strikes being a more extreme and hence less
frequent form of labor action; alternatively, this could simply reflect that the CLB do not cap-
ture all significant labor events that have taken place. More importantly for our purposes, the
CLB strike data clearly follow a similar upward trend as incidents of officially-recorded labor
disputes. Panel B of Figure A.1 further compares the annual changes in these two variables
  17
    For these checks, we use the total number of labor dispute cases raised either collectively or by individuals;
a very similar set of results is obtained when focusing only on collective labor disputes.



                                                       11
across provinces p and years t (t  {2013, 2014, 2015}). This confirms that annual changes in
the number of CLB-recorded strikes per million workers (EventsCLB         pt ) are positively corre-
lated with the corresponding changes in MOHRSS-recorded labor disputes per million workers
(EventsM  pt
             OHRSS
                    ).
    A more subtle concern is that the intensity of reporting on labor unrest could vary sys-
tematically with the extent of the economic shock experienced in a location. This would be
a source of nonclassical measurement error that could lead to a spurious negative correlation
between the number of CLB strikes and the change in exports, if internet sources were to in-
tensify their efforts to report on labor unrest in locations where the export shock was more
severe. Conversely, the reporting of labor disputes in the MOHRSS for such locations might
have actually declined, if local officials there had a greater incentive to discourage the filing of
labor disputes. We investigate this possibility by comparing the ratio of the number of CLB
to MOHRSS events, EventsCLB   pt  /EventsM   pt
                                                OHRSS
                                                      , against the observed change in the value of
exports per worker, where the latter are constructed using the analogue of (1) at the province
level. The correlation coefficient between these two variables turns out to be small (0.0032)
and not statistically significant.18 While we are unable to conduct a similar analysis at the
prefecture level due to data limitations, we take the above check as reassuring that such forms
of systematic reporting bias are unlikely to be prevalent in the data.


3.3     Other Local Economic Data
We also collected a set of socioeconomic variables at the prefecture level to be used as controls
or as additional local economic outcomes to be explored. These data were obtained from various
official Chinese sources. Data on the breakdown of the population by age group (in particular,
between the working ages of 15-64) and by internal migration status (hukou vs non-hukou) were
drawn from the 2010 Population Census.
    Data on other economic variables ­ such as the average wage level, gross industrial output
per capita, manufacturing employment share, college educated share of the population, mobile
and internet penetration rates ­ were computed from the China City Statistical Yearbooks.
Note that these yearbooks report only on urban prefectures, which reduces our coverage to
290 prefectures when these variables are used. Moreover, the data in these yearbooks that
pertain to labor markets (such as average wages) cover only the segment of the workforce with
hukou rights; to the extent that the non-hukou workforce may bear the brunt of the impact
of a negative export shock, the data would not directly pick up this effect. That said, this is
the best publicly-available data (to the best of our knowledge) that provides updates at the
prefecture level on an annual basis. (We present summary statistics for a selection of these
prefecture-level variables in Panel A of Table 1.)
  18
   The correlation between the annual change in this ratio of CLB to MOHRSS events and the province-level
export shock is likewise small (0.0384) and statistically not significant.

4      Empirical Strategy
In this section, we elaborate on the regression model and identification strategy that we adopt
to uncover the effects of the export slowdown on incidents of labor strikes. This forms the first
piece of evidence in our discussion of broader political economy outcomes in China.


4.1     Estimating Equation
Our baseline regression specification is as follows:

          (Event/L)it = 1 ExpShockit + 2 (Event/L)i,t-1 + X Xit + Dpt + Di + it ,                            (2)

where i denotes prefecture and t denotes year. The dependent variable (Event/L)it is the
change in number of CLB-recorded labor events per million workers, while the key explanatory
variable ExpShockit is the change in manufacturing exports per worker previously defined in
(1); both of these variables are constructed as changes between year t - 1 and t. The regression
sample stacks the first differences of three periods, 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and 2014-2015, and
includes province-by-year dummies, Dpt , and prefecture dummies, Di . The first-differencing
removes any time-invariant determinants of labor unrest that are specific to each prefecture.
The Dpt and Di further account for any province-specific shocks across different time periods, as
well as any prefecture-specific linear time trends in strike intensity, respectively. As a result, the
coefficient 1 is being identified off variation in export shifts across prefectures within provinces,
as well as within prefectures over time.
    With regard to the other right-hand side variables, the Xit refers to a set of time-varying
prefecture characteristics which we control for as potential alternative determinants of labor
strikes. We also include the lagged number of CLB events per worker (Event/L)i,t-1 , to control
for any tendency towards mean reversion in the occurrence of strikes; our findings are similar
even if we were to drop this variable (see Table B.1). We cluster the standard errors by
province to accommodate the possibility of unobserved correlated shocks across prefectures
within a given provincial unit.19 In practice, we run the regressions weighting each observation
by the working-age population in 2010, although this is not material for our results (see Table
B.1 for the unweighted regressions).


4.2     Instrumental Variable
An immediate concern that arises with ordinary least-squares estimates of (2) is the issue of
reverse causality, namely that it could instead be the occurrence of labor strikes that is adversely
  19
    In Table B.8, we demonstrate that the findings continue to hold under alternative clustering schemes that
seek to account for the concern in Ad~
                                     ao et al. (2018), namely that the regression error terms could be correlated
across prefectures that need not be geographically proximate, yet feature a similar initial export product mix.

affecting export performance. We therefore construct a shift-share or Bartik IV for the export
shock variable, to make a clearer case for a causal relationship running from a slowdown in
exports to a rise in strikes. This IV combines information on the initial export mix within
Chinese prefectures together with product-level shifts in world trade flows excluding China
(henceforth, referred to as the "rest of the world" or ROW). To be more specific, we construct
the following IV for ExpShockit :
                                                                            ROW
                                                              Xik,2010 Xkt
                              ExpShockROWit =                                    .                             (3)
                                                        k     i Xik,2010 Li,2000


                    ROW        ROW       ROW
In the above, Xkt         Xkt       - Xk,t -1 is the change in the value of product-k trade flows
from the ROW to the ROW, based on data on HS 6-digit product-level flows from UN Com-
trade. Each product-k shift is then apportioned to prefectures within China using weights
Xik,2010 / i Xik,2010 that reflect the importance of each prefecture i as an exporter of product k
in a pre-sample year (2010), as constructed from the Chinese customs data. We express the IV
as an export shock in units of 1000 USD per worker, by dividing by the working-age population
in prefecture i in the 2000 Census, Li,2000 ; we use data from an earlier census since using the
same denominator as in the construction of ExpShockit might artificially boost the first-stage
correlation of the IV.
    The validity of (3) as an instrument rests on the assumption that, conditional on the
province-year and prefecture fixed effects, ExpShockROWit is uncorrelated with other time-
varying, prefecture-specific determinants of the outcome variable that would be captured in
the regression residual, it , in (2). Given the Bartik-style construction, one would need to be
reassured that the it are uncorrelated with: (i) the initial export structure of the prefecture,
and (ii) the product-specific export shocks observed at the national level. With regard to (i),
a natural concern is that the initial export structure might directly drive prefecture-specific
trends in labor strikes per capita. The inclusion of the Di fixed effects helps precisely to guard
against this concern, to the extent that the underlying trends are linear in nature.20
                                                                         ROW
    With regard to (ii), we view the rest-of-the-world trade shifts, Xkt     , as primarily picking
up demand shocks that are external to China. This is supported by studies such as the IMF
World Economic Outlook (Aslam et al. 2016), which found that about 60-80% of the global
trade slowdown during this period was attributable to demand-side forces, specifically the weak
recovery in world demand after the global financial crisis; these conclusions were reached via
two separate methodologies, namely a reduced-form regression analysis and a model-based
structural decomposition.21 By contrast, supply-side forces and increases in trade frictions
  20
     See for example McCaig (2011), who differences his outcome variable relative to pre-shock data to address
this issue of confounding location-specific time trends that could be correlated with initial industry composition.
With the inclusion of prefecture fixed effects, our empirical strategy is similar to his.
  21
     The regression-based analysis estimated an import demand system, which delivered the 80% headline num-
ber for the contribution of aggregate demand forces to the global trade slowdown. On the other hand, the


                                                        14
played a smaller role in comparison. In our present empirical context, what this means is that
the shift-share IV we construct plausibly leverages on sources of variation in world trade flows
that are driven by foreign demand conditions, and then projects these onto each prefecture on
the basis of pre-determined product weights.
    While (3) serves as our baseline IV, we will explore the use of alternative constructions to
further isolate variation in the ROW product-level trade flows that is driven by foreign demand
forces. This includes a version that exploits the variation across importing countries (to capture
destination-specific demand forces), as well as measures that seek to filter out demand shifts
in foreign markets via a gravity-equation approach. We are also cognizant of the concern that
          ROW
the Xkt        terms might be incidentally correlated with domestic demand or domestic supply
shocks stemming from within China, and so we will report robustness results in which we make
an effort to control for these latter forces. (We defer a more detailed discussion of these and
other checks on the validity of the Bartik IV strategy to Section 5.2.)
    It is helpful at this juncture to discuss how the manner of construction of the IV in (3) com-
pares with the empirical approach in Autor et al. (2013). Our application studies the effects of
export shocks, rather than a shock to import competition. In addition, we adopt export shares
(Xik,2010 / i Xik,2010 ) when building our instrument, instead of analogous employment share
weights as in Autor et al. (2013). As shown in Appendix A.2, the export shock defined in equa-
tion (3) that uses export-share weights can be rationalized by log-linearizing the relationship
between exports and external demand shifts. Moreover, if one were to instead apportion the
                     ROW
export shocks Xkt          on the basis of employment shares, this could systematically over-state
the importance of export exposure in prefectures that are on the whole less export-oriented
(such as China's inland provinces). Last but not least, we have the benefit of the detailed
Chinese customs data from which the HS 6-digit export weights can be readily computed.


5     Effects of Export Shocks on Labor Strikes
We turn now to present our core findings on the effect of export performance on labor strikes at
the prefecture level (Section 5.1). We include in this section a discussion of robustness checks
and validation exercises for the Bartik IV strategy (Section 5.2), as well as further corroborating
evidence drawing on available data on other labor market and economic outcomes (Section 5.3).


5.1     Baseline Results
Table 2 first reports our baseline results. Column 1 presents the OLS estimates of the specifi-
cation in equation (2), revealing that an export slowdown (i.e., a more negative ExpShockit )
model-based decomposition built off the multi-country model of production and trade of Eaton et al. (2016);
this approach yielded a 60% figure for the contribution of aggregate demand forces to the decline in trade as a
share of world GDP.

            umn 4 reports the reduced-form where the Bartik IV is used directly in place of ExpShockit in an
            OLS regression. The additional control variables in Columns 3-4 are constructed as changes in log
            shares relative to prefecture population size, where the changes are taken between year t - 1 and t.

was indeed associated with a rise in CLB-recorded labor events per worker. We proceed to
instrument in Column 2 for the export shock using the shift-share variable defined in (3).22
The IV estimate points to a negative and statistically significant effect of the export shock in
raising the occurrence of strikes, that is moreover larger in magnitude than the OLS estimate.
This could be due to the standard attenuation bias arising from measurement error in the ex-
port shock variable. Alternatively, the OLS estimate in Column 1 may have been subject to
omitted variables bias; for example, unobserved supply shocks due to automation could boost
exports while also inducing more labor unrest from displaced workers, which would dampen
the magnitude of the export shock coefficient, 1 . To the extent that the Bartik IV satisfies the
exclusion restriction, it would leverage a component of ExpShockit that is orthogonal to such
supply shocks to yield an estimate of 1 that is not confounded by such forces.
    We incorporate in Column 3 a set of concurrent socioeconomic shifts that could indepen-
  22
     Although we do not report the estimates to save space, the shift-share IV is indeed positively correlated
with the export shock. The table does report the F-stats; these are all in excess of the rule-of-thumb value of
10, indicating that the first stage is highly relevant for explaining the variation in ExpShockit .

dently affect labor unrest. We control for the change in the log college-enrolled share of the
general population, motivated by related work that has shown that individuals with higher
levels of education have a greater propensity to engage in civic and even protest actions (see for
example, Campante and Chor 2012). We further include the contemporaneous changes in the
shares of mobile phone and internet subscribers in the prefecture population, to account for the
diffusion of digital information and communication technology (ICT) and its potential role in
facilitating the mobilization of workers (Manacorda and Tesei 2016, Campante et al. 2018). We
find that these control variables each exhibit a positive correlation with the occurrence of labor
strikes, with the role of broader access to ICT even being statistically significant.23 That said,
the estimated effect of the export shock on increases in strikes remains stable even when these
further controls are used. Lastly, Column 4 reports the reduced-form effect of our shift-share
variable on strike intensity in an OLS regression, to confirm that a decrease in the ROW export
shock is directly relevant for explaining a rise in incidents of labor unrest.
    To gauge the magnitude of the implied effects, we consider the differential change in strike
intensity that would be induced by a one standard deviation shift in the export shock (about
$841 per worker). The 1 point estimate from Column 3 translates this into 0.27 more strike
events per million workers, which is fairly sizeable considering that the median occurrence of
strikes in our sample is 0.96 per million workers.
    We explore next the nature and causes of these labor strikes in more detail. Making use
of the breakdown of these labor events by sector (as reported in the CLB), Table 3 confirms
that the observed effect on labor strikes was indeed concentrated in the manufacturing sector
(Column 1). Note that we run IV regressions in this table following the specification in Column
3 of Table 2, but use instead as the dependent variable the annual change in labor events in
the respective sector (normalized once again by the 2010 prefecture working age population);
when we do so, we also use a sector-specific measure of (Event/L)i,t-1 on the right-hand side.24
Bearing in mind that ExpShockit was constructed from manufacturing product trade flows, this
finding verifies that the manufacturing sector did indeed bear the brunt of the labor market
fallout. This also affected workers in construction and services (Columns 2 and 5), albeit with
smaller estimated effects. On the other hand, the export slowdown was not systematically
linked with labor unrest in the mining and transportation sectors (Columns 3 and 4).25
  23
      These auxiliary control variables are constructed as changes between year t - 1 and t (i.e., contemporaneous
with the dependent variable). Our findings are also robust if we were to further include the changes in log
average wage and log gross domestic product per capita from the China City Statistical Yearbooks; we however
do not use these latter variables in the baseline tables as these are potentially direct outcomes of the export
shock (results available on request).
   24
      The five sectors considered in Table 3 account for about 90% of all CLB labor incidents. The sectors omitted
from the table are "Education", "Retail", and "Others".
   25
      There are two possible explanations for the larger spillover effects of the export shock in construction and
services. First, the skills developed in the manufacturing sector could be less directly transferable to jobs in
mining and transportation. Second, the state plays a relatively larger role in mining and transportation, and so
could provide more of a buffer to cushion workers in these sectors from negative shocks. For example, according

    Table 4 further exploits the available information on the reported causes of the labor events.
We consider three categories of employee demands, namely arising from: (i) wage arrears (the
most commonly-cited cause); (ii) wage arrears and/or layoffs; and (iii) all other causes (not
wage arrears or layoffs, which includes for example disputes over work conditions).26 Using an
IV specification analogous to that in Table 3, the results in Table 4 confirm that negative export
shocks prompted an increase in labor strikes over wage arrears (Column 1), with an even larger
estimated effect if strikes related to layoffs are also considered (Column 2). By contrast, we
find no statistically significant effect of ExpShockit on labor events from other residual causes
(Column 3). We obtain a similar set of findings when restricting the labor events to those
strikes that occurred in the manufacturing sector: While we do now find a significant effect
of an export shock on labor events associated with residual causes (Column 5), this effect is
much smaller in magnitude compared to the rise in strikes over wage arrears or layoffs (Column
4). Viewed together, the patterns in Tables 3 and 4 are consistent with a broader narrative
of weakening labor market outcomes particularly in the manufacturing sector, leading to an
increase in expressions of worker distress arising from unpaid wages or layoffs.
    In Table 5, we look into several facets of the prefecture-level export shock variable. Col-
umn 1 considers whether spatial correlation in the export shock experienced across prefectures
to the 2013 Economic Census, the share of employment by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) was only 4.7% in
the construction sector, while the corresponding employment share was 27.5% for the transportation sector.

     Where multiple causes were cited for an event, we counted the incident as being about "wage arrears"
(respectively, "layoffs") if the term appeared anywhere in the list of recorded employee demands.

  Notes: The dependent variable is the change in CLB-recorded events per million workers in prefecture i between year t - 1 and t, for
 which the recorded cause is as indicated in the column heading; Columns 1-3 include events across all sectors, while Columns 4-5 include
 only events that occurred in the manufacturing sector. The "Events per million workersi,t-1 " variable is the corresponding economy-wide
 or manufacturing-specific level of CLB events per worker by recorded cause at time t - 1. All columns report IV regressions, weighted by
 the prefecture's working-age population in 2010. The additional time-t controls are those used in Column 3 of Table 2, namely: the changes
 in the log college-enrolled, mobile-use, and internet-use shares. Robust standard errors are clustered at the province level. *** p<0.01, **

might confound the interpretation of our regression findings. To address this, we construct
the working-age population-weighted average of ExpShock across all prefectures that share an
administrative border with i; when we include this as an additional right-hand side variable, we
further instrument for it with an analogous neighboring-prefecture weighted-average measure
of ExpShockROW . While the estimates in Column 1 point to interesting evidence of spatial
spillovers from negative shocks in neighboring prefectures, this does not detract from the im-
portance of the local export shock for explaining the rise in labor incidents in prefecture i itself.
In Column 2, we examine if the time-(t + 1) export shock might have explanatory power for
the incidence of strikes at time t, by replacing the contemporaneous export shock variable in
(2) with ExpShocki,t+1 , and instrumenting for it with the time-(t + 1) Bartik variable. Com-
pared to the baseline results in Column 3 of Table 2, the export shock coefficient is smaller in
magnitude and statistically insignificant. This helps to allay the concern that our results could
be driven by pre-determined trends at the prefecture level in the evolution of exports that are
in turn spuriously correlated with labor market outcomes.
    Motivated by the anecdotal reports of factory closures, we examine in Column 3 whether the
rise in labor incidents can be linked to firm exit induced by the slowdown in exports. To do so,
we split ExpShockit into a component that reflects episodes of firm exit from exporting ­ here,
defined as those firms that record positive exports in the customs data (in year t - 1), but cease

  Notes: The dependent variable is the change in CLB-recorded events per million workers in prefecture i between year t - 1 and
 t. All regressions are weighted by the prefecture's working-age population in 2010. Columns 1, 2 and 5 report IV estimates,
 while Columns 3 and 4 are OLS regressions. Column 1 controls for a working-age population weighted-average export shock
 measure in neighboring prefectures; we use an IV that is the corresponding weighted-average Bartik variable across neighboring
 prefectures. Column 2 examines whether the time t to t + 1 export shock has explanatory power for the increase in labor strikes
 between year t - 1 and t. Column 3 breaks down the export shock into the contribution from firms that exit from exporting versus
 stayers/new entrants. Column 4 breaks down the contribution of SOEs versus non-SOEs. Column 5 studies heterogeneous effects
 across prefectures that differ along initial characteristics. The additional time-t controls are those used in Column 3 of Table 2,
 namely: the changes in the log college-enrolled, mobile-use, and internet-use shares. Robust standard errors are clustered at the
 province level. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.



to export for two consecutive years (in years t and t + 1) ­ and a remaining component that
corresponds to continuing or new exporters. We use the former as a proxy for the exit margin
of the export shock, in the absence of direct data on firm or plant closures; we also present OLS
estimates, as it is not straightforward to propose two plausible IVs for the separate components


                                                                 20
of ExpShockit . We find in Column 3 that it is indeed the exit margin that drives the overall
negative correlation between the export shock and a rise in labor strikes. Column 4 presents an
alternative breakdown of ExpShockit into that attributable to state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
versus non-SOEs (which includes private domestic and foreign-owned firms). That the non-
SOE margin accounts for the export shock effect on labor incidents suggests that SOEs played
a role during the export slowdown as a buffer for local employment conditions.
    Finally, in Column 5, we investigate how the effects of the export shock varied across
prefectures that differ along certain initial characteristics. We find quite intuitively that the
negative effect of an export slowdown on labor strikes was more muted in prefectures where
the local government: (i) exhibited a greater capacity to manage unrest (as proxied by the
initial 2012 fiscal expenditure per worker on public security uses); and (ii) accounted for a
greater share of employment (as proxied by the share of workers employed in government and
party agencies, from the 2010 Census). Conversely, the effect of ExpShockit was exacerbated in
prefectures with a larger initial share of migrant workers (as measured by the population share
without hukou, from the 2010 Census). This would be consistent with the interpretation that,
with restricted access to social security benefits in the prefecture where they work, migrant
workers were less protected from export-induced income shocks and hence more prone to strike
when economic conditions took a turn for the worse. Lastly, we also find a negative interaction
effect between ExpShockit and the population share with at least some college education (from
the 2010 Census); this aligns with existing cross-country evidence that periods of economic
downturn are more strongly accompanied by rises in political protest in locations that feature
higher levels of educational attainment (Campante and Chor 2012).


5.2    Further Robustness Checks
In this subsection, we report on an extensive series of checks, including several exercises that
draw on recommendations in the recent literature pertaining to the use of a Bartik IV strategy.
We keep the exposition brisk here in the interest of brevity, with details relegated to Appendix
B. While the discussion is written around the effects of the export slowdown on the rise in
labor strikes, note that the appendix tables report these checks too for the political response
outcome variables (i.e., the textual analysis, fiscal spending, and incumbent turnover measures)
that the paper will turn to after this section. (Readers who prefer not to dwell on these checks
can proceed directly to that material starting in Section 6.)
    Basic Checks: We start in Panel A of Table B.1 by replacing the province-year fixed
effects in (2) with region-year fixed effects. This allows us to retain in the regression sample
several large and economically important prefectures (namely, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and
Chongqing) that would otherwise be dropped, as these are prefectures that make up their entire
province. Reverting to province-year fixed effects, Panel B reruns the IV regressions without


                                               21
weights, while Panel C drops the lag (Events/L) variable from the right-hand side. Our baseline
results are not overturned by any of these specification checks.
    We also address potential concerns about outlier observations. Figure B.1 in the appendix
is a residual scatterplot, based on the estimates from Column 3 of Table 2, which provides
reassurance that no observation is unduly influential for the negative slope coefficient of the
export shock variable. In Table B.2, we further confirm that no individual province is driving the
statistical significance of our results, by reporting the range of ExpShockit coefficient estimates
when dropping one entire province at a time. (Please see Appendix B.1 for further details).
    Other Prefecture-Level Shocks: The interpretation of our results could be undermined if
the ROW demand shocks in the Bartik IV were incidentally correlated with demand shocks that
originate from within China. If so, our baseline estimates may not be picking up the effects of
export demand per se. We address this concern by adding a proxy for domestic demand shocks
as a control variable. For this proxy, we draw on the China Industry Statistical Yearbooks to
compute domestic absorption (i.e., Absorptionjt = Outputjt - Exportjt + Importjt ) for four-
digit Chinese Standard Industrial Classification (CSIC) industries (indexed by j ). We then map
industry-level changes in absorption (Absorptionjt , between years t - 1 and t) to each prefec-
                                                                                L 2010 Absorptionjt

                                                                                i Lij,2010 Li,2000
Here, Lij,2010 / i Lij,2010 is prefecture i's share of industry-j employment (from the 2010 China
Annual Survey of Industrial Firms), and Li,2000 is the working-age population (from the 2000
Census); see Appendix B.2 for further details and related discussion.27
    There is an analogous concern that the ROW demand shocks might be correlated with
Chinese domestic supply shocks. We address this via a similar approach, by controlling for a
Bartik-style measure of prefecture-level output shocks constructed as above, but with Outputjt
in place of Absorptionjt . Even with these controls, the estimated effect of the export shock
remains robust; this holds regardless of whether we add the domestic demand and output proxies
separately (Panels A and B, Table B.3), or jointly in the same regression (Panel C).28 We have
similarly constructed a prefecture-level import shock measure ­ by replacing Absorptionjt
with Importjt in the above definition of AbsorptionShockit ­ to control for changes in imports
amidst the broader trade slowdown.29 Including this measure of import shocks has little bearing
  27
     One could in principle construct absorption at the prefecture level directly with the information on firm-level
output and location that would be available in the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms. We instead adopted this
approach through industry-level absorption, as the Annual Survey is not publicly accessible (to the best of our
knowledge) for the years after 2013.
  28
     Figure B.2 illustrates that the correlation between Absorptionjt and Outputjt on the one hand, and the
CSIC industry-level export shock on the other hand, is low; the respective slope coefficients are not statistically
different from zero. This provides further reassurance that our export shock variable is unlikely to be picking
up the roles of domestic demand or supply shocks.
  29
     In principle, an increase in imports may have two offsetting effects on labor unrest, and the overall effect is
ex-ante ambiguous. On the one hand, imports could replace local production, which could induce more labor-
related unrest. On the other hand, imported intermediate inputs may be complementary to domestic labor,
and hence reduce strikes instead.

on the estimated export shock coefficient (Panel D).
    Alternative Bartik IVs: We experiment with alternative constructions of the Bartik
IV in Table B.4. In Panel A, we show that our results are similar when we exclude exports
by intermediary firms from the prefecture-level ExpShock and ExpShockROW variables.30
This allays the criticism that changes in exports recorded by intermediary firms may not re-
flect actual shocks to manufacturing production in the local labor market. In Panel B, we
incorporate information on export shocks across destinations by constructing the Bartik IV
                                     ROW
                    Xidk,2010 Xdkt                  ROW
as:     k  d=CHN       X idk,2010 Li, 2010
                                           . Here, Xdkt denotes the change in exports of product
                     i
k from the ROW to country d between years t - 1 and t, while Xidk,2010 / i Xidk,2010 is the
share of China's exports of product k to destination d that accrue to prefecture i in the base
year (2010). This in principle exploits variation across destinations in product-level demand
shocks in the identification strategy. We next follow Redding and Venebles (2004) to back out
importer product-specific demand shocks, recovering these off estimates of importer-year fixed
effects from gravity equations that have been run separately for each product. We then compute
the implied trade shifts that can be attributed to the evolution of these importer-by-product
demand forces, and use these to build two Bartik measures: (i) one that is analogous to the
baseline IV in (3); and (ii) a version that makes use of the variation across destinations d, that
is analogous to the measure in Panel B above. The results when using these respective gravity-
based measures as IVs are reported in Panels C and D. Last but not least for this table, we have
also worked with an export shock measure that is based on product-level export growth rates,
rather than on dollar changes per worker (Panel E). Our main findings remain unaffected under
each of these alternatives to our Bartik IV; please see Appendix B.3 for additional details.
    Validating the Bartik Strategy: We carefully address a series of issues that may af-
fect confidence in the Bartik identification approach. Importantly, like all studies employing
Bartik-style IVs, one has to establish that the results are not simply due to initial special-
ization in certain industries that display pre-determined trends, which then are driving the
outcomes of interest. For example, labor unrest could be trending up in the textile industry,
and hence prefectures specializing in textile products would experience more strikes even in the
absence of export shocks. This issue is at the heart of Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2018), who
emphasize how with Bartik-style IVs, one can view identification as stemming from the exo-
geneity of the initial shares. Note that the Di fixed effects in specification (2) already account
for prefecture-specific linear time trends in the outcome variable. To further alleviate concern
about unobserved supply shocks with a non-linear pre-trend that are associated with certain
products, we show that the results are robust to dropping each individual HS section ­ and
reconstructing the ExpShockit measure and ExpShockROWit IV ­ one at a time (see Table
B.5 and Appendix B.4 for details). In addition, we pick up on the test in Column 2 of Table 5,
  30
    We follow the approach of Ahn et al. (2011) and drop firms with names containing Chinese characters that
are the English-equivalent of "importer", "exporter", and/or "trading".


                                                    23
to show that future export shocks have little explanatory power for contemporaneous outcomes;
this holds not just for labor strikes, but also for the set of political response variables we will
study (see Table B.6 and Appendix B.5). This indicates that prefecture-specific pre-trends are
unlikely to be at the root of our results.
    As discussed in Borusyak et al. (2018), the validity of a Bartik IV can be interpreted as
relying instead on the assumption that shocks ­ in our case, at the product level ­ are as good as
randomly assigned. This identification assumption may be violated if export demand decreases
more in industries that tend to concentrate in prefectures with certain baseline characteristics
that themselves have independent effects on local social stability. We therefore follow Borusyak
et al. (2018) and test whether the export shocks are balanced across an exposure-weighted
average of initial prefecture characteristics; the characteristics we consider are: the share of
workers with college education, share of manufacturing employment, export-to-GDP ratio, share
of population without hukou, log GDP per capita, and log fiscal revenue per capita. Table B.7
reports the results of the balance test, and more details are provided in Appendix B.6. It is
reassuring that none of the estimated correlations is statistically significant at conventional
levels. Moreover, the p-value for the joint test of significance across all six variables is 0.837.
    Alternative Statistical Inference: As a baseline, we have reported standard errors clus-
tered at the province level. This allows for arbitrary within-province correlation in the regression
error terms, but no cross-province correlation. In the context of Bartik IVs though, Ad~    ao et al.
(2018) have pointed out that prefectures located in different provinces could experience corre-
lated shocks if they share a similar initial product-level export mix. We have thus verified that
the statistical inference we draw is robust under alternative clustering protocols, including a
two-way clustering by province and by a separate partitioning of the prefectures based on an
export similarity index (see Appendix B.7 and Table B.8 for details).


5.3    Other Labor Market and Economic Outcomes
Our analysis to this point has focused on labor strikes as the key outcome variable. That
said, if the effect of the export slowdown we have been describing is indeed operative, we
should expect too to observe weakened outcomes in other measures related to employment
and output, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Table 6 provides corroborating evidence
on this front, with several alternative labor market and economic outcomes that could be
constructed from the available data in the China City Statistical Yearbooks. (We adopt the
same IV specification as in (2), but replace (Event/L)it and (Event/L)i,t-1 respectively with
the change in the economic outcome measure in question and its lag level.)
    The message that emerges from Table 6 is consistent with the broader narrative that the ex-
port slowdown induced turbulence in the manufacturing sector. We find that a negative export
shock was linked with a decline in the ratio of manufacturing employment to prefecture popu-

lation (Column 1), with no significant effect on the corresponding ratio for non-manufacturing
employment (Column 2). Moreover, gross industrial output in both per capita and per worker
terms declined in response to the slowdown in manufacturing exports (Columns 3 and 4). We
obtain too an effect on average wages that is of the expected sign ­ a decrease in exports would
reduce prefecture wages ­ although this point estimate is not statistically significant (Column
5). Note though that the average wage measure available in the statistical yearbooks covers in
principle workers in all sectors, and so would be a noisy reflection of wage conditions that are
specific to the manufacturing sector.


6      Political Response to Export Shocks: A Simple Model
Having established that prefecture-level export shocks prompt the emergence of labor unrest, we
now turn to study the response of China's political system. We are interested in the reaction
by local leaders who are most directly exposed to the events on the ground, as well as by
decision-makers in the upper levels of government.
    To organize our thinking on these fronts, we develop a simple model of career concerns
following Persson and Zhuravskaya (2014). In the model, a local (prefecture) incumbent can
engage in costly measures to bolster social stability when faced with a negative export shock.
The local incumbent's performance is in turn evaluated by an upper-level decision-maker (the
province or central government), who considers whether to retain or remove its local agent.


                                                                      25
While the model is relatively stylized, it nevertheless yields predictions on the level of effort
expended by the prefecture leader on stability measures that our subsequent empirical analysis
can relate to. It moreover sheds light on the decision rule that would be adopted by the
upper-level government in order to best incentivize the local incumbent's actions.


6.1    Setup
Consider a setting with two time periods. In the first period, the prefecture experiences an
external export shock denoted by x  [0, 1]; note that x is increasing in the export performance
of the prefecture, so that we associate a lower value of x with an export slowdown. We thus
assume that local stability y is given by:

                                      y = x + (1 - x)s + ,

where the first term, x, reflects the direct effect of the export shock on stability. The second
term, (1 - x)s, captures how the local government's use of fiscal resources (denoted by s) can
counteract the decline in stability that would accompany an export slowdown. We view s as
encapsulating various measures that could contribute towards local stability. This includes
public security spending to repress unrest ("sticks"), as well as social spending to soften the
economic impact on workers ("carrots"), both of which we are able to observe in the prefecture-
level fiscal data. We assume the measures s to be particularly effective at bolstering stability
when export conditions are weak, or conversely, that these measures are less crucial from the
standpoint of domestic stability when the economy is in healthy shape. For example, the
general public might perceive social spending as less attractive, and might find the use of
repression for its own sake uncalled for, when economic conditions are strong. The final term,
  N (0,  2 ), is an iid stochastic draw, which captures unobserved factors that influence the
realized level of stability. We interpret those as encompassing, for instance, the way unobserved
leader characteristics interact with local circumstances to affect political stability.
    The local party secretary (henceforth, he/him) is appointed for one period, but can be
reappointed or replaced for the second. Each period in office affords him rents R. In the first
period, after observing the export shock, he decides how much prefecture fiscal resources s
to devote to maintaining stability. At the end of the first period, the upper-level government
(henceforth, she/her) observes the realized value of stability y , and evaluates the incumbent. We
assume that she has complete information about the export shock x; in particular, the export
shock itself will not be mis-attributed to the local incumbent's performance. The upper-level
government will then follow a threshold strategy, keeping the incumbent if y exceeds y       ¯(x) ­
a threshold that depends on the observed shock ­ while replacing him otherwise from a pool
of potential officeholders who are all ex ante identical. (For simplicity, the baseline model
leaves aside the issue of selection on the basis of ability, and focuses instead on the provision

                                                26
of incentives to incumbents. We show in Appendix B.8 that the insights still obtain when we
allow incumbents to differ in their innate effectiveness in boosting stability, and incorporate
formally a concern with screening out low-ability incumbents.)
    The officeholder then chooses s in order to maximize:

                                       ¯(x)) R - g (s)
                           U = Pr (y > y
                             = (1 -  [¯
                                      y (x) - x - (1 - x)s]) R - g (s)

where (·) denotes the cdf of the normal distribution for , and g (s) is the cost of stability-
enhancing measures. Note that this cost function satisfies: g (0) = 0, g (s) > 0, and g (s)  0
(while being strictly positive over some range of the support of s). The first-order condition for
an interior solution is then:

                            y (x) - x - (1 - x)s] (1 - x)R = g (s),
                           [¯                                                                  (4)

where (·) is the pdf of the N (0,  2 ) normal distribution. Denote by s a solution to (4).
    Turning to the strategic considerations of the upper-level government, we assume that she is
concerned with maximizing the expected stability level, i.e., E (y ) = x +(1 - x)s, which increases
with s. Therefore, she can optimize the incumbent's effort towards maintaining stability by
suitably choosing y¯(x), such that the argument of (·) is zero, i.e., y   ¯ (x) = x + (1 - x)s .
Plugging this into equation (4), that first-order condition can be rewritten as:

                                     (1 - x)R
                                              = g (s ).                                        (5)
                                        2   2



6.2    Model Predictions
We consider the model's implications for two political outcomes which our data will speak to,
namely: the effort expended by the local incumbent on stability measures, and the likelihood
of replacement by the upper-level government.
                                                                 2
    Incumbent Effort: Let us assume for simplicity that g (s) = s
                                                                2
                                                                   , where  > 0 is a parameter
that governs the marginal cost of effort. This yields:

                                               (1 - x)R
                                         s =            ,                                      (6)
                                                 2 2

which renders the following predictions. In response to negative export shocks:
                                                       
  (i) expenditure on stability measures increases ( ds
                                                    dx
                                                       < 0);

 (ii) the increase in expenditure on stability measures is greater for incumbents who obtain a
                      d 2 s
      higher rent R ( dxdR  < 0); and

                                                27
 (iii) the increase in expenditure on stability measures is greater for incumbents with a smaller
                                    d2 s
       cost of fiscal resources,  ( dxd  > 0).

    Intuitively, a negative export shock increases the need for and effectiveness of spending
to bolster social stability, which delivers (i). Moreover, an incumbent who can expect higher
rents will have a magnified response to negative shocks, which yields prediction (ii). Similarly,
incumbents who incur a lower fiscal cost of implementing stability measures will respond more
strongly, as per (iii).31 As we will see in Section 7.2, we will relate these latter two predictions
to several observed prefecture and incumbent characteristics in our empirical exploration.
    Turnover: Under what circumstances will the local incumbent be replaced? It is straight-
forward to see that y - y ¯ (x) = , from which it follows that the likelihood of turnover is equal
to (-) and does not depend on the export shock x. This is because the threshold y              ¯ (x)
adjusts in response to the export shock, in order to properly incentivize the local incumbent to
exert effort to curb instability when exports have been hit by a slowdown. In other words, the
above framework implies that a local incumbent is removed not because of an adverse external
export shock per se, but rather because of "excess" strikes above what the upper-level govern-
ment adjudges to be tolerable, i.e., y - y  ¯ (x). This distinction is particularly relevant in our
empirical setting, since we seek to exploit variation from export shocks originating in the rest
of the world, that would in principle be outside the control of local incumbents. We will thus
take this notion of "excess strikes" seriously when we look empirically at the determinants of
incumbent turnover in Section 8.
    Note that this baseline model has the implication that the local leader's prospects for re-
tention are driven entirely by the realization of a stochastic draw for . This is a feature that
can be relaxed, as shown in the extension in Appendix B.8, where the upper-level government's
desire to select high-ability incumbents will induce the latter to raise their effort on bolstering
local stability, which in turn lowers their likelihood of being replaced. The crucial insight is
preserved though, namely that the threshold for removal of an incumbent will take into account
the circumstances under which he operates.32


7      Political Response: Preserving Social Stability
We now turn to the empirical investigation on the political reaction to the export slowdown
and the consequent rise in labor unrest. We document here evidence confirming that these
developments triggered a more acute concern over social stability, both from the public at large
and from local officeholders. The latter was reflected in an increased emphasis on matters of
  31
     Predictions (ii) and (iii) would hold under more general effort cost functions. In particular, it is sufficient
(but not necessary) that the marginal cost g (s) be convex at the equilibrium effort level s .
  32
     This relates to the literature that has investigated (in democracies) whether incumbents are punished for
outcomes beyond their control. See the discussion in Fowler and Hall (2018) and Achen and Bartels (2018).

law and order in prefecture annual work reports. This was accompanied by actual increases in
fiscal spending on stability measures, in line with the model's predictions.


7.1     Attention to Preserving Stability
We adopt a novel approach to measure the degree of attention paid at the prefecture level to-
wards the issue of public security, that is based on the use of key political phrases ­ in particular,
"weiwen" (in Chinese, "") ­ in the public domain. The term "weiwen" is a contraction of
"   ", which literally translates as "maintaining stability"; it was reportedly first used
in the official People's Daily newspaper in 2002, in an article that was accompanied by a pho-
tograph of armed police. Since then, the term "weiwen" has been adopted as a watchword by
the political authorities, and is widely used to refer to actions to maintain law and order in the
interest of preserving domestic stability (New York Times, 2012).
    We will make use of the above observation in two ways, to construct measures that will be
amenable to empirical analysis. First, we investigate the response of internet search volumes
for the term "weiwen" at the prefecture level in the aftermath of a local strike event, as an
indicator of the attention paid to domestic security issues by the general public. This will help
validate the premise that the public associates the occurrence of labor strikes with concerns
about stability. Second, we use this term as the basis for a textual analysis of prefecture annual
work reports, to measure the degree to which preserving social stability features as a political
priority of the local government; in particular, we explore whether there is a systematic shift
in "weiwen" emphasis following a negative export shock.

7.1.1   Public Concern: Baidu Search Index

We follow a growing body of empirical work in the economics literature that has used data
on the intensity of internet searches, based for example on such metrics as Google Trends, to
gauge the pattern of internet users' interests and attitudes on various socioeconomic or political
issues (Madestam et al. 2013; Stephens-Davidowitz 2014; Kearney and Levine 2015). For our
purposes, Google Trends is unlikely to reflect the true search volume among domestic Chinese
internet users, due to the fact that access to Google has been severely curtailed in mainland
China since 2010. We thus turn instead to the counterpart of Google Trends on the largest
search engine in China, Baidu. Note that Baidu's market share is typically estimated to be
between 60-70% of internet users in China.33
    The Baidu Index allows users to retrieve information at a weekly frequency on the volume
of search queries for specific keywords, and can moreover distinguish searches by the prefectures
from which they originate. Although Baidu does not publicly disclose the exact formula for
  33
    For example, see:   https://www.wsj.com/articles/bing-baidu-and-a-big-mess-for-chinese-search-engines-
11548328142


                                                  29
its index, prior researchers have verified that the Baidu Index is likely to be linearly correlated
with the volume of public searches recorded for a given keyword (Qin and Zhu 2017).34 We
therefore scrape the Baidu Index for the keyword "weiwen", both over time and by prefecture.35
    We demonstrate that public attention to "weiwen" is indeed related to the occurrence of
strikes, by exploiting the rich weekly dimension of the CLB strike data together with the above
Baidu "weiwen" index. The structure of the merged data lend themselves to an event-study
analysis, which we implement in the following regression:

                                6
 ln(SearchIndex)i,w =                l (Events/L)i,w-l +  ln(SearchIndex)i,w-1 + Dp,w + Di + i,w .
                              l=-2
                                                                                              (7)
Here,  ln(SearchIndex)i,w is the change in the log Baidu "weiwen" index in prefecture i
and week w (i.e., relative to week w - 1). We regress this against a set of leads and lags of
the change in CLB events per worker observed in that prefecture (where (Events/L)i,w-l =
(Events/L)i,w-l - (Events/L)i,w-l-1 ), as well as against the lag level of the search index itself
in week w - 1. The Dp,w and Di denote province-by-week and prefecture dummies respectively.
The flexible lead-and-lag structure allows us to track the dynamic effects of incidents of labor
strikes on public attention to "weiwen"-related issues. We estimate the above for a panel of
weekly observations spanning 2012-2015, although the results are very similar if we were to
expand the sample to 2011-2016 (available on request).
    Figure 4 illustrates the estimates of the l 's from (7), together with the 90% confidence
intervals; these are based on standard errors clustered by prefecture, to account for potential
serial correlation in how the intensity of strikes might evolve in a given location. We find
that the search volume for the term "weiwen" is statistically indistinguishable from zero in the
weeks leading up to a labor strike. Of note, this search volume picks up a week after a strike
incident is recorded in the prefecture, with the reaction in the Baidu index then persisting for
up to six weeks. (The full set of coefficient estimates is reported in full in Table B.9 in the
appendix. There, we show that the above pattern in the l coefficients is robust even if one were
to drop the prefecture fixed effects, or if one were to estimate the regressions with working-age
population weights.)
    The above finding provides evidence of a significant response in terms of an increase in
  34
      By contrast, Google Trends reports a "relative search index", which is the ratio of the search volume for a
given term to the total number of searches conducted in a particular time/location. The index is then normalized
with the most popular search term taking on a value of 100. The publicly-available information from Google
Trends thus only has an ordinal interpretation (Kearney and Levine 2015). On the other hand, the Baidu Index
appears to be a cardinal measure, which facilitates making comparisons across time and location.
   35
      In practice, the process of retrieving the Baidu Index data was a laborious one. First, Baidu places limita-
tions on the volume of information that can be accessed by a single user, so that the scraping process could not
be fully automated and had to be reset periodically. Second, the Baidu Index comes in the form of a graphed
time series, so an algorithm was written to read the value of the index off the pixels in the graphics file for each
prefecture.

attention paid by netizens to the issue of public security following local incidents of labor
strikes. This could reflect for example a rise in concern about the law and order situation in
one's prefecture, or an increase in internet searches related to media coverage of a new "weiwen"
policy to bolster stability. At a more basic level, this exercise also serves to validate the use of
"weiwen" as a keyword, in that the frequency of its use can help shed light on the intensity of
responses to local unrest events.

7.1.2   Local Government Concern: Annual Work Reports

We next extract information on the political emphasis on maintaining social stability from an
official document of the local government, namely the prefecture annual work report. Within
China's political system, this is a report delivered as a speech at the prefecture-level People's
Congress meeting usually held in January each year. The reports are relatively uniform in their
format, which is helpful for our implementation of a textual analysis. Specifically, each report
comes in two sections. The first section is a summary of socioeconomic conditions from the
preceding year, together with a list of the government's accomplishments. On occasion, this
material will mention instances of high-profile strikes or unrest events that drew the govern-
ment's attention. The second section then lays out development policies for the year ahead.
Apart from describing economic plans, this will include measures intended to check and mitigate
social unrest (i.e., "weiwen" actions) in prefectures where this may be a relevant issue.

                                                                                    31
     We use two different approaches to construct measures of a work report's emphasis on
preserving social stability. Our more basic approach involves a simple count of "weiwen"-related
keywords. For this, we scan each prefecture's work report for each year between 2013-2016, and
count the number of occurrences of eleven keywords. This list of keywords naturally contains
"weiwen" (""), its unabbreviated form (""), and several variants (e.g., "
" or "harmony and stability", "" or "safety and stability"); it also includes several
synonyms for public security (e.g., ""). (The full list of keywords and their translation
is in Table A.1.) The keyword count is then normalized by the total count of Chinese characters
in the associated government work report.
     We also implement a more sophisticated machine-learning approach to compute "weiwen"
scores for each report. For this, we first randomly selected 20 reports from a pre-sample
year (2011), to mark out all sentences as either being about "weiwen" or "not-weiwen". These
labelled passages were then used, together with a paragraph from a national-level State Council
document dated April 2015 on the topic of domestic security measures, as the training sample
for the machine-learning algorithms.36 We then tokenize the text of each annual work report
using an online Chinese word library, before applying two machine-learning algorithms: (i)
the Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), and (ii) the Support Vector Machine (SVM), to predict
whether a paragraph is related to the topic of maintaining social stability. More specifically,
the MNB model generates a posterior probability of a paragraph being "weiwen", from an
underlying multinomial distribution model of token frequencies. The SVM model on the other
hand is a binary classifier, that generates a 0-1 prediction for whether a paragraph is about
"weiwen" or not, after partitioning out the observations in a high-dimensional metric space.
(See Appendix A.4 for more technical details.) We then compute a report-level score, by taking
the character-length weighted-average of the paragraph-specific scores. We view these "weiwen"
scores as capturing the degree to which maintaining social stability is an active policy priority
for the local government in the prefecture in question.37 As a placebo test, we have checked
the predictions that the machine-learning algorithms deliver for paragraphs that are related to
tackling economic volatility (such as in the stock market or real estate prices), given that the
same Chinese phrase ("") is also used in references to economic stabilization policies. Both
MNB and SVM models returned "weiwen" scores that were close to zero for such passages,
verifying the algorithms' ability to discriminate between content related to economic versus
political stability.
  36
     The State Council document was entitled "Opinions on Strengthening Society's Public Security Pre-
vention and Control System", and provides a set of recommendations on "weiwen" measures.                      See:
http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2015-04/13/content 2846013.htm
  37
     Our approach thus makes use of "supervised" machine-learning algorithms, in that we train the algorithm to
recognize "weiwen" versus "non-weiwen" passages instead of allowing it free rein to identify textual associations.
This is similar to the approach in Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010), who use a keyword approach to identify the
political slant of U.S. newspapers. For other applications of machine-learning methods to classify free text in
empirical research in economics, see the survey article of Mullainathan and Spiess (2017).


                                                       32
   With these textual analysis measures, we then estimate the following regression model to
examine whether export shocks induced a political response in terms of "weiwen" emphasis:

                   yi,t+1 = 1 ExpShockit + 2 yit + X Xit + Dpt + Di + it .                     (8)

This specification is very similar to that in (2), with the key difference being that a textual
analysis measure (denoted by y ) is now being used in place of the CLB events variable. Note
that the regression seeks to explain changes in this political response variable between years
t and t + 1, as a function of the export shock in the preceding year. We lead the response
variable on the left-hand side by one period for two reasons. First, outcomes that involve
political actions would naturally respond to adverse economic shocks with some lag. Second,
the prefecture work reports are delivered at the start of each calendar year, with the content
and wording influenced by socioeconomic conditions in the preceding year. We therefore relate
political emphasis on stability that is quantified from work reports in year t +1 to export shocks
in year t. As before, we instrument for the export shock with the Bartik IV from (3), while
controlling for province-year and prefecture fixed effects; the regressions are weighted by the
prefecture working-age population in 2010, with standard errors clustered by province.
    Table 7 presents the results from this analysis of the prefecture annual work reports. For
each measure, the odd-numbered columns report a basic specification without prefecture time-
varying controls (Xit ), while the even-numbered columns include the prefecture-level changes
in the college-enrolled, mobile-use and internet-use shares, as seen earlier in Column 3 of Ta-
ble 2. We obtain a consistent pattern regardless of the textual-analysis dependent variable or
auxiliary controls adopted, namely that a negative export shock raises the emphasis placed
by local officeholders on maintaining social stability, to the extent that these are reflected in
the annual work reports they deliver. (We have also repeated the full set of checks described
earlier in Section 5.2 to assess the robustness of these effects of the export shock on "weiwen"
emphasis; these are reported using the MNB "weiwen" measure in Column 2 of the correspond-
ing Appendix B tables.) The above findings therefore underscore the political importance that
the prefecture governments attach to upholding public security and stability in response to the
export slowdown.


7.2    Fiscal Expenditure
The analysis from the previous subsection is useful for identifying the announced intentions of
the local government, but does this translate into the allocation of tangible resources towards
maintaining social stability, as suggested by our framework from Section 6? We turn to this
issue now by studying how the export slowdown affected the use of fiscal resources at the
prefecture level.
    Toward this end, we collected data on realized fiscal expenditures and their detailed structure

the export shock). All columns report IV regressions, weighted by the prefecture's working-age population in 2010. Columns 1 and
2 regress the change in "weiwen" keyword share against the initial level of the keyword share. Columns 3 and 4 regress the change
in log Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) score against the initial level of the MNB score. Columns 5 and 6 regress the change in log
Support Vector Machine (SVM) score against the initial level of the SVM score. The additional time-t controls in even-numbered
columns are those used in Column 3 of Table 2, namely: the changes in the log college-enrolled, mobile-use, and internet-use shares.

by spending categories. There is no one-stop repository of local-level fiscal data for China (to the
best of our knowledge), and so these data were gathered from several sources. The majority
of the data are from the Fiscal Statistical Yearbooks published by the provincial Bureau of
Finance, and the Statistical Yearbooks published by the provincial Bureau of Statistics, from
provinces across China. These are supplemented with information from prefecture statistical
yearbooks, as well as balance sheets from prefecture government websites. In all, we were able
to gather data for up to 95% of the prefecture-year observations in our sample. Note that
subnational governments in China are responsible for 85% of government spending (Wingender
2018), and so are a meaningful locus of decision-making over the use of fiscal resources.
    We focus our attention on two broad categories of spending that capture measures to bolster
local stability. The first is spending on public security uses. This includes all expenses by the
People's Armed Police, public security organs, court system, judicial system, and prosecutorial
system. On the other end of the spectrum, we consider other forms of expenditures ­ which we
place under the label of "social spending" ­ that could in principle assuage citizens' discontent
and thus bolster stability. These include: public services, education, social security, medical
services, and public housing. To give a sense of how these spending items compare against
each other, the share of prefecture fiscal expenditure on public security averaged 5.13% during
the period 2013-2016. By contrast, the average share on social spending was 54.24%, with the
largest components of this being spending on education (17.8%), social security (12.59%), and

                                                                34
public services (10.10%).38
     We follow the IV specification in (8) to assess the impact of export performance on patterns
of fiscal spending at the prefecture level. Specifically, we regress changes in log fiscal spending
in year t + 1 on export shocks in the prior period (year t); in other words, we use the log of
each expenditure item in turn as the variable y in equation (8). We report the estimates from
these in Panel A of Table 8.
     In Column 1, we demonstrate that total spending on stability measures ­ summed over
public security and social spending ­ indeed rises in response to a negative export shock.
This increase is moreover statistically significant for each component, when we consider public
security (Column 1a) and social spending (Column 1b) separately. In terms of magnitude,
the estimated coefficients imply that a one standard deviation worse export shock (841 USD
per worker) would prompt a 1.8% increase in public security spending, which is slightly larger
than the corresponding 1.3% increase in social spending. We further find in Column 2 that
the response of other forms of spending (i.e., summing over all categories not related to public
security or social spending) is less pronounced, even while Column 3 confirms that a bad export
shock would induce a significant rise in total prefecture fiscal expenditures.39 Put otherwise,
fiscal policy at the local level is on the whole counter-cyclical with respect to the prefecture's
export performance, and this is mostly driven by the increase in spending on items that can be
associated with measures to raise stability.40
     Panel B of Table 8 delves into whether the effects of export shocks on fiscal spending
patterns might differ systematically across prefectures. We focus our discussion here on the
findings in Columns 1a and 1b for public security and social spending respectively. We consider
first an interaction between the export shock and the increase in CLB-recorded strikes per
worker observed in the previous year, (Events/L)it , in order to explore whether the fiscal
spending effects might have been prompted (at least in part) by concerns over labor disputes.
  38
      Public security and social spending thus constituted around 60% of the total expenditures for the average
prefecture. The main remaining expenditure items are: on agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy; on
transport; and on urban and rural community affairs. These spending categories are arguably less relevant for
mitigating labor unrest. Moreover, production in the transport sector in principle complements export activities,
and hence fiscal expenditure on these items may increase mechanically when the export sector expands.
   39
      In the tables in Appendix B, specifically in Columns 3 and 4, we document the robustness of these findings
­ for log changes in spending on public security and log changes in social spending ­ to the various concerns
discussed in Section 5.2. Separately, Table B.10 presents the results when we work instead with the spending
items expressed as shares of total expenditure; we arrive at a similar set of conclusions. Table B.11 in turn
breaks down social spending further into its individual components; we find here that an export slowdown tends
to raise most forms of social spending, with the exception of expenditures on social security.
   40
      In relation to this, we have found that locally-raised fiscal revenues (i.e., excluding transfers from the
central government) also increase during an export slowdown (results available on request). This suggests that
the local authorities in China do possess the fiscal tools and capacity to increase revenues, in support of a rise
in discretionary spending. See for example Chen (2017), who presents evidence from an earlier episode showing
that Chinese counties were able to clamp down on tax evasion or undertake land sales, in the face of a potential
revenue shortfall. This is in contrast to the situation in the United States highlighted by Feler and Senses
(2017), where negative trade shocks tightened local budgets and thus hurt the provision of local public goods.

    Notes: The dependent variable is the change in log fiscal expenditure under the respective column headings in prefecture i between
   year t and t + 1 (i.e., one year after the export shock). All columns report IV regressions, weighted by the prefecture's working-age
   population in 2010. Panel A reports the average effects of the export shock on the respective fiscal spending measures. Panel B
   explores heterogeneous effects: The (Events/L)it variable is the change in CLB-recorded events per million between year t - 1
   and t. (FiscalRev/L)i,2012 is the local fiscal revenue per worker in 2012. (49Age53)it is a dummy variable for whether the
   prefecture party secretary is between ages 49 and 53 (inclusive) in year t. The additional time-t controls are those used in Column
   3 of Table 2, namely: the changes in the log college-enrolled, mobile-use, and internet-use shares. Robust standard errors are
   clustered at the province level. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.



The estimated interaction coefficients are negative and significant in both Columns 1a and 1b,
indicating that fiscal responses to a negative export shock are stronger for both "stick" and
"carrot" measures when there is a more severe increase in labor strikes, and hence (potentially)
a greater threat to social stability.
   Motivated by our framework from Section 6, we also consider whether the impact of the


                                                                   36
export shock might vary with the career prospects of the local incumbent and with local fiscal
capacity. On the former, we explore an interaction term involving a dummy variable for whether
the prefecture party secretary is between ages 49-53 in year t. As established in Appendix A.5,
the likelihood of promotion for a local party leader peaks between these ages, and we thus
take this dummy as a proxy for officeholders who have higher expected rents (R). We find
that its interaction coefficient with the export shock is significantly negative for both public
security and social spending. Politicians with greater promotion prospects are thus more likely
to increase spending on measures to bolster stability following a bad export shock, in line with
the logic of our model.
    On initial fiscal capacity, we use as a proxy the level of fiscal revenue per worker in 2012.
We find that this interaction effect with negative export shocks is negative and significant for
total spending on stability measures (Column 1). Prefecture governments who face fewer fiscal
constraints thus raise their spending on stability measures more strongly, consistent with the
implications of our model (associated in particular with a lower  ). Interestingly, we also find
that local governments with deeper fiscal pockets are less inclined to raise spending on public
security following a negative export shock (Column 1a), and more inclined instead to raise social
spending (Column 1b). While our stylized model does not fully capture this heterogeneous
response across different forms of spending, we hypothesize that this pattern could be related
to social spending requiring a more sustained or intensive use of fiscal resources than a short-
term ramping up of public security.


8      Political Response: Incumbent Turnover
As a final piece of empirical evidence, we examine the response of the upper-level government,
in the decisions that it makes over whether to retain or replace local party leaders. The model
in Section 6 would imply that prefecture party secretaries would be assessed on their relative
performance in maintaining social stability when faced with a negative export shock. We seek
to understand the extent to which the observed career paths of party secretaries during the
export slowdown period is in line with these predictions.


8.1     Data and Specification
We collected information on the biographic characteristics and career histories of local party
secretaries from the curricula vitae of these officeholders. These were compiled primarily from
the database of Chinese party and government leaders maintained by People.cn, an official
website affiliated with the Chinese government.41 The data cover 544 individuals who held the
  41
   See: http://ldzl.people.com.cn/dfzlk/front/firstPage.htm.   We supplement this with information from
Wikipedia where necessary.



                                                   37
position of prefecture party secretary over the period 2013-2016, and allows us to track the
month and year in which each individual took and/or left office.
    Our empirical analysis focuses on turnover of party secretaries. This is because the party
secretary is the top executive position at the prefecture level, with ultimate authority and
substantial discretion over local fiscal and regulatory policies (Persson and Zhuravskaya 2016).
In particular, the party secretary is in charge of personnel and other political duties such as
maintaining social stability, while the mayor (the second in rank) is in charge of the daily
operations of the government (Yao and Zhang 2015). To the extent that the party secretary
bears greater responsibility for local political stability, his/her career trajectory could be more
susceptible to any social unrest associated with negative economic shocks.
    We define T urnoverit to be an indicator variable equal to 1 when there is a change in party
secretary in prefecture i within a given calendar year t. Over 2014-2016, the average annual
turnover rate for prefecture party secretaries was 29.6% (see Table 1). We further classified the
nature of each instance of turnover as: a promotion, a lateral movement, or being due to other
causes (e.g., corruption, retirement, movement to an honorary position). We are helped here by
the fact that China's political system has a clear hierarchy of positions that can be ranked in
terms of political importance. This starts at the top with national-level positions, followed in
descending order by positions at the sub-national, province, sub-province, prefecture, and sub-
prefecture levels. In our coding, we define a promotion as a move by a prefecture party secretary
to a post that is at the sub-provincial level or above, while a lateral movement is a transfer to
a different prefecture-level position.42 Based on this criterion, 25% of the instances of turnover
during 2014-2016 are promotions, and 55.1% are lateral movements. The remaining cases are a
combination of retirements or terminations of political career (e.g., due to corruption). There
were in fact no cases where an individual was demoted from prefecture party secretary to a
position at the sub-prefecture level or below.
    The fact that there are no observed demotions (and relatively few cases of termination)
suggests that punishment for weak performance takes a different form within China's political
system. To capture this, we further break down the nature of the lateral movements in our
data. Existing guidelines indicate that prefectural officials should typically have served at least
three years in a position, before being promoted to the next level in the political hierarchy; this
  42
    There are a number of exceptions to this coding rule, as we detail in Appendix A.5. First, there are a
handful of more prominent prefectures designated as provincial-level or sub-provincial-level administrative units;
the party secretary positions in these locations are thus of higher rank, and we take care to define movements
into and out of these positions with this higher rank in mind. Second, we do not categorize appointments to
several honorary positions as promotions, even though these are nominally of sub-province rank. This follows
Li and Zhou (2005) and Yao and Zhang (2015), who categorize appointments to the position of chairman or
vice-chairman of the province-level People's Congress or People's Political Consultative Committee to be akin
to "consolation prizes" or retirement posts; our results are robust if we were instead to treat these movements
as promotions. Third, some prefecture party secretaries simultaneously hold positions that rank at the sub-
provincial level (e.g., member of the provincial standing committee); for such cases, we consider a movement to
another position at the sub-provincial level (e.g., a vice-provincial governor) as a lateral movement.


                                                       38
is announced for example in the Regulations for the Selection and Appointment of Party Cadres,
by the Organizational Department of the Chinese Communist Party.43 We therefore label lateral
moves that occurred prior to the three-year mark in the prefecture party secretary's tenure as
cases of "early" lateral movement. In our sample period, 31.1% of the lateral movements are
classified as "early". In Appendix A.5, we provide empirical evidence confirming that among
officeholders who had been moved laterally, those who were moved early had a lower likelihood
of future promotion compared to those who had served in their prior positions for the requisite
three years.44 We therefore adopt this definition of a premature lateral move as a proxy for a
de facto demotion, since it tends to blemish an official's career trajectory.
    Using this data on incumbent turnover, we estimate the following:

             T urnoveri,t+1 = 1 ExpShockit + 2 T urnoverit + X Xit + Dpt + Di + it .                        (9)

This follows closely the specification in (8), in that we investigate how the political response in
year t +1 ­ in this case, the decision of an upper-level government over whether or not to replace
a local officeholder ­ might depend on the export shock seen in the prefecture in year t. As
before, we instrument ExpShockit with the Bartik IV from (3), while controlling throughout
for province-year and prefecture fixed effects. We additionally include a set of incumbent
characteristics that we are able to extract from their curricula vitae, namely: gender, age,
education (whether he/she possesses a Masters degree or higher), tenure in the position (in
years), as well as province of birth. We use this last piece of information to construct a dummy
variable for whether the incumbent's current appointment is in her birth province, as a proxy
for the strength of his/her ties with the local political networks.
    To better understand the links between negative export shocks and political turnover, we
also study the differential effects across prefectures that experienced high versus low "excess
strikes". Recall that in the theoretical framework presented in Section 6, the upper-level gov-
ernment is cognizant that an export slowdown would induce a rise in worker-related unrest. In
order to properly incentivize local leaders to exert effort to bolster stability even when there
has been a bad export shock, the upper-level government's decision over whether to replace
the incumbent would have to depend not on the absolute level of strikes observed, but on the
extent to which the increase can be seen as excessive. To capture this, we compute the resid-
uals from a reduced-form regression of (Events/L)it on the Bartik-style ROW export shock
variable; to be more specific, we take these residuals from the regression in Column 4 of Table
2. We then split prefectures into high and low "excess strike" groups based on whether the
associated regression residual is respectively above or below its median value. This provides
us with a proxy for whether the local authorities have respectively under- or over-performed
  43

    This analysis is based on a sample of prefecture party secretaries who experienced a lateral movement during
2007-2012, and considers their observed career histories up until 2016 where our data end.


                                                      39
in their handling of the labor strike situation, relative to a benchmark that takes into account
observed ROW export shocks. We then augment the regression model in (9) as follows:

                                       Exp
       T urnoveri,t+1 =                g   1(i  g ) × ExpShockit + 2 T urnoverit + H 1(i  H )
                              g =H,L
                                   +X Xit + Dpt + Di + it ,                                                  (10)

                         Exp      Exp
so that the coefficients H   and L     pick up the differential effects of the export shock across
these two categories of prefectures (as captured by the dummy variables 1(i  g ), with H for
the high and L for the low excess strike groups respectively).


8.2     Results
Table 9 reports our key results on incumbent turnover. Column 1 presents the estimates from
(9), showing that the incumbent party secretary was indeed more likely to be replaced following
a downturn in prefecture exports. In particular, a one standard deviation more negative export
shock would raise the likelihood of turnover by 6.2 percentage points, a fairly sizeable effect
when compared against the average turnover rate of around 29.6% in our sample period. (As
reported in Column 5 of the Appendix B tables, this link from the export shock to incumbent
turnover is robust under the alternative specifications and checks discussed in Section 5.2.)
    The results from estimating (10) are reported in Column 2. In prefectures with low excess
strikes, an export slowdown has a negative but statistically insignificant effect on political
turnover. Importantly, the estimated effect of the export shock is much larger in magnitude
and highly significant in prefectures with high excess strikes. This is consistent with our model's
prediction that an incumbent would be replaced not because of the exogenous export shock per
se, but rather on the basis of his/her relative performance in maintaining social stability.45 This
stands in interesting contrast with evidence from democratic countries where voters have been
seen to punish politicians for economic circumstances that are outside their control (Achen and
Bartels 2004, Cole et al. 2012). One possible explanation is that relative to the voters in a
democracy, the upper-level government in China may hold more precise information or be more
able to process that information to evaluate the performance of its officeholders.
    Column 3 augments the model with an interaction term between the export shock and
the indicator for whether the incumbent is between 49 and 53 years of age. The estimated
coefficient is positive and significant, implying that young and potentially more politically-
motivated incumbents are less likely to be replaced after an adverse export shock, possibly
  45
    We have separately run a regression similar to (10), but in which (Events/L)it was itself interacted with
ExpShockit , in lieu of the interaction terms involving the high versus low "excess strike" dummy variables.
We do not obtain a significant interaction coefficient under this alternative specification, which underscores the
importance of considering "excess strikes" rather than just looking at the raw increase in labor unrest (results
available on request).

 Notes: The dependent variable is a dummy for whether there was a change in prefecture party secretary in year t + 1 (i.e., one
year after the export shock). All columns report IV regressions, weighted by the prefecture's working-age population in 2010.
The ExcessStrikeH  it variable in Columns 2-3 is an indicator variable for whether the predicted residual obtained from running
the reduced-form regression from Column 4 of Table 2 has an above-median value. The ExcessStrikeH         it variable in Columns 4-5
is similarly obtained from the predicted residual when run additionally with incumbent time-t controls. Where relevant, the
level effect of being in the low (respectively, high) excess strike bin is reported, together with the p-value of the test with null
hypothesis that the difference in these level effects is zero. (FiscalRev/L)i,2012 is the initial local fiscal revenue per worker in
2012. (Age48)it and (49Age53)it are dummy variables for whether the prefecture party secretary is of the respective ages
in year t. The additional time-t controls are those used in Column 3 of Table 2, namely: the changes in the log college-enrolled,
mobile-use, and internet-use shares. Robust standard errors are clustered at the province level. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

                                                                 41
because they are more inclined to increase spending on stability measures (as seen earlier in
Column 1 of Panel B, Table 8). We also find here that the incumbent is less likely to be
replaced when he/she has more fiscal resources (initial fiscal revenues per worker in 2012) to
wield against negative shocks. Columns 4-5 repeat the exercise from the preceding two columns,
with a version of the excess strike dummy that is constructed from the regression in Column 4
in Table 2 after further controlling for the set of incumbent characteristics used in Column 1 of
Table 9; the results we obtain are very similar. Note that near the bottom of the table, we have
computed for each column the implied effects on turnover for prefectures in the low and high
excess strike groups respectively, after accounting for the main effect of the group dummy and
setting ExpShockit at its mean value. The reported p-values confirm that there is a positive
gap (significant at least at the 10% level) in the estimated effects on incumbent turnover in
high relative to low excess strike prefectures.
    Finally, in Table 10, we make use of the information we gathered on the nature of each in-
stance of incumbent turnover. The dependent variables in this table are dummies for turnover
under the stated cause; we control for the respective lagged dependent variables, and use here
the version of the excess strike dummy from Columns 4-5 of Table 9. The results in Columns
1-2 show that the export shock has small and insignificant effects on promotion, regardless of
whether or not we consider the possibility of heterogeneous effects across prefectures that expe-
rienced high versus low excess strikes. Columns 3-4 confirm that a negative shock induces more
lateral movements, with this effect being concentrated moreover in prefectures that saw high
excess strikes. Lastly, as shown in Columns 5-6, the preceding results on lateral movement are
largely driven by the effects of export shocks on the "early" lateral movements (i.e., that occur
before the incumbent has accrued three years of service time as a local party secretary); notice
that the export shock coefficients of interest are larger in magnitude than the corresponding
point estimates in Columns 3-4.46 The contrasting effects of export shocks on promotion versus
early lateral movements are consistent with our observations that the latter movements are
akin to a de facto demotion, that send a negative signal about the incumbent's future career
path.
    In sum, the evidence on incumbent tenure lends itself to the interpretation that the central
government in China makes active decisions about the retention or replacement of local incum-
bents in response of negative economic shocks. These decisions moreover appear to be based
on an evaluation of the local leader's performance in maintaining social stability, that accounts
for the severity of the economic conditions that the incumbent faced.

    We have checked that the results are similar when defining lateral movements to be early if they occur
within the first two years (as opposed to three) of a prefecture party secretary's tenure (available on request).

 Notes: The dependent variable is a dummy for whether there was a change in prefecture party secretary in year t + 1 (i.e., one year after the
export shock), that is classified as a promotion (Columns 1-2), lateral movement (Columns 3-4), or early lateral movement (Columns 5-6); the
Turnover Outcomeit variable is the one-year lag of the dependent variable in each column. All columns report IV regressions, weighted by the
prefecture's working-age population in 2010. The ExcessStrikeH     it variable is an indicator for whether the predicted residual obtained from running
the reduced-form regression from Column 4 of Table 2 with additional incumbent time-t controls has an above-median value. Where relevant, the
level effect of being in the low (respectively, high) excess strike bin is reported, together with the p-value of the test with null hypothesis that the
difference in these level effects is zero. (Age48)it and (49Age53)it are dummy variables for whether the prefecture party secretary is of the
respective ages in year t. The additional time-t controls are those used in Column 3 of Table 2, namely: the changes in the log college-enrolled,
mobile-use, and internet-use shares. Robust standard errors are clustered at the province level. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

9    Conclusion
We have undertaken a wide-ranging investigation into the political economy consequences of a
slowdown in exports for China. We have documented how negative shocks to exports have been
associated with an increase in labor-related strikes in Chinese prefectures. Using a shift-share
instrumental variables strategy, we have argued that our estimates reflect a causal impact of
these export shocks.
    In order to better understand the political responses to this unfolding dynamic, we study
a simple model that seeks to capture essential features of China's hierarchical political system.
In the wake of a negative export shock, the model predicts that "excess" strikes are associated
with a greater likelihood that the upper-level government will replace the local incumbent;
the threat of removal in turn induces the local incumbent to increase the effort and resources
channelled towards bolstering domestic stability.
    These political responses are evident in the novel data that we gathered. Our textual analysis
of prefecture annual work reports shows that declining exports led to a rising use of "weiwen"
phrases, signaling a heightened emphasis on preserving stability as a political priority. More
directly, prefecture-level fiscal expenditures were increased, on both public security measures
(to safeguard law and order) and social spending (to potentially assuage worker grievances).
Last but not least, we find that severe export slowdowns accompanied by an excessively high
level of labor-related incidents ­ in excess of what would be predicted by the extent of the shock
to exports ­ help to explain subsequent turnover of local party secretaries.
    These patterns are useful for understanding the political response within China to the
recent decline in exports, a topic of obvious importance given China's role in global trade and
the world economy. More broadly though, they shed light on how economic shocks impact
political outcomes in the context of an autocratic regime with high levels of state capacity:
Local incumbents can be removed if they under-perform, but this accountability is exercised
within the political system from above, rather than stemming from the ballot box (in the case
of democracies) or the threat of political violence (in weak autocracies). With a large and
arguably increasing share of the world's population living under strong autocratic regimes,
understanding how such political systems function and cope with economic challenges is more
relevant than ever.

A.1      Labor Disputes Data from MOHRSS
The data on the number of labor dispute cases are from the China Labor Statistical Yearbook,
published by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (MOHRSS). These record
labor dispute cases that have been officially submitted for mediation or arbitration to "employ-
ment dispute arbitration committees" () at the county level. The count
is aggregated at the province level when reported in the statistical yearbooks.
    Panel A in Figure A.1 demonstrates that at the national level, the trends over time in the
total number of MOHRSS labor dispute cases and the total number of CLB-reported labor
events are highly correlated. Panel B in the same figure confirms that over the 2012-2015
period, the annual changes in both series are positively correlated across provinces. There is
one observation for Ningxia that appears to be an outlier to the right in Panel B, but removing
this point would further strengthen the positive correlation.


A.2      Rationalizing the Export-share Weights in the Bartik IV
We provide a brief justification for the use of weights based on initial export shares in the
                                             k
construction of the Bartik IV in (3). Let XiR  denote the value of exports of product k from
prefecture i in China to the ROW. We have:

                                          k
                                         XiR = k   k
                                               iR YR ,

         k
where YR   is the total expenditure in the ROW on product k , while k    iR is the corresponding
                            k
expenditure share (out of YR ) that is allocated to those products that originate from prefecture
                                                                                      k
i in China. The value of product-k exports from China as a whole to the ROW, XCR        , is given
by a similar relation:
                                            k
                                          XCR  = k     k
                                                   CR YR ,

where k CR denotes the expenditure share on those products that originate from China.
   Consider now a set of exogenous shocks that shifts the foreign demand for good k . Let XiR
denote total exports from prefecture i to the ROW. The change in these total exports is then
given by:

                                      k
                                      iR   k dYR

                                                                                 ~ k + diR X k .

A.3     An Example of a "Weiwen" Paragraph
The following is an example of a "weiwen" paragraph that was included in our training sample
for the machine learning algorithms. This paragraph is from the State Council document of
13 April 2015, entitled: "Opinions on Strengthening Society's Public Security Prevention and
Control System". The extracted paragraph in Chinese and its English translation (lightly edited
by Google Translate) are included.

Translation:
    "[We shall] improve the analysis and evaluation system on public security. The procuratorial
office, judicial administrative department, and public security department shall work collectively
and, in accordance with other departments, carry out all-round dynamic monitoring, and put
forward suggestions and advice. The public security department shall uphold intelligence-
led policing, establish and enhance the mechanism for analyzing, inspecting, and reviewing
criminal intelligence on social stability. [We shall] regularly examine and monitor the public
security situation. [We shall] improve the system of analyzing and predicting the trend of social
opinions, hotspot security problems, and sensitive issues. [We shall] strengthen the analysis and
examination of the major aspects of social stability in order to uncover in a timely manner the
emerging and hidden risks that endanger social stability, and to improve the ability to cope with
such issues. [We shall] establish and improve the monitoring and early-warning mechanisms for
public security, and enhance people's awareness for self-protection."


A.4     Machine Learning Models and Packages
Our machine learning models require inputs of words, commonly known as tokens in the field
of natural language processing, for training and classification purposes. Unlike English, where
tokenization simply involves splitting the text at white spaces and punctuation marks, Chinese


                                                51
text tokenization is more complicated due to the lack of delimiters such as spaces between
words. We employed an open source software library called jieba to perform this task; this
library contains a large dictionary of Chinese words, along with their relative positions and
their respective frequencies.47 When the software scans through a sentence, it builds a directed
acyclic graph (DAG) for all possible word combinations, and then identifies the most probable
combination based on the word-position frequency from its dictionary.
    For both the Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models,
we adopted packages from the open source scikit-learn library.48 This is a well-tested and well-
supported machine learning software library, with packages written in Python. For the MNB,
we used a "term frequency-inverse document frequency" (TFIDF) construction tool to compute
the frequencies of word tokens, as a first step in preparing the text documents for analysis.49
    To operationalize these supervised machine learning algorithms, we put together a training
dataset comprising: (i) 20 prefecture annual work reports selected at random from a pre-sample
year (2011); and (ii) the State Council document of 13 April 2015 on: "Opinions on Strengthen-
ing Society's Public Security Prevention and Control System". For (i), we manually identified
the sentences and phrases in each of the 20 reports that were on the topic of maintaining social
stability ("weiwen"); for (ii), we classified the entire report as being about "weiwen". The
MNB model uses this training dataset as the basis for computing a posterior probability that
an unseen text passage is about "weiwen", based on a multinomial probability distribution
model for the occurrence of tokens; the model is "naive", in that it assumes a zero correlation
in the joint occurrence of any pair of tokens. The SVM model on the other hand transforms
the passages from the training dataset into points in a high-dimensional metric space, and
then partitions these in a binary fashion via a hyperplane that seeks to maximize the distance
between itself and the nearest observation that lies on either "side" of it; unseen text passages
are then mapped into this same metric space, and classified as "weiwen" or not on the basis of
which side of the hyperplane they are located.
    In line with common practice, we performed a cross-validation of the 20 pre-sample work
reports at the training stage as follows. We divided these into four subsets of 5 reports each,
and then trained the machine learning model using the first three of these subsets together
with the State Council document from (ii). The trained models were then used to score the
passages in the omitted subset of 5 reports that had been marked out as being about "weiwen".
We repeated the above procedure a further three times, omitting in turn the second, third and
fourth subsets of 5 reports. From this exercise, the simple average of the scores obtained for
the passages in the omitted subset of reports was 0.98 for the MNB and 0.97 for the SVM
models respectively, providing validation of the internal consistency of the training sample in
identifying "weiwen" passages.

    We subsequently applied these two models to the prefecture annual work reports in our
sample period of interest (2012-2016). The "weiwen" score under each machine learning model
for a given work report was computed as the character-length weighted-average of the paragraph
scores from that report.


A.5     Classification of Incumbent Turnover
We classify each instance of incumbent turnover as a promotion, a lateral movement, or being
due to other causes (corruption, demotion, retirement, movement to an honorary position).
This coding is in turn based on a comparison of the political rank of the individual's new
position relative to the old position that he/she vacated.
     For most prefectures, the position of party secretary is considered to be at the prefecture
(or bureau) level in terms of political rank ("Tingju Ji",    in Chinese). We consider
a movement to be a promotion if the new position is at the sub-provincial ministerial level
("Fusheng Ji",   ; or "Fubu Ji",   ) or above. To give some examples of sub-
provincial level positions, these include: the provincial vice-governor; provincial vice-party
secretary; provincial standing committee member; head of People's Procuratorate and People's
Court at the provincial level; etc. Some examples of provincial ministerial level ("Fusheng Ji",
; or "Fubu Ji", ) positions are: the provincial governor; provincial party secretary;
head of different ministries at the central level; etc.
     There are a number of key exceptions to the above coding rules. First, there are 4 prefec-
tures that are also province-level municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing), so the
party secretary position is considered a rank at the provincial ministerial level; for these, we
consider their movement as a promotion if the new position is at the sub-national level ("Fuguo
Ji", or   ) or above. Second, there are 15 prefectures that are also sub-province-level
municipalities (Changchun, Chengdu, Dalian, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Harbin, Jinan, Nanjing,
Ningbo, Qingdao, Shenyang, Shenzhen, Wuhan, Xi'an, Xiamen), where the party secretary is a
rank at the sub-provincial ministerial level; for these, we consider a movement to be a promo-
tion if the new position is at the provincial ministerial level or above. Third, we do not consider
movements to positions in the province-level People's Congress or province-level People's Po-
litical Consultative Committee to be promotions, since these are viewed as honorary positions
akin to "consolation prizes" in China's political hierarchy; this follows Li and Zhou (2005) and
Yao and Zhang (2015).
     During the period 2014-2016, there were 292 instances of local party secretary turnover,
out of 987 available prefecture-year observations. Of these, 73 (or 25%) were classified as
promotions and 161 (or 55.1%) as lateral movements. The latter include 50 instances of early
lateral movements, that occurred before the incumbent had accrued three years in that position.
     Promotion age profile: Figure A.2 presents the age distribution of the prefecture party
secretaries (right vertical axis), as well as the observed promotion probability at different ages
(left vertical axis). The figure is constructed using the sample of prefecture party secretaries


                                                53
from 2012-2016; note that the promotion probability is computed simply as the share of in-
cumbents promoted at each given age. The figure shows that the promotion likelihood peaks
between ages 49-53 and declines steadily afterward. Likewise, the frequency of observing a
party secretary at a given age declines after age 53. In our empirical analysis, we thus consider
the age range between 49-53 as that in which a prefecture party secretary would see his/her
expected future rents from holding office to be at its largest.
    Early lateral movement and career trajectory: We investigate the implications of
early lateral movement on an official's career path, to show that this lowers his/her probability
of future promotion. Toward this end, we use the data on political turnover of prefecture party
secretaries and restrict the sample to those officials who experienced a lateral movement during
2007-2012; we then examine the career path of these officials up until 2016 where our data end.
    For each official, we consider the first lateral move he/she experienced in 2007-2012. Let
P0 denote the position that the official held prior to this move, and let P1 be the position to
which he/she was moved laterally. Let P2 then denote the position that he/she moved to in
his/her next subsequent move, if any. We code up a dummy variable equal to 1 if P2 is a higher
political rank relative to P1 ; the dummy is equal to 0 otherwise, including in situations where
the official did not experience a subsequent move P2 . Figure A.3 illustrates the future promotion
probability among these lateral movers, grouped by bins according to their tenure duration in
P0 at the time they were moved to P1 . Notice that the subsequent promotion probability of
early lateral movers, i.e., those who were in position P0 for fewer than three years, is lower than
that of lateral movers with a tenure of 3-6 years.
    This finding is further substantiated by the regressions reported in Table A.2. Using the
same sample of prefecture party secretaries as in Figure A.3, we regress various outcome mea-
sures related to future promotion on: (i) dummy variables for the official's years of tenure in
P0 at the time of the lateral move to P1 ; and (ii) a set of officeholder control variables, as listed
in the Table A.2 footnote. The dependent variables are dummies for whether: (i) the move to
P2 was a promotion relative to P1 (Column 1); (ii) the official was ever promoted in any moves
including and subsequent to P2 (Column 2); (iii) the highest rank he/she occupied was at the
sub-provincial level or higher (Column 3); and (iv) the highest rank he/she occupied was at
the provincial level or higher (Column 4). Columns 1 and 2 confirm that early lateral movers
(the omitted category) have lower future promotion prospects relative to lateral movers who
had spent between 3-6 years in their prior positions. The effect is statistically significant for
promotion during one's next move (Column 1); it may even affect one's prospects of ever being
promoted (Column 2), at least to the extent observable by 2016, although this coefficient is not
statistically significant. Early lateral movers are also less likely to make it to positions higher
up the political ranking, specifically to provincial-level positions (Column 4).

B      Additional Results & Checks                                (FOR ONLINE PUBLICATION)

B.1      Basic Robustness
Table B.1 presents a set of basic checks on our findings linking a slowdown in exports at the
prefecture level to increases in labor strikes (Column 1) and responses by the political authorities
(Columns 2-5). The dependent variables in this table (and in other robustness tables that
follow) are in column order: (i) the time-t change (relative to the previous year) in the number
of CLB-recorded strikes per worker; (ii) the time-(t + 1) change in the log Multinomial Naive
Bayes (MNB) "weiwen" score; (iii) the time-(t + 1) change in log fiscal expenditure on public
security; (iv) the time-(t + 1) change in log fiscal expenditure on social spending; and (v) an
indicator variable for party secretary turnover in time (t + 1). The IV specifications that are
estimated follow equation (2) for Column 1, equation (8) for Columns 2-4, and equation (9) for
Column 5.
    Panel A in Table B.1 shows that the results remain intact if the province-year fixed effects
are replaced by region-year fixed effects.50 This specification allows us to retain several large
prefectures (Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing) that comprise their entire province, that
would otherwise be dropped from the sample when province-year fixed effects are used. Panel B
reports unweighted regressions, to demonstrate that the findings do not depend on the decision
to weight the regressions by prefecture initial workforce size. Panel C shows that dropping the
lag level of the response variable of interest from the right-hand side controls is immaterial for
our findings.
    To address potential concerns about influential observations, Figure B.1 presents a residual
scatterplot based on the specification reported in Column 3 of Table 2. For the horizontal
axis variable, we take the predicted export shock that emerges from running the first-stage of
the IV regression; we then regress this predicted variable against the right-hand side variables
in equation (2) excluding ExpShockit , while weighting the observations by Li,2010 , in order
to extract an export shock residual. The vertical axis variable is analogously constructed, as
the residual from regressing the change in CLB events per million workers against all right-
hand side variables in (2) while weighting the observations by Li,2010 , once again excluding
ExpShockit . The residual scatterplot reveals a downward-sloping relationship, and moreover
provides reassurance that no single observation appears to be driving the negative slope.
    In Table B.2, we demonstrate that the findings are robust to dropping each province in turn,
so that there is no particular province that is driving the results. For each column, the table
reports the largest and smallest ExpShockit coefficients obtained from this exercise of dropping
one province at a time, together with the associated statistical significance levels.
  50
    The seven regions are: Northeast (Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning), North (Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi,
and Inner Mongolia), Central (Henan, Hubei, and Hunan), East (Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai, Zhejiang,
Jiangxi, and Fujian), South (Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan), Northwest (Shannxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai,
and Xinjiang), and Southwest (Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Chongqing, and Tibet).

B.2     Controlling for other Domestic Shocks
A potential concern is that demand shocks from the ROW could be correlated with shocks
that originate from within China's prefectures. The estimated export shock coefficient in our
regressions may thus be picking up the effects of these domestic demand or supply shocks,
rather than the effect of export demand per se.
   Consider first the possible role of domestic demand shocks. We construct a measure of
domestic demand, in order to directly control for it in the regressions. We build this measure
from information on absorption (i.e., domestic output less net exports) at the industry level.
For each four-digit Chinese Standard Industrial Classification (CSIC) industry (indexed by j )
and year (indexed by t), we compute first the output of that industry that is absorbed in the
Chinese economy as: Absorptionjt = Outputjt - Exportjt + Importjt ; in particular, the data on
output are from the China Industry Statistical Yearbooks. We then project the annual change
in Absorptionjt onto Chinese prefectures i using a Bartik-style construction as follows:

                                                      Lij,2010 Absorptionjt
                     AbsorptionShockit =                                    .
                                             j        i Lij,2010 Li,2010

In words, this is a weighted-average measure of the industry-level absorption shocks, where
the weights used are the initial shares of prefecture i in China-wide employment in industry j
(i.e., Lij,2010 / i Lij,2010 ); these weights are computed from the 2010 China Annual Survey of
Industrial Firms. The variable is further normalized by the working age population in prefecture
i, Li,2010 (from the 2010 Census). This is the proxy for domestic demand shocks at the prefecture
level which we control for in Panel A of Table B.3. (We build this measure from industry-level
data for China as a whole, as detailed data on industry-level output by prefecture are not yet
publicly available for the years in our sample, to the best of our knowledge.)
    To control for the role of domestic supply shocks, we construct an analogous Bartik-style
measure of prefecture-level shifts in output, using the same data sources as above:

                                                      Lij,2010 Outputjt
                         OutputShockit =                                 .
                                             j        i Lij,2010 Li,2010

We control for this proxy for domestic supply shocks in Panel B of Table B.3; in Panel C, we
control for it together with the domestic absorption shock.
    Throughout Panels A-C, we find that the estimated effect of the export shock on labor
strikes and political responses is similar to the baseline results in the main paper, suggesting
that domestic shocks are not influencing our findings. (Interestingly, Column 1 indicates that a
weakening in domestic demand and output would be associated with increases in labor strikes,
although this does not detract from the strong findings on the role of the export shock.) In
Figure B.2, we illustrate the cross-industry correlation between Absorptionjt and Outputjt
on the one hand, and the CSIC industry-level export shock on the other. These partial scat-


                                                 59
terplots are based on data from 2013-2015, and are obtained after residualizing Absorptionjt ,
Outputjt , and the CSIC industry-level export shock for the role of year fixed effects. The
slope coefficients in the figure are slightly positive, but not different from zero in a statistically
significant way. This provides further reassurance that the export shock is not likely to be
picking up an incidental correlation with domestic demand or supply shifts.
    To assess the potential confounding effect of imports, we construct a Bartik-style measure
of prefecture-level import shocks as:

                                                         Lij,2010 Mjt
                               ImpShockit =                                 ,
                                                j        i Lij,2010 Li,2010


where Mjt is the change in imports of industry j in year t, computed from the China customs
data. While we are reasonably confident about the exogeneity of external demand shocks faced
by Chinese exporters, it is more challenging to propose exogenous import supply shocks to
instrument for changes in imports at the prefecture level. With this caveat in mind, Panel
D of Table B.3 presents a specification where we introduce the above ImpShockit variable.
The estimated export shock coefficient resembles that from the baseline estimates, while the
coefficient on the import shock is not statistically significant.


B.3     Alternative Bartik Shocks
In this next set of checks reported in Table B.4, we confirm the robustness of the findings under
alternative constructions of the Bartik IV.
    Excluding intermediary firms: In Panel A, we drop firms f that are trade intermediaries,
identifying these on the basis of their Chinese character firm names, following Ahn et al. (2011).
We remove these intermediaries from the construction of the ExpShockit variable in (1) and
the ROW Bartik IV in (3).
    Destination-specific demand shocks: In Panel B, we use information on the composition
of exports across destination markets, to construct the following alternative Bartik IV:
                                                              ROW
                                               Xidk,2010 Xdkt
                                                                   .                            (B.1)
                                  k   d=CHN    i Xidk,2010 Li,2010


           ROW
Here, Xdkt      denotes the change in exports of product k from the ROW (excluding China)
to country d in year t. Xidk,2010 / i Xidk,2010 is the share of exports of product k from China
to the ROW that originate from prefecture i in the base year (2010); specifically, we apportion
destination-specific demand changes to each prefecture according to the initial distribution of
exports across source prefectures. The apportioned export shocks are summed across products
and destination markets, and then normalized by the local working age population. The vari-
ation in (B.1) thus stems from cross-destination-by-product differences in demand shocks, and
cross-prefecture differences in initial specialization patterns in producing for different markets.


                                                    60
(We exclude exports to Hong Kong and Macau for this exercise.)
    Gravity-based Demand Shocks: In Panels C and D, we use an empirical gravity model
of trade, in order to extract a component of the shift in trade flows that can be attributed to
foreign demand forces. Following Redding and Venables (2004), we first estimate:

       ln Xodkt = 1 ln Distod + 2 Bod + 3 Colod + 3 Langod + okt + dkt + odkt ,          (B.2)

where Xodkt denotes the trade flow of product k from country o to country d in year t. On the
right-hand side, Distod is the bilateral distance between o and d; Bod is an indicator variable
for whether the two countries share a common border; Colod is an indicator variable for shared
colonial ties; and Langod is a common language dummy. (Both the data on bilateral trade flows
and distance variables are from the CEPII; we use in particular the BACI database for trade
flows.) In the above, okt denotes exporter-by-product-by-year fixed effects, while dkt denotes
importer-by-product-by-year fixed effects; the estimation thus separates import demand from
export supply forces, and we consider the dkt 's as capturing demand shifters in the ROW that
would be faced by Chinese exporters. We estimate (B.2) separately for each HS6-digit product,
while excluding trade flows associated with China. We then construct the following measure of
exposure to demand shocks in the ROW:

                                            Xidk,2010 X   ^ ROW
                                                              dkt
                                                                   ,                     (B.3)
                                k   d=CHN   i X idk,2010 L i, 2010



where X   ^ ROW = X ROW dkt . Note that by multiplying the change (in log form) in the
           dkt         dk,t-1
product-specific demand shock in d (dkt ) with lagged product-k exports from the ROW to
               ROW
country d (Xdk,t -1 ), we obtain the change in exports from the ROW to d as predicted by a
gravity-based estimate of the change in market capacity of importer d. Panel C makes use of
this gravity-based Bartik IV from (B.3).
    We also construct a second gravity-based measure that is analogous to our baseline IV from
equation (3) in the main paper:

                                         Xik,2010 X    ^ ROW
                                                           kt
                                                                .                        (B.4)
                                     k   i X ik, 2010 L i, 2010


Here, X  ^ ROW =              ROW
          kt         d=CHN Xdk,t-1 dkt captures the implied demand shock for product k
summed across all destination countries d in the ROW. Panel D makes use of this alternative
gravity-based Bartik IV defined in (B.4).
   Based on Export Growth Rates: In Panel E, we experiment with a measure of the
ROW demand shock that is based on product-level export growth rates, as opposed to being




                                               61
denominated in dollar units per worker. This is constructed as:

                                               Xik,2010         ROW
                                      i                     ln Xkt  ,                                   (B.5)
                                           k   k X ik,2010


              ROW
where  ln Xkt      is the product-level growth rate of exports from the ROW to the ROW.
Note that the weights Xik,2010 / k Xik,2010 are now the share of product k in total exports from
prefecture i, and thus capture how important product k is for the prefecture. The term i is
a scaling term to capture the importance of exports for economic outcomes in the prefecture;
in particular, we set i to be total prefecture exports in 2012 divided by the working age
population in 2000 (Xi,2012 /Li,2000 ). The above variable is in the same spirit as Aghion et al.
(2018), who construct a Bartik-style export demand shock measure at the firm level. (There
are a large number of zero trade observations in the product-level trade data we work with.
We thus use in practice the Davis-Haltiwanger-Schuh approximation of the log growth rate,
            ROW       X ROW -Xk,t
                                ROW
                                  -1                                            ROW      ROW
i.e.,  ln Xkt     2 Xkt ROW +X ROW     , to avoid dropping observations where Xkt    or Xk,t -1 is
                           kt      k,t-1
a zero.) The results from using (B.5) as a Bartik IV for ExpShockit are reported in Panel E.
There is a decrease in the first-stage F-statistic to levels that are just above the rule-of-thumb
value of 10 for instrument relevance; that said, the effects of the export shock on labor strikes
and in inducing political responses from the local government remain statistically significant.


B.4      Dropping One HS Section at a Time
We assess whether our results hinge on the variation in export patterns inherent in any particular
segment of products. To do so, we reconstruct both the export shock in (1) and the Bartik IV
in (3), but leaving out the products from one HS section at a time. Bear in mind that the HS
sections are broad ­ there are only 15 HS sections ­ so that the number of products dropped
each time is large; there is thus a meaningful amount of variation left out with each iteration
of this check.51 If our baseline results are driven by endogeneity or pre-trend concerns that
are associated with a particular sector ­ a concern articulated by Goldsmith-Pinkham et al.
(2018) related to the use of Bartik instruments ­ one should expect the regression estimates to
be sensitive when we drop all products from the corresponding HS section. For each dependent
variable, we obtain 15 estimates of the export shock coefficient; we report the range of these
coefficients in Table B.5. Across the columns, we always find that the largest and smallest
coefficients obtained are negative and significantly different from zero. These findings alleviate
the concern that there may be particularly pivotal or influential product segments for which
the orthogonality conditions required for identification may be more questionable.
  51
     The HS sections are: (i) Animal & Animal Products; (ii) Vegetable Products; (iii) Foodstuffs; (iv) Mineral
Products; (v) Chemical & Allied Industries; (vi) Plastics/Rubbers; (vii) Raw Hides, Skins, Leather & Furs;
(viii) Wood & Wood Products; (ix) Textiles; (x) Footwear/Headgear; (xi) Stone/Glass; (xii) Metals; (xiii)
Machinery/Electrical; (xiv) Transportation; and (xv) Miscellaneous.




                                                      62
B.5     Effects of Future Export Shocks
To address the possibility that the results might be driven by pre-trends in the key variables,
we examine in Table B.6 whether the export shock at time t + 1 (as opposed to time t) has
explanatory power over the outcomes of interest. In particular, we adopt the same IV spec-
ifications as in equations (2), (8) and (9), but replace ExpShockit by ExpShocki,t+1 , while
instrumenting for the latter with the time-(t + 1) Bartik variable. In Column 1, this means
that we examine whether the annual change in strikes per worker in year t (for the sample
period 2013-2015) can be explained by the future export shock in year (t + 1); in Columns 2-5,
we are exploring whether the political response measures observed in year t (for the sample
period 2014-2016) respond with no lag to the contemporaneous year-t export shock. Across the
columns, the export shock coefficient that we now estimate is smaller in magnitude than in the
baseline results and typically not statistically significant. (The only exception is in Column 4,
which reports a mildly significant but positive effect on social spending; if anything, one would
need a reversion in pre-trends to rationalize the pattern for this particular outcome variable.)
In sum, these findings suggest that prefectures hit by more negative exports shocks were not
already experiencing faster deterioration in labor market conditions and social stability.


B.6     Balance Test of Product-level Export Shocks
The Bartik IV can be formulated more generally as k sik gk , where gk denotes the export
shock experienced by product k and sik measures the exposure of location i to each product-
level shock. (In our context, based on equation (3), we have: gk = ROWkt   / i Xik,2010 , and sik =
Xik,2010 /Li,2010 .) As discussed in Borusyak et al. (2018), the validity of the instrument relies
                                       p
on the assumption that k sk gk k      - 0, where sk = E (sik ) measures the expected exposure to
product k , and k = E (sik i )/E (sik ) is an exposure-weighted expectation of untreated potential
prefecture-level outcomes. Put in other words, the identification relies on the assumption
that, weighted by sk , the correlation between product-level shocks gk and unobservables k
approaches zero in large sample; this is the sense in which the shocks would then be as good
as randomly assigned. In our context, this assumption could be violated if say export demand
decreased more in products that happen to be produced in prefectures that were hit by other
unobserved shocks that also affect social stability.
    To allay this concern, we follow Borusyak et al. (2018) to test for whether the export shocks
are balanced with respect to various initial prefecture characteristics that could in principle
enter the i . In particular, we regress gkt on the empirical counterpart of k = E (sik i )/E (sik ),
where i comprises a set of various prefecture characteristics from 2010, namely: the share of
workers with college education, share of manufacturing employment, export to GDP ratio, share
of population without hukou rights, log GDP per capita, log fiscal revenue per capita. (The
data are drawn from the Census, the China City Statistical Yearbook, and the prefecture-level
yearbooks.) Table B.7 reports the results of this balance test. We report here the coefficient


                                                63
estimates from regressing the gkt 's (at the HS 6-digit level) against each of the weighted-average
prefecture characteristics and year fixed effects (with the sample period being 2013-2015). Each
regression is weighted by average industry exposure sk , and the standard errors are clustered
by 4-digit HS codes. The lack of statistical significance of the coefficients, both individually
and jointly, provides supportive evidence that our empirical setting ­ and in particular, the HS
6-digit product-level ROW export shocks ­ meets the requirements for treatment balance.


B.7     Alternative Clustered Standard Errors
As pointed out in Ad~   ao et al. (2018), the regression residuals in shift-share empirical spec-
ifications would be correlated across regions that are similar in their sectoral composition,
regardless of their geographic proximity, in the presence of unobserved sectoral shifters that af-
fect the outcome of interest. As a result, standard errors that are clustered by geographic unit
(in our context, by province) are likely biased downward. To address this potential problem, we
construct alternative clusters based on the similarity of prefectures' export structure. For each
prefecture, we calculate an index of the similarity of its initial vector of product-level export
shares to that of each of the 30 provincial capitals. The index we use is based on Finger and
Kreinin (1979):
                                                            ROW X ROW
                                                          Xik       jk
                      SimilarityIndexROWij    =    min      ROW
                                                                 , ROW ,
                                                 k
                                                          X i     X j

          ROW
where Xik       /XiROW (respectively, XjkROW
                                              /Xj ROW
                                                       ) denotes product k 's share in the total ex-
ports of prefecture i (respectively, j ) to the ROW. By construction, the index ranges between
0 to 1. If i's and j 's export patterns are totally dissimilar, in that i only exports products that
j does not (and vice versa), then the index takes on a value of 0. On the other extreme, if
the export shares of the two prefectures are identical, then the index is equal to 1. We used
the 2010 China customs data to construct this index, and then assigned each prefecture to an
export-similarity cluster corresponding to the provincial capital with which its export profile
was most similar.
    In Table B.8, we report the robust standard errors under different modes of clustering. Row
(i) reproduces our baseline standard errors, that are clustered at the province level. Row (ii)
reports the standard errors clustered instead by export-similarity group. Row (iii) then presents
standard errors that are two-way clustered by province and by export-similarity group. In Rows
(iv) and (v), we repeat the exercise in Rows (ii) and (iii), but modify how the export-similarity
groups are constructed; specifically, we group each prefecture with the provincial capital outside
of its own province with which its export-similarity index is highest. With this, there is no
overlap in the clusters at the province level and the export-similarity groups. The statistical
inference that we draw is robust regardless of the mode of clustering.
    As discussed in Ad~   ao et al. (2018), the spatial correlation of regression residuals induced
by similarity in sectoral composition will be less of a concern when the number of industries


                                                64
(in our case, products) in the shift-share IV is large, and when the shifter (in our case, export
demand from the ROW) soaks up most of the sectoral shocks affecting the outcomes of interest.
For our analysis, the number of products is more than 4,000. At the same time, the annual
product-level export shocks that we exploit can be relatively large in magnitude. These features
of our data potentially explain why our statistical inference is robust under alternative ways
of clustering the standard errors. (Note that we cannot directly apply the standard-error
correction approach proposed in Ad~  ao et al. (2018), since the number of products is larger than
the number of prefectures (333) in our setting.)


B.8     Political Response to Export Shocks: Extension
In this appendix section, we consider an extension to our framework in which we explicitly
model the upper-level government's concern with selecting high-quality local incumbents, in
addition to properly incentivizing them. We have the same basic two-period model, but now
there are two types of incumbents,  {H, L}, with the H -type being more capable than
the L-type in terms of delivering social stability, holding all else constant. Specifically, local
stability is given by:
                                  y =  + x + (1 - x)s + ,

with H > L ; recall that   N (0,  2 ) is an iid draw from the normal distribution with mean
0 and variance  2 . Again the upper-level government will follow a threshold strategy, keeping
the incumbent if y exceeds y¯(x), and replacing him otherwise from an ex ante identical pool of
potential officeholders. Note that is private information to each local officeholder, that is not
directly observed by the upper-level government.
    The officeholder of type would then choose s in order to maximize utility, U , given by:

                                    ¯(x)) R - g (s)
                        U = Pr (y > y
                           = (1 -  [¯
                                    y (x) -  - x - (1 - x)s]) R - g (s),

where (·) denotes the cdf of the N (0,  2 ) distribution, and g (s) is a type-specific cost function.
The first-order condition is then:

                            y (x) -  - x - (1 - x)s] (1 - x)R = g (s),
                           [¯                                                                  (B.6)

where (·) is the pdf of the N (0,  2 ) distribution. Denote by s the solution to equation (B.6).
                                                                                 
Let us further assume that g (s) = a + s, where  > 0, aH = 0 and aL > R/ 2 2 , so that
the H -type incurs a lower marginal cost of effort when implementing stability measures. In
this case, sL = 0 regardless of y¯(x), as the marginal cost of effort is always higher than the
marginal benefit for type L. This means that the low type will always choose zero effort, as
stability measures are too costly to him.
    Now we turn to the strategy of the upper-level government. Recall that she can fully observe


                                                 65
x, and her utility is given by the expected stability level:

                      E (y ) = (1 - x)(H s       
                                          H + L sL ) + (H H + L L ) + x

                            = (1 - x)H sH + (H H + L L ) + x,


where H and L denote respectively the shares of H -type and L-type among incumbents.
The second equality follows because s    L = 0. Therefore, the upper-level leader can optimize
the expected stability level by maximizing a H -type incumbent's effort towards maintaining
stability sH , by suitably choosing y¯(x) such that y  ¯ (x) = H + x + (1 - x)s H . Equation (B.6)
for type H can thus be written as:
                                          (1 - x)R
                                                      = s H,                                 (B.7)
                                            2     2

which characterizes the equilibrium effort level of the H -type.
    Equation (B.7) renders the following predictions on the incumbent's response to export
              ds            d2 s                 d2 s
shocks: (i) dx  H
                  < 0; (ii) dxdRH
                                  < 0; and (iii) dxd H
                                                        > 0, exactly as in the baseline model. On
the probability of turnover, this is once again not a function of the export shock per se ; in
particular, the threshold y ¯ (x) adjusts in response to the export shock x. Moreover, a L-type
incumbent would be more likely to be replaced than a H -type given the same observed level of
the export shock x. To see this, with H > L and s        H > 0, we have:


                                           y (x) - H - x - (1 - x)s
                        y (x) - L - x] >  [¯
                       [¯                                          H] .


Therefore, the cutoff rule also acts to screen out the L-type incumbents.

 Notes: The dependent variable in Column 1 is the change in CLB-recorded events per million workers in prefecture i between year
t - 1 and t, while that in Columns 2-5 is the change in the respective political response measure between year t and t + 1 (i.e., one
year after the export shock). All columns report IV regressions, based on the specification in (2) for Column 1, (8) for Columns
2-4, and (9) for Column 5. Panel A uses region-year instead of province-year fixed effects. Panel B reports unweighted regressions,
instead of weighting by the prefecture 2010 working-age population as in the rest of the table. Panel C drops the time-(t - 1) level
of CLB events per million workers or the corresponding time-t level of the political response measures from the right-hand side
controls. The additional time-t controls are those used in Column 3 of Table 2, namely: the changes in the log college-enrolled,
mobile-use, and internet-use shares. Column 5 further includes the incumbent characteristics used as controls in Column 1 of Table
9. Robust standard errors are clustered at the province level. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

                             weighted averages of beginning-of-period prefecture characteristics on
                             HS6 product-level export shocks and year fixed effects. Standard er-
                             rors are clustered by HS 4-digit codes. The regressions are weighted by
                             the average HS6 product-level export exposure across prefectures. Co-
                             efficients are multiplied by 100 for readability; none of the coefficient
                             estimates are significant at the 10% level.

 Notes: The dependent variable is the change in the prefecture log Baidu index score between week w - 1 and w.
The sample comprises all weeks in the years 2012-2015. All regressions are estimated by OLS, with six lags and
two leads of the weekly change in CLB-recorded events per million workers included as right-hand side variables.
All columns include province-by-week fixed effects, while Columns 3-4 further include prefecture fixed effects.
Columns 2 and 4 use the prefecture working-age population from the 2010 Census as regression weights. Robust
standard errors are clustered at the prefecture level. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

 Notes: The dependent variable is the change in log fiscal expenditure by social spending categories under the respective
column headings in prefecture i between year t and t + 1 (i.e., one year after the export shock). All columns report
IV regressions, weighted by the prefecture's working-age population in 2010, based on the specification in (8). Panel
A reports the average effects of the export shock on the respective fiscal spending measures. Panel B explores
heterogeneous effects: The (Events/L)it variable is the change in CLB-recorded events per million between year
t - 1 and t. (FiscalRev/L)i,2012 is the initial local fiscal revenue per worker in 2012. (49Age53)it is a dummy
variable for whether the prefecture party secretary is between ages 49 and 53 (inclusive) in year t. The additional
time-t controls are those used in Column 3 of Table 2, namely: the changes in the log college-enrolled, mobile-use,
and internet-use shares. Robust standard errors are clustered at the province level. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.
