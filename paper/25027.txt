Using data on 25 major American cities for the period 1900-1940, we explore the effects of
municipal-level public health efforts that were viewed as critical in the fight against food- and
water-borne diseases. In addition to studying interventions such as treating sewage and setting
strict bacteriological standards for milk, which have received little attention in the literature, we
provide new evidence on the effects of water filtration and chlorination, extending the work of
previous scholars. Contrary to the consensus view, we find that none of the interventions under
study contributed substantially to the observed declines in total and infant mortality.

1. INTRODUCTION

         Since the mid-19th century, mortality rates in the Western world have plummeted and life

expectancy has risen dramatically. Sometimes referred to as the mortality transition, this

development is widely recognized as one of the most significant in the history of human welfare

(Fogel 2004). Two features characterize the mortality transition. First, it was driven by reductions

in infectious diseases and diseases of infancy and childhood (Omran 2005; Costa 2015). Second, it

was concentrated in urban areas: at the turn of the 20th century, major cities were unsanitary havens

of pestilence; by 1940, urban mortality rates were comparable to those of rural areas (Haines 2001;

Cain and Hong 2009).

        Traditionally, economists have attributed the mortality transition to rising incomes, better

nutrition and the onset of modern economic growth (McKeown and Record 1962; McKeown 1976;

Fogel 1997, 2004). More recent reviews of the literature emphasize the role of public health efforts,

especially those aimed at purifying the water supply. For instance, Cutler et al. (2006) argue that

public health efforts drove the dramatic reductions in food- and water-borne diseases at the turn of

the 20th century. Similarly, Costa (2015) argues that clean-water technologies such as filtration and

chlorination were “the biggest contributor[s] to the decline in infant mortality” (p. 559), but

acknowledges that the effects of other public health interventions “remain understudied” (p. 546).

        Using data on 25 major American cities for the years 1900-1940, the current study revisits

the causes of the urban mortality decline at the turn of the 20th century. Specifically, we conduct a

statistical horse race that attempts to distinguish the effects of ambitious, often extraordinarily

expensive (Costa 2015, p. 554), public health interventions aimed at controlling mortality from food-

and water-borne diseases. Following previous researchers (Troesken 2004; Cutler and Miller 2005;

Beach et al. 2016; Knutsson 2018), we explore the extent to which filtering and chlorinating drinking

water contributed to the decline in typhoid mortality observed during the period under study and,

                                                    1
more generally, to the observed declines in total and infant mortality. In addition, we explore the

effects of several other municipal-level efforts that were, at the time, viewed as critical in the fight

against typhoid and other food- and water-borne diseases (Meckel 1990; Levitt et al. 2007; Melosi

2008) but have not received nearly as much attention from modern-day researchers. These

interventions include: the treatment of sewage before its discharge into lakes, rivers and streams;

projects designed to deliver clean water from further afield such as aqueducts and water cribs;

requirements that milk sold within city limits meet strict bacteriological standards; and requirements

that milk come from tuberculin-tested cows. Because the urban mortality transition was

characterized by substantial reductions in infant and childhood mortality (Omran 2005) and because

exclusive breastfeeding was not the norm during the period under study (Wolf 2001, 2003),

improvements in milk quality seem a particularly promising avenue to explore.

        Consistent with the results of Troesken (2004), Cutler and Miller (2005) and Beach et al.

(2016), we find that filtering the municipal water supply sharply reduced typhoid mortality. In fact,

our results suggest that the building of a water filtration plant cut the typhoid mortality rate by nearly

40 percent. More generally, however, our results are not consistent with the argument that public

health interventions drove the extraordinary reductions in infant and total mortality observed

between 1900 and 1940. Specifically, we find that efforts to purify milk had no appreciable effect on

infant mortality and no effect on mortality from non-pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), which was often

transmitted through infected milk. Likewise, neither chlorinating the water supply nor constructing

sewage treatment plants appears to have been effective. Although water filtration is associated with

a (statistically insignificant) 1-2 percent decrease in total mortality and an 11-12 percent decrease in

infant mortality, these estimates are considerably smaller than those found by previous researchers,

including Cutler and Miller (2005), the authors of the most influential study in this literature. Finally,

we find that filtration is associated with decreased diarrhea and enteritis mortality, but, given their

                                                     2
magnitude, our estimates fall well short of explaining the dramatic decline in mortality from these

causes during the period under study.

        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We begin with an overview of the

mortality transition and public health efforts to control food- and water-borne diseases. In Section

3, we describe our data and empirical strategy; in Section 4, we report our principal estimates; and in

Section 5 we explore their robustness and consider extensions to our baseline regression model. In

Section 6, we directly compare our water filtration estimates to those of Cutler and Miller (2005) and

document why they are so different. Using their original data and specification, we find that the

estimated effect of filtration on infant mortality shrinks by more than two-thirds when a series of

transcription errors are corrected. Section 7 concludes.



2. BACKGROUND

        Americans experienced an unprecedented improvement in health and longevity in the late

19th and early 20th centuries (Haines 2001; Riley 2005; Troesken 2015). During the period 1850-

1950, life expectancy at birth among whites increased by 75 percent from 39.5 to 69 years; among

non-whites, life expectancy more than doubled from 23 to 60.8 years (Troesken 2015, p. 10).

        This improvement in health and longevity was accompanied by radical changes in the U.S.

disease profile (Jones et al. 2012). Before 1900, the leading causes of death were food- and water-

borne diseases (e.g., diarrhea, enteritis and typhoid) and respiratory diseases (e.g., influenza and

pulmonary TB). By 1940, deaths from these diseases were on the wane; chronic conditions such as

heart disease and cancer had become the leading causes of death (Jones et al. 2012).

        Ferrie and Troesken (2008) use data from Chicago to illustrate mortality trends in major U.S.

cities. Between 1850 and 1925, the Chicago mortality rate fell by 60 percent, driven by the near

eradication of food- and water-borne diseases (which disproportionately affected infants and

                                                    3
children) and reductions in mortality from respiratory diseases. In other words, as Chicago

transitioned from a high- to low-mortality environment, so-called “modern diseases” replaced food-

borne, water-borne and respiratory diseases as the primary causes of death. 1 Boston, Philadelphia,

New York and other large American cities experienced their mortality/epidemiological transitions

over the same period, while similar transitions occurred roughly one-decade later in smaller

American cities (Haines 2001; Ferrie and Troesken 2008).



2.1. Efforts to supply clean water

         Many experts believe that, after 1900, the mortality transition in Chicago and other U.S.

cities was primarily driven by a series of public health interventions aimed at reducing food- and

water-borne illnesses (Cutler et al. 2006; Ferrie and Troesken 2008). 2 Yet, it is far from clear which

interventions were most effective, in part because the same city would often implement several of

them within a few years of each other, making it difficult to isolate the effect of any single

intervention, especially when researchers take a case-study approach. 3 Below, we describe the

various water-related public health efforts undertaken by U.S. cities during the period under study:




1 The phrase “modern diseases” suggests that other countries have experienced (or will experience) the equivalent of the
U.S. epidemiological transition (Jones and Greene 2013). This, of course, is an oversimplification. Perhaps because
economic development has been uneven, the epidemiological/mortality transition has not been universal (Frenk et al.
1989).

2 There is an argument to be made that these same public health interventions reduced the within-city (i.e., across

neighborhood) variation in mortality (Costa and Kahn 2015).

3
 For instance, Chicago built 5 separate tunnels under Lake Michigan during the period 1867-1892 in an effort to draw
water from beyond its heavily polluted shoreline (Reynolds 1894); in 1871, Chicago effectively reversed the current of
the Chicago River, which had previously carried sewage into Lake Michigan (Ferrie and Troesken 2008); in 1900, it
completed the Sanitary and Ship Canal guaranteeing that, even in the worst weather, the river flowed away from the lake
(Hering and Fuller. 1907; Ferrie and Troesken 2008); the North Shore Channel, designed to flush the sewage down the
Sanitary and Ship Canal, was completed in 1910 (Gustaitis 2013); in 1912, the city began treating its water with chlorine
before delivery to homes and businesses but the process of chlorination was not completed until 1917 (Jennings 1923);
and, in 1908, the city passed an ordinance requiring that milk sold within its limits meet a strict bacteriological standard
and come from tuberculin-tested cows. As described below, this ordinance had the effect of encouraging pasteurization.
                                                             4
         Water filtration. Chicago did not begin filtering its water supply until 1947 (Baylis 1949),

but filtration plants were built by most other major U.S. cities during the period under study. Of the

25 cities in our sample, all but 8 had built filtration plants by 1940 (Table 1). Originally developed to

reduce discoloration and turbidity, water filtration gained support as the field of bacteriology

advanced and city governments came under increasing political pressure to protect their citizens

from infectious diseases (McCarthy 1987; Melosi 2008, pp. 90-94). 4 Public health experts, armed

with studies showing dramatic decreases in typhoid mortality after filtration systems were put in

place (Clark 1907; Johnson 1907; Sedgwick and MacNutt. 1910; McLaughlin 1912a; Johnson 1913),

convinced skeptical policymakers that filtering water was a sound investment (Foss-Mollan 2001, pp.

80-116; Melosi 2008, p. 94).

         Chlorination. In 1908, Jersey City famously became the first municipality in the United

states to disinfect its water supply by treating it with chlorine (Allen 1918). The process of

chlorination was simple and inexpensive: water was added to bleaching powder (calcium

hypochlorite) to make a thick paste, which was then mixed with the water supply before delivery

(Hooker 1913). 5 In part because it was so inexpensive, chlorination quickly gained popularity (Hill

1911). By 1928, every city in our sample was chlorinating its water supply (Table 1), although issues

with taste and odor discouraged many smaller communities from adopting the technology. 6



4 The simplest method of water filtration (i.e., slow water filtration) consisted of “a body of sand of sufficient thickness,
underlaid or supported by a few inches of course and fine gravel or broken stone, with a proper number of pipe
underdrains to collect the water that passes through the sand…” (Clark 1907, p. 765). Mechanical filter plants, which
used coagulants and smaller filter beds, proved less expensive to build and maintain than slow water filtration plants and
eventually supplanted the latter (Johnson 1914a, 1914b).
5 Between 8 and 16 pounds of bleaching powder per million gallons of water were typically used (Hooker 1913, p. 65).
Within a decade of it being used to disinfect the Jersey City water supply, bleaching powder (also known as “chloride of
lime”) had been supplanted by liquid chlorine, which was less expensive and did not have “the disagreeable odor and
corrosive influences of chloride of lime” (Bowles 1919, p. 22).

6 According to Melosi (2008, p. 139), as late as 1939, only one-third of all U.S. waterworks used chlorine because of
“taste and odor problems.”

                                                              5
           Clean water projects. Chicago drew its water from Lake Michigan, but the city also

dumped its sewage, which carried disease-causing pathogens, directly into the lake (or into the

Chicago River, which flowed into the lake). In 1867, Chicago constructed a two-mile tunnel under

Lake Michigan, enabling it to extend its water crib well beyond its heavily polluted shoreline; in

1892, a four-mile tunnel was constructed (Reynolds 1894; Sells 2017). 7 Several other American cities

went to even greater lengths to deliver clean water, building aqueducts and tunnels that connected

distant reservoirs with their water distribution systems (Table 2). For instance, in 1914 San

Francisco began constructing a system of dams, conduits, hydroelectric plants and aqueducts

designed to deliver clean water from the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir to the Bay Area, a distance of over

150 miles (Hanson 2005). 8

           Sewage treatment plants. At the turn of the 20th century, dilution (i.e., discharge into lakes,

rivers, streams, or the ocean) was the standard method of sewage disposal. Experts argued that the

“natural power of self-purification” would render waste water clean and, ultimately, drinkable

(Whipple 1914, p. 638). 9 Evolving attitudes, coupled with new technologies and regulatory efforts,




7 Water cribs are structures designed to collect water from near the bottom of a lake, which is then carried to an onshore

pumping station. After the completion of these projects, typhoid deaths fell precipitously, as did deaths from respiratory
diseases such as pneumonia and TB, leading Ferrie and Troesken (2008, p. 15) to conclude that water purification efforts
reduced mortality “from diseases that other[wise] would not have been classified as waterborne or even water-related...”
In fact, Ferrie and Troesken (2008, p. 15) conclude that 35-56 percent of the total mortality decline in Chicago is
attributable to water purification efforts.

8 During the period 1900-1940, Boston, Jersey City, New York City, Newark and Providence also built aqueducts to
transport clean water from reservoirs located in protected watersheds. According to Melosi (2008, p. 57), “distant
sources of supply received great attention because they offered large and dependable quantities of water, but also
because they provided alternatives to polluted or infected sources in the local area.” Smaller cities, however, were “hard-
pressed to seek distant sources” and were therefore more likely to build filtration plants (Melosi 2008, p. 57).
9Despite this argument, several cities (including Chicago and Detroit) went to great lengths to ensure that their sewage
was disposed of downstream from the system intake (Hering and Fuller 1907; Cain 1977; Detroit Water and Sewerage
Department 2002).

                                                            6
prompted the construction of sewage treatment plants across the country (Tarr et al. 1984). 10 By the

end of 1940, 15 of the 25 cities in our sample were treating their sewage (Table 3). 11

            Previous studies in this literature have focused on estimating the effects of building and

extending sewer systems (i.e., providing sewerage) as distinct from treating sewage (i.e., using

chemical or biological processes to remove contaminants from waste water) before its discharge into

lakes, rivers and streams. For instance, using data from Paris for the period 1880–1914,

Kesztenbaum and Rosenthal (2017) show that the provision of sewerage to a neighborhood added

several years to the life expectancy of its residents. Using data on 60 municipalities in Massachusetts

for the period 1880-1920, Alsan and Goldin (2018) examine the effects of clean water and access to

a regional sewerage system on infant and child mortality. Instead of filtration or chlorination,

Massachusetts opted to provide clean water through a system of “impounding reservoirs in which

spring floodwaters were stored” (Alsan and Goldin 2018, p. 10). These authors find that the

interaction of clean water and sewerage accounted for approximately one-third of the observed

decline in child mortality (i.e., mortality among children under the age of 5) from 1880 to 1920 and

nearly one-half of the observed decline in infant mortality. 12 By the early 1900s, every major U.S.




10 During the period under study, the use of chemical precipitation (which involved the addition of coagulants to
separate sludge from water) waned and more efficient methods of treating sewage, including the activated sludge
process, were gradually adopted (Ardern and Lockett 1914; Reynolds 1933). Providence, Rhode Island was the first city
in our sample to treat its sewage. The Providence plant, built in 1901, used chemical precipitation (Nixon 1995). None
of the other cities in our sample adopted this technology and the Providence plant converted to using an activated
sludge process in the mid-1930s.

11 Philadelphia and San Francisco are not counted among these 15 cities because they were treating less than 25 percent
of their effluent by the end of the period under study (Mohlman 1940). We code our sewage treatment indicator as
equal to 0 for cities that were treating less than 25 percent of their effluent. If we apply a higher threshold (e.g., a city
must have been treating at least 50 percent of their effluent), our results are qualitatively similar. Appendix Figure 1
illustrates the rollout of the water-related interventions during the period 1900-1940 for our sample of cities.

12 Cutler  and Miller (2005) control for sewage treatment plants and the chlorination of sewage but only three out of 13
cities in their sample period constructed sewage treatment plants (Baltimore in 1911, Cleveland in 1922 and Milwaukee
in 1925) and only one city chlorinated its sewage (Cleveland in 1922).
                                                              7
city had installed sewers (Cain and Rotella 2001; Melosi 2008; Hoagland 2018), precluding us from

using the same regressors as were used by Alsan and Goldin (2018). 13



2.2. Efforts to supply clean milk

         Diarrheal diseases were important contributors to infant mortality in the early 1900s and

experts at the time were convinced that cleaning up the milk supply was key to combatting them

(Brosco 1999). Yet, aside from Olmstead and Rhode (2004a) and Komisarow (2017), modern-day

researchers have not paid a great deal of attention to milk-related public health efforts undertaken

during this period. 14 Below, we describe two milk-related municipal-level public health

interventions, the effects of which have not been explored sufficiently by previous researchers:

         Bacteriological standards for milk. Boston was the first U.S. city to require that milk sold

within its limits meet a bacteriological standard (specifically, a maximum of 500,000 bacteria per

cubic centimeter). Adopted by the Boston Board of Health in 1905, the rule was initially “the

subject of scoffing”, but ultimately served as a model for cities across the United States (Rosenau

1908, p. 434).

         Between 1900 and 1940, all but one of the 25 cities in our sample adopted a bacteriological

standard for milk (Table 4). 15 Although such standards were not always enforced with vigor



13 Baltimorewas the last major U.S. city to construct a sewer system. The first house was connected to the Baltimore
system in 1911 but the project was not completed until 1915 (Hoagland 2018).

14 Olmstead and Rhode (2004a) attribute the decline in bovine tuberculosis to a U.S. federal program that began in 1917

and was designed to eradicate the disease. See Olmstead and Rhode (2004b) for an excellent description of efforts to
control bovine TB that preceded the federal program. Using data from 40 U.S. cities, Komisarow (2017) explores the
effect of dairy farm inspections covering a “broad range of areas and practices, including the monitoring of animal
health, farmworkers’ sanitation practices, and farm worker health and hygiene” (p. 129) on mortality. She finds that the
introduction of dairy farm inspections reduced mortality from diarrhea and enteritis among one-year-olds by 14 percent,
but finds no effect among infants nor among children ages 2-4. In a robustness check, Alsan and Goldin (2015, p. 47)
include the proportion of dairies in the county that did not contain “objectionable features” as a control.

15 Komisarow  (2017, p. 131) asserts that only 5 major U.S. cities adopted a bacteriological standard for milk after 1901
(Kansas City, Missouri in 1902, Cleveland in 1906, Milwaukee in 1906, Omaha in 1906 and St. Paul in 1907). This
                                                             8
(Olmstead and Rhode 2004a), many cities went to great lengths to ensure that they were adhered to

by dairy farmers and milk vendors. For instance, Milwaukee employed 6 full-time inspectors to

ensure that its milk supply was clean (Milwaukee Common Council 1918); Baltimore hired 6 new

dairy-farm inspectors, two bacteriologists and two lab assistants shortly after its 1913 milk ordinance

was passed (Carey 1913). 16

         Ordinances requiring milk meet a bacteriological standard were (and are) sometimes referred

to by historians and public health experts as “pasteurization ordinances” (Harding 1917, p. 57;

Troesken 2015, pp. 33-34; Swinford 2016, p. 254; Komisarow 2017, p. 131) because they were

difficult to meet without resorting to pasteurization and, in fact, had the effect of encouraging all but

a handful of producers to pasteurize their milk (Meckel 1990, pp. 88-89). 17 Suggestive evidence of

their effectiveness comes from the fact that diarrheal deaths in the summer, when bacteria counts in

milk were highest, declined markedly between 1910 and 1930 (Cheney 1984; Condran 1988).

Nonetheless, this was a period during which “many municipalities were also making significant




assertion, which is incorrect, appears to be based on a misinterpretation of the “Collection of Milk” dates reported in
Table 114 of Parker (1917, p. 371).
16 Ingeneral, enforcement was strictest in the largest cities. Fuchs and Frank (1939) surveyed municipal health
departments across the country regarding their milk purification efforts in 1936. Cities with a population greater than
500,000 employed an average of 27.6 full-time milk inspectors; cities with a population between 100,000 and 500,000
employed an average of 3.7 full-time milk inspectors.

17 By the mid-1920s, the majority of American cities with a population greater than 100,000 reported that more than 90

percent of their milk supply was pasteurized (Ayers 1932). Many ordinances explicitly exempted pasteurized milk from
having to meet the bacteriological standard or allowed higher levels of bacteria in raw milk that was to be pasteurized
before being sold. Cities that required milk sold within their limits to meet a bacteriological standard but exempted
pasteurized milk include: Chicago, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia,
Providence and St Louis. During the period 1900-1940, only three cities in our sample (Detroit, Chicago and San
Francisco), required that all milk sold within their limits be pasteurized. Detroit passed its pasteurization ordinance in
1915 without first requiring that milk meet a bacteriological standard and that it come from tuberculin-tested cows
(Kiefer 1911; Clement and Warber 1918). One year later, the Chicago commissioner of health, worried about an
outbreak of Polio, ordered that all milk sold in the city be pasteurized (Czaplicki 2007). This emergency measure, which
was never rescinded, was viewed as necessary despite an ordinance requiring that unpasteurized milk sold within city
limits meet strict a strict bacteriological standard and that it come from tuberculin-tested cows. The San Francisco
pasteurization ordinance came into effect in 1939 (Skelly 1944). Boston, New York and Pittsburg banned the sale of raw
milk between 1940 and 1946.

and disentangling the effects of these various public-health interventions requires a more careful,

comprehensive empirical approach than heretofore undertaken.

         TB testing of dairy cows. Approximately 10 percent of dairy cows in the United States

were infected with bovine TB in 1917, the year in which federal efforts to control the disease were

begun (Olmstead and Rhode 2004a). Bovine TB can be transmitted to humans through the

consumption of raw milk and represented a particularly serious threat to the health of children and

infants because they had lower resistance to the disease (Olmstead and Rhode 2004a). Minneapolis

was the first city in our sample to require that milk sold within its limits come from tuberculin-tested

cows but the ordinance was not popular among dairy farmers and, at least initially, was not well

enforced (Keyes 1901; Baker 1910). Despite often bitter opposition from dairy farmers (Olmstead

and Rhode 2007), 22 of the 25 cities in our sample required that milk come from tuberculin-tested

cows by 1940. 18



3. DATA AND EMPIRICAL FRAMEWORK

         Our focus is on major U.S. cities, defined as having a population greater than 150,000 in

1900. This criterion is met by 24 cities. In addition to these 24 cities, we included data from

Memphis, Tennessee in our analyses. Although its population was less than 150,000 in 1900,




18For instance, due to opposition, the city of Cleveland did not initially require that dairy farmers comply with a
tuberculin-testing ordinance that was passed in 1906 (Lane and Weld 1908). A Chicago tuberculin-testing ordinance,
passed in 1908, faced so much resistance from dairy farmers that the Illinois legislature, under pressure from rural
constituents, passed a law prohibiting any city or town in the state from requiring that dairy cattle be tested for TB (Wolf
2001, pp. 59-63; Czaplicki 2007). Many ordinances explicitly exempted pasteurized milk from having to come from
tuberculin-tested cows. Cities that required milk sold within their limits to come from tuberculin-tested cows but
exempted pasteurized milk include: Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, New York and
Rochester. Appendix Figure 2 illustrates the roll-out of the milk-related interventions during the period 1900-1940 for
our sample of cities.

                                                            10
Memphis was among the 13 cities examined by Cutler and Miller (2005). All of our principal results,

discussed below, are robust to excluding Memphis.

          Municipal-level mortality data come from Mortality Statistics and Vital Statistics of the United

States, both of which were published annually by the U.S. Census Bureau. 19 From 1900 to 1940,

annual mortality rates in major American cities fell from 1,840 to 1,164 per 100,000 population, or

37 percent (Figure 1). The reduction in the infant mortality rate was even more dramatic, falling

from 383 to 80 per 100,000 population, or 79 percent (Figure 2).

          Typhoid deaths have been used as a proxy for water quality and to track diarrheal deaths

(Cutler and Miller 2005; Ferrie and Troesken 2008; Clay et al. 2014), but it is worth noting that they

represented only a small proportion of total deaths and never amounted to more than half of

mortality from diarrhea/enteritis. 20 In 1900, there were 39 typhoid deaths per 100,000 population

and 130 diarrhea/enteritis deaths per 100,000 population (Figures 3 and 4); by the 1920s, the

typhoid mortality rate was approaching zero (Figure 3) and the diarrhea/enteritis mortality rate was

not far behind (Figure 4). Mortality from non-pulmonary TB also plunged during the period under

study (Figure 5). In fact, by the mid-1930s non-pulmonary TB mortality among children under the




19 Specifically, mortality counts come from Mortality Statistics for the period 1900-1936 (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1906-

1938) and from Vital Statistics of the United States for the period 1937-1940 (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1939-1941, 1943).
Cause of death was obtained from the death certificate and coded using the International Classification of Diseases. When
more than one medical condition was listed on the death certificate, cause of death was based on a standardized
algorithm (Armstrong et al. 1999). Mortality rates are calculated using population data from the decennial censuses (and
linearly imputed for intercensal years).
20 See  Appendix Figures 3 and 4 for more information. Cutler and Miller (2005) assume a three-to-one ratio of
diarrhea/enteritis deaths to typhoid deaths. Based on this assumption, they conclude that “reductions in all waterborne
diseases account for about 8% of the reduction in total mortality….” (Cutler and Miller 2005, p. 14). In our data, the
ratio of diarrhea/enteritis to typhoid deaths ranges from 3.3 (in 1900) to 15.6 (in 1920). During the period under study,
diarrhea and enteritis deaths at the municipal level were reported in one category (“diarrhea and enteritis”) by Mortality
Statistics and Vital Statistics of the United States. Total mortality from diarrhea/enteritis is not available for the years 1939 or
1940. Enteritis is inflammation of the small intestine but can also include inflammation of the large intestine and
stomach (Pietrangelo 2016).

                                                                11
age of 2 had essentially been eradicated and non-pulmonary TB morality in other age groups was

approaching zero. 21

            We begin our exploration of which municipal-level public health efforts, if any, were

responsible for the trends shown in Figures 1-5 by estimating the following baseline regression:



(1)                ln(Mortality Ratect) = β0 + Zctβ1 + Xctβ2 + vc + wt + Θc· t + εct,



where c indexes cities and t indexes years. Our primary interest is in the variables that compose the

vector Zct, which were constructed using information available from a wide variety of primary and

secondary sources. Specifically, the vector Zct includes separate indicators for whether city c filtered

its water supply in year t, whether it treated its water with chlorine and whether it had completed a

clean water project. 22

            The vector of controls, Xct, is composed of city characteristics taken from the 1900-1940

Censuses (and linearly interpolated for intercensal years). Specifically, it includes the percent of the

population that was female, nonwhite, foreign born, under 15 years of age, 15-44 years of age and 45

years of age or older. The terms v c and wt represent city and year fixed effects, respectively. The city

fixed effects control for city-level determinants of mortality that were constant over time, and the

year fixed effects control for common shocks. In addition to these fixed effects, we include city-

specific linear time trends (Θc· t) to account for the possibility that mortality rates evolved differently


21 Our data do not distinguish between bovine TB mortality (caused by M. bovis), which was often transmitted through

milk, and non-bovine TB mortality (caused by M. tuberculosis), which was much more common and typically spread
through airborne particles (Anderson et al. forthcoming). Price (1939) estimates that M. bovis accounted for 12 percent
of total TB infections in the United States and there is evidence that approximately half of adult bovine TB sufferers
exhibited pulmonary infections (Olmstead and Rhode 2004a). By contrast, only 10 percent of bovine TB infections
were pulmonary among young children (Olmstead and Rhode 2004a).

22 Tables1 and 2 detail the water purification efforts of the cities in our sample. The references used to construct Tables
1 and 2 are given in Appendix B.

                                                            12
in cities that adopted certain technologies versus those that did not. Standard errors are corrected

for clustering at the city level (Bertrand et al. 2004).

          After estimating the baseline regression described above, we augment the vector Zct with an

indicator for whether city c treated or diverted its sewage in year t. Finally, our fully specified model

includes an indicator for whether city c required that milk sold within its limits meet a bacteriological

standard and an indicator for whether it required that milk come from tuberculin-tested cows. 23

Descriptive statistics and variable definitions are reported in Table 5. 24



4. BASELINE RESULTS

          We report estimates from the baseline model, which focuses on the relationship between

total mortality and water purification efforts, in the first column of Table 6. While the estimated

coefficient of the filtration indicator is negative, it is small and not statistically significant at

conventional levels. Taken at face value, it would suggest that filtering the municipal water supply

reduced the total mortality rate by 2 log points, or 2.0 percent (e-.02 -1 = -.020). By contrast, Cutler

and Miller (2005), whose empirical strategy and data are closest to ours, find that filtration is

associated with a 15 percent reduction in total mortality. 25 The estimated coefficients of the

chlorination and clean-water-project indicators are also small and statistically insignificant.



23Detroit passed its pasteurization ordinance in 1915 without first requiring that milk meet a bacteriological standard
and that it come from tuberculin-tested cows (Kiefer 1911; Clement and Warber 1918). The bacteriological standard
and tuberculin-testing indicators are set equal to .67 for Detroit in 1915 (the ordinance same into effect on May 1) and
set equal to 1 in subsequent years. We experimented with including a mandatory pasteurization ordinance indicator on
the right-hand side of our regressions. The results were qualitatively similar to those reported and discussed below.

24 When  information on the exact date of implementation was available, the water- and milk-related interventions took
on a value between 0 and 1 the year in which they went into effect.
25 Cutler and Miller (2005) report that water filtration is associated with a reduction in total mortality of 16 log points
(e-.16 – 1 = -.148). These authors estimate a regression model similar to equation (1) using data from 13 major American
cities for the period 1900-1936. In Section 6, we directly compare our filtration estimates to those of Cutler and Miller
(2005) and document why they are so different, at least with regard to infant and total mortality.

                                                            13
            The remaining columns of Table 6 report estimates from regression models in which the

sewage treatment/diversion and milk-related indicators are included on the right-hand side. The

estimated effect of treating/diverting sewage is small, positive and never statistically significant at

conventional levels. Likewise, the coefficients of the milk-related intervention indicators are small,

consistently positive, but imprecisely estimated. The joint effects of the water- and milk-related

public health interventions are given at the bottom of Table 6. There is little evidence that the

effects of these interventions, even when summed together, were related to total mortality.

            We turn our attention to infant mortality in Table 7. Across all specifications, there is strong

evidence of a negative relationship between water filtration and infant mortality. For instance,

filtration is association with a 12 percent reduction in the infant mortality rate if we do not include

the sewage- and milk-related intervention indicators; with these indicators on the right-hand side of

the regression model, it is associated with an 11 percent reduction. By contrast, Cutler and Miller

(2005) find that filtration was associated with a 35 percent reduction in the infant mortality rate. 26

            The results reported in Table 7 provide little evidence that the other interventions under

study contributed to the decline in infant mortality between 1900 and 1940. In fact, the estimated

effects of treating/diverting sewage, setting a bacteriological standard for milk and requiring dairy

cows to be tested for TB are consistently positive but statistically insignificant, and chlorination is

actually associated with a statistically significant 9-10 percent increase in the infant mortality rate. 27




26 Cutlerand Miller (2005) report that water filtration is associated with a reduction in the infant mortality rate of 43 log
points (e-.43 – 1 = -.349).

27 Cutler and Miller (2005) find a negative, but insignificant, relationship between chlorination and infant mortality,
although the coefficient of the interaction between chlorination and filtration is positive. These authors ascribe this
pattern of results to the fact that only a handful of cities in their sample adopted chlorination technology before building
a filtration plant. We, however, observe 9 cities that added chlorine to their water supply before the construction of a
filtration plant (Table 1).

                                                             14
Finally, the estimated effects of completing a clean water project, although negative, are not

statistically significant at conventional levels.



5. ROBUSTNESS CHECKS AND EXTENSIONS

         In Table 8, we explore the robustness of the infant mortality estimates described in the

previous section. We begin by controlling for the manufacturing wage in city c and year t, which can

be thought of as measuring the purchasing power of urban workers. The estimated coefficient of

the filtration indicator retains its magnitude and significance, suggesting that the effect of filtration

cannot be explained by changes in the purchasing power of urban workers. 28

         Additional robustness checks include controlling for region-by-year fixed effects, not

weighting by population, dropping New York City (the most populous city in the sample), dropping

the years 1917-1920 to avoid potential confounding from the effects of the 1918 influenza pandemic

and specifying the dependent variable in levels (as opposed to taking its log). The results of these

robustness checks provide evidence that the estimated effect of water filtration on infant mortality is

not an artifact of specification or sample choice. The positive (and admittedly counterintuitive)

association between chlorination and infant mortality, however, appears to be quite sensitive to

small changes in specification and sample composition. For instance, it shrinks and loses

significance when we include region-by-year fixed effects, do not weight by population, or run the

regression in levels as opposed to using the semi-log specification.


28 Data on the manufacturing wage come from the Biennial Census of Manufactures. The manufacturing wage is linearly

imputed for missing years and deflated using price indices in Rees and Jacobs (1961) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics
(1973). Rapid industrialization after 1900 led to substantial increases in the purchasing power of workers as measured by
the manufacturing wage (Bry 1960; Rees and Jacobs 1961). With the stock market crash in October of 1929 and the
onset of the Great Depression, the ranks of the unemployed swelled but real wages continued to increase (Margo 1993).
Evidence that the typical American diet underwent profound changes during the period under study is provided by
Bente and Gerrior (2002). Because the Census of Manufactures was discontinued after 1937, the column (1) regression is
based on the years 1900-1937. If we do not control for the manufacturing wage and restrict our attention to the period
1900-1937, the coefficient of the filtration indicator is equal to -.101 and is statistically significant at the 5 percent level.

                                                               15
          Next, we estimate a modified version of equation (1) in which the filtration indicator is

decomposed into a series of mutually exclusive lags. The results, which are reported in Table 9,

suggest that the effect of constructing a water filtration plant gradually became stronger over time.

Specifically, filtration is associated with a (statistically insignificant) 6-7 percent decrease in the infant

mortality in the year of implementation (Year 0); two years after implementation, filtration is

associated with a 9-10 percent decrease; and, after 5 or more years, filtration is associated with a 16

percent decrease in the infant mortality rate. 29 Replacing the filtration indicator with a series of its

leads and lags produces a similar pattern of results (Figure 6). Again, the effect of filtration increases

after Year 0 and there is no evidence that infant mortality rates began trending downwards prior to

the adoption of filtration, suggesting the parallel trends assumption is satisfied. 30



5.1. Interactive effects

          In the early 20th century, public health experts often disagreed as to whether it was necessary

to chemically treat water that had already been filtered and vice versa (Hill 1911; Orchard 1917; Race

1918; Kienle 1919; Stein 1919; Clark 1921). 31 There was also debate surrounding whether the


29 Even  after a filtration plant came online, it could be some time before filtered water was delivered throughout the city.
For instance, during its first 6 months of operation, the Cleveland filtration plant mixed its output with “raw” (i.e.,
unfiltered) water before delivery (Unknown Author 1918). The effort to provide filtered water to every neighborhood in
Philadelphia took more than three years (McCarthy 1987). Cutler and Miller (2005) find that the effects of water
purification efforts on total mortality and typhoid mortality grew over time. These authors argue that “[g]rowing effects
over time could be due to…increases in complementary private health behaviors (like hand washing, boiling milk, and
appropriate food storage) as the expected return to health investments rises” (pp. 14-15).
30Conventional difference-in-differences (DD) estimates can be biased if the treatment is not constant over time
(Goodman-Bacon 2018). One method of assessing the degree of bias is to compare the conventional DD estimate with
an average of event-study coefficients. The average of the coefficients for Year 0 through 5+ Years After Filtration in
Figure 6 is -.135. By comparison, the estimated effect of filtration reported in column (5) of Table 7 is -.111. Event
studies for chlorination, clean water projects and sewage treatment/diversion are shown in Appendix Figure 5.
Consistent with the parallel trends assumption, there is little evidence of an association between these interventions and
infant mortality prior to Year 0. Event studies for requiring that milk meet a bacteriological standard and that it come
from tuberculin-tested cows are shown in Appendix Figure 6. Again, there is little evidence of pre-treatment differences
in infant mortality rates.

31 Modern-day   researchers have also come to different conclusions with regard to the direction and importance of these
interactive effects. For instance, Cutler and Miller (2005) find evidence that “filtration and chlorination were substitute
                                                             16
treatment of sewage was necessary if the downstream water supply was chlorinated and/or filtered

(McLaughlin 1912b; Eddy 1913; Whipple 1913, 1914; Phelps 1918). We begin an exploration of

these questions by introducing interactions between filtration and the other efforts to purify

municipal water supplies.

          The results, which are reported in Table 10, provide evidence, albeit tentative, that these

interactions had negative effects on infant mortality. For instance, the estimated coefficient of the

filtration-sewage treatment/diversion interaction is negative and quite large, but statistically

insignificant. Taken at face value, it suggests that the combination of filtration and treating sewage

led to a 7 percent reduction in infant mortality. The estimated coefficients of the

Filtration*Chlorination and Filtration*Clean Water Project interactions are also negative, but imprecisely

measured. 32



5.2. Estimates by cause of death

          Municipal water purification efforts were often undertaken with the explicit goal of reducing

(or even eradicating) typhoid infections (Foss-Mollan 2001; Melosi 2008) and, more often than not,

public health officials could point to fewer typhoid deaths after these efforts came to fruition (Eddy

1913; Elms 1914; Jennings 1918; Morse and Hall 1919). 33 Nonetheless, it was widely recognized that



technologies” (p. 11). By contrast, Troesken (2004, p. 139-143) finds that typhoid mortality in Washington D.C. fell by
29 percent when its filtration plant opened and that filtration and chlorination combined reduced typhoid mortality in
Washington D.C. by 57 percent.

32Interacting Chlorination with Clean Water Project or with Sewage Treatment/Diversion produced coefficient estimates that
were negative in sign, small in magnitude and nowhere near statistically significant. Using data on 60 municipalities in
the Boston Harbor watershed area for the period 1880-1920, Alsan and Goldin (2018) examine the interaction between
access to a regional sewerage system and the provision of clean water. Municipalities in their sample began receiving
sewerage as early as 1892.
33 Interestingly,
                there was much consternation and complaint when typhoid mortality did not fall immediately after the
Washington D.C. filtration plant was put into operation (Horton 1906; Woodword 1907) and blame was placed on
infected dairy products and other sources (Horton 1906; Sedgwick 1906).

                                                            17
typhoid mortality could be used as a gauge of overall water quality and that mortality from other

water-borne diseases should, at least in theory, decline with the adoption of filtration and/or

chlorination technology (Sedgwick and MacNutt. 1910; Hill 1911; Jordan 1916).

            In the first column of Table 11, we report estimates from a modified version of equation (1)

where the dependent variable is the typhoid mortality rate per 100,000 population. Because there

were zero typhoid deaths for 20 city-year combinations, we used the quartic root of the typhoid

mortality rate instead of taking its natural log. 34 The marginal effects of the various interventions on

the typhoid mortality rate are reported in brackets (below the standard errors). We find that the

adoption of water filtration technology substantially reduced typhoid mortality. Specifically,

filtration is associated with 4.6 fewer deaths from typhoid per 100,000 population, or a 36 percent

reduction relative to the mean. 35 However, there is little evidence that the other public health

interventions under study were related to typhoid mortality.

            In the remaining columns of Table 11, we turn our attention to diarrhea/enteritis mortality

and mortality from non-pulmonary TB. 36 Although previous researchers have investigated the

effects of filtration and chlorination on typhoid mortality (Troesken 2004; Cutler and Miller 2005;

Beach et al. 2016), this is the first study that uses historical data to examine the effects of these


34 This
      method of dealing with zeros has been used by Thomas et al. (2006), Tarozzi et al. (2014), Ashraf et al. (2015) and
Anderson et al. (2016), among others. Taking the natural log of the rate or taking the natural log of the rate plus 1
produced similar results.
35 Cutlerand Miller (2005) find that filtration is associated with a reduction in the typhoid mortality rate of 46 log points,
or 37 percent (e-.46 – 1 = -.369).

36 Specifically,
               we report estimates of equation (1) using the natural log of total diarrhea/enteritis deaths per 100,000
population as the dependent variable and the natural log of diarrhea/enteritis deaths among children under the age of
two per 100,000 population. We also report estimates of equation (1) using the natural log of total non-pulmonary TB
deaths per 100,000 population as the dependent variable and the quartic root of non-pulmonary TB deaths among
children under the age of two per 100,000 population. Although half of adult bovine TB sufferers exhibited pulmonary
infections, only 10 percent of bovine TB infections were pulmonary among young children (Olmstead and Rhode
2004a). Because there were zero non-pulmonary TB deaths among children under the age of two for 12 city-year
combinations, we used the quartic root function instead of the natural log. Marginal effects are reported in brackets
below the standard errors.

                                                             18
interventions on diarrheal mortality. 37 It is also the first study to test whether turn-of-the-20th

century efforts to purify the milk supply at the municipal level led to reductions in mortality from

non-pulmonary TB mortality.

           As noted above, diarrheal deaths fell to near-zero levels during the period under study, at

least in major American cities (Figure 4). The results reported in Table 11 provide evidence that

filtration contributed to this phenomenon. Specifically, filtration is associated with a statistically

significant 14 percent reduction in the diarrhea/enteritis mortality rate. The estimated effects of the

milk-related interventions are, by contrast, consistently positive and imprecise. In fact, aside from

filtration, there is little evidence that any of the public health interventions under study contributed

to the falling rates of diarrhea/enteritis mortality. 38 Similarly, the public health interventions under

study seem to have been essentially unrelated to the non-pulmonary TB mortality rate. 39 Even

municipal ordinances requiring that milk meet strict bacteriological standards and that dairy cows be

tested for TB seem to have been ineffective at reducing the non-pulmonary TB mortality rate.




37 Cutler and Miller (2005) have mortality data on diarrhea/enteritis mortality for one year, 1900. Based on these data,

they assume a three-to-one ratio of diarrhea/enteritis deaths to typhoid deaths. Using data on 60 municipalities in
Massachusetts for the period 1880-1920, Alsan and Goldin (2018) find that the interaction of sewerage and clean water
is associated with a reduction in gastrointestinal mortality among children. Ferrie and Troesken (2008) use typhoid
mortality to proxy for water quality in Chicago. These authors find a strong negative association between typhoid
mortality and mortality due to other causes (including diarrhea/enteritis), which they interpret as evidence of a Mills–
Reincke effect. Using data from 15 American cities for 1908, Troesken (2004, pp. 179-183) examines the relationship
between miles of water mains per 100,000 population (a measure of “extensiveness of local water systems”) and
mortality from water-borne diseases, defined as the sum of typhoid and diarrheal mortality. Several studies in the
economics literature use more recent data to examine the effect of water purification efforts on diarrheal mortality
among children in the developing world. For instance, Bhalotra et al. (2017) estimate that a Mexican program that
increased the share of the population receiving chlorinated water by 30 percentage points led to a substantial reduction
in diarrheal mortality among children. Galiani et al. (2005) find that the privatization of municipal water companies in
Argentina is associated with substantial reductions in mortality from infectious and parasitic diseases among children.
Related studies in the medical literature include Arnold et al. (2007) and Gruber et al. (2013).
38The completion of a clean water project is associated with a 15 percent reduction in the total diarrhea/enteritis
mortality rate. It is also associated with a 15 percent reduction in the diarrhea/enteritis mortality rate among children
under the age of two. Neither of these estimates, however, are statistically significant at conventional levels.
39   Non-pulmonary TB mortality counts by age are unavailable at the municipal level for the years 1937-1940.

5.3. A closer look at filtration and typhoid mortality

         In this subsection, we take a closer look at the estimated effect of filtration on typhoid

mortality. Specifically, we show results from the same checks that were used to explore the

robustness of the infant mortality estimates in Table 7.

         The relationship between filtration and typhoid mortality is reasonably robust to

specification and sample choice (Table 12). For instance, controlling for the manufacturing wage,

filtration is associated with 4.9 fewer typhoid deaths per 100,000 population, or a 36 percent

reduction relative to the mean; controlling for region-by-year fixed effects, filtration is associated

with 5.1 fewer typhoid deaths per 100,000 population, or a 40 percent reduction relative to the

mean. Estimating equation (1) in levels (as opposed to taking the quartic root of the typhoid

mortality rate) produces an estimated effect of filtration on the typhoid mortality rate that is less

precise than the other estimates in Table 12 but about twice their size: in this specification, filtration

is associated with 9.7 fewer typhoid deaths per 100,000 population, or a 77 percent reduction relative

to the sample mean.

         In Table 13, we decompose the filtration indicator into a series of mutually exclusive lags.

Similar to the results for infant mortality, the effect of filtration on typhoid mortality gradually

becomes stronger over time. Replacing the filtration indicator with a series of its leads and lags

produces a similar pattern of results (Figure 7). The filtration effect steadily becomes stronger after

Year 0 and there is no evidence that typhoid mortality was trending downwards during the years

leading up to the adoption of filtration technology. 40



40 In Appendix Table 1, we explore the robustness of the diarrhea/enteritis results originally reported in Table 11. The
estimated effect of filtration on the diarrhea/enteritis mortality rate is consistently negative, although it loses significance
when we drop the years 1917-1920 or specify the dependent variable in levels. Controlling for region-by-year fixed
effects produces evidence that the construction of a clean water project led to a substantial reduction in
diarrhea/enteritis mortality. Results reported in Appendix Table 2 and Appendix Figure 7 indicate that the effect of
filtration on diarrhea/enteritis mortality gradually became stronger over time. Finally, we experimented with the wild
cluster bootstrap method for inference suggested by Cameron et al. (2008) and Cameron and Miller (2015). Appendix
                                                              20
6. COMPARING OUR ESTIMATES TO THOSE OF CUTLER AND MILLER

            Using data from 13 major American cities for the period 1900-1936, Cutler and Miller

(2005), hereafter C&M, investigate the effects of water filtration and chlorination on mortality.

C&M’s empirical strategy is similar to ours and their mortality data also come from Mortality Statistics.

They find that water filtration is associated with a reduction in total mortality of 16 log points (= -15

percent) and a reduction in infant mortality of 43 log points (= -35 percent). C&M’s estimate of the

effect of filtration on typhoid mortality is almost exactly equal to our estimate (reported in the first

column of Table 11). However, C&M’s infant and total mortality estimates are considerably larger.

In this section, we explore why.

            We begin by successfully reproducing C&M’s estimates of the effects of filtration and

chlorination on total mortality using their specification and original data. These estimates are

reported in column (1) of Table 14. 41 While C&M’s specification is similar to ours, they control for

5 lags of the total mortality rate. Because the inaugural issue of Mortality Statistics was published in

1900, including these lags effectively restricted their analysis to the period 1905-1936. In Appendix

Table 4, we compare their specification and sample to ours. 42

            In column (2) of Table 14, we correct their standard errors for clustering at the municipal

level (Bertrand et al. 2004). With this correction, the filtration coefficient is still significant at the 5

percent level, but the coefficient of the interaction between chlorination and filtration is no longer

statistically significant. C&M interpret the positive and significant coefficient of the interaction

between chlorination and filtration as evidence that these were “substitute technologies” (p. 11).


Table 3 reports our preferred filtration estimates for infant, typhoid, diarrhea/enteritis and diarrhea/enteritis (under age
2) mortality but also includes a row of p-values calculated from the wild bootstrap procedure for comparison.

41We are grateful to Cutler and Miller for graciously providing us with their data and do-file. These estimates
correspond to those reported by C&M in the second column of Table 5.

42 In   Appendix Table 5, we list and describe the controls used by C&M.

                                                             21
         In the third column of Table 14, we correct a minor transcription error. Memphis did not

provide mortality data to the U.S. Census Bureau in 1916, so C&M assign Memphis a total mortality

rate of zero for this year. Because they use a semi-log specification, the 1916 Memphis observation

is dropped from their regression, but the 5 lags of the 1916 Memphis total mortality rate are

incorrectly coded as zeros. Dropping these 5 observations with missing lagged mortality rates

reduces the estimated effect of filtration from -16 log points to -13 log points.

         For the years 1910-1917, C&M rely on total mortality rates published in Mortality Statistics. 43

By contrast, for the years 1900-1909 and 1918-1936, C&M calculate total mortality rates using

mortality counts from Mortality Statistics and U.S. Bureau of the Census population estimates (linearly

imputing population for intercensal years). In the fourth column of Table 14, we use this same

method to consistently calculate total mortality rates for the entire period under study, 1900-1936,

which reduces the estimated impact of filtration from -13 log points to -8 log points. 44

         In the fifth column of Table 14, we correct C&M’s chlorination and filtration dates. 45 These

corrections reduce the filtration estimate further, to -4.3 log points, which is less than a third the size

of C&M’s original estimate. In the last column of Table 14, we switch from C&M’s specification to



43These mortality rates can be found in Table III in U.S. Bureau of the Census (1910, 1911, 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916,
1917).

44 Population estimates at the city level for 1910 can be found in Table I of U.S. Bureau of the Census (1910).

Population estimates for 1920 can be found in Table IB of U.S. Bureau of the Census (1920). We also corrected two
minor mortality count transcriptions errors made by C&M for Baltimore in 1929 and New Orleans in 1930.

45The majority of these corrections were trivial. For instance, according to C&M, Baltimore began filtering its water
supply in 1914, but the Montebello Water Filtration Plant did not begin operations until September 13, 1915
(Hendrickson 2012). However, the chlorination dates provided by C&M for Memphis, Milwaukee and St. Louis are off
by at least 5 years. Memphis began chlorinating its water supply in 1920, not after 1936 (Typhoid in the Large Cities
1921, 1922); Milwaukee began chlorinating its water supply in 1910, not 1915 (Jennings 1918); and St. Louis began
chlorinating its water supply in 1913, not 1919 (Wall 1920). Chicago began experimenting with chlorinating its water
supply in 1912, but full chlorination was not achieved until 1917 (Jennings 1923). We chose to use 1912 as the start date
for Chicago chlorination but using 1917 does not appreciably change our results or those of C&M. Likewise, the
process of delivering filtered water to all the neighborhoods of Philadelphia began before 1906 and was not completed
until 1909 (Philadelphia 1909). We chose to use 1906 as the start date for Philadelphia filtration but using 1909 does not
appreciably change our results or those of C&M.

                                                           22
ours but restrict the sample to their years (i.e., 1905-1936) and cities. Filtration is associated with a

statistically insignificant reduction in total mortality of 4.2 log points, which is still considerably

larger than the estimate we report in the last column of Table 6, suggesting that the effect of

filtration on total mortality in the 13 cities analyzed by C&M may have been larger than its effect in

our expanded sample of 25 cities. 46

           We turn our attention to C&M’s infant mortality estimates in Table 15. Again, we begin by

reproducing C&M’s estimates of the effects of chlorination and filtration on infant mortality using

their original data. 47 In the second column of Table 15, we show that the estimated relationship

between filtration and infant mortality is still significant at the one percent level after correcting their

standard errors for clustering at the municipal level. In the third column, we drop the 5 Memphis

observations with missing lagged total mortality, which reduces the estimated effect of filtration on

infant mortality from -43 to -37 log points. In the fourth column, we correct a series of

transcription errors in C&M’s infant mortality counts (79 of 410 infant mortality counts were

incorrectly transcribed). These errors are detailed in Appendix Table 6. 48 Correcting them reduces

the estimated effect of filtration on infant mortality by almost two-thirds, from -37 log points to -13



46 The estimated effect of filtration on total mortality reported in the last column of Table 14 is very similar in magnitude
to an estimate produced by Catillon, Cutler and Getzen (2018) using data for the period 1905-1936 from the same 13
cities (see the first column of their Table 2). Catillon, Cutler and Getzen (2018) used C&M’s specification, but omitted
the city-specific linear trends and the following controls listed below in Appendix Table 5: ln(Poplation), Filtration w/in 5
Years and Chlorination w/in 5 Years.

47   These estimates correspond to those reported by C&M in the third column of Table 5.

48 In 9 out of the 13 cities in their sample, C&M make systematic transcription errors for the years 1910-1917. In these
city-year combinations, infant mortality counts are reported with decimal values. In Appendix Table 6, we list the
correct counts from Mortality Statistics alongside the incorrect values recorded by C&M. The differences between their
recorded values and the correct counts are not large for some cities, such as Chicago and St. Louis. For other cities,
however, the differences are substantial. For instance, the values recorded by C&M for Memphis and New Orleans are
roughly 50 percent smaller than the correct counts from Mortality Statistics. In all cases, the values recorded by C&M are
less than the true values. In addition to the systematic errors for the period 1910-1917, C&M make several other
transcription mistakes, some of which can easily be explained. For example, for Pittsburgh in 1901, C&M appear to
have incorrectly recorded the overall mortality count (6,578 deaths) instead of the infant mortality count (1,580 deaths).
For Pittsburgh in 1904, they appear to have incorrectly recorded 1,771 infant deaths as “771” infant deaths.

                                                             23
log points. Correcting C&M’s chlorination and filtration dates reduces the filtration estimate still

further, to a statistically insignificant -3.8 log points. Finally, when we switch from C&M’s

specification to ours (but restrict the sample to their years and cities), filtration is associated with a

reduction in infant mortality of 9.6 log points, which is similar in magnitude to our estimates

reported in Table 7. 49



7. GAUGING THE OVERALL IMPACT OF FILTRATION

         By 1940, 17 out of the 25 cities in our sample were filtering their water supply. To gauge the

extent to which the infant mortality decline documented in Figure 2 can be explained by filtration,

we calculated a predicted infant mortality rate for every year t (and its 90 percent confidence interval)

under the assumption that no filtration plants were constructed during the period 1900-1940.

Predicted mortality infant rates are from a regression model that controls for the variables listed in

Table 5, city fixed effects, year fixed effects and city-specific linear trends. The results from this

exercise are shown in Figure 8 and actual infant mortality rates for the cities in our sample are also

plotted for reference.

         The actual and predicted mortality rates are not far apart throughout the period under study,

suggesting that filtration did not contribute substantially to the observed decline in infant mortality.

For instance, the actual infant mortality rate among the 25 cities in our sample was 80 per 100,000

population in 1940. In the absence of filtration plants, we predict that it would have been 97 per

100,000 population. Even using the upper bound of the 90 percent confidence interval, we predict

that the infant mortality rate would have fallen by 71 percent (from 383 to 110 per 100,000


49 A final difference between C&M’s specification and ours is that they divide infant mortality by infant population rather

than overall population when calculating the infant mortality rate. If we do this, the filtration estimate reported in
column (6) in Table 15 becomes smaller in magnitude and loses precision (Filtration estimate = -.066, with a standard
error = .045).

                                                            24
population) had no filtration plants been built by the 25 cities in our sample during the period 1900-

1940.

         To gauge whether the typhoid mortality decline documented in Figure 3 can be explained by

filtration, we calculated a predicted typhoid mortality rate for every year t (and its 90 percent

confidence interval) under the assumption that no water filtration plants were built (Figure 9). The

actual typhoid mortality rate among the 25 cities in our sample was 0.44 per 100,000 population in

1940. In the absence of filtration plants, we predict that it would have been 8.3 per 100,000

population. Using the upper bound of the 90 percent confidence interval, we predict that the

typhoid mortality rate would have fallen by 59 percent (from 39 to 16 per 100,000 population) had

no filtration plants been built during the period 1900-1940. 50



8. CONCLUSION

         The mortality transition is of obvious importance to policymakers and economic historians,

but its causes are not well understood. Prominent economists such as Fogle and McKeown have

argued that rising incomes and better nutrition were the primary drivers of the morality transition

(McKeown and Record 1962; McKeown 1976; Fogel 1997, 2004). More recently, however,

economists have emphasized the role of municipal-level public health interventions. For instance,

Costa (2015) argues that filtration and chlorination were the primary drivers of the reduction in




50 In Appendix Figures 8 and 9, we repeat these exercises for infant and typhoid mortality, respectively, under the
assumption that no water-related interventions had been implemented by the 25 municipalities in our sample during the
period 1900-1940. These results are similar to those shown in Figures 8 and 9. In Appendix Figures 10 and 11, we
gauge the extent to which the observed diarrhea/enteritis mortality decline can be explained by filtration and, more
generally, by water-related interventions, respectively. In both figures, the actual and predicted rates are never far apart
throughout the period under study, suggesting that water-related technologies did not contribute substantially to the
decline in diarrhea/enteritis mortality. Finally, in Appendix Figure 12, we show that predicted infant mortality rates
under the assumption that the interactive effect between filtration and chlorination was zero. In Appendix Figures 13
and 14, we repeat this exercise for the interaction between filtration and clean water projects and for the interaction
between filtration and sewage treatment/diversion, respectively. The results suggest that interactive effects between
filtration and other water-related interventions did not appreciably contribute to the observed decline in infant mortality.

infant mortality; citing Cutler and Miller (2005), Cutler et al. (2006) argue that public health

interventions such filtration and chlorination were responsible for the dramatic reductions in food-

and water-borne diseases at the turn of the 20th century.

        In this study, we reevaluate the impact of public health interventions on the urban mortality

decline in the United States at the turn of the 20th century. Specifically, using data on 25 major

American cities for the years 1900-1940, we attempt to distinguish the effects of municipal-level

efforts to purify water and milk supplies. Previous researchers, including Cutler and Miller (2005),

Troesken (2004), Beach et al. (2016) and Knutsson (2018) focus on estimating the contributions of

filtering and chlorinating drinking water to the urban mortality decline. In addition to these

interventions, we examine the treatment of sewage before discharging it into lakes, rivers and

streams, the construction of large-scale projects designed to deliver clean water from further afield,

requirements that milk sold within city limits meet strict bacteriological standards and requirements

that milk come from tuberculin-tested cows.

        Consistent with the results of turn-of-the-20th-century studies (Clark 1907; Johnson 1907;

Sedgwick and MacNutt. 1910; Johnson 1913; McLaughlin 1912a), as well as more recent research

(Troesken 2004; Cutler and Miller 2005; Beach et al. 2016), we find that filtering the municipal water

supply sharply reduced typhoid mortality. For instance, after 5 or more years, filtration is associated

with more than a 60 percent reduction in the typhoid mortality rate. More generally, however, our

results are not consistent with the argument that municipal public health interventions were

important drivers of non-typhoid mortality. Specifically, we find little evidence that the chlorination

of water supplies or the milk-related interventions under study affected mortality. Likewise, we find




                                                    26
little evidence that treating sewage (i.e., using chemical or biological processes to remove

contaminants from waste water) was effective. 51

         By contrast, the building of a water filtration plant is negatively associated with infant

mortality. Nonetheless, filtration can explain, at most, only a small fraction of the overall decline in

infant mortality observed during the period 1900-1940. Although we find evidence that water

filtration led to reductions in diarrheal mortality, our results suggest that filtration alone cannot

explain why diarrheal mortality fell so precipitously after 1900.

         Leaning on the results of Cuter and Miller (2005), scholars such as Cutler et al. (2006) and

Costa (2015) argue that municipal public health efforts were important drivers of the mortality

transition at the turn of the 20th century. Because the study by Cutler and Miller (2005) is so

influential, it is important to document why our results are different from theirs. Using their original

data and specification, we find that the estimated effect of filtration on total mortality shrinks by

half, from -16 log points to -8 log points, when we correct a handful of transcription errors and use

U.S. Bureau of the Census population estimates to consistently calculate the total mortality rate for

the entire period under study, 1900-1936. Correcting a series of transcription errors in their infant

mortality counts (79 of 410 infant mortality counts were incorrectly transcribed) reduces the

estimated effect of filtration on infant mortality by two-thirds, from -43 log points to -13 log points.

         If public health interventions such as chlorination and filtration cannot explain why mortality

fell between 1900 and 1940, what can? Our results point to other factors such as better living

conditions and improved nutrition as being responsible for the sharp decline in urban mortality at

the turn of the 20th century. However, this is admittedly an educated guess. We hope that readers




51 It
    is worth reiterating that we cannot examine the effects of providing sewerage (i.e., the building and extending of
sewer systems) because, by the early 1900s, every major U.S. city was providing sewerage to its residents (Melosi 2008;
Hoagland 2018).

will embrace the implicit challenge inherent in our results and redouble their efforts to discover the

true causes of the urban mortality transition.

      Notes: OLS coefficient estimates (and their 90% confidence intervals) are reported, where the omitted category is 4
      or more years before treatment. The dependent variable is equal to the natural log of the number of infant deaths per
      100,000 population in city c and year t. Controls include the demographic characteristics and remaining public health
      interventions listed in Table 5, city fixed effects, year fixed effects, and city-specific linear trends. Regressions are
      weighted by city population. Standard errors are corrected for clustering at the city level.

a Baltimore, MD: On October 15, 1912, Baltimore passed an ordinance setting a bacteriological
standard, but the first milk inspectors did not start working until January 1, 1913. Boston, MA: On
March 1, 1905, the Boston Board of Health (in conjunction with the State Board of Health) set a
bacteriological standard for health inspectors to follow. On January 8, 1913, Boston passed an
ordinance that required licensing of milk producers and set a bacteriological standard. Buffalo, NY:
The Buffalo Health Commissioner conducted bacteriological tests of milk as early as 1907, but
standards were not set by law until October 9, 1918. Chicago, IL: The Chicago milk ordinance that
came into effect on January 1, 1909 was nullified by the Illinois legislature on June 12, 1911. A new
ordinance, passed on August 14, 1912, required that non-pasteurized milk come from tuberculin-
tested cows and meet a bacteriological standard. On July 22, 1916, the Chicago Commissioner of
Health required that all milk be pasteurized. Detroit, MI: An ordinance required that all milk sold
in Detroit be pasteurized as of May 1, 1915. Philadelphia, PA: As of October 15, 1909, dairy
farmers were required to have a license. Although inspections were conducted under rules set by the
Board of Health, a bacteriological standard was not enforced until July 1, 1915.
bSt. Louis, MO: Ordinance for tuberculin testing of raw milk was set on March 21, 1928.
Ordinance for tuberculin testing of all milk, including pasteurized milk, was set on March 21, 1930.

Notes: Based on annual data from Mortality Statistics for the period 1905-1936, published by the U.S. Census Bureau. Each column represents the results from a separate OLS regression.
The dependent variable is equal to the natural log of the number of deaths per 100,000 population in city c and year t. Controls for the Cutler and Miller (2005) regressions shown in columns
(1)-(5) include those listed in Appendix Table 5, city fixed effects, year fixed effects and city-specific linear trends. In column (6), controls include the demographic characteristics and
remaining public health interventions listed in Table 5, city fixed effects, year fixed effects and city-specific linear trends. In columns (1)-(5), the regressions are unweighted. In column (6),
the regression is weighted by city population. In column (1), Huber-White corrected standard errors are in parentheses. In columns (2)-(6), standard errors, corrected for clustering at the
city level, are in parentheses.

Notes: Based on annual data from Mortality Statistics for the period 1905-1936, published by the U.S. Census Bureau. Each column represents the results from a separate OLS regression. In
columns (1)-(5), the dependent variable is equal to the natural log of the number of infant deaths per 100,000 infant population in city c and year t. In column (6), the dependent variable is
equal to the natural log of the number of infant deaths per 100,000 population in city c and year t. Controls for the Cutler and Miller (2005) regressions shown in columns (1)-(5) include those
listed in Appendix Table 5, city fixed effects, year fixed effects and city-specific linear trends. In column (6), controls include the demographic characteristics and remaining public health
interventions listed in Table 5, city fixed effects, year fixed effects and city-specific linear trends. In columns (1)-(5), the regressions are unweighted. In column (6), the regression is weighted
by city population. In column (1), Huber-White corrected standard errors are in parentheses. In columns (2)-(6), standard errors, corrected for clustering at the city level, are in parentheses.

Notes: Based on annual data from Mortality Statistics for the period 1900-1938, published by the U.S. Census Bureau. Each column represents the
results from a separate OLS regression. In columns (1)-(5), the dependent variable is equal to the natural log of the number of diarrhea/enteritis
deaths per 100,000 population in city c and year t. In column (6), the dependent variable is equal to the number of diarrhea/enteritis deaths per
100,000 population in city c and year t. Controls include the demographic characteristics listed in Table 5, city fixed effects, year fixed effects and
city-specific linear trends. In columns (1)-(2) and (4)-(6), regressions are weighted by city population. Standard errors, corrected for clustering at
the city level, are in parentheses.

a In the Cutler and Miller data set, the variable “mort0_1” represents the infant mortality count. Their dependent variable of interest, the natural log of the infant

mortality rate, can be recreated with the following STATA command:

                                         gen lninfmrt = ln((mort0_1*100000)/age0_1), where “age0_1” is the city infant population.
