                                           ABSTRACT

Much of the new growth literature stresses countly characteristics, such as education levels or
political stability, as the dominant determinant of growth. However, growth rates are highly
unstable over time, with a correlation across decades of .1 to .3, while country characteristics are

stable, with cross-decade correlations of .6 to .9. Shocks, especially those to terms of trade, play
a large role in explaining variance in growth. These findings suggest either that shocks are
important relative to country characteristics in determining long-run growth, or that worldwide

technological change determines long-run growth while country characteristics determine relative
income levels.

                                                            Introduction

          Much of the new growth literature stresses country characteristics as the dominant determinant

of growth performance. A vast empirical literature tests the effects of country characteristics on

growth.' This paper presents a fact suggesting the emphasis on country characteristics is misguided:

growth rates are highly unstable over time, while country characteristics are highly persistent. The

correlation across decades of countries' growth rates of income per capita is around .1(0 .3. while

most country characteristics display cross-decade correlations of .6 to .9. Correlations of growth

across periods as long as two decades — period lengths comparable to those used in the cross-section

empirical literature — are similarly low. With a few famous exceptions, the same countries do not do

well period after period; countries are 'success stories' one period and disappointments the next.

          The low persistence of growth rates reconciles the enormous variation in growth rates across

countries with the remarkable stability of relative incomes across countries. For each of the last two

decades the standard deviation of growth rates has been over 2.5, nearly the growth difference

between Japan and the US. Yet the correlation of (Summers and Heston (1991)) GDP per capita in

1960 and 1988 was .92. Even more striking the rank correlation of GDP per capita for the 28

countries for which Maddison (1989) has data is .82 over 1870-1988. Major changes in country

income ranldngs would have required large persistent differences in growth rwts; in the event,

income rankings did not change much and only a small fraction of the growth differences between

countries were persistent.

           This paper has three sections and a conclusion. The first section presents the basic facts about

persistence of cross country growth differences and of country characteristics. The second section

attempts to identify the temporary shocks important in explaining low persistence of growth rates

across decades. The third section interprets low persistence under two types of growth models:

models in which country characteristics determine long-run growth rates and models in which country

characteristics determine relative levels of steady state income and long-run growth rates are

determined by worldwide technological change. A conclusion summarizes the results.

                       I) Low Persistence of Growth Rate DilTerences Across Countries

(a) Bcic facts
           The persistence of growth rate differences across countries, even over long periods, is low.

Table 1 presents correlations of the least-squares growth rate of GDP per worker between 1960-69,

1970-79 and 1980-88. The R2 obtained by regressing the current growth rate on the previous

decade's growth was less than 10 percent. Little of the variation of growth rates is explained by past

growth.3 This low persistence result is robust over the choice of country sample, time period, and

sectors] performance measure.

          Figure 1 displays the scatterplot of the growth razes for 115 countries over two periods, 1960-.

73 and 1974-88. The dotted lines show the averages in each period. A large portion of the sample is

contained in the off-diagonal quadrants: above-average in 1960-73 and below average in 1974-88, or

vice versa. The rank correlation is 21 in the figure.

           The boxes in the corners represent the deciles of the period growth rates. The northeast box

represents countries with growth in the top deciles in both periods. The southwest box shows the

countries persistently in the bottom decile. The northeast box (persistent success) contains Botswana

and the famous Asian Gang of Four (Hong Kong is actually just short of being in the top decile in the

tirst period). The East Asian success story is well Imown, while Botswana has benefitted from

extensive diamond mines and from a democratic government that has avoided some of its neighbors'

economic mistakes. The widespread perception of strong country effects in growth is strongly

influenced by the Gang of Four; without them and Botswana, the already low correlation of growth

rates between periods is cut in half. In contrast, persistence is not raised much by deleting a small

number of outliers.

          Persistence is also low for several subsamples of countries. The second, third and fourth rows

of Table 1 show the correlations for non-oil countries, the OECD countries, and the non-oil

developing countries. The only exception is a high correlation between the 60's and 70's in the small

sample of OECD countries, but this reverts to zero between the 70's and 80's.

          Figure 2 shows that persistence stays low at various period lengths in the postwar data. This

is confirmed by partial data on long-run growth rates for 30 year periods over 1870-1988'. We have

a total of 54 observations for 23 OECD and Latin American countries. Figure 3 shows growth plotted

against lagged growth for these 30 year periods. Portugal is illustrative: decent growth in 1870-99,

negative growth in 1900-29, average growth in 1930-59. and one of the highest growth rates in 1960-

88. The correlation of 30-year per capita growth with per capita growth in the previous 30 year

period in this data is only .l2.

          One possible explanation for low persistence in the recent data is instability in agriculture due

to price and weather shocks. Figure 4 shows persistence coefficients for growth of value added per

worker in agriculture, industry, and services. The rank persistence of agriculture is zero between the

70s and 80s and is low between              the 60s and 70s. However, industry and services also have low

persistence.

          Table 2 shows the low contemporaneous correlations of growth rates across sectors (with the

exception of services in the 70s, when it had about a one-half correlation with both industry and

agriculture). The low correlations could mean that shocks to individual sectors, such as relative price

movements that pull factors like capital and skilled entrepreneurs out of one sector and into others,

are more important than shocks affecting all sectors, such as increases in economy-wide human

capital.6 However, another explanation for low cross-sector correlations could be that even

economy-wide shocks cause sectoral shifts because of changing comparative advantage.

          Measurement error in the level of GDP could create artificially low persistence in growth

rates, by leading to an underestimate of growth in one period and an overestimate in the next, or vice

versa. However, we do not believe that measurement error explains low persistence. First, growth

rates are probably not constructed by estimating GDP in subsequent periods - more likely, growth

estimates are prepared first, and GDP in the second period is estimated from these growth estimates.

Second, we calculated persistence between periods that did not contain a common endpoint but instead

overreport growth rates — would raise persistence.

1'.   Are Country Characteristics Persistent?

           The most straightforward explanation of the low persistence of growth rates would                                  be   that the

country characteristics usually thought to determine growth are themselves not persistent. This section

shows this explanation to be untenable: country characteristics are persistent. Figure 5 shows

persistence of country characteristics between the 60's and 70's, and between the 70's and 80's for a

sample of 45 countries for which data is available for all variables and time periods. The variables

chosen are those that appear in the classic growth regression of liarro (1991), as well as several

others common in the literature. All of the country characteristics display far higher persistence than

growth rates. Many other country characteristics, like culture and geography, must be even more

persistent.

           However, some aggregate index of policy variables could still have low persistence.7 To

construct such an index, we use the variables shown in Figure 5 with a pooled time-series cross-

section regression on 10 year averages. Table 3 shows regressions using the Barro (1991) variables

with the exception of his PPI6ODEV (deviation of the relative price of investment from the sample

mean), which is not available in individual decades for a sufficient sample. (Our government

consumption variable does not exclude spending on defense and education as Barros did, due to lack

of decade data on the latter.) We allow the intercepts to vary across decades. We also perform a

second regression with a broader set of country characteristics. The fitted values from this regression

(denoted Barro Index and Augmented Barro Index, respectively) are also far more persistent than

growth rates, as shown in Figure 5.

           Rates    of factor accumulation are much more persistent than growth razes. To compute an

index of factor accumulation, we regressed aggregate growth (not per capita) on investment and labor

force growth, using a sample of 115 countries which have data for all three decades. Figure 6 shows

that investment, labor force growth, and the fitted value of growth predicted by the two are much

more persistent than growth. The residuals from this regression can be interpreted, under certain

assumptions, as the deviations of total factor productivity growth for each country from the global

mean.C As shown in the graph, TFP growth rates are even less persistent than growth rates.

                                                       II) Shocks and Policies

           This section argues that shocks, especially shocks to the terms of trade, are an important

determinant of variations in growth razes over ten year periods, and that they can help account for

low persistence.

           Below we test how much of the variation in growth rates between countries can be statistically

explained in terms of differences in policies, and how much is due to differences in shock variables,

such as the terms of trade, external transfers, the change in the number of war related casualties per

capita on national territory, and the presence of a debt crisis. We show that much of the variance in

growth rates, even over periods as long as a decade, can be directly explained by shocks,° Moreover,

shocks indirectly influence growth by changing policy variables. Thus the low persistence of shocks.

particularly external shocks, helps explain the low persistence of growth rates.

           Table 4 shows the simple correlations of three shock variables with growth rates.'° The

variables are (1) the growth in dollar export prices times the initial share of exports in GDP minus the

growth in import prices times the initial share of imports in GDP (terms of trade change); (2) the

change in war casualties per capita on national temtosy; and (3) a dummy measuring countries likely

to have a debt crisis in the 1980$." Growth is strongly correlated with terms of trade improvements

and high external debt in the 80's, and with war in the 70's (and weakly with war in the 80's).

           When shock variables are added to a regression with a small set of significant country

characteristics from section I, they have substantial explanatory power compared to policy variables

(Table 5). We add the three variables from the previous paragraph and, for completeness, the per

annum increase in official transfers. The partial R2 of the policy variables (enrollments, black market

premium, M2/GDP) in the 1970s was .26 and of the shocks .14, while in the 1980$ the partial R2 of

the policy variables was .10 versus .15 for shock variables.'2

           The terms of trade effect is large and strongly significant in both periods. In the 1980$ a

favorable terms of trade shock of I percentage point of GDP per annum raises the growth rate by .85

percentage point per annum. Recall that GDP is measured in constant prices, so there is no direct

effect of a terms of trade shock on growth. This increase in growth is far larger than would be

created simply through the effect of the increased income on savings. Even if all the shock passed

into saving, and the rate of return Co capital were (optimistically) 20 percent, growth would only

increase by .2 percentage points.

            Factor movements are one potential explanation of large growth effects from terms of trade

shocks.3 For example, labor or capita] might flow within the country to the sector receiving a

favorable shock, capital might flow in from abroad to the export sector, or domestic savings might

respond to improved export opportunities. In order to generate large growth effects through factor

movements, however, factors and export demand must be elastic, and terms of trade shocks must be

at least somewhat persistent.

            External shock variables other than the terms of trade have smaller effects on growth, partly

reflecting substantial multicollinearity among the shocks and between shock and policy variables. The

variable for the increase in war casualties is marginally significant in the 70's but not in the 80's: we

fail to detect significant separate effects of transfers and debt crises. The magnitude of the coefficient

on the war casualty variable implies relatively modest effects of wars in most cases. Violence in

Chile associated with the overthrow of Allende and its aftermath are estimated to have cost .3

percentage points of growth per annum in the 70's. Israel's wars during the 70's are estimated to

have lowered growth during the decade by .2 percentage points per annum. Highest casualties per

capita in the sample were from the civil war in Uganda, which was estimated to have reduced growth

in the 70's by 3 percentage points per annum. Given the distribution of various shock variables (with

a few large values for casualties, transfers, and terms of trade movements) the results for individual

variables are sensitive to choice of sample.

          The shocks help explain the low persistence of the observed growth rates. The correlation of

the growth rates between the 1970s and 1980s is -.05 in this sample of countries, while the

persistence of the component of predicted growth dependent on the non-shock variables was .63. The

correlation between decades of the fined growth component due to shocks was -.08 and the

persistence of the fined growth rates including all variables was •37l4

          The shock variables influenced growth not only directly, but also indirectly, through policy

variables. Table 6 reports regression of the black market premium on shock variables. War is

associated with a high black market premium and favorable terms of trade changes with a lower

premium.

          This casts doubt on the widespread interpretation of the black market premium as an indicator

of bad policies. If shock variables are omitted, estimates of the effect of the black market premium

on growth will falsely attribute externally-induced adversity to policy. Table 5 demonstrates that the

inclusion of shock variables in the regression reduces the coefficient and significance levels on the

black market premium, especially in the 1980's, when it cuts the coefficient in half.

          To summarize, shocks are important over decade-long periods, they help explain the

difference between the persistence of actual and predicted growth, and they influence 'policy'

variables, and thus estimates of the impact of policies.

                                          III) Pers1st and Growth Theory

          This section examines the interpretation of low persistence under two types of growth models.

In the first type of model, long-run growth depends on country characteristics. For example, in the

AK model of Rebelo (1991), growth depends on tax rates. In closed economy versions of Romer

(1990) or Aghion and Howict (1992), technological change, and therefore economic growth, depend

on a countrys patent system and market size. In simple versions of these models, low persistence of

growth rates implies that random shocks are important in determining the long-run path of output. In

(he second type of model, which includes both the neoclassical model with exogenous technological

change and some models of technological diffusion, growth is a world-wide process, and country

characteristics determine the relative level of income. In these models, low persistence is consistent

with shocks of any size, and shocks may play only a minor role in determining the long-run path of

output, despite being an important determinant of variance in decade-long growth rates.

a. Modefr in Which Cowuvy Characteristics Determine Long-Run Growth

        In a simple model in which country characteristics determine growth, the persistence

coefficient can be interpreted as reflecting the magnitude of variance in underlying growth rates

across countries relative to the variance of random shocks. To see this, denote the long-run growth

rate associated with the policies of country i as g1. This can be represented as the world average

growth rate, g, plus a country specific component e,, determined by country characteristics. Growth

for country i in period t equals its underlying growth rate, plus a country-specific, period-specific

shock. (A period specific aggregate shock could also be added, but would not affect the results.)

Thus.

The simplest assumption one can make is that

This simple model of country fixed effects does not allow for changes in policy over time. However,

since policies change only slowly, it may be a reasonable approximation over periods that are not too

long. Under this model, the best forecast of a country's growth rate will be a weighted combination

of its own past growth rate and the average growth rate of all other countries.0

           Under this model of fixed country effects, low persistence bounds the potential R2 that can be

achieved itt growth regressions. Even if policies were perfectly measured, and all policies and other

factors affecting growth were taken into account, the expected R2 in a thirty-year growth regression

would be only about 0.6. To see this, note that the expected R2 from regressing growth over n

periods on a perfect measure of policies that determine the country's long-nm growth rate will be

If one defines a period as ten years, then p is approximately 1/3, so the expected R2 over a thirty-year

period, given a perfect measure of policies is only 0.6. Thus if this model of fixed country effects

describes the data, it is unlikely that we will see much increase over the current R5 S in the literature.

which are already in this range. For example. Levine and Renelt (1992. p. 947) report R2s from .46

to .62 in their basic regressions for growth over 1960-89. Of course R2 is a random variable, so in

the process of many authors running regressions, it would not be surprising if some obtained higher

R2s. On the other hand, the expected R2 given existing imperfect measures of policy would be less

than 0.6.

        The Imding that in this model even a perfect measure of policies would explain only 60% of

variance in growth rates over a thirty-year period has economic as well as econometric implications.

In this simple model, low persistence implies that luck is important relative to policies in deterrnming

the long-run path of output. This model in which country characteristics determine long-run growth

thus leaves much of growth unexplained.

        This simple model assumes shocks are serially uncorrelated. If there were negative senal

correlation in the shocks, or if growth caine in spurts for deterministic reasons, persistence would be
                                                               14

lower for given variance in underlying growth rates across countries. Thus, policies would play a

more important role in determining the long-run path of output.                      It is not clear why one should

expect substantial negative serial correlation over successive ten-year periods. For the spurts

hypothesis, it is interesting to note that for the countries that have four decades of data in the

Summers and Heston (1991) sample, on average around 60% of their growth from 1950 to 1988 is

achieved in the fastest-growing decade within that period. However, it is not clear whether this is

due to deterministic spurts of growth or to high random variation.

b. Models in which Worldwide Technological Progress Determines Lông-Run Growth

        Under a different type of model, worldwide technological progress determines long-run

growth and country characteristics determine steady state relative levels of income. This category

includes not only the neoclassical model (Solow (1956)), but also some models of technological

diffusion. Suppose, for example, that technological progress at some rate g is generated in a few

advanced countries by a process of the type described by Romer (1990) or Aghion and Howitt (1992)

and then diffuses to other countries with lags of various lengths. Let diffusion follow the process


                                                      B X(p)(A -B)
where B is the level of technology in a backward country, p is the set of policies in that country, and

A is the level of technology in the advanced countries. Thus counthes that are further behind have

more learning potential, and countries with better policies learn faster. Setting BIB = A/A = g

implies the steady state value of B/A will be X(p)/(g+X(p))." in this model, the relative steady state

level of income is determined by policy, but except for those countries large and advanced enough to

generate a significant share of world technology, long-run growth is exogenously determined. Under

either a neoclassical model of capital accumulation or models of technological diffusion which

    Incorporate advantages          of backwardness,         persistence     depends on the distribution of countnes' incomes

    relative to their steady state income.

                  Adding an independent normal error term to a linearized version of these models allows

    persistence to be characterized.             If there is a wide dispersion of distances between countries initial
    incomes and their steady states, then transitional dynamics wIll dominate the effect of the random

    error term. The countries furthest below their steady state will grow the fastest. Relative growth

    rates will initially be highly persistent. However, as all countries approach their steady state levels of

    income, persistence will fall because transitional dynamics will become less important relative to the

    random error term. Asymptotically countries will converge to an ergodic distribution around the

    steady state, in which persistence will be negative since countries which receive a positive random

    shock one period will tend to fall back towards the steady state the next period.'7

                 This can be easily seen in Barro and Sala-i-Martin's linearized version of the neoclassical

    model with an added random shock, but similar results hold in the diffusion model. In the

    neoclassical model, Y1,.1 =                                        where YLs denotes log income of country i at time t.

    y denotes steady state income,                 is a random shock, and v E (0,1) measures the speed of

    adjustment to the steady state, which depends on a host of parameters, including the capital share.

steady state value, o =          a / (2v—v2). Thus if the initial cross-section vath.nce is greater than its
steady state value, persistence will decline over time. Persistence is asymptotically negative, since the

which must be negative.

        Note that even if the random shocks are arbitrarily small, these models predict that persistence

will asymptotically become negative. Under this model, a country's time path of income could be

determined almost completely by worldwide technological change and its policies, but if it were close

to its steady state income a large percentage of the time series variance in its growth rate would be

explained by random shocks. In this case the growth rate would just represent fluctuations around a

steady state income.

        This model could be generalized by allowing each country to have its own steady state level

of income depending on policies, and by allowing for exogenous technological change. In this case,

persistence depends not on variance of income, but on variance in the gap between actual income and

steady state income relative to the level of technology. If countries vary greatly in their distance from

their relative steady states, persistence will be high. The countries far below their relative steady

state income will initially have persistently high growth rates. As they approach the steady state.

their growth rate will fall.

        Asymptotically, there is a sharp distinction between models in which country characteristics

determine long-run growth and models in which country characteristics determine relative steady state

income. However, if countries are far from their steady states, models in which country

characteristics determine income look similar to those in which country characteristics determine

growth rates.

        One difficulty with this type of model is that it does not explain why we observe countries

outside the ergodic distribution around the steady state. Barro and Sala-i-Martin have suggested
                                                                    18

countnes may be outside this distribution due to large, infrequent shocks, such as wars, depressions,

or industrial revolutions. Such shocks could plausibly affect only a subset of counthes, thus creating a

wide distribution of ratios of actual to steady state relative income.

           This model has several testable implications for persistence. It predicts high and declining

persistence following a large shock that displaces countries or regions differing distances from their

steady states. It predicts low persistence in regions which are similar distances away from their

steady states, which might plausibly be regions of a country. Finally, it predicts that controlling for

initial income should generate very low persistence in samples of regions with similar steady states,

since in these models persistence is due to transition dynamics.

          Results from U.S. states and European provinces seem consistent with the predictions of the

model, although the evidence is far from decisive. Negative persistence is much more common

among states than among countries, as would be expected if states are more likely than countries to be

similar distances away from their steady states, Growth rates of personal per capita income in the

U.S. states, shown in Table 7, have negative persistence from the 20's to the 30's. probably reflecting

the large shocks of the collapse of agricultural prices in the 20's and the Great Depression of the

3D's, which adversely affected the poorest states which had been growing most quickly. In the next 3

decades, persistence was positive (although weaker between the 40's and 50's). Persistence then is

zero between the 60's and 70's, and negative between the 70's and 80's, as would make sense if U.S.

states were close to their steady states by then. Controlling for initial income makes persistence

consistently low or negative, as predicted by the neoclassical models.

          Data from 73 European provinces (covering Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, the

Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) provides further support for the model. Persistence across

subsequent decades from the 50's to the 80's is low, with negative persistence again observed for the

80's. Controlling for initial income makes persistence even lower. However, it is difficult to

explain why persistence was low from the 1950's to 1960's, since different European countries were

probablydifferent distances away from their steady state then.

          We also have a small amount of regional data from developing countries. The data is on gross

rather than per capita product for provinces in China, India, and Indonesia, and on per capita product

for provinces in Colombia.n We found negative persistence for 25 Chinese provinces across

subsequent periods of 1952-63, 1963-74, and 1974-85, negative persistence for 24 Colombian

provinces for periods of 1950-60, 1960-70, 1970-80, and 1980-90, and essentially zero persistence for

20 Indian provinces between 1970-77 and 1978-83. These results seem consistent with the

neoclassical model. Indonesia, on the other hand, had strongly positive persistence for 26 provinces

between 1975-79 and 1979-84, but the time period was short, and oil-producing Indonesia had just

received a strong shock with differential effects across provinces: the oil price increase of 1973-74.

          Just as these models predict high persistence following a large shock to the income of a group

of countries, such as a war, they predict high persistence following a large shock to the policies of a

country, such as a major policy reform. As mentioned earlier, a group of East Asian countries and

Botswana had consistently high growth. It seems plausible that many of them adopted policies at the

beginning of the period that led to steady state levels of income far above their initial income levels.

On the other hand, few countries were consistent bad performers. This may indicate that countries

with high levels of income do not often change to policies that give them a low level of steady state

income.

         In sum, under the simplest model in which country characteristics determine long run growth

rates, low persistence implies that there are large random shocks. This, in turn, implies that such

theories, if correct, leave much of growth unexplained, and that a country's income level will be

determined in large part by its luck in the past. These models could be reconciled with a dominant

role for policy in determining the long-run path of income if there were large negative serial

correlation in shocks, if growth caine in spurts, or if policies changed rapidly. On the other hand.

under models in which growth is determined by a worldwide process of technological change and by

transitional dynamics, luck may determine only fluctuations in income around a long run trend.

Under these models, low persistence implies that countries must be at similar enough distances from

their steady states that shocks are important relative to transitional dynamics. Non-negative

persistence implies that countries must not yet be in an ergodic distribution around their steady states.

        Relative growth rates of output per worker across countries are not very persistent. This low

persistence is robust to choice of sample, is not an artefact of changes in oil prices or of agricultural

disturbances, and it extends over long periods. In contrast to growth rates themselves, the country

characteristics which are often thought of as determinants of growth are highly persistent. Shocks,

especially terms of trade shocks, statistically explain as much of the variance in growth rates over 10

year periods as do country policies.

         Models in which country characteristics determine long-run growth can be reconciled to these

facts only if they generate spurts in growth or if there are large random shocks. In contrast, models in

which worldwide technological change determines long-run growth predict low persistence if countries

are near the steady state relative income levels determined by their policies.

        The finding that much variation in growth rates is due to random shocks should induce

caution in attributing high growth rates to good policy (or to a good 'work ethic'). Just as a baseball

star is dubbed a clutch hitter after a lucky hit, some so-called economic miracles are likely due to

random variation.
