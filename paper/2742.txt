                                     ABSTRACT



     An important deficiency in Harberger's (1962) model of corporate income
taxation is its inability to consider both corporate and noncorporate
production of the ssme good. This precludes analysis of within—industry
substitution of noncorporate for corporate production in response to the tax.
Such within—industry substitution has potentially major implications for both
the excess burden and incidence of the corporate tax.
     In Gravelle and Kotlikoff (1988) we present a new model of the
corporation income tax. The model has two key characteristics.    First,
corporate and noncorporate firms produce (with identical production functions)
each of the model's goods both before and after corporate taxation is imposed,
and second, the decision of entrepreneurs to establish unincorporated business
is endogenous. Compared with the Harberger model, the new model predicts a
very much larger excess burden from corporate income taxation. The incidence
of the corporate tax can also differ dramatically in the two models.
     Several commentators on our approach suggested that while corporate and
noncorporate fins produce goods that are close substitutes, they are not
necessarily identical goods. Others questioned the extent to which our
results hinged on the endogeneity of entrepreneurship. This paper is a
response to those comments. It presents a Harberger—type model (with no
entrepreneurs), but one in which each industry/sector contains corporate and
noncorporate fins (with identical production functions) which produce goods
that are close substitutes in demand. As in our earlier model, the scope for
considerable within—industry substitution of noncorporate for corporate
capital leads to a very much larger excess burden than that in the Harberger
model.   For example, using Harberger's original 195? data and assuming unitary
substitution elasticities in production and in inter—sector demand, but
substitution elasticities of 30 in intra—sector demand, the extess burden of
the corporate income tax in the current model is 107 percent of tax revenue.
This figure is quite close to the 123 percent figure reported in Cravelle and
Kotlikoff (1988) for the case of unitary substitution elasticities in
production and inter—industry demand. Both numbers are considerably larger
than the 8 percent excess burden figure that arises in the traditional
Harberger model with unitary substitution elasticities.

 I. Introduction

    An important deficiency in Harberger's (1962) model of corporate income

taxation is its inability to consider both corporate and noncorporate

production of the same good.    Empirical applications of the Harberger Model

treat all firms producing a particular good (or collection of goods) as

identical firms facing the same tax on capital, namely the average tax on

capital of firms actually producing the good (collection of goods) in

question.   This procedure deals with differential taxation of capital used in

the production of different goods (collections of goods).       But it totally

ignores the differential taxation of capital of corporate and noncorporate

fins   producing the same good (collection of goods).     Hence, the Harberger

approach precludes    analysis of within—industry   substitution of noncorporste

for corporate production in response to the corporate income tax.       Such

within—industry substitution has potentially major implications for both the

excess burden and incidence of the corporate tax.

     Unfortunately,   the Harberger Model, in its literal form, cannot be used

to study the effects of corporate taxation when both corporste and

noncorporste firms produce the same goods.     As Ebrill and Hartman (1982) point

out, in the Harberger Model corporate firms can not compete with noncorporate

firms in producing the same good in the presence of the corporate income tax.

       In Cravelle and Kotlikoff (1988) we present a new model of the

corporation income tax, labeled the Mutual Production Model (MPM), in which

entrepreneurship is endogenous and corporate and noncorporate firms produce

(with identical production functions) each good both before and after

corporate taxation is imposed.1     Compared with the Harberger model, the MPM

predicts a substantially    larger excess burden from corporate income taxation.
                                        —2—


The incidence of the corporate tax can alao differ dramatically in the two

models,

     Several commentators on the new approach auggeated that while corporate

and noncorporate firms produce gooda that are cloae aubatitutea, they are not

neceaaarily identical gooda.     Thia paper ia a reaponae to thoae comments.     It

apecifiea a Harberger—type model, but one in which each induatry/aector

containa corporate and noncorporate firms with identical production       functions

which produce goods that are close substitutes in demand.       We label the new

model as the Differentiated Product Model (DPM).     As in our earlier model,

when the corporate tax is imposed capital     is released   from corporate firms and

is absorbed by noncorporate firms many/most/all of which are producing       in the

same industry/sector.     As the substitutability in demand of the noncorporate

for the corporate good within esch industry increases, the extent of within—

industry substitution of noncorporste for corporate capital increases as does

the excess burden of the tax per dollar of revenue.

     The excess burden from corporate taxation can be quite large in the DPM.

For example, using Harberger's original 1957 data and assuming unitary

substitution elssticities in production and in inter—sector demand, but

substitution elasticities of 3D in intra—sector demand, the excess burden of

the corporate income tax is 1D2 percent of tax revenue.       This figure is quite

close to the 123 percent figure in the MPM for the case of unitary

substitution elasticities in production and inter—industry demand.2       Both

numbers are considerably larger than the 8 percent excess burden figure that

arises in the traditional Harberger model with unitary substitution

elasticities.

     The DPM's predicted incidence from the corporate tax is similar to that

of the Harberger model.    To illustrate, if elasticities of substitution in
                                         —3—


industry 1 and 2 are .5, the inter—sector demand elasticity is 1, and the

within—sector     elasticity is 10, 88 percent of the tax falls on capital.     The

incidence on capital in the Harberger model is 82 percent of the tsx for

production elasticities of .5 and a demand elasticity of 1.       In contrast, in

the MPH the incidence on capital is 1.41 percent of the tax revenue for

production elasticities of .5 and an inter—industry demand elasticity of        l.
      The paper begins in the next section, II, with a presentation of the

model.   Section III briefly describes the data used to calibrate the model.

Sections IV and    V   present, respectively, the model's predictions for the

excess burden and the incidence of the corporate tax and compares these

predictions with those of the Harberger model and the MPM.       Section VI

concludes the paper.




II.   The Model

      The DPM model has two industries, 1 and 2.      In each industry there is a

corporate and a noncorporate good.       The four goods are denoted C1, N1, C2, N2,

where C1 and N1 (C2 and N2) are the corporste and noncorporate goods,

respectively, in industry 1 (2).       While C1 and N1 (C2 and N2) are not

identical goods, they are closer substitutes than, for example, C1 and C2,

and, hence, are classified as in the same industry.      Our notion of closer

substitutes is made precise by reference to the model's utility function:




      U —
(1)
            [s[d1c_1/+
                                                                  /(1l/i)
                        +   (1-a) [d2C1"÷   (l_d2)N   1i(1-1
                                           -4-


In equation (1) i      ia   the within—industry elasticity of substitution, while $

is    the key determinant of the between—industry elasticity of aubstitution.

The terms a,
             d1, and d2 are share parameters.

       As ia traditional in static models of this kind, workers, capitalists,

and the government are asaumed to have the same preferences given by (I).

Hence, economy—wide demands for the three goods result from maximizing          (1)

subject to the economy—wide budget constraint:



              C +P N +P C +P N —I
(2)         P
             dl   nll  c22  n22

The left hand side of equation (2) is total expenditure on the four goods,

while the right hand side, I, stands for national income, which is taken as

the model's numeraire.

       Production of each good is governed by a CES production function.         The

production functions for C1 and N1 are identical, and the production          functiona

for C2 and N2 are identical.        The production functions are expressed as:




                     Hi[(l_b)LjPi + biKjPi j"i
                 —                                    for i—l,2 and j—ci,ni
(3)         Q.


In (3) the tens    and    refer to labor and capital used in production of
                Lj     Kj

good j.

       Factor markets are competitive.      Hence, the marginal revenue products of

labor equal the wage, W, and the net of tax marginal revenue products of

capital equal the rental on capital, R.          In order to close the model we add to

the first order conditions for utility and profit maximization and equation

(2)   the conditions that factor demands equal factor supplies.

       Table 1 contains 16 equations from the post—tax equilibrium that we use

to calibrate the model.        In the post—equilibrium the wage and rental as well

as the prices of the corporate goods are measured in units such that they

                              —         (6).    Since the noncorporate production
equal 1, hence, equations (4)

functions are identical to the corporate production functions, the prices of

                                                                          the
the noncorporate goods would also equal 1 were it not for the presence of

                                                                               of
corporate income tax.       Equations (7) give the post—tax equilibrium prices

the noncorporste goods.

       The terms sc]. and   c2   are the respective capital income shares in the

production of C1 and C2.4        Equations (8) and (9) are general equilibrium

conditions requiring, respectively,            that total capital and labor demanded

equal the total supplies of capital and labor, K and L. Equations                 (10)

through (13) reflect profit maximization by producers.                 Equation (14) is

simply a rewrite of the budget constraint (2).             Finally, equations (15) and

(16) are combinations       of the first order conditions for utility maximization.

       Table 2 lists the equations of the no—tax equilibrium with which we

compare the post—tax equilibrium.          Note that in the no—tax equilibrium

                and               The equations in Table        2   represent sixteen

elasticity of substitution, q, we use values ranging

inter—industry elasticity of substitution,            ,   we use values of .5 and 1.

National income, I, is nuineraired at $296 billion, the 1957 level of net

national income used hy Shoven (1976). The value of t uaed is                           .45,   which is

the average corporate tax rate for 1957 according to data reported in the                               g
Economic Retort of the President.               l987.
        Shoven's (1976) study also reports capital income shares in the

"noncorporate" sector (our industry 1) and the "corporate" sector (our

industry 2) of .60 and .20, respectively.                   To obtain values for        cl     and   c2      we

use the following post—tax relationships:



                            (Kci1Ki) + (Kn
                   —

where   L   is the capital income share in industry i, and                  K    in total capital in

industry i.6       Given values of the ratios of capital stocks in equation                          (32),

one can compute values of                  To solve for these capital ratios in the 1957

where   t   is the average corporate tax rate reported in 1957 in sector i.                             The

specific values, which are determined from Rosenberg's (1969) data, are t1 —

.014 and t2 — .340.         Equation (33) simply exploits the idea that if the tax ia

levied only on corporate firms and one observes the average tax rate                            t    in

sector i, where the average is computed using total sector i capital, one can

infer the corporate share of the sector's capital, i.e., the share of the

capital that is subject to the tax t.
                                            —7—


       The calibration of R proceedsby first noting that the ratio K1/K2 can

be computed from    (34)   given a value for Gl—(l—92), sector l's share of total

national product.      From Shoven's data this value is .15.

used to determine K in the following manner; First, prices for the two

noncorporate goods can be determined from equation (7) and then substituted

into each sector's version of equation (13).              This version of (13) plus (12)

express output in terms of capital and other known parameters.              These

expressions for output are then substituted into equation (14) yielding one

equation in the four capital inputs.          By substituting into this expression

the calculatedpost—tax ratios of each capital input to K we can solve for

the value of V.     Given the value for R, the capital ratioa are used to solve

for the levels of 1ni'              1c1' and 1c2   Given these values, each sector's

hence, L, and each sector's version of (12) and (13) can be used to solve for

C1, C2, N1, and N2.        Given the output ratios, each aector's version of (15) is

used to solve for d1 and d2, and equation          (16)    is used to solve for a.




IV.    Excess Burden

       Table 3 expresses the excesa burden in the           OW   assuming different

elasticities of substitution in production and demand.              Excess burden is

calculated as the amount of additional         income needed in the post—tax
                                           —8—


equilibrium to regain the no—tax equilibrium level of utility.7         The last

entry in the first row may be of most interest.         This case corresponds to the

standard assumption of Cobb—Douglas technologies as well as the Harberger

benchmark   of a unitary inter—industry demand elasticity.       However, the case

also involves a very high within—industry                                   — a value
                                                 elasticity of substitution

of 30.   The excess burden in this case exceeds the revenue.        The excess burden

remains substantial even for smaller values of the within—industry elasticity.

For exsmple, it is 19 percent of the tax revenue in the case thac all

substitution elasticities are unity.

     While the excess burden figures are highly sensitive to the within—

industry substitution elasticity, they are rather insensitive to production or

inter—industry substitution elasticities.        In the case that the within—

industry substitution elasticity equals 10, the excess burden ranges from 39

to 58 percent of tax revenue for combinations of the production elasticities

ranging from .5 to 2 and for values of the inter—industry substitution

elasticity of .5 and 1.

     These excess burden figures are quite large when compared with those from

the Harberger model.        Table 4 compares excess burden in the two models as well

as that in the MPM under the assumption of variable entrepreneurs.         Our new

model (assuming    'j—30)   and our earlier model both predict very substantial

excess burdens    —   excess burdens equal to or somewhat larger than the amount of

taxes collected.

     One reason that the excess burden in the DPM is so much greater than in

the Harberger Model involves the size of the distortionary tax rates used in

the three analyses.      Although the results for the three models rely on the

same tax data, including the same tax revenue, the effective diatortionary

wedges in the DFM and MPM are both 82 percent compared to only 50 percent in
                                         —9.—



the Harberger Model.      Since excess burden rises roughly with the square of the

tax rate, the difference in effective distortionary taxes csn, by itself,

account for an excess burden in the OPM and MPH that is 2.6 times the

Hsrberger Model's excess burden.      Indeed, setting both the intra—sector and

intra—sector elasticities to unity in the DPM produces a model that is quite

similar to that of Harberger's with respect to demand elasticities.        If we now

                         —     noncorporate   tax wedge in this version of the DPH,
apply the full corporate

we find an excess burden in the DPM that is close to 2.6 times the excess

burden in the Harberger Model.

     To understand these differences note that in the DPH and MPH the economy—

wide average corporate tax rate, calculated as total corporate revenues

divided by total corporate income, is .45.        In terms of the model's tax

variable r, this value of .45 for t corresponds to a tax wedge of .82, where

.82 —    .45/(l—.45).   With auch a large diatortionary tax, the considerable aize

of the distortiona in the DPM and MPH is not surprising.        In contrast, in the

Harberger — Shoven analysis the diatortionary corporate tax is the difference

between the average corporate tax rates in the two sectors.        But this average

tax in each sector is computed based on total sector capital income, not

simply the corporate      income in the sector.   By averaging over noncorporate as

well as corporate capital to determine the tax rates in each sector, Harberger

and Shoven dilute the effective distortionary corporate tax. Since t1 — .014

and t2 —    .340,   the effective distortionary tax wedge in the Harberger — Shoven

procedure    is only .50, which corresponds to (.340 —    .014)/[(l—.340)(l—.014)].
        The second reason that the excess burden is so much larger in the DPM and

MPM than in the Harberger Model involves differences in the DPM and the MPH,
                                          —lo-

on   the one hand, and the Harberger Model, on the other, in the source of the

inefficiency in conjuncture with differences in within—sector and between—

sector demand elasticities.    To understand this point first note that the

approximation   formula for excess burden is the ssme in all three models,

nsmely .5t28Kc/3T, where Kc stands for total corporate capital and r is the

comparative tax wedge.    But the change in corporate capital in the DPM and MPM

model is due, in lsrge part or entirely (e.g., in the case of a perfectly

symmetric model), to within—sector    substitution of noncorporate capital as

well as other factors for corporate capital.      In contrast, in the Harberger

Model 3K/ar is negative only hecause of between—sector substitution of

capital away from corporate capital.

       The fact that the DPM's and MPM's primary source of inefficiency is

within—sector   rather than between—sector   reallocation of capital does not, by

itself, suggest that excess burden is larger in the DPM and MPM.       But one

needs to consider these differences in the source of excess burden in light of

differences in the within— versus between—sector elasticities of demands for

corporate and noncorporate goods.     In the OPH the within—sector demand

elssticity between corporate and noncorporate output should be set (and is set

in Table 4) at a much higher value than the between—sector elasticity.          In the

MPM the within—sector elasticity    is,   indeed, infinite.   In contrast, in all

three models the between—sector demand elasticity between corporate and

noncorporate goods is assumed to be small, typically unity or less.        To

appreciate how this difference in demand elasticities may affect the reduction

in corporate capital and, thus, excess burden, consider how excess burden in

the Harberger Model changes as the between—sector demand elasticity increases.

Assuming unitary elasticities of substitution in production, raising the

demand elasticity in the Harberger model from unity to 10 increases the excess
                                        —11—


burden as a fraction of tax revenue by a factor of     3.   Together with the 2.6

factor arising from differences in effective tax wedges, this factor of 3

suggests an excess burden in the DPM and MPH that could easily exceed that in

the Harberger Model by a factor of 7.

     The size of the excess burdens in the DPM and MPH raises the question of

whether the large shifts in capital underlying these results are plausible?

The question can be adduced by comparing actual with predicted changes in the

corporate share of output in response to changes in the corporate tax wedge.

Gravelle and Kotlikoff   (1988) report that between 1957 and 1982 the corporate

share of output increased from   6   to 20 percent in the "noncorporate" sector

and from 76 to 86 percent in the "corporate" sector.        During this period the

corporate tax wedge declined by about 23 percent.      Both the DPM, assuming an

within—sector   demand elasticity of 10, and the MPH, assuming fixed

entrepreneurs, predict changes in corporate output shares in response to a 23

percent change in the corporate tax wedge that are roughly similar to those

actually observed,    Obviously this is a rather crude test of the two models,

but it is suggests, nonetheless, that these models' predictions may well be in

the right ballpark.




V.   Tax Incidence

      Equations (26) and (27) give     respectively, the incidence formulae for

the DPM and Harberger Model.    The formula for the incidence in the DPM is

derived in the Appendix.    In the case of the Harberger Model, industry 1 is

the "corporate" industry.    Note that the formula for incidence in the DPM

reduces to the Harberger formula in the case that Kc2 —       nl — 0,    i.e, in the

case that sector 1 is totally corporate and sector 2 is totally noncorporate.

Note also that the within—industry     demand elasticity,   , plays no   role in the
                                              —12—


formula for tax incidence in the DPM in the case of small tax changes.            This

is not entirely surprising since, in the no—tax equilibrium, the factor shares

of noncorporate firma within each sector are identical to those of the

corporate firma in that sector.        We know from the Harherger Model that demand

factors can drop out of incidence formulae in the case of equal factor shares.

       Turning to the incidence of the corporate tax in the DPM, Table 5 reports

the share of the tax falling on capital.             As one would expect, in the case of

Cobb—Douglas production functions 100 percent of the tax incidence falls on

capital.    The values of the incidence on capital reported in the Table range

from 60 percent to 145 percent.        The highest values occur when the production

substitution elasticity in the corporate sector is large.            Higher values of
the production substitution elasticity in the noncorporate            sector serve to

lower somewhat the share of the tax falling on capital.

       Table 6 compares incidence in the DPM with incidence in the Harberger

Model and the MPM.      The incidence in the DPM is quite similar to that of the

Harberger Model, but may differ considerably from that in the MPM.            This is

not surprising given the fairly similar structures of the DPM and Harberger

Models and the somewhat different structure of the MPM.

VI.   Sursry and Conclusion
      This paper contains a Harberger—type model of corporate income taxation,

but one that admits corporate and noncorporate production of goods that, while

not identical, are close substitutes in demand.   The model's predictions

concerning the corporate tax's excess burden are quite similar to those in

Gravelle and Kotlikoff   (1988) in which corporate and noncorporate firms within

the same industry produce identical goods.8    In both models the presence of

corporate and noncorporate goods in the same industry (where industry is

defined in this paper by a collection of goods that are close suhstitutes in

demand and are produced with the same technology) means that an important

response to the corporate income tax will be within—industry   substitution of

noncorporate for corporate capital.   The high demand elasticity between

corporate and noncorporate goods in the same industry translates into

considerable scope for capital to flow out of corporate into noncorporate

production.   Since the excess burden of the corporate tax is proportional to

the change in corporate capital, this increased substitutability of capital

implies a much greater excess burden than in the Harberger Model.

      The second reason for the higher excess burden involves the size of the

tax wedge.    In the model developed here as well as in that of Gravelle—

Kotlikoff (1988) the incentive to move capital from corporate to noncorporate

production depends on the full difference between corporate and noncorporate

capital taxation.    The size of this tax wedge is much larger than the size of

the tax wedge entering the Harberger Model because the Harberger analysis

compares average taxes across two sectors both of which have corporate as well

as noncorporate firma.    If the two sectors were equally corporate—intensive

the Harberger analysis would suggest a zero corporate tax wedge when, in fact,
                                     —14—


there might be a very substantial tax wedge within each industry between

corporate and noncorporate firms in that industry.

    As a consequence of ignoring within—sector substitution and using a much

too small tax wedge, the Harberger Model may well understate the excess burden

of the corporate tax by a factor in excess of ten.

                                         Notes

1 The MPM has two goods each of which are produced with labor, capital, and
managerial input (entrepreneurial input in the case of noncorporate firms).
Agents differ in their level of entrepreneurial skill. Any agent can choose
to become an entrepreneur, a worker, or a corporate manager. Those agents
with the most entrepreneurial skill choose, in equilibrium, to become
entrepreneurs and establish their own proprietorships.   Proprietorships may be
quite small.  In contrast, corporations must operate at greater than a minimum
scale. This minimum scale requirement ensures that the corporate sector will
not disappear in the presence of the corporate income tax.

2 The large excess burden in the MPM reflects, to some extent, our
assumptions concerning the supply elasticity of entrepreneurs.  But even if we
assume a zero supply elasticity of entrepreneurs, the MPM's excess burden is
still over nine times larger than that of the Harberger Model for the Cobb—
Douglas case.

3 In the MPM corporate and noncorporate goods within each industry are
perfect substitutes. Hence, the effective intra—industry elasticity of
substitution in demand between noncorporate and corporate goods is infinite.

4   The capital income shares are related to the parameters   of the production
                                     —                              for i—l,2.
function through the formula    ci
5 The revenue base for measuring this tax rate is corporate profits plus
interest.

6  Equation (38) incorporates the following relationship between corporate and
noncorporate capital income shares:      nrci
                                            (l_t)/Pni]P1/(l+P1).

7   Recall   that in the post—tax equilibrium tax revenues are returned to the
consumers    in a   lump sum.
8   While the two models predict similar excess burdens,   the MPM with   a   rather
inelastic supply of entrepreneurs seems a better model of corporate taxation.
In contrast to the MPM, the DPMdoes not  permit corporate and noncorporate
firms to produce the same good. For example, in modeling the agricultural
sector the DPM requires that one view corporate corn as a different good from
noncorporate corn. It is true that using an extremely high within—sector
demand elastic brings one quite close to a model in which corporate and
noncorporate corn are identical goods. But if this elasticity is set too high
the DPM's predicted swings in the corporate share of output in response to
changes in the corporate tax wedge are implausible.  The notion of assuming
less than perfect substitutability among corporate and noncorporste goods
seems particularly strained when the goods in question are intermediate
inputs. Another reason to favor the MPM over the DPM is its endogenous
treatment of proprietorships and its ability to explain the size distribution
of noncorporate firms.
