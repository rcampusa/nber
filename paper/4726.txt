       In recent years a growing number of countries have constructed data series on job creation

and job destruction using establishment-level data sets. This paper provides a description and

detailed comparison of these new data series for the United States and Canada. Pint, the

Canadian and United States industry-level job creation and destruction rates are remarkably

similar. Industries with high (low) job creation in the U.S. exhibit high (low) job creation in

Canada. The same is true for job destruction. In addition, the overall magnitude of gross job

flows in the two countries is comparable. Second, the time-series patterns of creation and
destruction are qualitatively similar but do differ in a number of important respects. In both

countries, job destruction is much more cyclically volatile than job creation. This cyclical

asymmetry is, however, more pronounced in the United States. The paper finishes with a

characterization of the job flow patterns using a modified Blanchard and Diamond (1992)model.

 I. Introduction
            Considerable recent research by economists has been devoted to the measurement and

 analysis of the job-creation and job-destruction processes.' The basic findings of these

 studies for the United States are that gross job creation and job destruction substantially

 exceeds the corresponding net changes in employment, the vast majority of job creation and

job destruction occurs within sectors as opposed to reallocation of employment across

 sectors,    job creation and destruction vary systematically with plant characteristics such as
 plant   size, and job destruction is much more cyclically sensitive than job creation. As
 more data series on gross job flows become available for a growing number of countries, the

question arises as to how gross job flows compare across countries.

          As a first step, this paper examines the cross-country differences and regularities in

gross job flows for the United States and Canada. This is a natural step to take for a number

of reasons. First, parallel to the measurement efforts in the United States, high quality

longitudinal plant-level data for Canada necessary to measure the gross job flows accurately
have been developed as well. Data quality and consistency problems inherently plague the

measurement of gross job flows. Spurious flows can be genented if longitudinal linkages of
establishments are broken mistakenly by changes in ownership structUre or statistical

processing (e.g., mergers, divestitures, takeovers, ownership changes, name or minor

address changes, changes in corporate status, changes in employer tax or other ids, etc.).

The datasets underlying the measurement of gross flows for this study are arguably the best

economies.

 datasets available for avoiding longitudinal linkage problems.2 Further, the datasets used for

 the analysis in this study have been developed sufficiently to allow for measurement of gross

 flows for a relatively long time interval. Thus, the proximity of the United States and

 Canada and the similarity of the database development make for a natural testing ground for

 these newly developed statistics on the dynamics of the labor market. The similarity in the

economies provides a useful cross-check for the independent measurement efforts in each

country. The differences in the two countries provide a first step in using cross-country

evidence to help identify the factors that affect the pace and timing of job Wmover

          Our approach pursues two basic lines of inquiry. First, both the time-series and the

cross-sectional patterns of job creation and destruction are examined. Given that the U.S.

and Canada have experienced relatively similar business cycles over the 1972-1986 period,
we ask -- Do the time-series patterns of job creation and job destruction look similar in the

two countries? We are particularly interested in whether the striking asymmetry in the

relative time-series variances of job destruction and creation in the United States is also

present in Canada. Additionally, do common industries in the U.S. and Canada share similar

patterns of gross job flows? Given that an industry in Canada and the U.S. is likely to use

similar technologies and face companble sunk costs, one might expect that industries

characterized by high (low) job turnover in one country would have a tendency to experience

high (low) job turnover in the other country. Mitigating these technological stories is the



        Sec the discussion in the appendix of Davis }laltiwanger and Schuh for discussion of the measurement
difficulties in measwing gr flows and the advantage, of using the Longitudinal RacistS Database (LRD) for
this purpose. Similaiiy. see Baldwin sad Gorecki (1990b) for a discussion of the waits of the C.n.A.n data.
There were many problems in developing these data for this purpose. Many pemoa yws went into the development
of the data and there is a long list of individuals at both the U.S. Bureau of the Census and Statistics muds who
have been involved in these efforts. Longitudinal linkage problems are an inherent â€” of developing this type of
data because of the continuous process of change that the business population is undergoing. The advantage of these
datasets relative to others is that there is considerable auxiliary information available to aid in the process of creating
the longitudinal links. Nevesiheless, given these difficulties, an important aspect of this crou.countiy comparison
is to provide a cross check on the data quality and the measurement methodology.

fact that unionization, plant size, and market sizes differ markedly in the two countries.

Second, we present a simple model of gross job flows and the labor market based on
Blanchard and Diamond (1992) which helps characterize the role of aggregate and allocative
shocks on job creation and job destruction. We then use this model to guide our analysis of
Canadian and U.S. job flows data.

       The paper addresses these issues utilizing plant-level data on employment changes for
Canada and the U.S.. The Canadian data come from Statistics Canada's Annual Censuses of

Manufactures and the U.S. data come from U.S. Census Bureau's Longitudinal Research
Database (LRD). For this study, considerable effort was made to harmonize the construction

of the job flows variables across the two countries. Thus, the data are quite comparable.
The main findings of the paper are:

       (1) While the time-series patterns of net changes of employment, job creation, job
       destruction, and job turnover (the sum of creation and destruction) are similar
       qualitatively, there are substantial differences in the quantitative variability of the net
       and gross job flows. In both countries, job creation and destruction are inversely
       correlated, job destruction is much- more volatile than job creation, and job turnover
       is countercyclical. However, each of these properties is more pronounced in the
       United States.

      (2) Examining cross-sectional data, there is a remarkable similarity in the patterns and
      magnitudes of the industry-level avenge job-creation and destruction rates. Two-digit
      industries with high (low) levels of job creation, job destruction, job turnover, and net
      employment change in Canada have correspondingly high (low) values in the U.S..

      (3) Using pooled cross-sectional time-series data on U.S. and Canada job
      flows data, variation in job flows is explained, to a large part, by industry and
      year effects. Country effects, while statistically significant, have little
      explanatory power when modeling job flows variation.

      (4) The remarkably similar industry patterns strongly point towards
      technological differences as the predominant factor accounting for between-
      industry differences in job flow rates. Further evidence in support of this
      interpretation is the finding that in both countries the cross-industry variation
      in the job flows is tightly connected to cross-industry differences in the size
      distribution of employment. That is, in both countries, industries where the


                                                3
            typical worker is employed at a large plant have substantially less job turnover
        than industries where the typical worker is employs at a small plant. In
        addition, the cross-industry patterns of the size distribution of employment are
        very similar across the two countries.

        The paper is organized in the following fashion. The next section describes the

 datasets   used and basic measurement of job flows. The third section provides a comparison
of job flows in Canada and the U.S.. The fourth section sets out a basic model of job flows

and labor markets. The fifth section provides basic estimates of the relative importance of

country, industry and year effects. The final section closes with brief concluding remarks.


11. Data and Measurement Issues

        The main objective of this paper is to compare the patterns of job creation and
destruction in the U.S. and Canada. Job creation and destruction are measured as jobs

gained and jobs lost--defined simply as the difference in employment in establishments
between two periods. The resulting summary measures provide indicators of job turnover at

the plant level. Note, however, that differences in the number of workers employed in a

plant represent net employment changes in the plant's employment opportunities and do not
reflect the change in the composition of employment opportunities or the workforce. Thus,

they provide a lower bound on the total amount of job turnover at the plant level.

       The employment flow measures utilized in this study are constructed from individual

plant-level micro-data on employment. Total job-creation measures for both Canada and the
United States are calculated by summing employment gains at expanding and new

establishments within a sector between period t-1 and t; total job destruction by
                                                                                  summing
employment losses at shrinking and dying establishments within a sector between period t-l
and t. Rates of growth between period t-1 and t (P05.,) and rates of decline (NECL) are

calculated by dividing total job creation and
                                                destruction, respectively, by sector size. Sector

                                                  4
size (XJ is calculated as the avenge of employment between period 1-1 and t. The
difference between POSI and NEQ is net employment growth (NET1). The sum of P05,, and

NEQ is used to measure the total job-turnover rate (SUM.) of a sector between t-l and t.
These four measures, POS NEG,,, NET,, and SUM1, will be the focus of the empirical
analyses which follow.




         The data used in this study come from two recently developed plant-level longitudinal

databases. The Canadian data are from an annual census of the Canadian manufacturing

sector and cover the period from 1972 to 1986. The United States data come from the
Annual Survey of Manufactures covering the period 1972 to 1986. The details of the
construction of these datasets can be found in Baldwin (1990a, 1990k,) for the Canadian data,
and Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1994) for the U.S. data.

        Many previous cross-country comparisons of various aspects of intra-industry mobility
have suffered from a lack of data comparability.' This is mainly the result of differences in

the way statistical agencies collect and organize data on firms and their plants. In order to

improve the relative comparability of the Canadian and U.S. plant-level job flows data,

samples and definitions used for the estimates were careflully harmonized.4 In the Canadian

case, this meant using a larger sample than previously; in the United States, it meant using a
more restrictive definition of birth and deaths. As a result, some of the turnover estimates

  111. Basic Patterns of Job flows In Canada and the VS.
          This section provIdes a description and comparison of the patterns of Job flows In
 Canada    and the U.S. over the 1972-1986 period. The analysis is twofold. First, the time-
 series fluctuations of job creation and destruction are examined. Next, the avenge annual
 rates of job creation and destruction are disaggregated by two-digit industry.

 Tune Variation of U.S. and Canada Job flows

          Table 1 presents annual rates of job creation (POS) and destruction (NEG), net

 employment growth (NE'!) and the total turnover rate (SUM) for Canada and the United
 States. Previous research in both countries (Baldwin and Gorecki, 1990b; Davis and
 Haltiwanger 1990) has stressed that job creation and destruction occur simultaneously. In

 Canada, net change is negative in 1974, 1977, 1979, 1982 and 1983; but there is substantial
job creation in these years-mon than 7 per cent in each year of negative net job growth.
The same pattern can be found in the United States where there is substantial job creation
even when net rates of change are negative.

          The two countries differ in terms of net job creation. The Canadian manufacturing

sector experiences small but positive growth over the period being studied; manufacturing in
the United States declines at an annual rate of 1.2% annually.' The total turnover rate
(SUM) is equally high in both countries averaging about 20% annually. It does not differ
significantly in the two countries. It also has very much the same range in both


   $ In
        particular, for the Canadian data compare the numbers reposted herein to Baldwin and Gorecki (198Th,
199th, and 1990b) and the US data in Davis and Raltiwanger (19fl).

       There is a discrepancy between th, estimated act employment growth from the LRD and the implied net
growth from the published Annuai Suivey of Manufactures (ASM) data. The rensona for this discrepancy are
discussed at length in Davis, Haltiwanger, and Scbuh (1990,1994).

                                                     6
countries--varying from a low of 17% to a high of 23%. Additionally, the rate of job

creation is negatively correlated with the rate of job destruction in both countries. However,

this inverse relitionship is much more pronounced in the United States where the correlation

is -0.78 while the same correlation in Canada is -0.47.
          Figure Ia and Figure lb show the movements in job creation and job destruction for

the U.S. and Canada. The top panel plots the job-creation time series for both countries

while the bottom panel graphs the analogous job-destruction series. Examining the top panel,
one sees that the job-creation movements differ markedly between the countries in the 1975-

1979 and 1985-1986 periods. The U.S. experienced a much larger contraction in job

creation during the 1975 recession than Canada but experienced a more rapid rebound in job-

creation activity in 1976. In the 1985-1986 period, Canada's job creation remained quite

high while the U.S.'s dropped off substantially after the 1984 iecovesy. The rank correlation

coefficient for the job-creation series between the two countries is .264 and is not statistically

significant at the .05 level. In terms of volatility, job creation is substantially more volatile
in the United States.

       The patterns of job destruction in the two countries are somewhat more coherent in

Canada and the U.S. during the 1972-1986 period. The main difference in the two series

appears   during the   1975   recession, where the U.S. experienced a sharp increase in job
destruction. The rank correlation between the job-destruction series for the two countries is

.8 10. Again, however, job destruction is substantially more volatile in the U.S. relative to

Canada.

       Figure 2 plots the total job-turnover (SUM) and the net employment-change (NET)

series for the two countries. Movements in net changes are similar in the two countries (the

rank cross-country correlation is     .7 as are the fluctuations in total job turnover
(cross-country correlation is 0.53). Both the Canadian and U.S. job-turnover series have a

                                                   7
  slight upward trend. Fitting a simple linear time trend to both series yields a trend

  coefficient (standard error) of 0.38 (0.094) tbr Canada and 0.11(0.14) for the United States.

 In results not reported here, this difference is also found to exist for most 2-digit industries.

 To illustrate the magnitude of the increase in Canada, the rate of total job turnover (SUM)

 averages 18.7% from 1972 to 1976 and 22.5% from 1983-1986. In terms of volatility, net

 employment growth is more volatile in the U.S. and the volatility of total job turnover is

 very similar in the two countries. The latter may scm surprising since the separate

 components of total job turnover (creation and destruction) are both substantially more

 volatile in the U.S. However, the negative covariance between creation and destruction is

 greater in the U.S. which offsets the higher individual variances.

        The cyclical properties of job turnover also differ somewhat between the two

 countries. As stressed by Davis and Haltiwanger (1990, 1992), job destruction is more

cyclically sensitive than job creation in the United States. This is evident from the higher

time-series standard deviation of job destruction (3.3) than for job creation (2.2) reported at

the bottom of Table 1. As noted at the bottom of Table 1, this implies that the time-series

variance of job destruction is more than twice that of job creation. An implication of this

striking asymmetry in the time-series volatility of creation and destruction is thatgross job

turnover is countercyclicai. The pearson correlation between the net job-growth rate andjob-
turnover rate for the U.S. is -0.54. These same qualitative patterns hold for Canada, but the

quantitative effects are somewhat muted. The time-series standard deviation of job

destruction (2.2) does exceed that of job creation (1.8) for Canada. This implies that the

time-series variance of job destruction is about one and one half times larger than the

variance of job creation. Further, the time-series correlation between net job growth and

total job turnover is -0.25. As Figure 2 shows, part of the reason for the smaller Canadian

correlation is that the Canadian turnover rate exhibits a significarnpositive trend. Hence, as

                                               8
 the Canadian manufacturing sector continued to grow in the mid 1980s, so did volatility.

          The magnitude of job creation andjob destruction observed both in Canada and the

 United States is not unique to these countries or developed countries in               general. For the
 industrialized economies, Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1994) summarize a number of
 studies of individual countries with estimated rates of job turnover that lange from 16.0

 percent in Germany to 23.5 percent in Sweden.7 These rates are quite similar to those
 reported here for Canada and the United States. For developing countries, Roberts (1994)

constructs job flows statistics for three developing nations, Colombia, Chile and Morocco.

He finds that gross job flows substantially exceeds net employment changes, and that job
turnover lies in the range 26.2 and 30.6 for the three countries. This is roughly 25%-50%
higher than that found in Canada and the U.S. and other industrialized economies. However,
it illustrates the ubiquitous nature of concurrent job creation and destruction in all types of
economies.



Cross-Industry Variation in Avera2e Annual Job flows

         Turning back to the U.S.-Canada comparison, aggregate job-turnover rates may hide

substantial differences between Canada and the United States at the industry level. In order to

investigate differences in industry-level job flows, the same job-turnover rates were
calculated for 2-digit industries. Table 2 presents the average annual rates for total job

creation (P05), total job loss (NEG), net job change (NET) and job turnover (SUM) for




      As emphasized in the introduction, there are qÃ¢estions about dais quality and consistency over time for many
of these studies. Further, winy of these studies are hued upon quite short time intervals. An in depth comparison
will only be possible wbai comparable data and methodology are used.

                                                        9
 two-digit manufacturing industries in Canada and the United States for the period 1972-
 1986. The first point to note is that the patterns of job flows look remarkably similar
 across the two countries. Sectors that have high job turnover in Canada generally have high

job turnover in the U.S.. This is especially true for the Apparel and Lumber industries of
 both countries. Similarly, sectors such as Paper, Chemicals, Petroleum and Primaxy Metals

 have relatively low job turnover in each country. The second point is that industries with

 high (low) levels of job-creation experience high (low) levels of job destruction. Utilizing
the data from Table 2, we construct within-country correlations between job creation and job
destruction. The within-county rank correlation (standard errors) between job creation and

job destruction is .672(.0016) for the US and is .831(.0001) for Canada.

         To illustrate the similarities in industry job flows in Canada and the U.S., Table 3
provides cross-country rank correlations between the Canadian measures of job flows and the
U.S. measures. The rank correlations of job creation, job destruction, net employment
growth, and job turnover between the Canadian and U.S. data all show strong positive

correlations. The rank correlation coefficients between U.S. and Canadian job creation, job

destruction, employment growth, and job turnover are .868, .795, .778, and .815,
respectively. This suggests that there may be important industry chakacteristics that are
common across countries that help determine the patterns of inter-sectoral job flows. These




       The Canadian and US two-digit industry groupings differ In two important respeas which affects our data.
First, Canada reports knitting mills separately from other textile mills. In this case we eonstnct the anaiogous US
industry which incorporates all plants In SIC 225. Second, Canada does not have a separate two-digit industry for
scientific equipment as the US does (SIC 38.) The fln.4in data for this industry is included in Miscellaneous.
In this study, therefore, we include alt US producers in SIC 38 in the Miscellaneous category as weu. Finally.

 industry effects are explored more fully in the second half of the paper.'

          Overall, the cross-country comparisons yield several striking patterns.           First,
 qualitatively the patterns of net and gross flows are similar. Both countries exhibit a strong
 asymmetry in the time-series volatility of job destruction relative to creation. However,

 there are striking differences in the quantitative patterns. The asymmetry in the cyclical

 volatility of destruction relative to creation is more pronounced in the United States.
 Further, the time-series volatility of both the net and the gross flows is greater in the U.S.
 series. Second, the forces generating cross-industry turnover produce a very similar pattern
 the two countries. Industries that experience high (low) turnover in Canada have high (low)
 turnover in the U.S..



 IV. A Model of Job flows and the Labor Market
         In this section, we develop a simple model of the dynamics of job creation and

destruction. The motivation isto provide structure for interpreting the similarities and
differences in the behavior of job flows in Canada and the U.S.

        The model is essentially a modification of the model in Blanchani and Diamond

(1992). The primary modification is to allow for multiple sectors so that intersectoral
differences in the behavior of job flows can be characterized. The determinants of job
creation and destruction in each sector are described as follows:




       Note, also that employment change due to plant cpenings and plant dosinga arc way similar in the two
 countÃ±es. Industries cbanctcrizcd by high (low) entry job flow. in     have conespondingly high (tow) amity
job flows in the US. These results are reported in Baldwin, Dunne, and Haltiwanger (1994.)

where x, is job desiniction in sector s, y, is job creation in sector s, w is the wage rate, the
a's are vectors of structural characteristics (e.g.,technology, market structure, entry and exit

costs, hiring and firing costs) that influence job creation and destruction in sector s, the 0's

are vectors of shocks that shift job creation and destruction (e.g., aggrega*e demand shocks,

allocative shocks, technology shocks). Job destruction is increasing in the wage rate and job
creation is decreasing in the wage rate. This specification makes clear that job creation and
destruction are appropriately characterized as the decomposition of the change in labor

demand into plants expanding and plants contracting employment, respectively.
         The job creation described in (2) is desired job creation. The hiring or matching

process to accommodate this desired job creation is given by:

                                            h,'.m,(u,v)                                       (3)


where h, is hires in sector s, u is the unemployment rate, and v. is the vacancy rate in sector

s. The   matching function is increasing in u and v. This matching function captures the

notion that there are frictions in the process of matching firms creating jobs and workers

seeking jobs. Empirically, Blanchard and Diamond (1990) found that the matching function

approximately exhibits constant returns to scale. Firms and sectors are heterogenous but
workers are homogenous. Hence, hires and vacancies are indexed by s but all firms hire
from the common unemployment pool. Further, the only source of worker turnover isJob
turnover â€” that is, there are no quits due to either bad matches of workers to job slots or

labor force exits.

       Wages are determined by a Nash bargaining process summarized by:

       The connection between job creation and destruction and unemployment and vacancy

dynamics is given by:

                                                                                             (1)

       Equations (7) and (8) are the heart of the model. They describe the precise
relationship between job flows and unemployment and vacancies. It is clear from (7) and (8)
that short run dynamics of job creation and destruction will be influcaced by the wage

determination process, the matching process, the structural characteristics (a) and the
aggregate and allocative shocks (. The steady state relationship implied by equations (7)

and (8) is given by:

                                                 13
                                           yâ€”'-l; y,-m                                            (9)


        In the steady state, aggregate net job creation must equal labor force growth and

desired job creation must equal hires in each sector. Note that individual sectors need not

satisfy the net job creation equal to labor force growth relationship. That is, even in the

steady state, some sectors may have higher than average net job creation while others lower

than avenge net job creation. This suggests that (9) is best interpreted as an intermediatC

run steady state that does not require a steady state distribution of sectoral employment

shares. Steady-state distribution of sectoral employment shares requires:


                                                                                              (10)



        In the long run, all sectors must satisfy the net job creation equal to net labor force

growth relationship. However, individual sectors may satisfy this relationship but with

different gross rates of job creation and destruction. Further, and most importantly, equation

(10) implies that sectors with higher than avenge rates of job creation must also have higher

than average rates of job destruction in the long run.

       Key features of the model are illustrated in Figure 3 for a hypÃ©thetical economy with

two sectors. Figure 3a depicts the long-run steady state. In the case depicted, sector 1 is a

low job-turnover sector and sector 2 is a high job-turnover sector. In terms of the model,
this is generated by differences in the structural characteristics in the two sectors. Note that

by construction, the aggregate job creation and destruction rates are employment weighted

avenges of the sectoral rates. For simplicity, the two sectors are depicted as having equal
weights and there is no long-run labor force growth in all panels of Figure 3. Figure 3b

illustrates an intermediate run steady state. Sector 1 has higher creation than destruction

while sector 2 has higher destruction than creation, while in the aggregate job creation equals


                                               14
 job destruction (recall the zero labor force growth assumption for this figure). In the

 aggregate, net job creation equals labor force growth but this is not true for individual

 sectors in this intermediate run steady state,

           Figure 3c depicts the impact of an adverse aggregate shock starting from the steady
 state   depicted in Figure Ia. The adverse aggregate shock causes job destruction to rise and

job creation to fall in both sectors. One fundamental question is whether job creation and
destruction respond symmetrically to an aggregate shock. Empirically, Davis, Haltiwanger

and Schuh (1990, 1994) and Blanchard and Diamond (1990) find that job destruction

responds     disproportionately to aggregate shocks in the U.S.. Potential explanations for this
asymmetry are explored in these latter two papers as well as Caballero and Hammour (1992)
and   Mortensen and Pissarides (1992). For the present purposes, we are interested in
determining whether the nature of the cyclical asymmetry differs between the U.S. and
Canada. In the figure, job destruction is depicted as responding disproportionately to the
aggregate shock.

          Figure 3d depicts the impact of an allocative shock that hits both sectors. The
ailocative shock causes job destruction and job creation to rise in both sectors. Here again

there may be an asymmetry in the response to allocative shocks. Further, there is no reason
that allocative shocks need, in general, to be common and/or have common effects across
sectors.

          For the Canada and the U.S., we use these features of the model to address the
following questions: First, do we find that sectors with high rates of job creation also have
high rates of job destruction on avenge over the sample period? While this ultimately must
be the case, it is of interest to know whether over a 15 year horizon thislong-run property is
satisfied. Second, are the sectoral rankings of job turnover similar across the countries?     In

addressing this question, we are particularly interested in whether it is technological

                                                  15
 differences across sectors or market structure or institutional differences across sectors that

 drive differences in the job-flow rates. If it is primarily technology differences, then
 presumably U.S. and Canada should exhibit similar sectoral patterns. If it is primarily

 market structure or institutional differences, then Canada and the U.S. may exhibit different

 sectoral patterns depending on the degree of differences in market structure and institutions

 across the countries. Finally, even without limited time-series, we are interested in
 whether the U.S. and Canada exhibit noticeable secular or cyclical differences in the

 behavior of job creation and destruction.



 V. Empirical Analysis of Year, Country, and lndustiy Differences in Job Rows
        To formally investigate the nature and source of the Canada, U.S. differences, we

estimate simple OLS regressions with job creation, job destruction, job turnover and net
growth as dependent variables with year, country, and industry effects as regressors. In
addition, we consider country-yeax inteiactions and country-industry interactions. The

objective of this exercise is to quantify the alternative sources of variation in the data.

        Table 4a reports F-tests from these regressions. First, there are statistically

significant differences in job creation and net employment growth by year, by industry and
by country. Second, while job destruction has significant year and industry effects, there are
no significant U.S.-Canada differences in the mean rate of job destruction. Third, the

interaction of year and country is statistically significant for all measures. Fourth, the
country-industry interactions are not statistically significant for net employment growth but
are significant for job creation, job destruction and job turnover.
       While Table 4a reveals considerable statistical significant differences by year, country

and industry, Table 4b provides perspective on the quantitative importance of these

differences by reporting the adjusted R2 associated for alternative specifications. The results

                                                16
 are striking. First, country effects have almost no explanatory power in accounting for
 variation in any of the measures. Second, industry effects have a very large role in

 accounting for variation in job creation, job destruction, and total job turnover but a minimal
 role in accounting for variation in net employment growth. The importance of industry

 effects is especially pronounced for total job turnover. Third, year effects are very important

in accounting for variation in net employment growth and are somewhat less important for

variation in gross job flows. Fourth, year effects play a more important role in the variation

of job destruction than in the variation of job creation. This reflects the asymmetry in the

cyclicality of job destruction and creation.
        The picture that emerges from Table 4is that Canada and the U.S. look very similar

in the long run in terms of the industrial structure of job creation, destruction, turnover and

growth. It is important to note in this regard that there are large cross-industry differences
in job-flow rates. Nevertheless, the U.S. and Canada line up very similarly. However,

Canada and the U.S. exhibit considerable year-to-year differences in each of these measures.

In terms of the model, this suggests that the two countries have very similar cr-distributions

but are subject to different shocks (experience different C's).   Further, the more pronounced
asymmetry in the relative variances of job destruction and creation in the U.S. suggests that

the propagation of cyclical shocks may be somewhat different in the two countries (in terms

of the model, this is the response of x and y to 0).
       The time-series differences in the Canada, U.S. job-flow rates are depicted in Figure
4. Specifically, Figure 4   depicts the year-country interaction coefficients, controlling for

common industry and year effects. In contrast to the striking similarity in tenus of long-run

rates, Figure 4 depicts substantial year-to-year differences. Three features stand out from
this figure. First, the largest time-series differences are in the net rather than the gross



                                                17
 flows. Second, there is no obvious time trend in the differences.'Â° Third, the difference is

 linked to the business cycle. Job destruction rises more rapidly in recessions in the U.S.

 than in Canada. Job creation rises somewhat more rapidly in recoveries but this effect is

relatively short-lived. Put together, the countercyclicality of job turnover is more

pronounced in the U.S. than in Canada.

         The above results indicating overwhelming similarity in the cross-industry differences

in job-turnover races between countries can be directly interpreted in light of the steady state

predictions of the model presented in section IV. This can be seen by examining the

empirical analogue of Figure 3. Specifically, we consider time-series averages by 2-digit
industry and plot them in the fashion suggested by Figure 3. The results of this exercise are

depicted in Figures Sa and Sb, for Canada and the U.S. respectively. Each 2-digit industry

is labeled with its SIC number (see Table 2 for correspondence).

         Two illustrative results emerge from this exercise. First, industries do line up

approximately on the 45% line. That is, as predicted by the model, high job creation

industries are also high job-destruction industries)' Ultimately, this is not surprising but it

is interesting that a 15 year period is sufficient for this 'steady-state' result to emerge.

Second, and more importantly, the ranking of industries in this manner is very similar in the

U.S. and Canada (which is precisely what the regression results told us). Within the context

of the model, this suggests that there are common factors in the two countries yielding

similar industry rankings of job-flow behavior.



    'Â°Eor the United Stan, business cycle turning points based on USER reference cycle chronology (or this period
are as Follows. Cyclical peaks: November 1983, Junuary 1980, July 1981. Cyclical boughs: March 1975. July
1980, December 1982.

      It is true that for the United States many industries lie to the sight of the 45 degree line given the net
contnctioe of manufacturing employment in the United States. However, it is still the case that the IS-yen industry
avenges exhibit the property that high job-creation industries also axe high job-destruction industries - it is this
prediction of the steady-state model that we an referring to in this context.

                                                         18
          These results strongly point towards technological differences as the predominant

 factor accounting for between-industry differences in job-flow rates. Canada and the U.S.
 share the same technology and have the same sulking cross-industry patterns in job-flow

 rates. Further evidence in support of this interpretation is presented in Figure 6 which shows
 that an industry characteristic that lines up well with the job-flow rates is the average size of

 the plant at which the typical worker is employed (the coworker mean).'2 The cross-
 industry differences in the coworker mean can be interpreted as reflecting differences in the

 scale and sunkness of operations across industries) Figure 6 illustrates a tight connection
between the coworker mean of an industry and its job-turnover rates. Here, industries are

depicted in the manner suggested by the model but labeled by their zanldng by coworker

means. High turnover industries are clearly depicted as having relatively low coworker
means.



VI. Concluding Remarks

         Recently developed longitudinal datasets in the United States and Canada permit a



        The coworker mesa is developed sad analyzed in Davis and Haltiwanger (1990). It is literally the
employment weighted average size of the establichrw.,t. It is a mammary ntaauv which in contrast to the average
establishment size captures the notion that while the typical estabh.h.nns is snail, the typical worker works torn
large establishment. For example, the avenge establicbnwd size in the manubcturing sector in the United States
in 1987 is less than 60 workers. In contrast, the coworker mean in the U.S. manuhctnSg sector (the size of the
establishment for the typical worker) is more than 1700 workers.
    Â°  The cross-industry differences in the coworker mesa can also be interpreted as reflecting differences in
market stnscture across sectors. We do not dress this interpretation for two macus. Fiat, if market stnrcWre
differences across industries were important in this context we would aped to observe greater cron.cctintiy
differences in net and job-flow rates since there are presaniably significant differences in market stnscture across
the two countries. Second1 the precise connection between the size distribution of employment and market stnzcture
is not well understood. In contrast, the connection between the coworker -          and technologies seems, at least
to us, direct and unambiguous. For evidence in support of this interpretation ma Duane (1993). The latter paper
finds a close correspondence between plant size and the use of new manuhcturing technologies. This paper does
not attempt a complete investigation of the industry chnteristics and associated interpretations that help account
for the common cross-industry differences between countries. Some prslina analysis in this direction is
presented in Baldwin, Dunne, sad Haitiwinger (1994).

much richer statistical portrait of employment dynamics. Gross job creation and destruction

rates are measured in a comparable fashion for these two countries for the analysis in this

paper. The remarkable similarity in the magnitude and the cross-industry variation in rates is

striking for a number of reasons. First, it suggests that these remarkably large rates of job

creation and destruction in each country are being measured accurately. It is a striking fact

in both Canada and the U.S. manufacturing sectors that roughly one in ten jobs is destroyed

every year and one in ten jobs is created. While the datasets used for this study are arguably

the very best available for avoiding longitudinal linkage problems that plague the

measurement of gross flows, this cross-country comparison provides substantial further

support for the accuracy of these new statistics.

        Beyond providing support for the accuracy of the statistics, the results in this paper

are striking in what they tell us about the nature of the similarities and the differences

between Canada and the United States. Canada and the U.S. undoubtedly differ in their

institutions, in their market structures and in the shocks impacting the economy. However,

only the latter come through as having a strong effect. The common technology as well as

other common elements dominate the long-run structural relationships across industries.

Accordingly, it is difficult to distinguish between the countries in terms of the industrial

structure of net and gross job-flow rates.
