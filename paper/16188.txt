                                              ABSTRACT

We simultaneously assess the contributions to productivity of three sources of research and development
spillovers: geographic, technology and product–market proximity. To do this, we construct a new
measure of geographic proximity that is based on the distribution of a firm’s inventor locations rather
than its headquarters, and we report both parametric and semiparametric estimates of our geographic–
distance functions. We find that: i) Geographic space matters even after conditioning on horizontal
and technological spillovers; ii) Technological proximity matters; iii) Product–market proximity is
less important; iv) Locations of researchers are more important than headquarters but both have explanatory
power; and v) Geographic markets are very local.

1     Introduction

Firms engage in research and development (R&D) because they anticipate future benefits
in the form of lower costs, new methods of production, and new uses for their products.
To the extent that they can capture the fruits of their efforts, private and social returns
to R&D should be equal.1 However, when they cannot appropriate the returns, R&D
becomes a public good and underinvestment is expected. A knowledge of the magnitude
and direction of the problem (i.e., who benefits from the efforts of whom) is therefore a
prerequisite for an appropriate design of public policy.
     We address the much studied question of the relationship between R&D spillovers and
productivity, where a spillover occurs when firm i benefits from the R&D activities of firm
j. There is substantial evidence that spillovers exist. Furthermore, it is commonly agreed
that spillovers are larger when firms are closer. However, it is not clear what closeness
means or how it can be measured, and those questions are the focus of our research.
Specifically, although we are most interested in geographic proximity, we look at variants
of three measures of closeness: proximity in horizontal (product market), technological
(R&D), and geographic space.2
     Our research differs from the literature to date in three respects. First, we assess
all three measures simultaneously, which removes the possibility that one measure (say
geographic proximity) appears to be important simply because researchers fail to control
adequately for the common influence of a second measure (say technological proximity).
In other words, firms that are technologically similar might locate in the same region and
benefit from each other’s R&D activities. There has been little work that uses the same
data and model to evaluate multiple measures of closeness, both individually and jointly.
     Second, we refine the measures of closeness, particularly geographic proximity. To
illustrate, most previous researchers have used the (single) location of a firm’s headquarters
to calculate geographic distance. It is not clear, however, that technological advances are
likely to be communicated by CEOs. We hypothesize that inventors are more apt to
communicate and we use the distribution of a firm’s (multiple) inventor locations to
calculate proximity. To our knowledge, no one has exploited firms’ research locations to
create a multidimensional measure of geographic closeness.
     Third, whereas previous researchers have used either a zero/one measure of geographic
distance (same or different region) or a simple one–parameter function of Euclidean
distance between headquarters, we allow the effect of our multi–dimensional measure of
geographic proximity to decay in a more flexible manner. Specifically, we estimate that
    1 Foroptimality, technology markets must also be competitive. In other words, strategic behavior can also
distort decisions (see, e.g., Spence 1984).
   2 We do not assess vertical proximity because we do not have adequate data.




                                                     1
function semiparametrically.
    Our research attempts to answer a number of questions. First and foremost, what is the
nature of spillovers? In particular, who benefits from the R&D activities of whom? This
question is logically prior to all others. Indeed, in the absence of an answer, it is impossible
to formulate appropriate public policy towards R&D. Furthermore, it cannot be answered
by considering one source of spillovers in isolation. Second, to what extent is knowledge
private or public? In other words, can firms capture the lion’s share of the rents that are
associated with their R&D activities or are they freely available to rivals? This question
must be answered if we are interested in assessing under and over investment and the need
to correct the associated externalities. Finally, are knowledge flows confined to narrowly
defined product markets, technology classes and/or geographic regions? Put differently,
are spillovers local or global? This question must be answered if we are concerned with
asymmetric patterns of regional or industrial growth and decline and whether growth
paths will converge or diverge.
    We use U.S. firm level accounting data (sales, employment, capital, R&D, etc.) from U.S.
Compustat 1980-2000 matched into the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) data
from the NBER data archive. The Compustat data were compiled by Bloom, Schankerman,
and Van Reenen (2008). The use of patent data to create distributions of inventor locations,
however, is new.
    To analyze that data, we employ spatial econometric techniques that were developed
by Pinkse, Slade, and Brett (2002) and Pinkse and Slade (2004). With those techniques,
which allow us to handle multiple measures of closeness in a flexible but parsimonious
manner, space is broadly defined to include a number of geographic and nongeographic
dimensions.
    Section 2 discusses the previous literature, section 3 the model, and section 4 measuring
spillovers. The data is discussed in section 5, econometric methods in section 6, and results
in section 7. Some concluding comments are offered in section 8.


2   Previous Literature

Griliches (1979) was perhaps the first to recognize the multi–dimensional nature of the
spillover problem. He discussed alternative hypotheses about the nature of closeness,
which can be:


Horizontal or learning from product–market rivals

Firms that produce similar products can often benefit from each other’s R&D activities.
For example, when a pharmaceutical firm introduces a new drug, in the absence of patent


                                               2
protection, rival companies can easily determine its makeup and offer close substitutes.
Horizontal spillovers have been studied by e.g., Levin and Reiss (1988), Bernstein (1988),
and Ornaghi (2006).


Technological or learning from technology–market rivals

Firms that perform similar types of research can also learn from each other. For example,
the discovery of froth flotation, which facilitated the refining of sulfide ores, was an
important advance in the mining industry that benefitted firms from many different
product markets (e.g., copper, lead, and zinc metals, which are used in wiring, batteries,
and galvanizing, respectively). Technology–market spillovers have been studied by e.g.,
Jaffe (1986).


Vertical or learning from suppliers or retailers

Firms that are related through a vertical chain might experience technological synergies.
Although vertical or input/output spillovers have been studied, it is not clear if these
are real or simply result from failure to control for quality or price. For example, if
there is an advance that increases the quality or lowers the cost of producing auto bodies,
auto manufacturers benefit. However, their technology has not changed; they can simply
purchase better bodies at lower prices (a pecuniary externality). Vertical spillovers have
been studied by e.g., Scherer (1982), Griliches and Lichtenberg (1984), and Goto and Suzuki
(1989).
   More recently, researchers have recognized that there is another type of closeness that
Griliches (1979) did not mention:


Geographic or learning by meeting

Firms that are located in the same or proximate regions have opportunities to communicate.
For example, employees of different firms that are located in close geographic proximity
might meet on the golf course or belong to common civic organizations where they
discuss and learn from each other’s research activities. In other words, social networks
can facilitate learning. In addition, geographic proximity can enable capitalization of
complementarities among firms’ research activities. Geographic spillovers are particularly
important since they affect the potential for regional and national convergence. Indeed,
if spillovers are highly localized, the prospects for convergence are poor. Geographic
spillovers have been studied by e.g., Jaffe, Trajtenberg and Henderson (1993), Eaton and
Kortum (1996), Keller (2002), and Orlando (2004).
   Most early spillover studies used data on industrial sectors to examine intersectoral


                                                   3
input/output flows or vertical spillovers based on sectoral input/output tables. More
recently, however, researchers have used firm level data that allow them to examine such
issues as intra versus inter product or geographic market spillovers. In general, researchers
have found significant spillover effects. However, most concentrate on one proximity
measure in isolation.3 In addition, all use scalar measures of geographic proximity that
depend on at most one parameter.
    Our research, which is based on firm data in a multi–proximity–measure setting, takes
a production–function approach to the problem. There are of course other approaches. For
example, some researchers (e.g., Bernstein and Nadiri 1989) have used a dual framework
based on a system of factor demands.4 The advantage of the former is that it requires no
behavioral assumptions and therefore avoids misspecification bias. The dual approach,
in contrast, requires strong assumptions such as perfectly competitive input and output
markets or, if imperfect competition is assumed, on the nature of the product market
game or the bargaining process. Since the latter exploits more information, the estimates
obtained are more efficient if that information is correct. Unfortunately, if that information
is inaccurate, biases are introduced. Furthermore, since a system of interrelated equations
is estimated, the bias in a single equation can contaminate all equations.5
    There are a number of issues that we have chosen not to cover. For example, we
consider private R&D but neglect public and academic activity (for work on the latter,
see e.g., Adams 1990, Jaffe 1989, and Acs, Audretsch, and Feldman 1992). Furthermore,
although we exploit patent data to create our measure of geographic proximity, we do
not consider patent flows as direct measures of spillovers (as in, e.g., Jaffe, Tratjenberg,
and Henderson 1993). Finally and most importantly, we do not consider vertical or
input/output spillovers. We do this for two reasons. First, we do not have detailed data on
interfirm purchases and sales. In addition, we believe that most such studies suffer from
a measurement problem that is due to the fact that both price and quantity aggregates
underestimate the value of new or higher quality goods. Productivity is therefore apt to
be mismeasured.
    Finally, as is typical of studies that use cross sectional or panel–data, we do not exploit
information on individual industries but instead use a common model for all. We adopt a
common framework because ultimately we want to test whether a simple model has wide
applicability.
   3 Exceptions   include Orlando (2004), who assesses technological and geographic proximity in a discrete
framework (e.g., same product market/different geographic market), and Bloom, Schankerman and Van
Reenen (2008), who assess product and technology–market proximity.
   4 Still others have used a consumer–surplus framework (see, e.g., the survey by Griliches 1991).
   5 The dual approach also allows one to endogenze R&D and capital investment decisions through the use

of Euler equations. This is a plus if the specified model is correct but a minus if not.

3     The Model

We use a standard value–added production–function framework similar to that employed
by Griliches (1979). In particular, output Q is produced by conventional inputs capital
K and labor L. In addition to the conventional inputs, output depends on a stock of
knowledge or productivity, which we model as Hicks neutral. Firms’ R&D activities
augment that stock, which depreciates over time.
     Specifically, there are n firms, i = 1, . . . , n, observed in T time periods, t = 1, . . . , T.
The production function is
                                       Qit = Ait Mt Uit Hi ( xit ),                                  (1)

where Q is output, A × M × U is the state of knowledge or productivity, and x is a vector
of conventional inputs. Taking logs we have

                                    qit = ait + hi ( xit ) + µt + uit ,                              (2)

where lower case letters denote logarithms (ait = ln Ait , etc.). Productivity consists of two
parts: a systematic component a, and a random component µ + u. The random component
is further subdivided into an aggregate shock, µ, and an idiosyncratic shock u ∼ F (0, V ).
     We model knowledge acquisition using a standard capital–accumulation type equation.
Specifically, firm i’s systematic stock of knowledge is

                                     Sit = (1 − δ)Sit−1 + Rit−1 ,                                    (3)

where δ is the depreciation rate and Rit is firm i’s investment in knowledge in period t.6
     We assume that the systematic component of productivity is a weighted average of the
R&D activities of all firms
                                        ait = θSit + ∑ wij S jt ,                                    (4)
                                                         j 6 =i

where wij is a weight that corresponds to some notion of the distance between i and j. Our
objective is to uncover the weighting matrix W = [wij ].
     We do this as follows. Assume that we have K distance (really proximity) measures,
where each measure is an n × n matrix, D k = [dijk ]. Let Dij = (d1ij , . . . , dijK ) be the vector of
measures for the (i, j) pair of firms and define the spillover pool associated with D k to be

                                           S−ikt =   ∑ dijk Sjt .                                    (5)
                                                     j 6 =i

    6 We
       follow Hall et al. (2005) in constructing the empirical measure of the R&D stock using a knowledge
depreciation rate of 15%. See the data appendix for details.




                                                     5
Based on this definition, the simplest parametric weights correspond to

                                        ait = θSit + ζ k S−ikt ,                                  (6)

or
                                       ait = θSit + ∑ ζ k S−ikt .                                 (7)
                                                           k

With (6), wij = ζ k dijk and with (7), wij = ∑k ζ k dijk .
   More generally one can incorporate flexibility into the weighting matrix and estimate
the associated equation parametrically or nonparametrically. With the latter, each element
of W is assumed to be a common function of the vector of distance measures, wij = g( Dij ).
The vector D must be specified by the practitioner. However, the functional form of g is
determined by the data.


4    Measuring Spillovers

Alternative distance or proximity measures have been used in the literature. We build on
and refine some of these.


Technology Spillovers

We, like most researchers who examine technological proximity, use a measure that is
due to Jaffe (1986). Suppose that there are L technology clases, l = 1, . . . , L. Let FilT be
the fraction of firm i’s R&D activities (e.g., expenditures or patents) that are in class
l. i’s technology locational distribution is then FiT = ( Fi1T , Fi2T , . . . , FiL
                                                                                  T ). The measure of

technology match between firms i and j is the uncentered correlation coefficient

                                                    ∑lL=1 FilT FjlT
                                wijT   =q                                          .              (8)
                                            [∑lL=1 ( FilT )2 ][∑lL=1 ( FjlT )2 ]

Notice that with (8) all classes are treated symmetrically — no class is ‘closer’ to any other.
Furthermore, spillovers occur within but not across classes. In other words, there are no
FilT FjkT terms with l 6= k.


Horizontal Spillovers

Most people use a discrete measure, same or different Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC), that distinguishes between intra and interindustry spillovers (e.g., Levin & Reis
1988, Bernstein 1988, Bernstein & Nadiri 1989, Ornaghi 2006). We use a continuous and


                                                       6
more disaggregate measure that was employed by Bloom, Shankerman, & Van Reenen
(2008). In particular, suppose that there are M product markets, m = 1, . . . , M, where
markets are proxied by SICs, and let F P be defined similarly to F T , i.e., Fim
                                                                               P is the fraction

of i’s output that belongs to product market m. Then FiP is firm i’s product–market
locational distribution, and wijP is the uncentered correlation coefficient between the output
distributions FiP and FjP . Notice that here, as with the technology measure, product markets
are treated symmetrically — no market is ‘closer’ to any other — and spillovers occur
within but not across markets.7


Geographic Spillovers

Most previous studies focus on the location of firms’ headquarters as the basis for mea-
suring geographic spillovers. Several measures have been used: i) the Euclidean distance
between the capital cities of the countries where the headquarters of firms i and j are
located (Eaton & Kortum 1996, Keller 2002) and ii) a 0/1 variable that distinguishes if the
firms’ headquarters are located in a different or the same region (Eaton & Kortum 1999,
Orlando 2004).
       It is not clear, however, that headquarters is the relevant locational variable. It seems to
us more likely that inventors communicate, and many inventors are employed in research
labs. Moreover, unlike headquarters, a given firm might locate laboratories in many
regions. Although the locations of headquarters and labs are correlated, correlation is far
from perfect. To illustrate, Microsoft began operations in the Seattle area, where it located
both its head office and its research lab. However, over time, it constructed additional labs
in high–tech areas of the US, such as Silicon Valley and the Boston area. Still more recently,
it has developed international labs in places as distant as Bangalore and Beijing.
       In our empirical work we look at the locations of both headquarters and research labs.
However, we do not have data on the geographic locations of labs. To circumvent this
problem, we use patent data. Specifically, each patent gives the address of its principal
inventor, and we construct geographic R&D locational distributions from those addresses.
       We do this as follows. Suppose that there are K geographic regions, k = 1, . . . , K. Let
FikG   be the fraction of firm i’s inventors that are located in region k, and FiG be firm i’s
geographic–market locational distribution. All of our geographic measures are of the form


                     wijG =   ∑ ∑ f ( FikG , FilG , FjkG , FjlG )C(dkl ),   i 6= j,   wiiG = 0,           (9)
                               k   l

where dkl is the Euclidean distance between regions k and l.
   7 The revised version of Bloom et al (2008) considers extending this to measures which do take into account

the idea that some industries (and technological classes) may be closer to each other by using the Mahalanobis
distance metric instead of the Jaffe style measure.


                                                            7
      We distinguish between measures of match ( f ) and measures of Euclidean distance (C).


i)    Measures of match

We use two functions f (.) of the locational distributions:
      The product function,
                                           f prod (.) = FikG FjlG ,                         (10)

and the sum function
                              f sum (.) = Oijkl ( FikG + FilG + FjkG + FjlG ),              (11)

where Oijkl equals 1 if there is an overlap between the activities of firms i and j in the
combined regions k and l. The product function is a multidimensional relative of the
uncentered correlation coefficient, whereas the sum function measures, for those regions
where the two firms’ activities overlap, the fraction of their combined activities that are
located in the combined regions.
      There are a number of attributes of our geographic measures that should be noted.
First, unlike our product market and technology class measures, with our geographic
measures spillovers occur across markets and cross–market spillovers are weighted by
geographic distance between the markets. Note also that the second measure (the sum)
favors diversification of labs. In other words, if a rival’s inventors are distributed across all
locations, firm i would also like to diversify its locations. In contrast, with the product
measure, firm i is indifferent between specialization and diversification. Finally, note that
each measure specializes to headquarters, which is similar to considering firms that have
only one lab or have all of their labs in the same region.


ii)   Measures of Euclidean distance

With our parametric specifications, we also use alternative functions of dkl . Specifically, we
define two simple functions C (.) of the Euclidean distance between regions k and l.
                                                     (
                                                          1, k = l,
                                    Ccorr (dkl ) =                                          (12)
                                                          0, k 6= l,

and
                                     Cexp (dkl ) = exp(−αdkl ).                             (13)

With the first function, geographic distance does not matter. Indeed, no spillovers occur
unless firms i and j are located in the same region. We use the subscript corr to indicate
that this is the distance measure that is implicit when the uncentered correlation coefficient



                                                     8
is calculated (i.e., our measures of technology and product–market spillovers). With the
second measure, the effect of distance decays gradually. The parameter α in (13), which
determines the rate of decay, can be estimated or set exogenously. We use the subscript
exp to denote exponential decay.


5     Data

We use two firm level data sources. Accounting data (sales, employment, capital, etc.) come
from U.S. Compustat 1980-2000. Since we focus on manufacturing, we removed all firms
whose primary industries are outside of the manufacturing sector (SIC codes 2000-3990).
The data items available in Compustat, which are those reported in standard corporate
income statements, are used to construct our measures of output and conventional inputs,
Q, L, and K. We deflate sales by a year–specific four digit producer price index and capital
by the CPI. The Compustat Segment data also allow us to create breakdowns of each firm’s
activities across product markets. Specifically, firms’ sales are allocated to industry codes
or lines of business, such as 3660 (“Communications equipment”) and 3820 (“Measuring
and controlling devices”). On average each firm reports sales in approximately 4.8 different
industry codes.
     The Compustat firms were matched into the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
data from the NBER data archive. This archive contains detailed information on almost
three million U.S. patents granted between January 1963 and December 1999 and all
citations made to those patents between 1975 and 1999.8 Since our method requires
information on patenting, we kept only those firm years with a positive patent stock (firms
that had no patents at all in the period of 1970-2000 were dropped), leaving an unbalanced
panel of 812 manufacturing firms with at least four observations with non-missing sales,
capital stock and employment information. The USPTO allocates patents into technology
classes, such as class 042 (“Firearms”) and class 257 (“Solid state devices”), the breakdown
that we use to construct technological proximity. On average each firm owns 496 patents
in 37 classes.
     Inventor location is taken from the address of the lead inventor of the patent, which is
recorded at the city level. This is the standard measure of inventor location used by Jaffe
and Trajtenberg (2002) and Griffith , Harrison and Van Reenen (2006), among many others.
We feel that it is a more appropriate proxy for the location of the firm’s R&D, and thus
the potential for spillovers, than the headquarters of the firm, as it is a better indicator of
where the key research was conducted. We allocate R&D activity into 2,039 geographic
units, where a unit is a county. Because there are multiple patents, we are able to build
    8 See   Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2005) and Jaffe and Trajtenberg (2002).

              The geographic spillover measure is based on inventor locations and uses
              the product measure of match and exponential decay with distance



up a picture of the location of the firm’s R&D activity spatially. We do not use inventor
information outside the United States because we have focused on US firms.
      Each firm’s own stock of knowledge, S, is constructed from R&D expenditure data as
in equation (3) with the depreciation rate δ set to 0.15 following Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg
(2005). The horizontal product–market spillover measure (with weights w P ), which is
denoted SpillSIC, makes use of 349 3 digit SICs, and the technological spillover measure
(with weights w T ), which is denoted SpillTech, makes use of 410 technology classes. Finally,
the measures of geographic proximity (with weights wG ), which are denoted SpillGeog,
differ depending on the functions of match ( f ) and geographic distance (C) that are chosen.


5.1     Descriptive Statistics

Table 1 provides some basic descriptive statistics for the accounting and patenting data,
and the technology, product market, and geographic distance measures, SpillTech, SpillSIC,
and SpillGeog. The sample firms are large (mean employment is over 13,000), but with
much heterogeneity in size (measured by sales, employment, or physical capital), R&D
intensity, patenting activity, and location. The three spillover measures also differ widely
across firms.
      In order to distinguish between the effects of technology, product market, and geo-
graphic spillovers econometrically we need independent variation in the distance metrics
in technology, product market, and geographic space. To gauge this we do two things.
      First, we calculate and report in table 2 raw correlation coefficients between pairs of



                                               10

              the change of lnSpillM         0.460        0.129          0.327
                Notes:
                All correlations are significant at the 1% level
                In column one, M denotes SIC, TECH, or Geog
                The change in lnSpill is defined as a residual from the regression
                with firm fixed effects and time dummies.

measures. To interpret table 2, consider the first column. The first row in that column
contains the correlation coefficient between the product and technology market weights,
w P and w T , the second column that between lnSpillSIC and lnSpillTech, and the third
between ∆lnSpillSIC and ∆lnSpillTech. In performing this calculation, we used the product
measure of match and the exponential measure of distance to construct SpillGeog. The
correlations between the weights, the levels, and the changes of the spillover variables
are positive and significant at the 1% level. However, they are well below unity, implying
substantial independent variation in each of the three measures.
   Second, we plot each pair of weights. Figures 1, 2, and 3, which show w T , w P , and wG
plotted against each other reveal that the positive correlations that we observe are caused
by a dispersion across the unit box rather than by a few outliers.
   We also investigate the relationship between the locations of inventors and headquarters
in two ways. First, we calculate the aggregate distribution of inventor locations, which
shows the aggregate fraction of inventors that are located at various distances from their



                                              11

headquarters. The quintiles of this distribution are reported in table 3, which shows that
although some firms have all of their research activities located in close proximity to their
headquarters, the activities of others are much more dispersed.
   Second, we picked four firms that exhibit very different patterns. The information
for those firms is summarized in figure 4. The triangles in the graphs locate each firm’s
headquarters, whereas the circles show the distribution of its inventors. The first firm, Po-
laroid, has almost all of its research activities located in close proximity to its headquarters;
the second, Motorola, has four concentrations of inventors, one of which is in close to its



                                               12
headquarters; the third, Eaton (a power management company), has many concentrations
of research activities. This dispersion is due to the fact that Eaton has expanded mainly
through acquisitions; finally, the fourth, Union Carbide, has most of its R&D activities
located in the Northeast where its headquarters used to be. In 1982, however, it relocated
its headquarters to Connecticut and later to Texas but left its labs in place.


6     Econometric Methodology

6.1    The Model

We use a Cobb–Douglas production function. The dependent variable is lnQ, where Q
is real sales, and the explanatory variables are lnK, where K is capital, and lnL, where
L is labor, as well as firm and year fixed effects. In addition, we include a firm’s own
stock of knowledge, lnOwnS, the horizontal product–market spillover measure, lnSpillSIC,
and the technological spillover measure, lnSpillTech. Most equations that are reported
below contain all of these variables. In addition, they contain one or more measures of
geographic proximity, lnSpillGeog, that differ depending on the functions of match ( f ) and
geographic distance (C) that are chosen. Variables that are preceded by ln are in natural
logarithms.
      In some cases, our construction of the geographic spillover measure is somewhat
different from that of the product–market and technology spillover measures, lnSpillSIC
and lnSpillTech. We define two geographic spillover variables,
                                                                 
                               lnSpillGeogit = ln       ∑ ij ,
                                                         w G
                                                             S jt                       (14)
                                                         j

and
                             SpillGeoglnit =   ∑ wijG ln(1 + Sjt ).                     (15)
                                                j

      We make this distinction because using the logarithm of sums makes semiparametric
estimation difficult. As one substitutes a series approximation for wijG , the production–
function equation becomes nonlinear in the unknown parameters, and the estimates can
only be obtained from numerical minimization. The problem is that the objective function
is not convex; it has many local minima, their number growing with the number of terms
in the series expansion. Using the sum of logarithms, in contrast, makes the equation
linear in parameters, and one can estimate it simply by applying OLS.
      We therefore faced a tradeoff between being confident that the global minimum was
found, which is difficult to ensure with (15), and being consistent in the definition of the
spillover measure. We chose the former (log–of–sums) for the parametric exercise. All

where, in the semiparametric case, lnSpillGeog is replaced with SpillGeogln. Note that we
have a doubly unbalanced panel, since n differs by year and T differs by firm.


6.2     Econometric Issues

i)    Identification

The potential bias in OLS estimates of production functions has long been recognized (see,
e.g., Marschak and Andrews 1944). This bias results from the possible correlation between
input levels and firm level productivity shocks. Specifically, when firms experience a large
productivity shock, they might respond by using more inputs. Applied economists have
devised alternatives to OLS that circumvent this problem. Most use either a variant of the
method developed by Olley and Pakes (1996) and extended by Levinsohn and Petrin (2003)
or the GMM methods proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991), Arellano and Bover (1995)
and Blundell and Bond (2000). We have chosen to focus on GMM approaches because it is
difficult to introduce endogenous R&D into Olley–Pakes approaches.
      Essentially, the Arellano and Bond approach assumes that serial correlation of the error
term (after controling for fixed effects) is of finite order. In the simplest case of no serial
correlation this implies that levels dated t − 2 and earlier are valid instruments. If there
is some first order correlation (e.g. MA(1)) we can use t − 3 dated instruments. We also
considered the additional moments for the levels equations suggested by Arellano and
Bover (1995) and first used in a production function context by Blundell and Bond (2000).
      We assume that the inventor distances are exogenous and instrument for the terms in
the semiparametric expansion by the corresponding terms with potentially endogenous
regressors replaced with corresponding instruments (see Pinkse, Slade, and Brett, 2002).
The assumption that inventor distances are exogenous is questionable. However, in our
model inventor locations are constant over the observed time period. Moreover, finding
plausible instruments for such distances is near impossible in the present application,
unlike in Pinkse, Slade, and Brett (2002).




                                                      15
ii)   Estimation

We use four different methods to estimate the unknown coefficients in (16): OLS, GMM,
semiparametric least squares (SLS) and semiparametric GMM (SGMM). For (S)GMM we
consider both a static and a dynamic version.
      The parametric methods presume that we know the shape of the weights in lnSpillGeog,
which is likely unreasonable. As is often the case, our choice is a tradeoff between ‘bias’
arising from using a parsimonious model and increased ‘variance’ arising from having too
many unknowns.
      For the static models we subtract out firm–specific means in (16) to eliminate firm fixed
effects. We then obtain
                                       yi∗ = Xi∗ β + µ∗ + ui∗ ,                              (18)

where yi∗ , Xi∗ , µ∗ , ui∗ are demeaned versions of yi , Xi , µ, ui respectively. With OLS and SLS
there is an implicit and impausible assumption of strict exogeneity. Errors here can be
serially correlated.
      For the static versions of GMM and SGMM, we use sufficiently lagged xit ’s as instru-
ments. This presumes that such instruments are orthogonal to current and (one period–)
lagged errors. Such orthogonality of instruments and errors for all intents and purposes
entails either strict exogeneity of the instruments or an absence of serial correlation in the
errors. Our choice of using lagged xit ’s as instruments implies the second interpretation.
      For the dynamic version of the model we use the methodology of Arellano and Bond
(1991) and estimate a model similar to that of Blundell and Bond (2000). Consider equation
(16), but allow the error term to follow the AR(1) process

                                         uit = ρuit−1 + ε it ,

where ε it is serially independent (we can allow this to be correlated up to finite order).
Substituting this back into equation (18) gives

                        yit = π1 yit−1 + Xit π2 + Xit−1 π3 + νi∗ + µ∗t + ε it .              (19)

      The production function estimates are identified using the common factor restriction:

                                                         π3
                                          β = π2 = −        .                                (20)
                                                         π1
      We estimate the unrestricted model of equation (19) and then impose (20) by minimum
distance methods.




                                                  16
iii)    Semiparametric Estimation

For our semiparametric estimation of the distance function C, as before, the estimated
equation is (18). However, as discussed in subsection 6.1, lnSpillGeog is replaced by
SpillGeogln.
       We follow Chen (2007) (see also Dechevsky and Penev, 1997) and approximate C by

                                           2 Jn
                                           ∑      γm b 2 Jn G̃ (d) − m + 1 ,
                                                                          
                                C (d) =
                                           m =0

where                                      
                                           1 − | x − 1|,     | x − 1| < 2,
                                b( x ) =
                                           0,                | x − 1| ≥ 1,

and G̃ is a monotonic distance transformation described below.
       The advantage of our choice of basis functions is that it allows us to control the shape
of C by imposing restrictions on the γ–coefficients. This is important to ensure that C
decrease to zero sufficiently fast; see Pinkse and Slade (2010) for further discussion.
       As with all nonparametric methods there is a sample–size–dependent input parameter,
here Jn . Jn should increase with the sample size n to an infinite limit. In finite size samples,
however, this requirement provides little guidance, and we experiment with two different
values for Jn : Jn = 2 (5 basis functions) and Jn = 3 (9 basis functions).
       In some specifications, we impose that our γ–coefficients satisfy the restrictions γ2 Jn = 0
and                                            h                                    i
              ∀0 ≤ m̃ ≤ m ≤ 2 Jn : γm ≤ γm̃ exp −α G̃ −1 (m/2 Jn ) − G̃ −1 (m̃/2 Jn ) ,       (21)

for α = 0 and α = (ln 2)/3000, which results in monotonically decreasing C and both
exponentially and monotonically decreasing C, respectively.
   Finally, if d is distance in thousands of kilometers and [d] is the largest integer no
                                                               
greater than d, then G̃ (d) = (d − [d]) G̃[d]+1 + 1 − (d − [d]) G̃[d] , where G̃i is the fraction
of inventor pairs at different firms who are no more than 1000i kilometers apart.
       For SGMM we again apply the Arellano and Bond (1991) technique, albeit that we now
need a sample–size dependent number of instruments. We obtain such instruments using
a simplified version of the estimation procedure of Pinkse, Slade and Brett (2002).


iv)     Inference

For the parametric result, we use fairly standard methodology, albeit that we make some
independence assumptions across firms for the errors. More precisely, we assume the

existence of constants σti such that
                                                               
                                                               0,           j 6= i,
                                  E[uit u js |zit , z js ] =                                              (22)
                                                               σ
                                                                 |t−s|,i ,   j = i.

For most specifications, we set σ|t−s|,i = 0 if |t − s| ≥ r, where r is a parameter that we
choose. The difference between (22) and full ‘clustering’ is that the covariance between
uit and uis depends only on the identity of the firm and the difference |t − s| and that the
conditional covariance of uit , uis does not depend on zit , zis . Our choice is motivated by the
idea of providing a reasonable compromise between the extremes of Stock and Watson
(2008) and full clustering.
     Asymptotics for semiparametric IV estimators under spatial dependence are derived
by Pinkse, Slade, and Brett (2002), who establish consistency and asymptotic normality.
However, their results do not allow for the presence of inequality restrictions like those
imposed to achieve monotonicity and exponential decline, they do not explicitly address
the issue of Comfac restrictions,9 and the method of generating spillover measures based
on inventor locations complicates matters further.
     An earlier version of this work contained standard errors and confidence bands based
on the Pinkse, Slade, and Brett (2002) method, again using a compromise between the
extremes of full clustering and Stock and Watson (2008). The results presented here are
based on subsampling10 and yield qualitatively the same results. We opted for subsampling
since the requirements for its consistency are the weakest among possible alternatives.
Nevertheless, we do not rigorously establish that our estimator has a limiting distribution
nor indeed a convergence rate, and some of the issues mentioned in the first paragraph
are problematic with subsampling, also. So standard errors and confidence bands for the
semiparametric case should be viewed with some caution, but the qualitative similarity of
results based on the two methods mentioned is reassuring.


7     Results

The remaining tables contain a number of specifications of our production function with
knowledge spillovers, all of which include firm and year fixed effects. We begin with the
OLS estimates.
    9 Comfac would be a comparatively straightforward adjustment.
    10 Subsampling is a resampling method akin to the bootstrap. It requires weaker conditions than the
bootstrap at the cost of slower convergence if the bootstrap conditions are satisfied; see Politis, Romano, and
Wolf (1999).

7.1     Fixed Effects OLS

Single Spillover Measures

Table 4, which assesses each spillover measure in isolation as well as all three jointly, shows
that when only one measure is considered, the coefficient of that measure is positive and
significant at conventional levels. However, the coefficients of lnSpillTech and lnSpillGeog
are an order of magnitude larger than the coefficient of lnSpillSIC. Furthermore, when all
three measures are included in the same equation, the coefficient of lnSpillSIC becomes
negative and insignificant. We will see that the negative insignificant coefficient persists in
virtually all subsequent specifications.
      This is consistent with the model outlined in Bloom et al (2008) where R&D by product
market rivals affects market value, but should have no effect on total factor productivity
(TFP), as it does not alter technological capabilities (conditional on own R&D). If we have
not properly controlled for firm-specific prices when measuring output, however, then
SpillSIC could have a negative effect in the (revenue-based) production function as it
depresses own prices.


Multiple Spillover Measures

Tables 5–7 contain further estimates of the production function. The geographic measures
in table 5 are based on inventor locations, those in table 6 are based on headquarters,
whereas table 7 assesses inventors and headquarters based measures jointly. Looking
across equations and tables, we can see that, in all specifications, the coefficients of the
common variables are remarkably similar in magnitude and significance. Furthermore,
all of those coefficients are positive, significant at high levels, and the capital and labor
coefficients are similar in magnitude to those obtained by previous researchers.11 Finally, as
in Bloom, Schankerman, and Van Reenen (2008), the coefficient of the technology spillover
variable is substantially larger than that of the horizontal measure.
      To examine geographic spillovers in more detail, first consider table 5, which is based on
inventor locations and contains all combinations of our measures of match (sum and prod)
and distance (corr and exp). When considered separately, the estimates of the coefficients
of the sum measure are larger than those of the prod measure. However, when both are
included in the same equation, the coefficients of the prod measure become larger than
those of the sum measure. Moreover, with the exponential distance function, the latter
become negative and insignificant whereas the former remain virtually unchanged. Finally,
comparing across specifications, we see that the sum coefficients are highly unstable. For
  11 Note that our estimates show mildly diminishing returns when only the firm’s choice variables are

considered but strongly increasing returns when spillovers are added.

   Columns (2) through (7) contain t–statistics for the indicated choices of covariance matrix
   estimate, where in columns (4) through (6) dependence up to lag no greater than r is
   assumed.
   Columns (3) and (7) allow for heteroskedasticity across time and firm, whereas columns
   (4) through (6) allow for heteroskedasticity across firms, but not time.


these reasons, in what follows, we report only equations that use the product measure.
   Table 5 also contains specifications that use the corr and exp functions of geographic
distance. It is clear that, although the coefficients of both measures are positive and
significant at conventional levels, with one exception the magnitude of the spillover effect
is much larger when the effect of distance is allowed to decay gradually. In other words,
a zero/one distinction (different or same geographic market) has much less explanatory
power, implying that cross–market spillovers are important.
   Table 6, which contains measures based on headquarters, shows similar patterns. In
particular, the estimate of the coefficient of the spillover measure that uses the corr distance
function is considerably smaller than that of the measure that uses the exp function. Finally
table 7, which assesses measures based on inventor and headquarters locations jointly,
shows that inventor measures outperform headquarters measures.
   Tables 5–7 thus reveal four regularities that persist in alternative specifications. First,
the prod measure of match, which is the natural extension of the uncentered correlation
coefficient, outperforms the sum measure. Second, although match by itself is important, it
is clear that considering both match and Euclidean distance is associated with estimates of
spillover effects that are both larger and more significant than when distance is ignored.
Third, geographic distance effects are larger when inventor rather than headquarter
locations are chosen. Our use of the patent data therefore appears to result in an improved



                                                 22
geographic measure. Finally, the coefficients of the spillover variables are substantially
larger that those of the own stock of knowledge, another finding that is consistent with
previous research.
       Estimates in tables 5–7 use standardized geographic spillover variables.12 Standard-
ization makes it more difficult to interpret the values of coefficients. To demonstrate the
magnitude of geographic spillovers we perform the following thought experiment.13 We
track the total factor productivity (TFP) of a hypothetical firm, whose inventors are located
in Los Angeles County (“incumbent LA firm”). We assume that another hypothetical
firm has a lab in the same county with an R&D stock of $500m. We then relocate this lab
farther and farther away from LA. As the lab moves to an infinite distance, its contribution
to the LA incumbent’s geographic spillover variable declines to zero, while the product
market and the technology spillovers are left unaffected. Having such a lab in LA raises
the incumbent LA firm’s TFP by 0.82%, whereas having the mobile R&D lab in San Diego
would raise TFP by only 0.44%. If the lab were moved to San Francisco, its contribution
would decline further to 0.12%. Having the lab as far as Seattle would only raise the
LA–based firm’s TFP by 0.00038% (essentially zero). Since LA’s GDP was approximately
$55 billion in 2002 according to the Census, this implies the lab with a $500m R&D stock
raises LA county’s net output by $451 million. This is a substantial effect and could
rationalise why cities and states compete so eagerly for the location of R&D activities (e.g.
Wilson, 2009).
       These OLS estimates, which suffer from a number of econometric problems that are
discussed in section 6, are only preliminary. Nevertheless, they serve as a guide to our
more rigorous specifications. In particular, in what follows, we report specifications based
on inventor locations, product measures of match, and nontrivial functions of Euclidean
distance (Cexp or a semiparametric specification).


7.2      Corrected Standard Errors

Table 8 contains t statistics for six different estimates of the covariance matrix. All are
based on inventor locations, the f prod measure of match, and the Cexp function of distance.
The first equation was obtained under the assumption of homoskedasticity, whereas the
second assumes unrestricted heteroskedasticity. Neither allows for serial correlation. The
remaining entries in the table are based on the assumption that errors cluster by firm but
make different assumptions concerning the nature of serial correlation. In particular, the
third, fourth, and fifth equations, which allow for restricted correlation, correspond to r
  12 See
       appendix A for an explanation.
  13For this experiment, we reestimated the equation in table 5 column (5) without standardizing the
geographic spillover variable.



                                                23
= 0, r = 2, and r = 21, where serial correlation dies out after r periods. Finally, the last
equation allows for unrestricted serial correlation.
      The table shows that the t statistics tend to decline as we move from left to right.
This occurs because the number of coefficients that must be estimated grows. The single
exception is the move from specification two to three, since clustering without serial
correlation involves fewer parameters than unrestricted heteroskedasticity.
      Two regularities are notable. First, the coefficients of the geographic and technology
spillover measures are positive and significant, regardless of covariance–matrix estimator.
Second, the coefficient of the product–market measure is negative and insignificant in all
specifications
      Although we do not report further estimates, the qualitative nature of the regularities
than we have noted persists when other measures of geographic match and distance are
used.

      Figure 5 shows estimates of C (d) from our semiparametric estimations under various
specifications of the approximating function. The three rows of graphs correspond to the
three sets of restrictions, or lack thereof: no restrictions, monotonicity, and exponential
decline. The graphs on the left side were obtained by assuming that Jn = 2 (5 basis
functions), whereas those on the right assume that Jn = 3 (9 basis functions). Table 9 lists
the estimates of the parametric parts of the equation.
      As is typical with series estimation, the unrestricted functions are highly nonmonotonic.

Here, moreover, failing to impose exponentially declining functions is likely to result in
inconsistent estimates; see Pinkse and Slade (2010). The other functions are, of course,
monotonic by assumption. Regardless of specification, however, one regularity stands out
— the function declines sharply close to the origin. Indeed, after about 500 km., geographic
spillovers are small or nonexistent. This finding implies that technology markets are
confined to narrow geographic areas.14


7.4     Correction for Endogeneity

IV Estimates

An obvious concern with the estimation strategy is that even after controlling for fixed
effects the production function inputs are endogenous. There is a huge literature on esti-
mating production functions (see, e.g. Ackerberg et al, 2007). We present some experiments
in table 10 to allow for endogeneity following Arellano and Bond (1991). Column (1)
presents estimates of the static production function coefficients. The results are consistent
with our main within–groups estimates: geographically–based knowledge spillovers are
positive and significant, albeit with a coefficient that is somewhat smaller than the Jaffe–
based technological distance measure. As before, the product–market–based spillover term
is statistically insignificant.
      The diagnostics at the base of column (1) indicate that there is significant autocorrela-
tion, which invalidates our use of instruments. If we follow Blundell and Bond (2000) and
assume that there is an AR(1) error term in the static production function, this generates a
model that includes a lagged dependent variable and lags of all the production function
inputs and spillovers. We present the results of the unrestricted model in column (3),
and note that the diagnostics at the base of the column indicate that there is no further
evidence of serial correlation.
      As outlined in section 6.2, the structure of the model implies common factor (COMFAC)
restrictions on the coefficients, which we impose in column (2). The qualitative results
from this COMFAC model are consistent with the findings in column (1) and elsewhere
in the paper. In particular, there is a significant effect of the geographically–based R&D
spillover in addition to the standard technological spillover term. We also experimented
with using further “levels” moments that follow if we make assumptions over the initial
conditions (essentially mean stationarity) as suggested by Arellano and Bover (1995) and
Blundell and Bond (1998).15 Unfortunately, Sargan–Difference tests suggested that these
  14 This pattern of local spillovers has also been found from patent citation data for universities (see Belenzon
and Schankerman, 2010).
  15 Note, that unlike the main estimates, the coefficient on own R&D is no longer significant. This probably

reflects the well-known problem discussed in Blundell and Bond (1998) that it is difficult to instrument very

            are treated as endogenous and instrumented using the Arellano-Bond (1991)
            method using instruments dated t-2 to t-6 (i.e. all variables first differenced and
            instrumented with their own lagged levels from t-2 and before). Column (1)
            estimates a static production function and column (3) a dynamic production
            function including a lagged dependent variable and lags of all the variables.
            Column (2) imposes the Comfac restrictions i.e. it assumes that the DGP is a
            static production function with an AR(1) levels error term (see Blundell and
            Bond, 2000). All columns include a full set of time dummies.

       The estimates are far from ideal. First, Hansen/Sargan tests reject instrument validity
in both specifications. This is common, however, when one has large samples (e.g. Nevo,
2000). Second, the COMFAC restrictions are rejected, which formally implies that we
cannot go from the unrestricted to the restricted model. Nevertheless, we present our
results and note that the positive and significant effect of the spillover terms is invariant
to many experiments with different instrument sets. This finding suggests that our key
conclusions are robust.16


Semiparametric IV Estimates

We have also estimated the COMFAC specification using our semiparametric estimator.
The results are reported in table 11 and figure 6. Although there are differences with the
unrestricted (i.e. without common factor restrictions) case, the main conclusions are the
same.

  16We could go for an alternative dynamic form, say from a general to specific method. However, we do
not want to overwhelm the reader with too many specifications. Indeed, there are diminishing returns to
changing the specification.

8   Conclusions

A number of conclusions can be drawn from our study. First and foremost, geography
matters. Indeed, intraregional spillovers are significant, sizeable, and economically im-
portant, even after conditioning on technological and product–market spillovers. This
finding is consistent with an emerging literature suggesting important local productivity
spillovers (e.g. Greenstone, Hornbeck and Moretti, 2010). We conclude that social learning
and capitalization of complementarities among firms’ research activities can be important
factors for economic growth. Second, distance matters. More precisely, a geographic
distance function that allows spillovers to decay gradually as regions become farther apart
outperforms a specification that constrains spillovers to occur only within regions (i.e.,
a zero/one distance function that indicates that two regions are the same or different).
Finally, estimated geographic spillover effects are larger when the distribution of each
firm’s inventors is used as a measure of R&D location rather than the location of its
headquarters. Our use of the patent data to create spatial distributions of the location of
firms’ research activities therefore appears to be a worthwhile extension.
    Turning to technological spillovers, we have experimented less with different measures
of this important variable. Nevertheless, as with geographic spillovers, we find that
technological spillovers are significant, sizeable, and economically important. In fact, in
most specifications, the magnitude of the coefficients of this measure are comparable to
those of the geographic measures.
    The picture with respect to product–market productivity spillovers is very different.
Indeed, although the coefficient of this variable is positive and significant when it is consid-
ered in isolation, more often than not that coefficient becomes negative and insignificant
when the other spillover variables are included in the specification. We argue that this
finding is consistent with the model outlined in Bloom et al (2008), where R&D by product
market rivals affects market value, but should have no effect on total factor productivity,
as it does not alter technological capabilities conditional on own R&D.
    What have we learned from a policy point of view? We can conclude that since
estimated spillover effects are large, there is a sizeable public–good aspect to R&D activity.
In the absence of public policy to rectify this externality, we might therefore expect to see
underinvestment in R&D. Nevertheless, as there are also costs associated with intervention,
more research would be required before one could advocate interference in R&D markets.
Finally, we can conclude that geographic markets are very local. This could explain why
local policymakers invest substantial sums in tax incentives to attract R&D labs to their
cities, states, and countries (e.g. Wilson, 2008). Indeed, our semiparametric estimates show
that, although knowledge spillovers are large, they decay quickly, which is not good news
for regional convergence.

Possible Extensions
   Note that, although we have used specifications of proximity measures that allow for
cross–market spillovers only for geographic markets, the same could be done for product
and technology markets. To illustrate, consider product markets. Although it is clear
that the production of cars is much closer to that of trucks and buses than it is to that
of breakfast cereals and ladies apparel, the zero/one distance function that is implicitly
assumed in research to date does not allow for intermediate cases (i.e., two activities are in
different but close technology or product markets). It might therefore be fruitful to modify
the product and technology proximity measures to incorporate nontrivial C functions.
Moreover, the construction of SICs and technology classes, which involves classification
into n–digit groups, gives us a natural distance metric.

A     Data Appendix

A.1      The patents and Compustat databases

The NBER patents database provides detailed patenting and citation information for
around 2,500 firms (as described in Hall, Jaffe and Trajtenberg (2005) and Jaffe and
Trajtenberg (2002)). We started by using the NBER’s match of the Compustat accounting
data to the USPTO data between 1970 to 200017 , and kept only patenting firms. These
firms were then matched into the Compustat Segment (“line of business”) Dataset keeping
only the 817 firms with data on both sales by four digit industry and patents, although
these need not be concurrent. For example, a firm which patented in 1985, 1988 and 1989,
had Segment data from 1993 to 1997, and accounting data from 1980 to 1997 would be
kept in our dataset for the period 1980 to 1997. The Compustat Segment Database allocates
firm sales into four digit industries each year using firm’s descriptions of their sales by
lines of business. See Villalonga (2004) for a more detailed description.
    The output of each firm is deflated by the PPI for the primary industry of that firm.
When PPI data are unavailable (about a third of the firm–year pairs in our sample) we use
the aggregate Manufacturing PPI for those sectors.
    This dataset was cleaned to remove accounting years with extremely large jumps in
sales, employment or capital signalling merger and acquisition activity. When we removed
a year we treat the firm as a new entity and give it a new identifier (and therefore a new
fixed effect) even if the firm identifier (CUSIP reference) in Compustat remained the same.
This is more general than including a full set of firm fixed effects as we are allowing
the fixed effect to change over time. We also removed firms with less than four years of
non-missing accounting data.
    This left a final sample of 812 firms to estimate the model on with accounting data for
at least some of the period 1980 to 2000 and patenting data for at least some of the period
between 1970 and 1999. The panel is unbalanced as we keep new entrants and exitors in
the sample.


A.2      Geographic coordinates

We obtain the geographic coordinates of inventors by merging the patents data and the
extract from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) provided by the US
Geological Survey. All inventor records contain address information, in most cases the
names of the home state and the city. The GNIS records provide coordinates for all
established geographic names.
 17 We   dropped pre-1970 data as being too outdated for our 1980s and 1990s accounts data.




                                                    36
   Most of the time city and state names are not sufficient to uniquely identify a geographic
place: a typical city name has a number of duplicates within its state. If these duplicates
are located in the same county or within 0.1 degrees of latitude and longitude, we treat
them as one entity.
   If the duplicated names are located far apart, we give preference to incorporated places.
Names of incorporated places are usually more permanent and stable, they are more likely
to be used by the U.S. Postal Service. In turn, inventors are more likely to indicate a
USPS-preferred city name when they are asked to provide their home address.
   Following these rules, we are able to match 98.25% of inventor records that are related
to the firms in our sample. To reduce computational burden, we aggregate all geographic
data to the county level. For example, we assign identical coordinates to inventors from
Long Beach CA and Los Angeles CA: both cities are located in Los Angeles County.


A.3   Variables

The book value of capital is the net stock of property, plant and equipment (Compustat
Mnemonic PPENT); Employment is the number of employees (EMP). R&D expenditure
(XRD) is used to create R&D capital stocks calculated using a perpetual inventory method
with a 15% depreciation rate. We use sales as our output measure (SALE). Industry price
deflators were taken from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics PPI Database.
   The construction of the spillover variables is described in Section (3) above in detail.
About 95% of the variance of the spillover measures, SpillSIC, SpillTech and SpillGeog
is between firm and 5% is within firm. When we include fixed effects we are, of course,
relying on the time series variation for identification. lnSpillGeog is normalized to have
mean zero and variance one to facilitate comparisons of coefficients. In particular, when
we compare the explanatory power of different measures of match and distance, we use
the fact that when two variables have the same variance, the variation that they contribute
is measured by the absolute values of their coefficients.
   Industry sales are constructed in exactly the same way as SpillSIC, with the only
exception that the market proximity measure w P is weighted with the firm’s sales instead
of the R&D stock.
