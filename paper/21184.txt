In this paper, we shed new light on a long-standing puzzle: In India, Muslim children are
substantially more likely than Hindu children to survive to their first birthday, even though Indian
Muslims have lower wealth, consumption, educational attainment, and access to state services.
Contrary to the prior literature, we show that the observed mortality advantage accrues not to
Muslim households themselves but rather to their neighbors, who are also likely to be Muslim.
Investigating mechanisms, we provide a collage of evidence suggesting externalities due to poor
sanitation are a channel linking the religious composition of neighborhoods to infant mortality.

In this paper, we address a long-standing puzzle in the development and health literature: In India,

Muslim children are substantially more likely than Hindu children to survive to their first birthday,

even though Muslims have lower wealth, consumption, and educational attainment, and face worse

access to state services such as piped water and health infrastructure, compared to the majority Hin-

dus.1 By age one, mortality among Muslims is 17% lower than among Hindus, with an additional 1.1

infants per 100 surviving. Bhalotra, Valente and van Soest (2010) named this robust and persistent

pattern a “puzzle,” showing that individual and household characteristics could not explain it.2

     After replicating the fact that Muslim children have a large survival advantage in India, we show

that the mortality difference can be accounted for by two facts. First, compared to the typical Hindu

infant, the typical Muslim infant lives in a neighborhood where a larger share of her neighbors are

Muslim. Second, both Hindu and Muslim infants are more likely to survive in neighborhoods with

high shares of Muslim neighbors. The natural question, then, is: what makes neighborhoods dis-

proportionately inhabited by Muslims better places for the health of (Muslim and Hindu) children?

We show, consistent with the well-known relative disadvantage of Muslims in India (Sachar et al.,

2006 and Deolalikar, 2008), that neighborhoods with high shares of Muslim households are associ-

ated with worse characteristics that predict infant health along many observable dimensions—with

the important exception of sanitation.

     Despite relative economic advantage, India’s majority Hindu population is 25 percentage points

more likely to defecate in the open—that is, in open places such as in fields, behind bushes, or near

roads—than the minority Muslim population. This Hindu-Muslim behavioral difference implies that

the fraction of a household’s neighbors who are Muslim is strongly correlated with the local sanita-

tion environment to which the household is exposed. For example, in nationally representative data,

Hindus residing in neighborhoods that are 10% Muslim are exposed to a local open defecation preva-

lence of 63%, while Hindus residing in neighborhoods that are 90% Muslim are exposed to a local

open defecation prevalence of 46%. To better understand this variation, we draw on a survey by

Coffey et al. (2014) in rural northern India that was designed to elicit richer detail on stated and
   1 This phenomenon, which has existed since at least the 1960s and which has been documented by Shariff (1995), Bhat
and Zavier (2005), Bhalotra and van Soest (2008), and Bhalotra, Valente and van Soest (2010), is hard to reconcile with the
well-developed literature on the importance of parental income in predicting child health and mortality. For overviews of
the literature and applications in the US, see Cutler and Lleras-Muney (2010) and Geruso (2012).
   2 Bhalotra, Valente and van Soest (2010) carefully demonstrated that individual and household characteristics, develop-

ment expenditure, and village-level health services and health infrastructure could not account for the Muslim mortality
advantage.

revealed preferences toward latrine ownership and use. While both Hindus and Muslims in India

are significantly more likely to defecate in the open than similarly poor people in other developing

countries, there is a significant gap in attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors between these two groups in

India. Hindus are more likely to report that using a toilet or latrine near their home is “impure” and

that defecating away from the home in the open is part of a healthy lifestyle. Even conditional on

ownership of a working latrine, Hindus are less likely to use it. The idea that latrine demand could

be significantly influenced by social factors beyond price and wealth accords with recent qualita-

tive work in India (Coffey et al., 2017) and experimental interventions in Bangladesh (Guiteras et al.,

2014).3

     After establishing that the mortality advantage accrues, in fact, to both Hindu and Muslim neigh-

bors of Muslims and after observing that local sanitation is strongly associated with the share of Mus-

lim neighbors, we provide a collage of evidence consistent with poor sanitation as the channel linking

religious composition of neighborhoods to infant mortality. We show (i) that the partial correlation

between Muslim neighbors and mortality diminishes once one controls for the sanitation practices of

neighbors; (ii) that in the minority of neighborhoods where there is no open defecation, there is no

mortality advantage associated with a higher proportion of Muslim neighbors; (iii) that where there

is non-negligible open defecation, regional variation in the strength of the Hindu-Muslim difference

in defecation behaviors predicts the regional strength of the Muslim mortality advantage; (iv) that

other child outcomes with a specific biological link to the bacteria and worms spread by fecal matter

(in particular, anemia and low current weight) are correlated with Muslim neighbors in the same

pattern as infant mortality; and (v) that child health inputs (diet, hand washing, access to piped wa-

ter) and child health outcomes (vaccinations, institutional births) that should not be affected by open

defecation do not positively covary with the Muslim share in the neighborhood.

     As a final exercise, we attempt to understand the potential size of the apparent mortality external-

ities of open defecation by instrumenting for neighborhood sanitation with the religious composition

of neighbors, holding constant own religious identity and own latrine/toilet use. These regressions

have the advantage that the coefficient of interest is identified off of a component of the variation

in neighbors’ behavior that is carefully documented in the paper. However, even though we show

that the observed correlates of Muslim neighborhoods would tend to bias against the finding of a
   3 Coffey et al. (2017) document significant resistance to the adoption of effective, low-cost improvements to sanitation in

India.


                                                              2
negative externality under this strategy, the neighborhoods where Muslims are concentrated may be

different in unobservable ways, so these results are presented with caution. With that caveat, we find

that a 10 percentage point reduction in the fraction of neighbors defecating in the open is associated

with a decline in infant mortality of 6 infants per 1,000, or about 8% of the population mean infant

mortality rate (IMR).4 By replicating the IV results within various subsets of the data—for example,

boys and girls separately, first-borns and later-borns separately, and rural and urban neighborhoods

separately—we show that these results are not confounded by phenomena like differential son pref-

erence by Hindus and Muslims, birth order explanations, or differential sorting of Muslims to urban

areas.

     The implied importance of open defecation for infant mortality in the modern Indian context

fits with evidence by Bleakley (2007), Cutler and Miller (2005), and Watson (2006) regarding the role

of sanitation and water in determining health and human capital outcomes in the historical US.5 In

particular, Cutler and Miller (2005) show that clean water and sanitation interventions in US citites

explain large shares of the decline in infant mortality in the US at the turn of the twentieth century.6

Our estimates are also consistent with the most credible data on cause of death during early-life in

India, which show that a large share (22%) of non-neonatal child deaths in India are due to diarrhea,

which is just one symptom of the diseases transmitted via open defecation.7

     It is difficult to overstate the potential importance of this issue. Today, more than a billion peo-

ple continue to defecate in the open. Ending this practice has become a target of governments,

NGOs, and private foundations. For example: ending open defecation was adopted in September

2015 among the UN’s new Sustainable Development Goals; in India in 2014, the central government

launched a 100-day construction plan during which one toilet or latrine was to be constructed every

second; from 2007 to 2014, the World Bank Group committed an average of over $3 billion per year
   4 To give a sense of how large a 10 percentage point decline in open defecation would be, we note that despite India’s

rapid economic growth over the last two decades and a large government investment specific to open defecation (Spears,
2013), open defecation rates have fallen in India by no more than 1 percentage point per year between 2001 and 2011 on
average (Government of India, 2011).
   5 Watson (2006) studied federal interventions to improve water and sanitation on US Indian reservations, finding effects

on local infant mortality and spillovers to neighboring localities. Bleakley (2007) studied the eradication of hookworm in
school-aged children in the US South at the turn of the twentieth century, documenting impacts on school enrollment and
attendance and on later-life income.
   6 Cutler and Miller (2005) show that the introduction of clean water technologies in US cities beginning around 1900

reduced the infant mortality rate by 87 deaths per thousand, or 46 percent of the base of 189 per thousand. Naively
applying our IV estimates would predict that cutting open defecation in half from 66 percent to 33 percent would reduce
infant mortality by 20 deaths per thousand (= 0.33 · 61.4). This would be a 28 percent reduction in the baseline Indian
infant mortality rate of 72 deaths per thousand during our sample period.

to water and sanitation; and since 2005, the Gates Foundation has invested hundreds of millions of

dollars to improve sanitation in developing countries, including efforts to “reinvent the toilet.” In

parallel, researchers have investigated the economic (Guiteras, Levinsohn and Mobarak, 2015) and

social (Guiteras et al., 2014) determinants of persistent open defecation. The rationale underlying

much of this recent attention is that private demand for toilets and latrines may be below the social

optimum, possibly because of inaccurate beliefs about the health benefits of improved sanitation, or

because latrine use has an important public goods component. The public goods aspect of sanitation

is indeed plausible. Epidemiological evidence and recent work by Duflo et al. (2015) suggest clear

pathways by which exposure to fecal pathogens introduced by neighbors could lead to acute net

malnutrition and ultimately death.8 Nonetheless, the research significantly lags the policy action and

investment.9

     Our paper develops important new facts on sanitation in the modern developing world—in part

by simply documenting striking patterns in stated and revealed preferences over latrines in India.

But our study also contributes new evidence to a long-running debate: The past two centuries have

produced the fastest declines in human mortality ever experienced. Much of this gain has come

from declines in infant deaths. Economic historians examining the epidemiological transition to low

infant mortality in developed countries have debated whether it reflects changes in nutrition, med-

ical care, or the disease environment. The disease environment, including water and sanitation, has

been found to be an important determinant of health and human capital outcomes around the world

(Spears and Lamba, 2014; Gertler et al., 2015; Headey et al., 2015). Our study is unique in the eco-

nomics literature in providing even suggestive evidence of the external impacts of open defecation on

mortality. Establishing whether the harm from open defecation is primarily external is an important
   8 We  discuss the epidemiological evidence in detail in Section 5. Duflo et al. (2015) show that an integrated water and
sanitation improvement program in rural India reduced diarrhea episodes by 30-50%.
    9 There are several reasons why, despite significant interest in and spending on this issue, the externalities of open

defecation are not yet well understood. For one, OLS estimates are likely to be biased because neighborhoods with worse
sanitation practices are likely to be worse in other unobservable dimensions as well. Further, efforts to estimate the impacts
of sanitation via field experiments have been complicated by difficulties in generating a first-stage effect on latrine use.
In many places there exist deeply rooted preferences against using latrines and toilets, even those freely provided. The
difficulty in generating a large first stage effect has been demonstrated by three recent field experiments in rural India, each
intending to estimate the effect of open defecation on child height (Hammer and Spears, 2016; Clasen et al., 2015; Gertler
et al., 2015). Indeed, the difficulty of changing latrine use behavior, combined with the large number of neighborhood
clusters required to measure mortality externalities, may explain the lack of any experimental evidence on sanitation and
mortality to date.The number of neighborhood clusters required to detect even economically large mortality effects via a
field experiment is large both because of the plausible effect size relative to the variance in mortality and because measuring
local externalities necessarily implies randomization at the level of the locality, not the individual. We discuss the issue in
Appendix A.1.

starting point for understanding behavior that is socially suboptimal and for justifying any policy

intervention on the grounds of efficiency.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: We begin in Section 2 by replicating the Mus-

lim mortality puzzle and showing that the mortality advantage in fact accrues to both Hindu and

Muslim households in Muslim-concentrated neighborhoods. Section 3 then documents how neigh-

borhood characteristics vary with religious composition, suggesting the possibility of a sanitation

channel. Section 4 draws on several household survey datasets to understand these neighborhood

differences in light of striking differences between Hindu and Muslim respondents in stated beliefs

and revealed preferences regarding the use of latrines. Section 5 provides a variety of corroborat-

ing evidence supporting a sanitation channel, and Section 6 puts the magnitudes of the apparent

sanitation externalities in context.



2      The Puzzle of Muslim Mortality Advantage

2.1      Data

For our main analysis, we use data from three rounds of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)

of India: 1992/1993, 1998/1999, and 2005/2006. The NFHS (India’s version of the Demographic

and Health Survey) is a large, nationally representative survey that collects data from women aged

15 to 49. Respondents report birth histories, including deaths and stillbirths, from which we calcu-

late infant and neonatal mortality rates. The NFHS also includes information on household assets,

household physical infrastructure, and health behaviors. With respect to the disposal of excreta, the

respondents are asked about the type of toilet facility, if any, the household usually uses. We code

a household as practicing open defecation (OD) if they report using no facility, or using a bush or a

field.

       Table 1 tabulates the summary statistics for our main analysis sample, which consists of Hindus

and Muslims in all waves of the NFHS. Corresponding to the analysis below, children (live births) are

the unit of observation.10 Our primary outcomes of interest are the infant mortality rate (IMR) and

the neonatal mortality rate (NMR), defined respectively as the number of deaths among children less

than one year old and less than 1 month old, scaled per 1,000 live births.11 Throughout the paper,
    10 Therefore,  these averages are representative of young children and their households, not of all of India.
    11 We   focus on these mortality outcomes as they are measured closest in time to the open defecation measurement that


                                                              5
we organize our analysis at the level of the child, constructing mortality rates from birth history

information on around 280,000 Hindu and Muslim children in India over the three survey rounds.

      Infant mortality is high across India, and consistent with previous studies, there is a large and

significant Muslim survival advantage. Table 1 shows that across both groups during our sample

period, more than 6 children in 100 died before their first birthday. Comparison of the Hindu and

Muslim means shows that for every hundred live births, 1.1 fewer Hindu children will survive to

age one, implying infant mortality is 17% higher among Hindus. Neonatal mortality shows a similar

pattern, with a 19% survival deficit. This is despite Muslims having lower educational attainment

and wealth, measured in this survey by assets. Though the NFHS does not measure consumption, the

India Human Development Survey, which is used to supplement the main analysis and is described

below, shows that mean and median consumption are higher among Hindus than Muslims as well.12

      Below, we show that neighborhood characteristics are important in understanding the lower

mortality rates of Muslim infants. We exploit the two-stage sampling structure of the survey design

to identify neighborhoods as primary sampling units (PSUs).13 The median survey PSU contains

observations on 27 households, which are sampled from PSU-level frames of about 100-200 house-

holds. In rural areas, these PSU frames may be the entire village. In urban areas, they are census

enumeration blocks.14 Therefore, PSU identifiers allow us to construct neighborhood-level variables

that reflect the characteristics of small localities. For each PSU j in the NFHS, we calculate the fraction

of sample respondents that are Muslim, M j , referred to below as Muslim concentration or Muslim

share.


2.2    The Puzzle

Figure 1 illustrates the mortality puzzle that was most clearly documented by Bhalotra, Valente and

van Soest (2010). At all levels of socioeconomic status, mortality is lower among Muslim children

than among Hindu children. The figure plots infant mortality, separately by religious group, against

two alternative summary measures of household economic well-being. The NFHS, like all DHS sur-
comprises our variable of interest.
  12 The unconditional mean and median consumption among Hindus in the IHDS is 985 and 710 rupees per month per

capita, respectively. The unconditional mean and median consumption among Muslims is 831 and 623 rupees per month
per capita, respectively.
  13 The NFHS is a two-stage random sample, first sampling PSUs and then households within sampled PSUs.
  14 Our data do not contain the sampling frame itself. According to the NFHS-3 report, rural PSUs are villages of “usually

about 100 to 200 households.” Large villages above 500 households were split into three possible PSUs. Urban PSUs are
census enumeration blocks (approximately 150-200 households).


                                                            6
veys, does not measure income or consumption. Therefore, in Panel A we follow the literature (see,

for example, Filmer and Pritchett, 2001) in using asset ownership as a proxy for wealth, and collaps-

ing seven categories of asset ownership into a single-dimensional wealth rank within the sample.15

This gives the horizontal axis a clear rank interpretation. As an alternative measure of parental en-

dowment, we use mother’s height along the horizontal axis in Panel B. Maternal adult height predicts

maternal adult health and reflects maternal economic well-being earlier in the mother’s life (Case and

Paxson, 2008; Steckel, 2009).

      Consistent with asset ownership and mother’s height capturing meaningful variation in endow-

ments that is correlated with child survival, Figure 1 shows that infant mortality is steeply decreas-

ing in both measures. The Muslim advantage documented by Shariff (1995), Bhat and Zavier (2005),

Bhalotra and van Soest (2008), and Bhalotra, Valente and van Soest (2010) is apparent in the large and

statistically significant mortality differences at any fixed level of either measure of well-being. To put

the size of the mortality difference in context, holding either wealth rank or maternal height constant

at their medians, Figure 1 shows that about an additional 10 out of 1000 infants in Hindu households

will die before age one compared to Muslim infants. The figure is consistent with the unconditional

difference in means of 11.1 (per thousand) in Table 1. The confidence intervals in the figure are not

adjusted for clustering, though as we show in regressions clustered at the neighborhood level in Ta-

ble 2, the mortality gap is strongly statistically significant and persists after conditioning on a wider

set of person, household, and neighborhood characteristics.


2.3    The Solution: Neighborhoods

In Table 2, we analyze the extent to which neighborhood composition can statistically account for the

Hindu-Muslim mortality gap, net of the religious identity of the respondent household. In the table,

observations are children (live births). We estimate regressions of the form


                                    Yijt = a1 Mijt + a2 M jt + fjt + f ( Xijt ) + eijt ,                                  (1)
  15 We cannot use the pre-constructed asset index included in the NFHS dataset because it is constructed including mea-

sures of sanitation. Therefore, following Filmer and Pritchett (2001), we construct a household’s asset rank by (1) partition-
ing the sample into 128 = 27 bins of indicators for ownership of seven assets listed in Table 1; (2) ranking the bins by the
average infant mortality rate in each bin; and (3) assigning each household the median rank within the sample of its bin.
Thus, the household of child 200,000 has more and better assets than 200,000 of the approximately 300,000 children in our
sample. Unlike a principal component index, this measure has units with a clear interpretation.




                                                              7
where i indexes live births, j indexes survey PSUs, and t indexes the three NFHS survey rounds.16

The dependent variable, Yijt , is an individual-level mortality indicator for infant or neonatal death,

as indicated in the column headers of Table 2. It is scaled so that coefficients reflect impacts on deaths

per thousand: Yijt is either 0 if a child survived to the specified age or 1,000 if she did not.17 The

regressor of interest is an indicator for whether the household in which the child lived is Muslim,

Mijt . In some specifications, we include controls for the fraction of the PSU that is Muslim M j , or PSU

fixed effects, fjt . Standard errors are clustered by PSU.

     The top panel includes no covariates Xijt beyond indicators for the survey round. The bottom

panel adds controls for a set of demographic and socio-economic characteristics that the literature on

the determinants of early-life health in India has highlighted.18 The first column in the table offers

another illustration of the widely-documented mortality puzzle. In Panel A, the Muslim coefficient

replicates the unconditional mean infant mortality difference discussed above. In the corresponding

column of Panel B, the addition of individual, household, and PSU-level variables has essentially no

net effect on the Muslim coefficient.

     To capture the possibility of neighborhood effects, we include PSU fixed effects in columns 2

and 6 of Table 2. These controls attenuate the own Muslim coefficient and render it statistically in-

significant. Contrary to the focus in the prior literature on the characteristics of Muslim respondents

themselves, these columns show that it is the places where Muslims are more likely to reside that is

most strongly associated with low infant mortality, and that this neighborhood effect is similar for

Hindu and Muslim households. The respondent household’s religious identity no longer predicts

its child’s survival. In the next two columns within each set of specifications (columns 3 and 7 in

Panels A and B), we control for just one PSU-level variable: the fraction of the PSU that is Muslim

(M j ). Doing so has nearly the same effect on the own-Muslim coefficient as including a neighborhood

fixed effect. Additionally controlling for indicators for all-Muslim and all-Hindu neighborhoods in

columns 4 and 8 replicates the same statistically insignificant point estimate for the coefficient on

own household Muslim as the specifications that are linear in M j . In all cases—infant and neona-
  16 Allspecifications include survey round fixed effects.
  17 Thisconstruction merely scales mortality rates and coefficients to match the standard of expressing rates per 1,000.
  18 These controls, labeled “extended controls” in Table 2, include a full set of birth order indicators interacted with sex

(Pande and Jayachandran, 2013); indicators for household ownership of each of the seven assets asked about throughout
survey rounds, the standard strategy for controlling for SES using these data (Filmer and Pritchett, 2001); an indicator for
whether the mother lives with her husband’s parents (Coffey, Khera and Spears, 2013); indicators for child’s birth month
(Doblhammer and Vaupel, 2001) and birth year; an urban indicator; household size; and several other individual and
PSU-level variables. See the Table 2 notes for the full control list.


                                                             8
tal mortality with and without extended controls—controlling for the religious composition of the

neighborhood removes the association between a household’s own religion and the child’s mortal-

ity. These results imply that what has been widely documented as a Muslim survival advantage is

actually an advantage accruing to the neighbors of Muslims.

      Figure 2 displays corresponding semi-parametric plots of infant mortality versus Muslim concen-

tration. Consistent with a negative coefficient on Muslim concentration in Table 2, the negative slope

in M j in the figure indicates that infant mortality is lower for both Hindus and Muslims in neigh-

borhoods with a greater proportion of Muslim neighbors. Also consistent with Table 2, the Muslim

mortality advantage, reflected in the vertical distance between the regression lines, is smaller (about

4 deaths per thousand) and statistically insignificant once one holds constant the religious composi-

tion of a household’s neighbors (Panel A). After additionally conditioning on own household latrine

use—a behavior that figures prominently in the analysis below—the point estimates converge even

more closely (Panel B).



3     Characteristics of Muslim Neighborhoods

The results in Table 2 raise an obvious question: What is different about neighborhoods where Mus-

lims are likely to reside that confers a mortality advantage to the (Hindu and Muslim) residents of

those places? In this section, we investigate how neighborhoods in this context vary with religious

composition. We show a striking pattern in which Muslim-dominated neighborhoods appear to be

worse in terms of characteristics that predict infant health along many observable dimensions—with

the singular exception of sanitation.


3.1    Better or Worse Places?

Hindus and Muslims are largely segregated by neighborhood in India, but a substantial minority of

neighborhoods are mixed. Figure 3 plots the histogram of Muslim share, M j , across PSUs, with the

point mass at zero (= 65%) excluded to maintain a readable scale. The histogram shows that between

the extremes of perfect segregation of the majority Hindu and minority Muslim populations, there is

substantial variation in M j . In particular, 31% of survey primary sampling units (PSUs) contain some

fraction of Muslim residents strictly between zero and one. These mixed neighborhoods are what

identify neighborhood religious composition effects separately from own religion in the regressions

of Table 2.

       To investigate how neighborhood-level characteristics covary with Muslim concentration, Fig-

ure 4 plots local polynomial regressions in which a set of ten variables capturing characteristics of

children, parents, and their neighborhoods that are likely to be relevant health inputs, outputs, and

correlates are regressed on M j . For ease of interpretation, we define each of the variables such that

its range is [0, 1] and higher values predict better child health outcomes.19 The dependent variables

include asset wealth (as the fraction of the seven assets reported in all survey rounds) and indicators

for household electrification, household piped water, institutional delivery of the child, any child

vaccinations, family possession of a national health card, mother having a say in child’s healthcare,

mothers’ literacy, and latrine use. In Panel A, we include all PSUs in the data. In Panel B, we restrict

the sample to the set of mixed-religion PSUs (0 < M j < 1).

       Other than latrine use, the characteristics in Figure 4 are generally flat or declining in M j , in-

dicating a mortality disadvantage of Muslim neighborhoods. The pattern is particularly clear and

approximately linear in Panel B of Figure 4, which excludes religiously homogenous PSUs. The bot-

tom panels of Figure 4 summarize this intuition by predicting infant mortality on the basis of the

neighborhood-level means of the variables examined in Panels A and B, other than latrine use. We

regress IMR on these variables, then apply the coefficient estimates to each PSU’s characteristics to

generate predictions.20 The predicted IMR (dashed line) is monotonically increasing in Muslim con-

centration, for both the full sample (Panel C) and for the subset of mixed-religion PSUs (Panel D). The

actual IMR (solid line) exhibits exactly the opposite pattern, decreasing in the proportion of Muslim

neighbors.

       For completeness, Appendix Table A1 reports the coefficients from the linear regressions corre-

sponding to the local polynomials plotted in Panel B of Figure 4. In Appendix Table A2, we confirm

the sign of the relationships between each of these characteristics and infant mortality by regress-

ing IMR on each of the dependent variables in Table A1. Together, Figure 4 and Tables A1 and A2

show that among variables likely to cause or to be correlated with child health outcomes, almost all

are either uncorrelated with M j or are changing in a way that would predict worse child health as
 19 We   confirm the sign of the relationships between these variables and mortality in Appendix Table A2.
 20 We   also normalize the constant in the regression so that the mean predicted IMR exactly replicates the mean observed
IMR.

Muslim concentration increases. In Section 5.3, we turn to an additional dataset, the India Human

Development Survey, to show that Muslim concentration is likewise uncorrelated with diet and hy-

giene behaviors that are not observable in our main dataset. The finding that Muslim-concentrated

neighborhoods are no better and possibly worse for infant survival along observables also accords

with observations about the relative disadvantage of India’s Muslim minority (Sachar et al., 2006;

Deolalikar, 2008).

      A clear exception to this pattern in which higher Muslim concentration predicts neutral or worse

PSU characteristics is latrine use, defined as one minus the indicator for open defecation.21 In neigh-

borhoods with close to zero Muslim residents, open defecation averages nearly 70%. This decreases

monotonically in Muslim concentration, with residents in all-Muslim neighborhoods facing local

open defecation rates below 40%. In aggregate, given the patterns of residential sorting, exposure to

local open defecation is higher for the typical Hindu child by a margin of 21 percentage points (Table

1, row 4). The relationship between M j and local open defecation (hereafter abbreviated OD) is pri-

marily driven by variation in religious composition interacting with stable differences across Hindu

and Muslim households in their probability of practicing open defecation. In Appendix Figure A1,

we show that, within the Hindu and Muslim subsamples, there is also a small gradient in which both

groups are more likely to safely dispose of feces as M j increases.22


3.2    Neighborhood Sanitation and IMR

In light of Figure 4, we examine the correlation between the sanitation differences across Hindu and

Muslim neighborhoods and the observed Hindu-Muslim mortality differences. To precisely control

for neighbors’ behavior separately from that of the respondent household, we calculate a neighbor

OD rate, ODij i , where the superscript           i indicates a leave-out mean, taken over all households in

PSU j other than the respondent household.

      In Figure 5, we plot local polynomial regressions of IMR on ODij i , separately for Hindus and

Muslims. These plots parallel those from Figure 2 in which Muslim share was the regressor of in-

terest, and ask whether the mortality association with sanitation follows the same pattern as the

mortality association with religious composition. Panel A displays the raw correlation and Panel B
   21 Urban/rural status and household size show some association, but not after controlling for own household character-

istics (own latrine use and own religion).
   22 This fact highlights the importance of controlling for the own household’s use of latrines or toilets in any analysis

examining the external effects of neighborhood-level sanitation.


                                                            11
controls for the household’s own latrine use.23 In both panels, the slope is similar across the two reli-

gious groups. At higher levels of ODij i in Panel A, point estimates suggest a possible Hindu-Muslim

difference conditional on ODij i , though that pattern is not robust and reverses in Panel B with the

addition of a control for own household OD.24

     In a series of supplemental tests in Table A3, we regress mortality outcomes on a Muslim indi-

cator, local Muslim share, and own and neighbors’ OD. The exercise is not intended to recover well

identified causal effects of open defecation.25 These “horserace” regressions address a more basic

question: Does the partial correlation between Muslim neighbors and own child mortality diminish

once one controls for the sanitation practices of neighbors? We find that it does. Consistent with

Figure 5, adding controls for own household and neighbors’ OD attenuates the coefficient on M j to a

magnitude that is economically small and statistically insignificant.

     The result that neighborhood open defecation is strongly correlated with IMR is a very robust

pattern.26 A natural question in this context is whether differences in son preference and intra-

household resource allocation between Hindus and Muslims could confound the results. To address

this possibility, in Panel A of Appendix Table A4 we examine the correlation between local OD and

IMR, splitting the sample by child’s sex. The table shows that the Hindu-Muslim gaps in infant

mortality are similar across boys and girls. More importantly, in both the boy and girl subsamples,

these gaps attenuate to insignificance once the measures of open defecation are included. We also

investigate whether the apparent relationship is confounded by the pattern documented in Pande

and Jayachandran (2013) in which sex ⇥ birth order interactions predict child health in India. The

behavior has the potential for importance here, because Hindu and Muslim household sizes in In-

dia differ, and therefore so do the mean birth orders across groups. Nonetheless, this phenomenon

does not explain the patterns here: All regressions in Panel B of Table 2 include the full set of sex

indicators interacted with birth order indicators as controls, and Panel B of Table A4 shows that the
  23 Throughout,    latrine use is used as a shorthand for latrine and toilet use, either of which can safely dispose of excreta.
  24 As  in all of the local polynomial regression plots, the 95% confidence intervals drawn in the figure are not corrected
for clustering and will overstate the statistical significance of Hindu-Muslim differences. We rely on Table A3 to assess the
statistical significance of the OD-IMR cross-sectional relationship and Hindu-Muslim differences in it.
  25 Further below, we estimate IV specifications to get a sense of magnitudes of the effect of ODij i on IMR under strong
identification assumptions that we make explicit.
  26 In Appendix Section A.2, we describe an alternative approach to statistically accounting for the mortality gaps. There,

we estimate counterfactual Hindu mortality rates after nonparametrically reweighting the sample of Hindu children to
match the joint distribution of characteristics in the Muslim child sample. Compared to the linear regressions above, this
exercise more flexibly controls for the entire distribution of open defecation exposure, matching the probability mass in 20
bins defining the sanitation environment: 10 bands of local (PSU) open defecation interacted with household’s own latrine
use indicator. Appendix Table A5 reports the results of the exercise, which are closely consistent with Tables 2 and A3.


                                                               12
pattern of our results holds whether restricting the sample to only first births or to only second or

later births. Because residence in an urban area was shown in Table 1 to differ significantly across

religious groups, in Panel C of Table A4 we replicate the regression separately for urban and rural

areas, allowing more flexibility in how urban status is held constant. The results within the urban

and rural subsamples are closely consistent with the overall patterns.


3.3    Heterogeneity in the Muslim Advantage

The facts above suggest that a channel operating behind the mortality advantage of Muslims may

consist of two pieces. First, compared to the typical Hindu infant, the typical Muslim infant lives

in a neighborhood where a larger share of her neighbors are Muslim. Second, Muslim neighbors are

much less likely to defecate in the open. Below in Section 5.1 we discuss the plausibility of a biological

mechanism linking neighbors’ OD to infant mortality via fecal pathogens. Here, we first examine

some basic statistical predictions of this interpretation that do not require a deep understanding of

the biological mechanism.

      First, we note that if the channel linking mortality and religious composition of neighborhoods

is indeed better sanitation, then in the subset of neighborhoods in which OD is rare, and the channel

is therefore closed off, Muslim neighbors should not predict lower mortality. Table 3 tests this idea,

dividing the sample of survey PSUs according to whether there is non-zero open defecation, and

re-running the mortality regressions from Table 2 within these partitions.27

      There is a clear pattern in the point estimates across this division: In places with zero reported

open defecation, Muslim identity has an insignificant and often positive association with morality. In

places where open defecation is present, Muslim identity has a significantly negative association with

morality. This general pattern holds whether one examines the correlation between own religion

and IMR (Panel A), neighbors’ religion and IMR (Panel B), or the partial correlations of own and

neighbors’ religion in the same regression (Panel C). It is striking that in places where the OD channel

cannot operate by construction of the subsample, Muslim own identity and Muslim neighbor identity
  27 This partitioning—and more generally relying on measures of open defecation based on household-level responses—

overstates the precision with which we can observe open defecation at the person level. This is because the type of
household-level reports recorded in the NFHS do not account for the possibility of discordant latrine use behaviors among
members of the same household. As we discuss in detail below in Section 4, there can be substantial within-household
differences in latrine use. Thus, even setting aside measurement error due to the PSU mean OD being calculated from a
small sample, there is error in this measurement. Person-level open defecation is rare in the PSUs in column 1 of Table 3,
but likely not a precise zero.



                                                           13
are actually correlated with higher IMR, in clear contrast to the national, aggregate relationship that

motivates this paper. The sign reversal is consistent with Figure 4, which shows that other than

latrine use, neighborhoods with many Muslims tend to be worse in terms of features that would

predict child health and human capital.

    An alternative test in a similar spirit asks whether the Muslim neighborhood mortality effects

are weaker in places where the “first stage” relationship between religious identity and sanitation

practice is weaker. India is a large, geographically diverse country of 1.2 billion people. We ex-

ploit spatial heterogeneity across the states of India in the degree to which religious identity predicts

revealed preference for open defecation. To do so, we divide the main survey data into 79 state-by-

survey round cells.28 For each cell, we calculate the means of IMR and OD separately for Hindus

and Muslims. This allows us to calculate a first stage relationship (E[OD |Hindu]                       E[OD |Muslim])

and a reduced form relationship (E[ I MR|Hindu]                   E[ I MR|Muslim]) separately within each cell. In

Panel A of Figure 6, we plot these statistics against each other. Each scatter point is a state-by-survey

round, and marker sizes are proportional to sample size. Most of the points lie in the right-hand

portion of the graph because in most places, the prevalence of OD among Hindus exceeds that of

Muslims, consistent with the national averages. But behind those national averages lies some hetero-

geneity, and Panel A shows that only in the places where there is a strong behavioral difference in

latrine use between Hindus and Muslims is there a strong association between religious identity and

infant mortality. A regression line fit to the data points (in red) passes through the origin, indicating

that in expectation, there is no relationship between religious identity and infant mortality in places

where Hindus and Muslims have similar sanitation practices.

    In Panel B of Figure 6, we retain the same horizontal axis, but on the vertical axis plot the strength

of the religion-IMR relationship, as revealed in a regression of infant mortality on a Muslim indica-

tor. This is the same regression that is reported in the first column of Table 3, but is here estimated

separately for each state-by-round cell. The vertical axis measures the t-statistics for the coefficients,

rather than the coefficients themselves, in order to reduce the visual noise associated with any large

but statistically insignificant estimates generated within the 79 cells of the partitioned sample. (Ap-

pendix Figure A2 plots the analogous graph using coefficients themselves.) Here again, the strength

and direction of the statistical relationship between religious identity and mortality is clearly related
 28 The   number of states increased from 25 to 29 across the years represented in the survey rounds.




                                                             14
to the strength and direction of the first stage relationship: In the many places where Hindus are more

likely to OD (right of the origin), Muslims, who tend to collocate near other Muslims, have an aggre-

gate mortality advantage. In the few places where Hindus are less likely to OD (left of the origin),

Muslims, who tend to collocate near other Muslims, have an aggregate mortality disadvantage.

     Taken together, Table 3 and Figures 6 and A2 support the idea that sanitation may be the channel

linking religious composition of neighborhoods to infant mortality. Where there is no OD, there

is no Muslim mortality advantage. And where there is non-zero OD, the strength of the Hindu-

Muslim difference in OD predicts the strength of the mortality advantage. This clearly suggests a

mechanism in which neighborhood religious composition is predictive of IMR via its association

with open defecation.



4    Hindu-Muslim Differences in Demand for Latrine Use

Given the observed association between the religious composition of neighborhoods and local sanita-

tion, in this section we draw on several data sources to better understand Hindu-Muslim differences

in attitudes and behaviors related to latrine/toilet use. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that open defe-

cation in this context is not merely a matter of latrine affordability or access, but rather involves clear

consumer preference heterogeneity.

     More than half of the Indian population, over 600 million people, defecates in the open. Mus-

lim Indians, though they are more likely to defecate in the open than the poor rural populations of

much of the world, are much less likely to do so than Hindu Indians. In our main dataset, only 32%

of Hindu children live in households that use latrines or toilets, compared to 57% of Muslim chil-

dren. This gross difference cannot be explained by affordability because Hindus are the richer group:

Appendix Figure A3 shows that conditional on any level of asset wealth, Hindus are more likely

to be exposed to open defecation and to defecate in the open themselves, compared to Muslims.29

Importantly, although exposure to open defecation declines in wealth, even Hindus and Muslims

in relatively wealthy households still practice OD at non-negligible rates and are still exposed to
   29 The figure also shows that this disparity holds conditioning instead on mother’s height—thus paralleling Figure 1,

which showed that Hindu IMR was higher at any level of asset wealth or mother’s height. The associations of sanita-
tion with asset wealth and mother’s height strikingly resemble the associations of infant mortality with asset wealth and
mother’s height. Linear regressions confirm that the gaps are statistically significant (p < .01) in both panels. In panels C
and D of Appendix Figure A3, we plot own, rather than PSU, OD on the vertical axes. The pattern is nearly identical, high-
lighting that even relatively wealthy Hindus (and to a lesser extent relatively wealthy Muslims) are still likely to practice
OD in this context. The richest Hindus by the asset wealth measure have OD rates in excess of 30%.

significantly high levels of open defecation by their neighbors.

     To investigate these patterns in more detail, we turn briefly in Table 4 to data from the Sanitation

Quality, Use, Access, & Trends (SQUAT) survey, which was collected in rural northern India in 2013

and 2014. Unlike our main analysis dataset (the NFHS) this survey was specifically designed to elicit

preferences over latrine use, as distinct from latrine ownership. The survey is also unique in having

a structure that permits reporting of different latrine use patterns by different members of the same

household. The survey is described in more detail in Coffey et al. (2014).30

     Table 4 summarizes responses at the individual and household levels, with Hindu means in col-

umn 1 and Muslim means in column 2. Consistent with other data sources, the first row of the table

shows that Hindus are significantly more likely than Muslims to practice OD—that is, they are less

likely to use a latrine or toilet. This difference in revealed preferences is deeply embedded: The sec-

ond row shows that a substantial minority of Hindus who reside in a household with a working

latrine nonetheless choose to defecate in the open. 26% of Hindus whose households own func-

tional latrines choose not to use them, compared to 10% of Muslims. These statistics mask some

within-household heterogeneity: Over 40% of households that had a working latrine had at least one

member who nevertheless defecated in the open.

     These statistics are especially useful in disentangling access to latrines from preferences over

latrine use. People from households that owned a latrine used by another household member un-

ambiguously had the option not to defecate in the open. These findings are consistent with accounts

from Indian commentators (e.g. Ramaswami, 2005) and evaluations by researchers (e.g. Barnard

et al., 2013) that toilets constructed or paid for by the government often remain unused or repur-

posed. We investigate further in Appendix Figure A4, where we compare latrine use behaviors at

the individual (rather than household) level and separately by ownership of a working latrine. The

figure shows that whether one examines all respondents, or just those residing in latrine-owning

households, Hindus are more likely to defecate in the open.

     To provide additional context to the fact that high socioeconomic status does not predict zero

open defecation in this setting, we draw on another nationally representative survey, the India Hu-
  30 See the Sanitation Quality, Use, Access, & Trends (SQUAT) Survey. The SQUAT survey was designed to be represen-

tative of rural open defecation practices in five states of north India: Bihar, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and
Uttar Pradesh. These states are home to 40% of the population of India, and to 45% of households in India without a toilet
or latrine. Surveyors interviewed 3,235 adults about their defecation practices and views on latrines and latrine use, and
collected individual level latrine use data for 22,787 household members.




                                                           16
man Development Survey, which has the advantage of being more recent than our main dataset

and of allowing additional measures of household socioeconomic status. (See Section 5.3 for a fuller

description of these data.) Among rural households in the 2012 IHDS in which the most highly-

educated adult member holds a bachelor’s degree or higher, 32% of households report practicing

open defecation. For rural households in which the most highly-educated adult completed sec-

ondary school, the statistic is 51%. This contrasts with neighboring Bangladesh (in its 2011 DHS

survey), where only 1% of rural households in which the most highly-educated adult completed any

schooling beyond secondary defecated in the open, and where only 4% of households with a member

who completed secondary school defecated in the open.

     The roots of these behavioral differences are difficult to trace and are beyond the scope of this

paper. Sanitation practices may have evolved differently across Muslim and Hindu communities

for purely secular reasons, and could have been privately or socially optimal given the context un-

der which they arose (Mobarak, Levinsohn and Guiteras, 2014). Even specific religious instruction

with respect to sanitation and hygiene that we observe today may have been established long ago—

codifying then-existing norms, rather than establishing those norms.31 Regardless of the historical

path, today religion is a highly predictive marker for group differences.

     While we take no position on whether religion causes OD per se, it is common for Indians to

discuss waste disposal choices with reference to religious purity. Row 4 of Table 4 shows that a

substantial fraction of both Hindu and Muslim respondents self-report that a religious leader has

told them explicitly where to defecate. The table shows that Hindus are more likely than Muslims to

respond that OD away from the home is pure, while using a latrine near the home is not pure. All

Hindu-Muslim differences in the table are statistically significant at the 5% level.

     The SQUAT data also allow us to observe plainly-stated beliefs about whether sanitation (latrine

use) confers a health benefit to children. Respondents were asked “Imagine two villages, one in

which everyone defecates in the open and one in which everyone uses a latrine. In which village do

you think children would be healthier?” The final row of Table 4 shows that 40% of Hindus reported

that open defecation was healthier, compared to 27% of Muslims. Hindus and Muslims gave statis-

tically identical answers to the other questions in this module, which asked whether children would
  31 The Laws of Manu, a Hindu sacred text, advises defecating away from the home (Chapter 4 verse 151): “Far from his
dwelling let him remove urine and excreta.” In contrast, the Mishkat-al-Masabiha, a Muslim sacred text, offers opposing
advice: “Muadh reported God’s messenger as saying, ‘Guard against the three things which produce cursing: relieving
one self in watering-places, in the middle of the road and in the shade.’ ”


                                                          17
be healthier in villages where people ate rice or wheat and whether children would be healthier in

villages where households used kerosene or dung as fuel.32

     The possibility that open defecation would ever be chosen if a working toilet or latrine were avail-

able may be surprising to many readers, but these patterns, and indeed the Hindu-Muslim behavior

difference itself, are well known to many residents of rural India. Coffey et al. (2017) documents this

fact in a qualitative study in rural northern India, recording, for example, how a Muslim woman

from Uttar Pradesh described the differences: “Even if Hindus have made a latrine, still they go out

to defecate in the open. Now for our people [Muslims], it’s not a problem. If we have a latrine in the

house, we will use it.”33,34

     In short, the pattern of especially poor sanitation in Hindu-concentrated neighborhoods is not

merely a matter of affordability of or access to latrines and toilets. Instead, many Indians (Muslim

and Hindu) report and reveal clear preferences against using latrines, and this clear preference for

open defecation is particularly strong among the Hindu majority.



5    Corroborating Evidence for the Open Defecation Channel

We next present a collage of evidence evaluating sanitation externalities as the possible channel link-

ing the religious composition of neighborhoods to infant mortality. We begin by briefly outlining the

biological mechanism, drawing on the prior literature. That discussion then guides several empirical

tests with respect to intermediate health outcomes where effects of poor sanitation should be de-

tectable, and which would not easily be explained by other phenomenon. We conclude with a series

of falsification tests.
  32 In this module of three questions, the order was: rice/wheat, followed by dung/kerosene, followed by OD/latrine.

Respondents could answer that one of the two options within each set was healthier for children in the village, or that
the two options had the same impact. Only the sanitation question showed a differential response pattern by religious
identity. The F-stats, are, in the same order, 0.5, 2.7, and 9.7. We also note that this question about the health perceptions
surrounding sanitation was asked before it was revealed that the survey was specifically focused on sanitation.
  33 Coffey et al. (2017) also reports how a Hindu man in Haryana described his beliefs about the health benefits of open

defecation: “[By defecating in the open] one can stretch the body, one can go out for a walk. You can also prevent yourself
from getting diseases. If a latrine is in the house, bad smells will come, germs will grow. Latrines in the house are like...hell.
The environment becomes completely polluted.”
  34 Moreover, this behavior has long been recognized and documented publicly: Cultural scholars attribute the modern

persistence of OD among Hindus in India to the persistence of the Hindu caste system, with its ritual avoidance of excreta
(Ramaswami, 2005; Bathran, 2011). Recently, Hindu politicians from both major political parties in India have echoed
this sentiment with the slogan: “Toilets are more important than [Hindu] Temples.” Union Rural Development Minister
Jairam Ramesh of the Congress party made the statement in October 2012. From the BJP, Gujarat Chief Minister and then-
candidate for Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an identical statement in October 2013. And nearly a century ago,
Gandhi campaigned to change Indian behavior with respect to excreta disposal, famously declaring, “Sanitation is more
important than independence.”


                                                               18
5.1    Biological Mechanism

Bacteria and parasites, such as intestinal worms, live in feces. Fecal matter in the local environment

gets onto feet and hands and into mouths directly. It can also contaminate food and water. These

pathogenic processes have been documented since at least the 19th century.35 By definition, open

defecation is not limited to a confined or designated area. Feces are disposed of in crop fields, near

homes, and in and along roads, implying widespread scope for disease transmission and potential

harm, regardless of whether an individual chooses to use a latrine himself.

      For children, infections caused by fecal pathogens can reduce net nutrition through caloric loss

to diarrhea and parasites, as well as by expending calories to combat infections. Acute malnutrition

due to infectious disease is well established in the epidemiological literature (Kielmann and McCord,

1978; Mosley and Chen, 1984) and recognized among economists (e.g. Cutler, Deaton and Lleras-

Muney, 2006). Epidemiological evidence also suggests that exposure to fecal pathogens could lead

to enteropathy—a chronic intestinal problem that prevents the proper absorption of calories and

micronutrients (Humphrey, 2009; Petri et al., 2008; Mondal et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2013). The resulting

acute malnutrition manifests as wasting (low weight) and can lead to death (Black, Morris and Bryce,

2003). It may also manifest as anemia as the body fails to absorb the nutrients necessary for red

blood cell production (Rosenberg and Bowman, 1982). We check this mechanism directly below by

examining the intermediate outcomes of blood hemoglobin, weight-for-height, and weight-for-age.

      For neonates (0-1 month old), the process is somewhat different but with the potential for similar

mortality effects. Maternal exposure to fecal pathogens could cause neonatal mortality by reducing

the quality of maternal net nutrition during gestation, in turn reducing uterine growth and birth

weight. This possibility is highlighted by the recent finding in Prendergast et al. (2014) of a correlation

between in-utero growth, growth hormones at birth, and mothers’ exposure to open defecation in

Zimbabwe.

      The public goods features of sanitation have been highlighted in the economics literature. Mo-

barak, Levinsohn and Guiteras (2014) investigated the determinants of latrine use in Bangladesh via

a field experiment, finding an important role for local complementarities. Other studies have ex-

amined health outcomes impacted by the public goods problems of sanitation, though these have

focused almost exclusively on worms, which comprise just one channel by which OD could affect
 35 See   Freedman, 1991 for examples.



                                                    19
health. In the Kenyan context, Miguel and Kremer (2004) studied the public goods problems asso-

ciated with intestinal worms transmitted by contact with fecal matter. In the historical US context,

Bleakley (2007) examined the impact of efforts by the Rockefeller Foundation at the turn of the cen-

tury to eradicate widespread hookworm infections in the US South. Taken together, the economic

literature supports the potential of important externalities of OD, while the epidemiological evidence

suggests that health impacts could be significant and include mortality effects.


5.2    Tests of the Fecal Pathogens Channel

Anemia/Hemoglobin. In Table 5 we examine a health outcome with a direct connection to the type

of intestinal disease spread by open defecation. Anemia, defined as low levels of blood hemoglobin,

can be caused by diets lacking iron, vitamin B12 and folic acid, all of which are necessary for the pro-

duction of red blood cells. Intestinal parasites also importantly contribute to low blood hemoglobin

in developing country settings, by causing blood loss in the stool, lack of appetite, increased motility

(including via diarrhea), and competition for nutrients. Intestinal parasites also cause damage to the

intestinal wall lining, which can inhibit the absorption of nutrients critical in red blood cell produc-

tion (Rosenberg and Bowman, 1982). The impacts of intestinal parasites on hemoglobin can be large

even relative to the impacts of diet or micronutrient supplementation. For example, in a random-

ized control trial among Kenyan children, Friis et al. (2003) found that a single dose of deworming

medicine was as effective in raising hemoglobin levels as the daily administration of micronutrient

supplements, including iron, for a period of eight months. In the economics literature, Bleakley (2007)

shows that a hookworm eradication campaign in the US South at the turn of the twentieth century

raised school attendance and later-life incomes, with reduced anemia as the assumed channel.36

      The dependent variable in the first four columns of Table 5 is the child’s blood hemoglobin, in

g/dL, measured from a surveyor-collected blood sample analyzed by a portable device in the field.

Mean hemoglobin in the sample is 10.3 g/dL, very near to the WHO threshold for moderate ane-

mia (< 10 g/dL). The analysis sample is significantly smaller than in the main analysis because

hemoglobin was measured only in the most recent NFHS survey round and because these measure-

ments were taken only for children alive at the time of the interview and between one and five years
  36 In Bleakley (2007), anemia was the assumed channel, though it was not possible in that study to directly observe blood

hemoglobin in the historical data. In a cross-country comparison of recent micro data in which hemoglobin was measured
in blood samples, Coffey, Geruso and Spears (2017) show that, at the country level, children’s hemoglobin and sanitation
are correlated, even after controlling for household-level diet data and national malaria incidence.


                                                            20
old. Table 5 shows that Muslim children are observed to have higher hemoglobin on average (col-

umn 1), but this relationship disappears after controlling for neighborhood fixed effects (column 2)

or the fraction of Muslims in the neighborhood (column 3). In column 4 the association between

neighborhood religious composition and blood hemoglobin becomes smaller and insignificant after

partialing-out the contribution of poor sanitation. This pattern precisely tracks the pattern of Tables

2 and A3.

    It is important to understand that the list of other potential causes of low hemoglobin here is very

limited. As discussed in Coffey, Geruso and Spears (2017), the literature points to just diet, malaria,

and the type of intestinal infections spread by poor sanitation as being plausible causes of anemia in

this context. And we are able to investigate diet directly, which we do below in Section 5.3, where

we show that conditional on own religion, own diet is uncorrelated with the religious composition

of neighborhoods.

    Acute Malnutrition. A related pathway from exposure to fecal pathogens to death is poor net

nutrition—that is, calories consumed net of calories lost to diarrheal disease and parasites and ex-

pended in combating infections. Acute malnutrition is a well-known mechanism linking infectious

disease to infant death (Kielmann and McCord, 1978; Mosley and Chen, 1984), our outcome of inter-

est. If open defecation is causing deaths via infection, acute malnutrition should also be observable in

weight. This intermediate outcome may also be of independent interest, because acute malnutrition

could impact the human capital accumulation of surviving children.

    We follow the standard practice (e.g. Schmidt et al., 2010) of using surveyor-measured weight

to capture acute malnutrition and recent diarrhea. Weight, rather than self-reported diarrheal dis-

ease, is recommended due to widely recognized problems in survey-reported diarrhea. We discuss

the problems with survey-reported diarrhea in this context in more detail in Appendix A.3, and pro-

vide statistics in our own dataset highlighting these issues. Weight-for-age is the particular measure

of recent diarrhea recommended by Schmidt et al. (2010). To evaluate robustness, we also examine

weight-for-height.37 We operationalize both measures as z-scores scaled to the World Health Organi-
zation’s child growth standards.

    Columns 5 through 12 in Table 5 repeat the exercise performed for hemoglobin, but now with

measures of child weight as the dependent variables. The sample includes all children up to 24
   37 Height is an appropriate denominator for normalizing weight when analyzing acute malnutrition because height re-

flects long-term, but not recent, net nutritional and disease experience.


                                                         21
months for whom a weight measurement was taken. Due to the DHS/NFHS surveying scheme,

these detailed anthropometry measures exist for only a small subset of our main analysis sample. In

the first three columns, the dependent variable is weight-for-age. We report OLS regressions.38 The

extended controls are identical to those in the bottom panel of Table 2 with an additional control for

height.39

     The results for weight follow the now-familiar pattern: In columns 5 and 9, an indicator for Mus-

lim households predicts significantly higher z-scores (i.e., heavier children). Then, additionally con-

trolling for Muslim concentration in the locality (M j ) or controlling for a PSU fixed effect attenuates

the coefficient on the Muslim indicator to insignificance. And finally, incrementally controlling for

the local sanitation environment attenuates the coefficient on M j as well. This pattern of results sup-

ports the mechanism outlined above, as it shows that the fraction of Muslim neighbors is correlated

with child malnutrition, but not after partialing out the association between religious composition of

the neighborhood or neighborhood open defecation.

     Breastfeeding Interactions. Water and prepared food are two key pathways through which poor

sanitation causes infections in children. Breastfeeding, which interrupts this pathway, is known to be

protective against the transmission of such infections, and previous studies have shown important

interactions in this context between the efficacy of breastfeeding and the quality of a household’s

water supply (see Jayachandran and Kuziemko, 2010). Here, we examine whether the efficacy of

breastfeeding is increasing in the fraction of neighbors who defecate in the open. Operationally, this

means examing interactions between breastfeeding and M j or OD j .

     Table 6 examines various combinations of interactions between religion, breastfeeding, and san-

itation in OLS regressions in which the dependent variable is IMR. The regressor of interest is an

indicator for exclusive breastfeeding during the infant’s first six months of life if she survived, or un-

til death if she died. Controls are as in Table 2. Column 1 reports results for a specification interacting

breastfeeding with the Muslim indicator. Unsurprisingly, the main effect of exclusive breastfeeding

is large and negative—i.e., breastfeeding is associated with reduced mortality. But the significant

positive coefficient estimate for the interaction term breastfed ⇥ Muslim indicates that breastfeeding is
  38 The sample here is smaller because weight in the NFHS is only consistently measured for children below age 3 at the

time of the survey, whereas in our main analysis, we calculate IMR over a larger sample by using the mother’s responses
to retrospective questions about the timing of births and deaths over a longer look back period.
  39 We control for height-for-age to ensure that results are not spuriously driven by chronic malnutrition, which would be

reflected in height. In practice, removing the height control does not affect the pattern of results in the table.



                                                            22
less beneficial to Muslim children than Hindu children, on average.

      This non-intuitive pattern again appears to be due to the correlation between own religious iden-

tity and that of neighbors and due to the association of both with sanitation. After additionally

controlling for M j or ODij i and the interaction of each with breastfeeding, the positive coefficient

on breastfed ⇥ Muslim becomes insignificant (column 3) or flips sign (column 6). Overall, comparing

columns 1 through 3, in which there are no controls for sanitation, with columns 5 through 7, in which

these controls are included, suggests that the associations of the breastfed ⇥ Muslim and breastfed ⇥

fraction Muslim with mortality are operating via open defecation: Living near more Hindus predicts

a greater protective effect of breastfeeding only until the correlation between religious composition

and sanitation is controlled for. These regressions indicate that Muslim children, on average, benefit

less from breastfeeding only because they tend to live in better local sanitation environments, while

Hindu children, on average, face environments where the protection conferred by breastfeeding mat-

ters more.40

      Appendix Table A6 shows that although the main effect of breastfeeding varies significantly as a

function of baseline IMR, the coefficient on the interaction of breastfeeding with PSU fraction Muslim

is remarkably similar across PSUs split by high versus low infant morality rates. Thus, these results

are not merely driven by a stronger effect of breastfeeding in locales where IMR is higher.


5.3    Falsification Tests

Panels A and B of Figure 4 showed that two child health outcomes that should not be driven by local

sanitation are indeed flat (institutional deliveries) or declining (vaccinations) in fraction Muslim, a

clear contrast with the overall IMR patterns revealed in Panels C and D of that figure, in which sur-

vival increases in fraction Muslim. In this section, we investigate whether the religious composition

of neighbors is correlated with other important observable health behaviors, inputs, and outcomes

that would not be expected to be importantly affected by open defecation. Although there is no

reason in principle that sanitation-related and and non-sanitation-related child inputs and outcomes

should not be positively correlated, the special institutional feature of our setting is that higher con-

centration of Muslims in a locality predicts better sanitation but otherwise predicts worse or neutral
  40 Like the main results in Table 2, estimates in Table 6 are identified off of the religion of neighbors, not the religion of the

child’s own household. Therefore, any unobserved differences in inputs like weaning foods between Hindu and Muslim
households would be captured by controls for Muslim and Muslim ⇥ breastfed.



                                                                23
neighborhood characteristics, allowing us to potentially separate which channel is operating.

     Diet. In Table 7 we ask whether Hindus living around many Muslims are likely to have different

diets than Hindus living around few Muslims. Because our main dataset, the NFHS, was not de-

signed to measure consumption and contains relatively little information on hygiene behaviors, we

turn again to the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) of 2012.41 Summary statistics for this

supplemental dataset are included in Appendix Table A7. For the set of variables common to both

the IHDS and NFHS, such as urban residence, open defecation, and access to piped water, Table A7

shows that the IHDS replicates the same Hindu-Muslim differences found in the NFHS, which are

displayed in Table 1.

     The dependent variables in Table 7 are listed in the column headers and include measures of

meat, eggs, and dairy consumption, measured per household per month. For each of these diet

variables, we first regress diet on own religion to demonstrate that the consumption data are rich

enough to capture differences across Muslim and Hindu households. For example, column 1 shows

that Muslims are a precisely estimated 15 percentage points more likely (on a base of 25 percentage

points) to consume meat compared to Hindus. Such differences are expected, and not problematic.

     We add (M j ) as a regressor in the second and third columns for each dependent variable. Panel

A shows that there is no correlation between M j and the extensive margin of eating any meat, or

between M j and the intensive margin of quantity of meat consumed. In Panel B, we examine two

other calorie- and protein-rich foods: eggs and milk. For all diet variables, the coefficients are small,

not significantly different from zero, and robust to the inclusion of controls.42 This is true even though

large, precisely estimated diet differences are apparent between Hindu and Muslim households for

each consumption outcome in the table.

     Table 7 is direct evidence against the notion that Hindus living around Muslims have systemat-

ically different diets than Hindus living around other Hindus, and similarly against the notion that

Muslims living around Hindus have systematically different diets than Muslims living around other

Muslims. Thus, there is no empirical evidence that our results are likely to be confounded by issues

related to diet, including our results regarding hemoglobin in Table 5.
  41 The IHDS contains richer hygiene information and a complete consumption module, but it cannot be used to construct

mortality rates that are similarly reliable to those from the NFHS. Specifically, we are limited by the fact that complete birth
histories were not recorded for all women of childbearing age.
  42 We control for log per capita per consumption and the urban classification of the household, which could be important

in principle because richer and urban households in India are more likely to eat meat.



                                                              24
     Other Hygiene and Water. Diet is likely to have primarily private benefits, but hygiene practices

like hand washing could generate externalities in principle. If these practices covary with Muslim

concentration across localities, then our estimates could be reflecting a different hygiene-related ex-

ternality associated with the religious composition of a neighborhood. In fact, Hindu and Muslim

households do not appear to differ with respect to these health behaviors. For example, the sum-

mary statistics from the IHDS data in Table A7 reveal that unlike OD (practiced by 51% of Hindus

and 31% of Muslims in the IHDS data), Hindu and Muslim households do not differ in hand washing

(72% vs. 70%) or purifying water (11% vs. 12%).

     In Table 8, we report on regressions in which the dependent variables are various measures of

hygiene and water quality from the IHDS. The regressor of interest is Muslim share, M j . In the first

eight columns the dependent variables are always washing hands, sometimes washing hands, al-

ways purifying water, and sometimes purifying water. In columns 9 and 10, the dependent variable

is piped public water to the home, for which a similar measure is available in the NFHS. For com-

pleteness, in columns 11 and 12, we replicate the Figure 4 regression of OD on M j using the IHDS

data. The last four columns are shaded, since these can be compared directly to results in the NFHS

dataset—although in a different time period.

     Columns 1 through 8 show that there is no correlation between measures of washing or water

purifying and M j . The only significant difference we find in the table—besides OD—is that Muslim

concentration is associated with less access to public piped water. This is consistent with our analysis

in the NFHS data presented above (see Figure 4 and Table A1). Both the literature (Jayachandran

and Kuziemko, 2010) and our own analysis (Table A2) indicate that lower access to piped water

in this region implies a Muslim disadvantage with respect to health. The difference in piped water

likely reflects the inferior access to state services faced by Muslims. It appears that the Hindu-Muslim

difference in latrine use, therefore, is not merely a marker for a wider array of other important hygiene

behaviors with public goods qualities.

     Cough and Fever. Although all types of infectious disease may respond to poor sanitation expo-

sure due to a weakened immune system,43 respiratory infections and fevers may be be less responsive
  43 As Cutler and Miller (2005) explain: “It is difficult to determine which infectious diseases should have responded to

clean water technologies, however. Hiram Mills, a member of the Massachusetts State Board of Health, and J. J. Reincke,
a health officer in Hamburg, Germany, independently observed a marked reduction in overall mortality, not just mortality
from waterborne diseases, on the introduction of water filtration more than a century ago. ... The biological mechanism un-
derpinning the so-called Mills-Reincke phenomenon would presumably be that contaminated water weakens the immune
system, making one more susceptible to other contagions.”


                                                            25
than symptoms specifically related to the gut. As a falsification test, we examine here whether fever

and cough respond to neighborhood religious composition differently than diarrhea, a symptom with

a more direct (and presumably quantitatively stronger) link to sanitation.

     As discussed above, our primary measure of recent diarrhea in children is based not on the

survey reports of mothers, but on current weight. This follows the recommendation from the medical

literature (Schmidt et al., 2010) of preferring surveyor-measured weight to capture recent diarrhea

even when self-reports of the symptom are available. Our own analysis in Table A8 suggests that a

mother’s education may significantly affect what she decides “counts” as diarrhea in her child. To

overcome differences in the perceptions of illness across mothers of different socioeconomic status,

we compare the relative reporting of three different types of symptoms by the same mother.

     The NFHS contains mothers’ subjective reports of three infectious disease symptoms: fever,

cough, and diarrhea. We estimate differences in the relative reporting of these symptoms within

a mother across localities that vary in Muslim concentration. In a stacked regression in which an

observation is a child ⇥ symptom, we regress an indicator for a positive report of the symptom on

mother ⇥ child fixed effects. Appendix Figure A5 plots residuals from that regression—separately

by symptom—against the religious composition of the PSU in which the child resides. The figure

shows that for the fever and cough symptoms, residuals are clearly increasing in fraction Muslim.

Diarrhea residuals, in contrast, are clearly decreasing in fraction Muslim. This means that mothers in

neighborhoods with higher Muslim shares are differentially less likely to report their child as having

recent diarrhea, relative to their reporting of recent fever and cough and relative to mothers in neigh-

borhoods with fewer Muslims. Appendix Section A.4 describes the exercise in more detail and also

reports on a parametric regression approach that yields the same pattern of results.44



6    Sizing the Externalities

In this section we attempt to understand the potential size of the sanitation externalities suggested by

the evidence above. To do so, we instrument for the local sanitation environment with the religious

composition variable, M j . This strategy would yield unbiased estimates of the externalities of interest

if PSU religious composition predicted own-household infant mortality only through its association
 44 The parametric version of this mother fixed effect regression in Table A12 yields a coefficient on diarrhea ⇥ fraction

Muslim that is significant at p < .09.



                                                           26
with nearby neighbors’ open defecation. In contrast, it is clear from Figure 4 that the neighborhoods

where Muslims are concentrated are somewhat different along several other observable dimensions.

Even though the evidence above points toward Muslim neighborhoods being, if anything, worse in

terms of observable correlates of child health (other than sanitation), we cannot rule out the possibil-

ity of important unobservables. We therefore view the IV analysis as informative primarily because

these regressions are identified off of a subset of the variation in open defecation that is carefully

documented above.

     We regress mortality outcomes on variables capturing a household’s own open defecation (ODijt )

and neighbors’ open defecation within the PSU (ODijti ):


                                           \
                                Yijt = b 1 ODijti + b 2 ODijt + b 3 Mijt + f ( Xijt ) + eijt .                             (2)


We instrument for the mean open defecation rate among neighbors with the fraction of PSU house-

holds that are Muslim:


                               ODijti = g1 M jt + g2 ODijt + g3 Mijt + f ( Xijt ) + µijt .                                 (3)


As above, i indexes live births, j indexes survey PSUs, and t indexes the three NFHS survey rounds.

The dependent variables are infant and neonatal mortality. Note that the indicator for the child

residing in a Muslim household, Mijt , absorbs any unobserved health behaviors or child investments

that could be correlated with a household’s own religion, such as differing Hindu and Muslim diets.

We restrict attention to the mixed-religion PSU sample, over which the relationship between between

M j and other PSU characteristics, including OD j , is monotonic and approximately linear, as shown

in Panel B of Figure 4. That plot visually depicts a non-parametric version of the first stage regression

for the case of no controls.45 Parametric first stage estimates are presented in Appendix Table A9,

with first stage F-statistics always exceeding weak instrument thresholds. We also estimate the first

stage separately within subsamples defined by child’s birth order, child’s sex, child’s own religion,
  45 Besides tracking the linearity of the first stage, restricting to mixed-religion PSUs confers the identification advantage

that only respondents who have settled or remained in mixed neighborhoods contribute to estimating our coefficients. This
could be important if the types of Hindus and Muslims who are willing to collocate with the other group are systematically
different from those who are not. Panel A of Figure 4 suggests that all-Muslim and all-Hindu neighborhoods may indeed
differ from mixed-religion neighborhoods, because the nonparametric plots jump at the endpoints (M = 0 and M = 1) for
many variables.




                                                              27
and the location of the household in a rural or urban setting in order to demonstrate that the first

stage relationship is not driven by an association with any of these variables. Table A9 shows that

the first stage effect is strong, precisely estimated, and consistent across subsamples.

     Table 9 presents the results of the IV analysis. Results for IMR are displayed in Panel A. Re-

sults for NMR are in Panel B. Columns 1 and 2 in each panel report OLS estimates for comparison.

Columns 3 through 7 report IV estimates with various control sets.46,47 Table 9 shows that instrument-

ing for ODij i with M j yields point estimates of about 50-60 infant deaths per thousand. To put the

size in context, the IV coefficient in column 7 implies that a 10 percentage point reduction in the frac-

tion of neighbors defecating in the open is associated with a decline in infant mortality of 6.1 children

out of 1000. For neonatal mortality (Panel B), the figure is 4.4 deaths per thousand. The magnitude of

the estimated externality is similar across specifications that vary the control set, suggesting that the

variation in open defecation that arises from the composition of neighbors is not strongly correlated

with any individual-level behaviors or characteristics that affect mortality.48

     These effects are economically large. In the context of our data, the difference between a locality

in which all of a household’s neighbors defecate in the open and a locality where none of them do is

associated with a larger reduction in child mortality than the difference between households at the

bottom and top quintiles of asset wealth (see Figure 1). To understand the economic importance of

our results, it is useful to consider external harm created by a single household defecating in the open.

Because about one in every ten Indian households has an infant born each year, the coefficient on

ODij i is approximately equal to the sum of harm (across all neighbors) imposed by a single household

that chooses open defecation, aggregated over 10 years.49

     The implied importance of open defecation for infant mortality in the modern Indian context is
  46 All   regressions include indicators for survey rounds. The extended controls are identical to those in Table 2.
  47 The coefficient on own household OD becomes insignificant and unstable in the IV. This accords with the fact that own

latrine use and neighbors’ latrine use are highly correlated, as Appendix Figure A1 shows.
  48 The   IV estimates may be larger than the OLS due to measurement error in the PSU-level variable ODij i , which is
calculated over only the survey-sampled households, and because, as reported in Table 4 from the supplementary SQUAT
data, even within a household there is variation in use of latrines that our main data cannot capture. Computations in the
spirit of regression calibration indicate that measurement error in local area open defecation could plausibly account for the
IV coefficients being approximately twice as large as our OLS coefficients, in large part because own household Muslim,
own open defecation, and survey round are correlated with the “signal” in true PSU open defecation.
  49 Consider the simple case in which all households contain one infant. Because the contribution of any household to the

regressor OD i is weighted by its share in the PSU, the harm caused by one household defecating in the open on any other
single household is N1 1 · b, where N is the number of households in the PSU and b is the coefficient on OD i . The total
external harm summed across the other N 1 households is then N 1 · N1 1 · b = b. In practice, about one in every 10
Indian households has an infant born each year, so that the total harm equals b over a 10-year window.



                                                               28
consistent with evidence by Cutler and Miller (2005) and Watson (2006) on the role of clean water

and sanitation in explaining large shares of declining infant mortality in the history of the US.50

Cutler and Miller (2005) show that the introduction of clean water technologies in US cities beginning

around 1900 reduced the infant mortality rate by 87 deaths per thousand, or 46 percent of the base

of 189 per thousand. To put our findings in perspective, naively applying our IV estimates (Table

9, column 7), would predict that cutting open defecation in half from 66% to 33% would reduce

infant mortality by 20 deaths per thousand in India (=                     0.33 ⇥ 61.4). This would be a 28 percent

reduction in the baseline Indian infant mortality rate of 72 deaths per thousand during our sample

period.51 Our estimates are also consistent with the most credible data on cause of death during

early-life in India: Using a census of all Indian deaths occurring from 2001 to 2003, Million Death

Study Collaborators (2010) show that 22% of non-neonatal child deaths (deaths from 1-59 months) in

India are due to diarrhea, which is just one of the potential pathways by which intestinal worms and

bacterial infections that are transmitted via open defecation could affect infant mortality.52

     Although ours is the first paper to provide even suggestive evidence of mortality externalities

associated with open defecation, recent work exploring other human capital impacts of open defeca-

tion has found effects with similarly large magnitudes. Gertler et al. (2015) perform a meta-analysis

of open defecation-height experiments, and estimate a reduction of 0.046 height-for-age standard de-

viations from a 10 percentage point reduction in open defecation. To compare the size of these height

effects to our mortality estimates, one can scale the estimates using the correlation between IMR and

height across Indian villages. In the NFHS, Indian villages with one more IMR point (.0010) have

children that are 0.0034 normalized height-for-age standard deviations shorter. Using this conver-
   50 Watson (2006), studying sanitation programs in the United States in the 1960s, where infant mortality was lower and the

therefore marginal effects would be expected to be smaller compared to India, finds that “sanitation interventions explain
almost forty percent of the convergence in Native American and White infant mortality rates in reservation counties since
1970.” Galiani, Gertler and Schargrodsky (2005) studying water privatization in Argentina, found a decline in all-cause
child mortality by 8%, with effects reaching as high as 26% in the poorest places, which are likely to be better comparisons
to India with respect to poverty. Given that interventions like water privatization could have such large effects on mortality,
it is unsurprising to find similarly large effects of open defecation. Among other plausible channels, open defecation is
likely to contaminate drinking water.
   51 This calculation sets aside all complications of predictions out-of-sample, such as the potential for reinforcing or coun-

tervailing behavioral responses to such a dramatic shift in the local environment. The denominator 72 is the weighted
average IMR of Hindus and Muslims from row 1 of Table 1.)
   52 As we discuss in Footnote 43, there is a plausible pathway from poor sanitation to all infectious disease, not merely

diarrhea. In addition, Million Death Study Collaborators (2010) show that an even larger fraction (33%) of neonatal deaths
(deaths from 0-1 months) are attributable to low birthweight. As we discuss in Section 5.1, there is clear epidemiological
evidence that exposure to fecal pathogens reduces the body’s net absorption of nutrients. In mothers, poorer net nutri-
tion would have direct impacts on child’s birthweight. Prendergast et al. (2014) find suggestive evidence on birthweight
specifically, showing a correlation between in-utero growth and mothers’ exposure to open defecation in Zimbabwe.



                                                              29
sion factor to roughly translate between outcomes, our estimate of a .0061 mortality improvement

for a 10 percentage point decline open defecation (Table 9, col 4) would be consistent with a 0.021

height-for-age effect. This effect size translated from our mortality estimates is roughly half of the

Gertler et al. (2015) experimental effect sizes, implying our estimates, though economically large, are

smaller by this metric.

     To examine the robustness of our IV results to more flexibly controlling for potential confounders,

we re-estimate the IV regressions over different partitions of our analysis sample. Dividing the sam-

ple into various partitions pushes the limit of what the data is powered to detect, but in Appendix

Table A10, we estimate the IV regression separately for Muslim and Hindu children (in each case

continuing to instrument with the religious composition of all neighbors). The additional flexibility

and smaller sample reduces statistical precision. The point estimate in the Muslim subsample is less

than half the size of corresponding point estimate in the Hindu subsample, though not statistically

different from the Hindu effect or from zero. Similarly, Table A10 shows that within subsamples of

only girls or boys, only first-borns or later-borns, and only urban or rural PSUs, the IV results are

never statistically different and are often quantitatively similar.53

     Finally, we note that individuals who are willing to live in more diverse neighborhoods could be

systematically different from those who are not. However, any “cosmopolitan” advantage in health

could not even in principle spuriously generate our results. This is because the instrument here does

not measure the religious diversity of a PSU, it measures the share that is Muslim, which has an

asymmetric relationship to religious diversity for Hindus and Muslims. For example, because most

Hindus collocate with other Hindus and most Muslims collocate with other Muslims, for the typical

Muslim, an increase in M j implies a less religiously diverse neighborhood. In contrast, for the typical

Hindu, an increase in M j implies a more religiously diverse neighborhood. This predicted asymmetry

stands in contrast to the symmetry of the effects we estimate in Appendix Table A10, where we split

the sample by own religion and find positive effects for both groups.54
   53 It would be interesting to evaluate whether there was any interaction between own household latrine use and that of

neighbors. A priori, it is unclear whether an interaction should exist: The disposal of feces in this context is distributed
along roads, in fields, and near homes—that is, it is not relegated to areas trafficked only by those who do not use latrines.
This implies that the effect of neighbors’ open defecation may be invariant to own household latrine use. Our estimation
strategy, which focuses on neighbor effects, does not allow us identify the interaction term, as doing so would require a
second instrument (for own open defecation, ODi ).
   54 This is contrary to the diversity hypothesis, which would predict effects working in opposite directions for the two

subsamples. Such a hypothesis would imply that, counter to our findings, Muslims living in a neighborhood with a 50
percent Muslim share would experience lower infant mortality than Muslims living in a neighborhood with a 100 percent
Muslim share.


                                                             30
     To show that unobservables associated with willingness to live in a diverse or cosmopolitan

neighborhood are not driving our results, in Appendix Table A11 we replicate our main IV analysis

from Table 9, but include an additional control for diversity, defined as the fraction of neighbors who

are religiously dissimilar from the respondent household. This religious dissimilarity variable moves

in opposite directions for Hindu and Muslim households as M j increases. The regressions show that

coefficients on religious dissimilarity in IMR and NNM regressions are small and indistinguishable

from zero, and that the effects of interest are almost numerically identical to the specifications in Table

9.



7    Conclusion

As of 2014, more than a billion people worldwide continue to defecate in the open, without the use

of even basic latrines. While governments and others have invested heavily in reducing the practice

in recent years, there has been disproportionately little evidence of the impact of open defecation on

mortality. We view our study as informing ongoing policy efforts to reduce open defecation around

the world, as well as contributing to the economic literature concerned with the impacts of infectious

disease on health and human capital.

     The pattern we document solves an existing puzzle in the literature—that in India, Muslim chil-

dren suffer lower rates of mortality than Hindu children, despite being poorer on average. We show

that this operates via the tendency of Muslims to reside near other Muslims, but that both Hindus

and Muslims appear to gain advantage from Muslim neighbors. Investigating channels, we observe

that Indian Muslims, despite being more likely to defecate in the open than Muslims in neighboring

Pakistan or Bangladesh, practice open defecation at significantly lower rates than Indian Hindus, im-

plying that the neighbors of Muslims are on average exposed to better sanitation environments in this

context. Tests of the mechanisms linking open defecation to infant death, including contamination of

food and water and acute malnutrition due to intestinal disease, lend support to this interpretation.

     More broadly, our study provides insights into the public goods aspect of sanitation. Under-

standing this public goods component is important for policy interventions motivated by the effi-

ciency concern that private demand is below the social optimum. The clear stated and revealed

preferences towards open defecation reported in Section 4 suggest that the gap between individual

perceptions regarding latrine use and the objective external harms of open defecation are signifi-

                                                    31
cant. Practically, our results suggest that many infants die each year due to poor sanitation in their

localities. In the context of India, a back-of-the-envelope calculation within the range of variation

supported by the data suggests that reducing mean open defecation by 10 percentage points (one

quarter of a standard deviation across localities) would reduce IMR by 6 deaths per thousand, or

about 8% of the mean mortality rate. With an estimated 26 million children born in India each year,

this equates to 156,000 deaths annually. The sheer size of these potential effects highlights the need

for further investigation into the externalities of sanitation in the modern developing world.

Note: Figure shows the histogram of Muslim concentration across primary sampling units (PSUs) in the NFHS
survey. Observations are PSUs. Most PSUs are perfectly segregated along religious lines, with either 0% or 100%
Muslim shares. The point mass representing 100% Hindu, which comprises about two thirds of all PSUs, is not
drawn to scale.

 Note: Figure plots local regressions. The dependent variables in Panels A and B are household-level characteristics,
 and the regressor is Muslim concentration in the PSU (M j ). Each dependent variable is defined such that higher val-
 ues predict better infant health outcomes. The signs of the relationships between these variables and infant mortality
 are confirmed in Appendix Table A2. The dependent variables include asset wealth (as the fraction of the seven as-
 sets reported in all survey rounds) and indicators for household electrification, household piped water, institutional
 delivery of the child, any child vaccinations, family possession of a national health card, mother having a say in
 child’s healthcare, mothers’ literacy, and latrine use. Panel A includes all PSUs in the sample. Panel B includes only
 mixed-religion PSUs (0 < M < 1). Observations are live births. In Panels C and D, we plot actual and predicted
 IMR versus fraction Muslim in the full and mixed-PSU samples. Predicted values in C and D are generated via a
 regression of IMR on the neighborhood-level means of the variables examined in Panels A and B, other than latrine
 use.

Note: Figure plots local regressions of infant mortality on the fraction of the neighborhood that defecates in the
open. The dependent variable is an indicator for death in the first year of life ⇥ 1000. Neighborhoods are defined as
survey PSUs. Panel A plots the raw relationship, separately for Hindus and Muslims. Panel B plots residuals after
conditioning on own open defecation. Observations are live births in mixed-religion PSUs (0 < M < 1). Thinner
lines in the figure correspond to 95% confidence intervals that are not adjusted for clustering. Table A3 reports
standard errors that account for clustering.

 Note: Figure shows how heterogeneity in the “first stage” relationship between religious identity and open defe-
 cation is reflected in the reduced-form relationship between religious identity and IMR. Scatter points are Indian
 states ⇥ survey rounds, with marker sizes proportional to sample sizes. Panel A plots the Hindu-Muslim mean IMR
 difference versus the Hindu-Muslim mean difference in OD for each state ⇥ round. Panel B plots the t-statistic on
 an indicator for Muslim in an individual-level regression in which the dependent variable is IMR. That regression
 follows the specification in Panel A, column 1 of Table 2 but is estimated separately for each state ⇥ round cell. OLS
 regressions fit to the scatterpoints are displayed in red in each panel, along with 95% confidence intervals.

Note: Table displays summary statistics for our main analysis sample, rounds 1, 2, and 3 of the NFHS. Neonatal and
infant mortality are defined, respectively, as the number of deaths among children less than one month old and less
than one year old, scaled per 1,000 live births. Observations are children (live births).

Note: Table reports results from OLS regressions. The dependent variable in columns 1 through 4 is infant mortality
(year 1). The dependent variable in columns 5 through 8 is neonatal mortality (month 1). Mortality variables are scaled
as described in the text to generate coefficients that indicate impacts on rates ⇥ 1000 (deaths per 1000 children). All
regressions include survey round fixed effects. Columns 4 and 8 control both for the Muslim share of the PSU and for
indicators for all-Muslim and all-Hindu neighborhoods. Extended controls in the bottom panel include a full set of
birth order indicators interacted with sex, indicators for household ownership of each of the seven assets asked about
throughout NFHS survey rounds, an indicator for piped water, an indicator for whether the mother lives with her
husband’s parents, indicators for child’s birth month and birth year, an indicator for the child being a multiple birth, an
urban indicator, household size, mother’s education in years, and an indicator for mother’s literacy, as well as PSU-level
means of household assets, household electricity, household piped water, whether births occurred in an institution,
whether mothers had birth assistance, whether children were ever vaccinated, household possession of a health card, and
father’s education in years. See the text for additional details. Observations are children (live births). Standard errors are
clustered at the PSU level. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.

Note: Table reports results from OLS regressions run over subsamples of the NFHS data. Columns divide the sample
into partitions according to the mean of household-level open defecation in the PSU, either zero or greater than zero.
The sample consists of mixed-religion PSUs (0 < M < 1). Household-level observations of open defecation reported
in the NFHS do not account for the discordant latrine use behaviors among household members. The dependent
variable in columns 1 and 2 is infant mortality (year 1), and in columns 3 and 4 is neonatal mortality (month 1).
Survey round FEs are included in all specifications. See Table 2 for additional notes. Observations are children (live
births). Standard errors are clustered at the PSU level. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.

Note: Table reports means and standard errors of survey responses from the Sanitation Quality, Use, Access, &
Trends (SQUAT) Survey, 2013-2014. Responses are stratified by religious group. The table contains information on
22,787 individuals in 3,235 sampled rural households in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. The
unit of observation differs across rows and includes either all persons in the household, whether interviewed or told
about; the household itself; or the survey respondent (one per household). Standard errors of the means, clustered
by village, are shown in parentheses. All across-group comparisons are statistically significant at the 5% level.

     Note: Table reports results from OLS regressions. The dependent variables are indicated at the column header and are either blood hemoglobin
     in g/dL, or weight-for-age or weight-for-height scaled as WHO z-scores. Hemoglobin levels are affected by intestinal parasites. Current weight
     is an outcome reflecting acute malnutrition, and is recommended in the medical literature as the preferred measure for recent bouts of diarrhea.
     PSU mean OD is calculated over all households in the PSU other than the respondent household. Controls are as described in the Table 2 notes.
     Observations are children (live births). Due to the DHS/NFHS surveying scheme, the hemoglobin and anthropometry measurements exist for only
     a small subset of our main analysis sample. The sample in columns 1 through 4 includes all observations for which hemoglobin was collected in
     the NFHS data. The sample in columns 5 through 12 includes all children up to 24 months for whom a weight measurement was taken. Standard
     errors are clustered at the PSU level. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.

Note: Table reports results from OLS regressions. The dependent variable is IMR, scaled as described in the text
to generate coefficients that indicate impacts on rates ⇥ 1000 (deaths per 1000 children). The breastfed indicator is
equal to one if the infant was exclusively breastfed during the first six months of life if she survived, or until death if
she died. PSU mean OD is calculated over all households in the PSU other than the respondent household. Controls
are as described in the Table 2 notes. All regressions include survey round fixed effects. Observations are children
(live births). Standard errors are clustered at the PSU level. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.

A.1   Sample Sizes Needed to Experimentally Identify Infant Mortality Externalities
In footnote 1 in the introduction, we noted that the number of neighborhood clusters required to
detect even economically large infant mortality effects of open defecation (OD) via a field experiment
is large, both because of the plausible effect size relative to the variance in mortality and because
measuring local externalities necessarily implies randomization at the level of the locality, not the
individual. We also noted that it can be difficult to generate a first stage effect on latrine use via
experimental interventions. In this section, we illustrate these issues.
     We begin with a standard power calculation to determine the number of localities (clusters) re-
quired to detect an external effect of OD on IMR. Assume we wish to detect a minimum effect size of
3.5 infant deaths per thousand, which is 5% of mean IMR and a little larger than our OLS estimate of
2.7 to 2.9 deaths averted per 10 percentage point reduction in local open defecation. The calculation
results in 8,622 clusters, based on a simple two-sided test.
     With the NFHS data, we can alternatively perform a more detailed calculation for the required
sample size and cluster count via Monte Carlo simulation. Unlike the standard power calculation,
this method naturally incorporates any heterogeneity in infant mortality that is present across clus-
ters. For the simulation, we again assume that the true effect of a 10 percentage point reduction in
local OD is equal to 5 percent of mean infant mortality, or 3.5 deaths per thousand. To implement
the Monte Carlo simulation, we iterate over the following procedure, varying the number of sample
clusters (Nc ) included. We use PSUs from the NFHS data described in Section 2 as our clusters.

   1. Randomly select, with replacement, Nc clusters to include in the simulation.

   2. Randomly assign half the included clusters to treatment and half to control.

   3. Randomly identify 5 percent of infants in treated clusters and replace their infant mortality
      with zero, thus leaving observations for live children unchanged. This changes the mean IMR
      in each treatment cluster by 5 percent of the mean on average.

   4. Regress infant mortality on a treatment indicator, clustering standard errors.

     In practice, we vary Nc from 2,000 to 10,500 clusters in increments of 100, with 50 iterations at each
value of Nc . Appendix Figure A6 plots the relationship between sample size and power delivered
by the simulation. The horizontal axis shows the cluster count, and the vertical axis measures the
fraction of simulations resulting in a significant treatment effect at the 5% level. The graph reveals
that between 9,000 and 10,000 clusters are needed to achieve power = .80. This closely aligns with
the analytical derivation of the required sample size of 8,622 clusters.
     Note that these power calculations will somewhat understate the required sample size because
they do not account for the fact that within a cluster, externalities can only be measured on the subset
of households that were not assigned the latrine treatment. Here, we have used the size of the whole
cluster to simulate the externality, whereas the correct experiment would measure the externality
within only the “leave-out” households in treatment clusters.
     Calculating costs requires making additional assumptions about the efficacy of a hypothetical
latrine intervention, on which very little data exists. For illustration, we note that Barnard et al. (2013)
provides evidence on this question by examining a small number of Indian villages where latrines
were built under the central government’s Total Sanitation Campaign in the late 2000s. Barnard et al.
(2013) shows that among individuals owning a latrine following the implementation of the program
in their village, less than half were using the latrines.

     To calculate a lower-bound estimate of the cost of an experiment that detected the mortality ex-
ternalities of a latrine intervention, consider an intervention that converts non-latrine users to latrine
users at a success rate of 50% by constructing a latrine and providing some information about its ben-
efits and use at a cost of $500 USD per household.55 With approximately 9,000 clusters and average
cluster sizes of 200 households, this implies 40 interventions in each of the 4,500 treatment localities
in order to generate the 10 percentage point first stage effect on latrine use. The cost of implementing
the treatment alone (leaving out surveying and other costs) would equal $90 million.

A.2    Details of Non-Parametric Decomposition
As an alternative approach to statistically explaining the mortality gaps, we estimate counterfactual
Hindu mortality rates after non-parametrically reweighting the sample of Hindu children to match
the characteristics of Muslim children. Compared to the linear regressions in Section 2, this non-
parametric approach has the advantage of more flexibly allowing correlation between open defeca-
tion and other controls.
    Following DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996), we first reweight the Hindu sample according
to a partition based on variables other than open defecation and report counterfactual outcomes.
We then reweight according to a finer partition that interacts groupings of these variables with our
sanitation variable. Here, sanitation (exposure to open defecation) is defined flexibly as an interaction
between own and neighbors’ latrine use. In particular, we divide both samples into 20 bins b of
exposure to open defecation: 10 bands of local (PSU) open defecation interacted with household
open defecation. Other variables are binned as follows: 3 survey rounds, 2 urban statuses, 8 bins of
asset ownership, 3 terciles of household size, and 4 quartiles of birth order.56 For each reweight on
some combination these of characteristics, we follow three steps:

   1. Within each sample s 2 {Hindu, Muslim} and each bin b, compute wbs , the fraction of sample s
      in bin b, using survey design weights.

   2. For each observation in the Hindu sample, create new counterfactual weights by multiplying
                                                                          wbMuslim
       the observation’s survey sampling weight by the ratio              wbHindu
                                                                                     for the bin b of which it is a mem-
       ber.

   3. Compute a counterfactual mean Hindu mortality rate under the Muslim distribution of char-
      acteristics using these new weights.

    Table A5 reports counterfactual Hindu infant mortality rates with the new weights. The first
row displays the unweighted difference in means and the reweight on the marginal distribution of
open defecation alone. The rest of the table explores the explanatory power of local open defecation
when added sequentially after reweighting with respect to other factors. Row 1 shows that match-
ing on open defecation alone completely accounts for, and even reverses, the direction of the gap.
Sanitation non-parametrically accounting for 108 percent of the IMR gap is consistent with the fact
that Hindu children come from richer families, on average, and would therefore be expected to have
lower mortality. In the remaining rows, reweighting on various sets of covariates that do not include
OD continues to generate a large mortality gap. Then, adding sanitation to the set of reweighting
variables has a large incremental effect and explains the entire gap in most cases. The single case in
  55 The $500 figure follows Duflo et al. (2015) who report an approximate construction cost of $440 per latrine plus annual

maintenance.
  56 The requirement in any reweighting exercise to create joint distributions that include full support in both subsamples

limits the number of dimensions over which we can jointly reweight in a fixed sample size. See Geruso (2012) for a fuller
discussion of this limitation.

which it fails to do so is the specification that includes a count of joint household assets, but does not
control for the fact that Muslims live in larger households.

A.3   Problems with Survey-Reported Diarrhea
The NFHS contains information on mothers’ reports of diarrhea in their children. This type of survey
measure is likely to contain significant biases that may be correlated with our regressors of interest.
For example, because the reporting of diarrhea depends on whether the reporting mother recognizes
a loose stool as diarrhea, differences in reporting across children is correlated with the education level
of their mothers. Appendix Table A8 illustrates this fact, regressing reported diarrhea on mother’s
education, where the omitted category is no education. The table also includes regressions where
weight-for-age is the dependent variable. The table shows that reported diarrhea is only weakly
correlated with education, even though children of higher educated mothers tend to show fewer
measurable symptoms of the problem: Point estimates indicate that mothers with some education
are weakly more likely to report diarrhea than those with no education (columns 1 and 2). This is
despite the fact that weight moves in the predicted pattern, increasing with education. Columns 3
and 4 show that the weight of children is strongly correlated with mother’s education.
     We also note that in the NFHS data, the reported incidence of diarrhea fluctuates significantly
across survey rounds: In our sample it is 11% in the 1992/1993 round, up to 19% in the 1998/1999
round, and then back down to 11% in the 2005/2006 round. This non-monotonicity over time stands
in stark contrast to the wide evidence from elsewhere, including the Census of India, that infant
mortality—which is largely accounted for by diarrheal disease (Million Death Study Collaborators,
2010)—was steadily declining in India over this time period. For these reasons, we focus our analysis
on surveyor-measured weight-for-age, following the standard practice (Schmidt et al., 2011). For
more detail on the problems with survey-reported diarrhea, see Schmidt et al. (2011).

A.4   Cough, Fever, and Diarrhea
In Section 5.3 we describe an exercise that examines whether fever and cough respond to neighbor-
hood religious composition differently than diarrhea. We attempt to address differences across moth-
ers of different socioeconomic status in the subjective reporting of symptoms by comparing relative
reporting of the three types of symptoms conditional on a mother ⇥ child fixed effect. We reshape
the data to “stack” three observations per child, one for each symptom: fever, cough, and diarrhea.
The dependent variable is an indicator for whether the mother reported that the child was recently ill
with that symptom. We regress an indicator for a positive report of the symptom on mother ⇥ child
fixed effects.

                     Ill recentlyijt = a + qijt + g1 coughijt + g2 diarrheaijt
                                   + y1 coughijt ⇥ M jt + y2 diarrheaijt ⇥ M jt + eijt .                (4)

where aijt are mother ⇥ child FEs. Note that the main effect of M jt is absorbed by aijt . The variables
feverijt and feverijt ⇥ M jt are the excluded categories. In this regression, coughijt and diarrheaijt take
on values of one if the observation corresponds to that symptom type, regardless of whether the
mother reported the symptom as present (Ill recentlyijt = 1) or absent (Ill recentlyijt = 0). Table
A12 reports the coefficients, which show that relative to fever, diarrhea is more strongly negatively
associated with fraction Muslim. Cough, in contrast, is not.
    Appendix Figure A5 reports on a non-parametric version of this exercise, plotting residuals from
a regression of symptom indicators on mother ⇥ child fixed effects, separately by symptom, against

                 Ill recentlyijt = aijt + g1 feverijt + g2 coughijt + g3 diarrheaijt + eijt .   (5)

  Note: Figure shows how heterogeneity in the first stage relationship between religious identity and open defecation
  is reflected in the reduced-form second stage relationship between religious identity and IMR. Scatter points are
  Indian states ⇥ survey rounds, with marker size proportional to sample size. The vertical axis measures the Muslim
  coefficient in an individual-level regression in which the dependent variable is IMR, estimated separately in each
  state ⇥ round. A linear regression is displayed in red, along with 95% confidence intervals. See Figure 6.

Note: Figure plots local linear regressions in which the dependent variable is person-specific open defecation. The
sample in the left panels includes all household members for whom a response was recorded. The sample in the right
panels includes only respondents in households that own a latrine, illustrating the preference for open defecation
even when latrines are clearly available. The rows, respectively, condition on age and a life satisfaction “ladder”
question (0 to 10, 10 being the most satisfied). The dataset used to construct these plots is the SQUAT survey. Obser-
vations are individuals. See Table 4 for additional data notes.

  Note: Figure plots local regressions of symptom residuals on M j . Residuals are generated from a stacked regression
  in which an observation is a child ⇥ symptom, for each of three symptoms: fever, cough, and diarrhea. An indicator
  for a positive report of the symptom is regressed on mother ⇥ child fixed effects and on indicators for each of the
  three symptom types. Residuals are plotted separately by symptom. See Appendix A.4 for additional details.

  Note: Figure plots statistical power against the number of clusters for a hypothetical experiment that generates infant
  mortality reductions equal to 5 percent of the mean infant mortality rate via a cluster-level externality. Observations
  are generated by sampling NFHS survey data, following a Monte Carlo procedure described in Appendix A.1. The
  line in the figure is a local polynomial regression of the simulation result on the cluster count.

  Note: Table reports results from OLS regressions in which the dependent variable is a characteristic of a household,
  parent, or child, and the single regressor is the fraction of the PSU in which the child resides that is Muslim (M).
  The sample is limited to mixed religion PSUs (0 < M < 1). Observations are children (live births), and sample size
  varies across regressions because some survey questions were asked to only subsets of respondents. Standard errors
  are clustered at the PSU level. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.

  Note: Table reports results from OLS regressions in which the dependent variable is IMR. Each column reports a
  separate regression of IMR on a single regressor, which is listed in the column header. Mortality variables are scaled
  as described in the text to generate coefficients that indicate impacts on rates ⇥ 1000 (deaths per 1000 children). The
  sample is limited to mixed religion PSUs (0 < M < 1) to correspond to Table A1. Observations are children (live
  births), and sample size varies across regressions because of the design of the DHS questionnaire, which asked some
  questions to only subsets of respondents. Standard errors are clustered at the PSU level. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.

  Note: Table presents a nonparametric decomposition of the extent to which sanitation differences can account for
  infant mortality differences between Hindus and Muslims. Xs in the left of the table indicate the characteristics
  over which the reweight of the joint distribution is performed. Column 1 presents counterfactual mortality rates
  for Hindu children (⇥1000), using the empirical Hindu distribution of exposure to OD and the Muslim distribution
  of other characteristics. Column 3 presents counterfactual mortality rates for Hindu children after matching the
  Muslim joint distribution of exposure to OD and the indicated characteristics. The distribution of open defecation
  is defined over 20 bins of exposure: 10 bands of local (PSU) open defecation interacted with household open
  defecation. Other characteristics are binned as follows: 3 survey rounds, 2 urban statuses, 8 bins of asset ownership,
  3 terciles of household size, and 4 quartiles of birth order. The final row matches the distribution of characteristics
  across 11,520 (=20⇥3⇥2⇥8⇥3⇥4) cells.

  Note: Table reports results from OLS regressions. The dependent variable is IMR, scaled as described in the text
  to generate coefficients that indicate impacts on rates ⇥ 1000 (deaths per 1000 children). The breastfed indicator is
  equal to one if the infant was exclusively breastfed during the first six months of life if she survived, or until death
  if she died. PSU mean OD is calculated over all households in the PSU other than the respondent household. The
  sample is split across the columns according to PSU-level mean IMR above or below the median. Controls are as
  described in the Table 2 notes. All regressions include survey round fixed effects. Observations are children (live
  births). Standard errors are clustered at the PSU level. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.

  aThe sample sizes for the wash and water variables are slightly smaller than for the rest of the table because these
  were observed in the female questionnaire, rather than the main household questionnaire. These sample sizes are
  32,254 and 4,550 for Hindus and Muslims, respectively.

  Note: Table reports results from OLS regressions. In Columns 1 and 2, the dependent variable is the respondent’s
  report of diarrhea in the child. In Columns 3 and 4, the dependent variable is the surveyor-measured weight
  and height, converted to a weight-for-height z-score according to the World Health Organization child growth
  standard. Some education corresponds to some primary education. High education corresponds to greater than
  primary education. The omitted category is no education. Extended controls are as described in the Table 2 notes.
  All regressions control for survey round fixed effects. Observations are children (live births). Standard errors are
  clustered at the PSU level. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.

  Note: Table reports results from OLS regressions in which the dependent variable is the mean of neighbors’ open
  defecation in the PSU (ODij i ). The regressor of interest is the fraction of the PSU that is Muslim (M). Column 1 reports
  results from the full sample. Columns 2 and 3 and Columns 4 and 5 estimate the identical OLS regression for each
  of the subsamples defined in the panel headers. All regressions control for own religion and own OD. Regressions
  in columns 4 and 6 include the extended controls as described in the Table 2 notes. All regressions include only the
  mixed-religion PSU sample over which the IV is defined (0 < M < 1). All regressions include survey round fixed
  effects. Observations are children (live births). Standard errors are clustered at the PSU level. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.

  Note: Table reports results from IV regressions of mortality on neighbors’ open defecation in the PSU (ODij i ).
  Mortality variables are scaled as described in the text to generate coefficients that indicate impacts on rates ⇥ 1000
  (deaths per 1000 children). Column 1 reports results from the full sample IV regression in column 7 of Table 9 for
  comparison. Columns 2 and 3 estimate the identical IV regression over each of the subsamples defined in the panel
  headers. All regressions include only the mixed-religion PSU sample over which the IV is defined (0 < M < 1). All
  regressions control for survey round fixed effects, own religion, own OD and the extended controls as described
  in the Table 2 notes, except for the single variable on which the sample is split in each panel (sex, birth order, etc.).
  Observations are children (live births). Standard errors are clustered at the PSU level. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
