                                      ABSTRACT




      The feeling   is widespread that the financial strength of U.S. corporations

has   eroded over the past twenty years. This trend is often blamed on some
combination of the tax system, inflation and overly optimistic assessments of

business risk.

      This paper examines recent corporate financing developments from a

long—run perspective.      It is concluded that these developments appear less

dangerous when viewed in the context of the twentieth century as a whole than

when viewed in the context of the post—World War II years. A second major

conclusion is that powerful corrective mechanIsms are at work to keep

corporate financial positions from becoming too risky. These forces have been

particularly noticeable over the past ten years,           Third, the effects on

business financing of the tax system, inflation and business risk are

difficult to trace in the aggregate data, and these effects may be less

straightforward than has commonly been thought. Finally, it is argued that

the degree of economic instability and the relative level of federal

government borrowing will be key determinants of future corporate financing

patterns.

              HAVE U.S. CORPORATIONS GROWN FINANCIALLy WEAK?



      The feeling   is widespread that the financial strength of U.S. corporations

 has eroded over the past twenty years.1 The apparent increase in debt financing,

 especially short—term and floating rate debt, has alarmed many observers.

 Declining liquidity ratios and heavy reliance on external funds have also caused

 concern. These trends are typically blamed on some combination of three factors:

 the tax system, which is said to favor debt over equity financing; inflation,

which causes internal funds to lag behind total needs and which is alleged to

make debt cheap; and overly optimistic assessments of business risk.

      This paper examines corporate financing developments of the past two decades

from a long—run perspective. Recent years' trends are compared with those for

the twentieth century as a whole in an attempt to shed some light on the follow-

ing questions: Is it true that corporations have increasingly relied on external

funds of all kinds, especially debt? Are the trends of recent years unusual in

light of prior years? What causes long—run patterns in corporate finance? Rave

U.S. corporations indeed become financially weak?

     Section 1 of the paper uses a variety of data sources to determine what

financing trends have actually occurred over the twentieth century. Special

emphasis is placed on the problem of accurate measurement during
                                                                   inflationary
periods. Section II examines the ability of taxes, inflation and perceived

business risk to explain these financing trends. The impact of federal government

borrowing on the financing decisions of the business sector is also considered.

Section III summarizes the paper's findings and attempts to identify the key

determinants of future developments in corporate financing.

          I.    Corporate Financing Trends, 1900—1983

                A. Debt Ratios

                       Perhaps the most commonly—used measure of financial condition is

                some form of debt ratio, computed with ordinary accounting data. For

                the U.S. corporate sector as a whole, such data are available from the

                Internal Revenue Service Statistics of Income for the years 1926—81 and from

                this data the ratio of long—term debt to total capitalization is graphed in

(FIG. 1        Figure 1.    It is easy to see from this figure why there is a widespread
HERE)
               feeling not only that corporate debt usage has increased steadily in the

               years since World War II but that it has reached historical peaks in

               recent years.2 Perhaps less widely appreciated is the apparent fact that

               the rise in debt ratios ceased in the early 1970s. One might conclude

               from Figure 1 that U.S. corporations were increasingly willing to take

               on financial risk in the postwar years but that debt ratios have remained

               stable at a new higher plateau for roughly the past decade.

                       However, the accounting data on which Figure 1 is based are subject

               to several potential biases and should be interpreted with caution.

               Liberalization of depreciation allowances, as has occurred at several

               points from the 1960s onward, increases corporate cash flow but reduces

               measured profits and retained earnings. Thus debt ratios will tend to

               be overstated when allowed depreciation is increased. Inflation also

               causes distortions in accounting data. Reported asset values may be

               understated in an inflation, resulting in overstated debt ratios. Likewise,

               standard accounting data do not reflect decreases in the real value of debt

               and   reported   debt ratios may thus exaggerate the real burden of corporate

               liabilities. On the other hand, accountin data have not traditionally

          included such off—balance sheet items as lease obligations and unfunded

          pension liabilities, so reported debt ratios may also contain some under-

          statements.3

(FIG. 2            Figure 2 tracks the movement of two alternative debt ratio calculations
 HERE)
          that attempt to correct for some of the biases in standard accounting data.

          The first of these is an estimated ratio of the market value of debt to the

          market value of total capitalization of U.S. nonfinancial corporations.

          The underlying data are taken from Holland and Myers (1979), who estimated

          market values for debt and equity by capitalizing total corporate interest

          and dividend payments at current market yields. The market value ratio

          should    adjust for inflation—induced valuation changes and thus provide a
          more accurate measure of the burden of corporate debt. The primary disad-
          vantages of   this measure are that it is subject to estimation error, and

          it   does not allow separation of actual corporate financing decisions from
          changes   in market   valuation.
                 As shown in Figure 2, the market value debt ratio is more volatile

          than the book value ratio. It does, however, exhibit somewhat the same

          general pattern. Corporate debt ratios were relatively high in the l930s

          and early l940s but they declined markedly by the end of World War II.

          There then appears to have been an upward trend in the postwar period,

          although the market value data suggest that much of the upward movement

          took place in the late l960s and early l970s, Finally, this rise in the

          debt ratio leveled off in the mid—1970s, with declines occurring in the

          most recent years.

                 The second ratio graphed in Figure 2 is an estimated ratio of the

          market value of debt to the replacement value of assets for U.S. nonfinancial

          corporations. Like the market value data, the replacement value estimates

          are aimed at eliminating inflationary distortions. Another advantage of

          this measure is that by combining Goldsmithetal's(l963) estimates for

          the early years with more recent estimates by von Furstenberg (1977), it

          is possible to put together a long series of comparable ratios.

                Again, the replacement value ratios exhibit a broad pattern that is

          similar in many respects to that of the book value ratios: corporate debt

          usage apparently fell to a low point at the end of World War II and

          subsequently rose. However, the replacement value data suggest that the

          steadiest increases were over by the inid—l960s, with a more cyclical

          pattern ensuing since then. An especially interesting feature of the

          replacement value data is their implication that corporate debt usage was

          quite high early in the century. By these estimates, the corporate debt

          ratio was unusually low at the end of World War II, and it has only recently

          attained the levels that were normal in the period 1900—1930.

                Considered as a group, all three debt ratio measures suggest that the

          end of World War II may be a quite misleading reference point from which

          to judge recent corporate financing trends. It seems undeniable that

          corporate debt usage has risen in the postwar period, but it is far from

          clear that current debt levels are unusually high when viewed fiom a long—

          run perspective.

          B. Liquidity Ratios

                Liquidity ratios are a second type of balance sheet ratio frequently

          used to measure financial condition. The ratios of liquid assets to total

          assets and to short—term liabilities for U.S. nonfinancial corporations

          are shown in Table 1 for selected years. Total assets are measured at

   1Liquid assets consist of currency, deposits and marketable securities

   other than corporate stock. Total assets are measured at replacement

   value. Data for 1900—1945 are from Goldsmith et al. (1963) and for

   1953—1975 from Goldsmith (1982).

   profit taxes payable and trade debt. Data for 1900—1945 are from

          replacement value, while short—term liabilities are measured at book value.

                 As worried observers have noted, there indeed appears to have been a

          substantial decline in corporate liquidity during the postwar period.

          However, as with the debt ratios, 1945 was a year of unusually low financial

          risk for corporations. Not only were their debt ratios at historic lows

          by the end of the war, but they held large amounts of U.S. government

          securities as well. If we subtracted liquid asset holdings from total

          debt, we would see that corporations were effectively in a position of

          negative leverage at that time.

                 From a longer—run perspective, recent ratios of liquid assets to

          total assets do not seem alarmingly low. Their levels are roughly

          commensurate with those of the 1900—1930 period. It does appear, though, that

          the most recent ratio of liquid assets to short—term liabilities is somewhat

          low, even by historical standards. This suggests that short—term debt has

          risen in relative terms at the same time that liquid assets have been

          declining. Whether or not this trend is cause for concern will be

          C.   Flows of Funds

                 A different approach to assessing corporations' financial condition

          is to examine flows of funds over selected periods. While the balance

          sheet measures the cumulative effect of all prior flows as of a particular

          moment, the flow data reflect corporations' actual financing decisions

(FIG. 3   during specified periods. In Figure 3, for example, the yearly flows of

          sources of funds for U.S. nonfinancial corporations, are graphed for the

          period 1946—1983. Data are taken from the Federal Reserve's Flow of

          Funds Accounts.

                 These data do give one indication of financial duress for the

         corporate sector in recent years that was not readily apparent in the

         balance sheet data: the volatility of funds flow composition has increased

         tremendously since the early 1970s. The availability of internal funds

         relative to total financing needs has alternately plunged and soared.

         Simultaneously, debt usage has reached unusually high levels when internal

         funds were short and unusually low levels when internal funds weie plentiful.

         Once again it should be noted, though, that one's reference point is

         important to any conclusions about volatility, it could possibly be argued

         that the period from the late l950s to the late '60s was one of unusual

         stability and that recent fluctuations are more akin to those experienced

         in the immediate postwar years.

                 An accurate picture of long—term trends is more likely to emerge if

(TLE 2   we smooth Out some of these yearly fluctuations. The same funds flow ratios

         are thus shown for five—year periods in Table 2. The use of longer periods

         also allows the Flow of Funds data to be supplemented by Goldsmith's (1958)

         estimates of funds flow composition for selected periods between 1900 and

         1945.

                 Several trends are apparent in Table 2. First, debt has accounted

         for a consistently larger fraction of total financing since the inid—1960s

         than was the case for nearly all prior periods. Even with recent declines

         from the 1969—73 peak, debt financing appears to be quite high. Second,

         the rise in debt financing has not been caused by an increase in long—term

debt, which, if anything, may exhibit some downtrend. Rather, it is short—

term liabilities that have increased markedly. Third, the increase in

short—term debt cannot be predominantly attributed to the growth of such

spontaneous liabilities as tax accruals and trade debt. Much of it has come

from credit market instruments, such as bank loans and commercial paper.4

Fourth, stock issues fell precipitously as a source of funds during World

War II and have remained low ever since. Finally, it is difficult to

discern any long—run trend in internal funds.

      At least in part, then, any trend toward increased debt—equity

ratios could be characterized as a substitution of short—term debt for

external equity. Such a characterization offers some support for the fears

of those observers who argue that U.S. corporations have dramatically

increased their exposure to financial risk.

      However, this interpretation of the data is subject to qualification.

As it does with the balance sheet ratios, inflation may distort the

financing picture reflected in the Flow of Funds data. In particular,

von Furstenberg and Malkiel (1977) have argued that annual funds flows

should be adjusted for any changes in firms' real indebtedness during the

year that are caused by changes in the price level.

      Suppose, for example, that the real interest rate is 4 percent, If

expected inflation suddenly increases from zero to 8 percent, lenders will

demand a nominal interest rate of roughly 12 percent in order to provide

themselves a 4 percent real return. If the inflationary process is neutral,

one would expect these nominal adjustments to take place, leaving the real

pattern of corporate profits, investment and financing undisturbed.
                                         —8--



                 Note, however, that in this example a neutral inflation will increase

           corporations' operating cash flows by 8 percent, while their nominal interest

           payments rise by 200 percent. As conventionally reported, corporate internal

           funds will not rise as fast as the inflation rate. If the flow of debt

           financing remains constant in real terms, this necessarily implies that

           nominal debt financing will rise relative to nominal internal funds.

                 The inflation premium in nominal interest payments is more appropriately

           treated as a return of the lender's real principal, which just compensates

           for the decline in real value of the nominal principal. As a return of

           principal, however, this amount should not be deducted from corporate profits

           but rather treated as any other net retirement of debt, By this argument,

           we should therefore add to reported internal funds any decline in the real

           value of outstanding debt, since it is not in the true sense a current

           expense. The same amount should also be subtracted from reported debt issues.

           Since it represents a retirement of real principal, only new debt issues over

           and above this amount represent net increases in real debt.

                 The data in Table 2 were therefore adjusted for changes in real in-

           debtedness, following the procedure outlined in von Furstenberg and Malkiel

           (1977). The revised relative proportions of gross internal funds and total

           debt are shown in Table 3, alongside the corresponding unadjusted figures.
(TABLE 3
 HERE)
                 The adjusted figures give the impression that recent debt proportions

           are by no means unusually high. Even after adjusting for inflation, however,

           the proportions of debt financing in the late 1960s and early l970s were

           unusually high and the past eight years have witnessed a substantial

           correction. Much of this correction has occurred through heavy reliance on

           adjusted internal sources. Instead of financing funds needs with increasing

           or even constant proportions of real debt, corporations have in effect been

           retiring some of their maturing real debt principal, with internal funds.

           D. Dividend Payout Ratios

                 The assertion that corporations have placed heavy emphasis on internal

           funds in recent years naturally raises the question of whether they have

           sacrificed dividend payments in order to do so. Three measures of corporate

(TABLE 4   dividend payout over selected periods are presented in Table 4.
 HERE)
                 The ratios in columns 1 and 2 measure dividend payments relative to

           total. available internal funds. Both the adjusted and unadjusted internal

           funds measures from Table 3 have been used in computing these ratios. The

           data suggest that corporations did indeed cut their dividend payout some-

           what, even before the peak in debt issuance, in an attempt to increase the

           share of equity financing.

                 The more traditional measure of payout, dividends divided by net profit

           after taxes, is shown in Column 3. These figures also convey the impression

           that dividends were cut fairly severely in order to conserve internal funds,

           beginning as early as the midl96Os. Some of the decline in payout in the

           mid—1960s may be attributable to the well—known tendency of dividends to

           lag behind profits. However, subsequent periods were not particuarly

           profitable ones for U.S. corporations, so this does not explain away the

           long period of relatively low payouts from 1964 to the present. The decline

           in payout during the 1974—78 period is particularly dramatic.

           E. Summary of Financing Trends

                Does the weight of the evidence support the view that U.S. corporations

           have become increasingly prone to financial weakness? In most respects, I

           believe the most plausible answer is no. Many assertions of corporate

           balance sheet deterioration use the end of World War II as their reference

     point, but as we have seen, that was hardly a typical time. Viewed from

     a longer—run perspective, current corporate debt usage does not appear

     dangerously high nor does liquidity appear dangerously low.5 In addition,

     adjustment for inflationary distortions over the past fifteen years removes

     some of the trend toward increased debt that appears in the raw data. Finally,

     it should be recognized that corporations have made substantial efforts

     over the past eight years, particularly through reduced dividend payout,

     to rebuild financial strength.

           Nevertheless, some opposing points must be conceded. The financial

     environment of the past ten to fifteen years has been more volatile, as is

     reflected in the sharp changes in the composition of funds sources.

     Corporate treasurers have had to act more nimbly and imaginatively in order

     to keep up with the fluctuations in external funds needs. Increased use

     of short—term and floating rate debt has undeniably made corporations more

     vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations. And even if some of corporate

     borrowing in recent years is a rolling over of real principal instead of

    net new debt, it is still true that these roliovers necessitate more

    frequent visits to the capital market.

II. What Causes the Trends in Corporate Financing?

          Regardless of our perception of financial strength or weakness, we

    could feel more comfortable with our understanding of these corporate

    financing developments if we knew their primary determinants. This in

    turn necessitates a theory of corporate capital structure.

          It is widely believed that corporations adjust their financing to

    some target balance sheet composition. As Myers (1984) has argued,
                                    —11—


 the adjustment process may be quite slow, and thus there may be a good

deal of slippage between actual and target balance sheets. For example,

 subject to their established dividend policies, firms may have a decided

preference for internal over external funds, and, to the extent that ex-

ternal funds are needed, for debt over stock issues. Thus when internal

funds are plentiful relative to investment needs, debt ratios will fall

below target, while the reverse will occur when internal funds are in

short supply.

     Despite this slippage, the influence of the target financing compo-

sition will be felt over the long run. Corporations do reach points

where they feel their debt capacity is exhausted and they must turn to

external equity. Moreover, the standards for debt capacity and the

willingness to issue equity appear to change over time. From Table 2,

the reluctance to issue equity was apparently much less in the 1900—1940

period than it has been in recent decades.

     The primary determinants of these changing standards that have been

emphasized by business financing observers are perceptions of business

risk, the level of corporate and personal taxes and inflation. In the

paragraphs that follow we will explore the extent to which changes in

these underlying factors correspond to business financing patterns. The

possible influence of federal government borrowing on business financing

will also be considered.

     A. Business Risk

     Since the threat of bankruptcy entails both explicit and implicit

costs, firms will limit their debt ratios in order to avoid it. For any

given debt level, the threat of bankruptcy is greater as the degree of
                                         —12—

           business risk increases. Thus we would expect an inverse relationship

           between corporate debt ratios and perceived business risk.

                Unfortunately, perceived business risk Is notoriously difficult to

          measure. A possible proxy for investors' risk perceptions in a given year

          is the standard deviation of monthly percentage stock price changes for

          that year. Estimates of these standard deviations, derived from Standard

(FIG. 4   and Poor's Composite Index for the years 1900— 1980 are shown in Figure 4,
 HERE)
          plotted against the pattern of replacement value debt ratios.

               Movements in stock price volatility are dominated by the tremendous

          fluctuations of the Depression era. Figure 4 thus offers some support

          for the argument made by many observers: Corporate debt ratios plunged

          in the wake of the huge increases in business risk during the Great

          Depression and then began a long and steady climb, as business risk con-

          sistently remained at lower levels in the postwar years.

               However, the ability of this proxy for business risk to explain

          the shorter swings in corporate debt ratios is not very great. One might

          argue that the increased volatility around 1980 is associated with the

          reductions in debt financing that are apparent in the Flow of Funds data in

          Tables 2 and 36 But the sharp changes in the debt ratio between 1900 and

          1922 do not correspond to changes in volatility, and it is similarly dif-

          ficult to match up most financing swings since 1960 with stock price

          fluctuations. Overall, the evidence that perceived business risk con-

          tinually and consistently affects corporate financing patterns is limited.

          B. Corporate and Personal Taxes

               It is commonly held that the tax deductibility of interest favors

          debt over equity financing. From an investor's standpoint, however,

           fraction of the returns to equity are taxed at lower capital gains

           rates. The degree to which the tax advantage of debt at the corporate

           level outweighs its disadvantage at the investor level thus depends on

           the relative magnitudes of corporate and personal tax rates.

               There is, of course, a whole spectrum of personal tax rates, and what

          is really needed is some idea of the distribution of investor wealth

          across tax brackets. Inthe absence of such information, a cruder

          measure, which I label the "debt incentive tax ratio" has been con-

          structed as a proxy for the net tax advantage of corporate debt. It is

          essentially a comparison between statutory corporate tax rates and the

          lowest level of statutory personal rates.] This debt incentive tax ratio

(FIG. 5   has been graphed in Figure 5 against the replacement value debt ratio.
 HERE)
               Figure 5 indicates that the biggest increase in the net tax ad-

          vantage to corporate debt occurred between the late 1930s and early l950s.

          The fact that this tax advantage has remained at a relatively high level for

          the past forty years is undoubtedly related to the postwar increases in

          corporate debt. This tax advantage has been nearly constant for some time,

          though, so it cannot explain short—run fluctuations in the debt—equity mix.

          It is also something of a puzzle that debt financing proportions were high

          early in the century when there was no tax advantage and then fell after

          the tax code was introduced.

               While there is little evidence of a close correspondence between

          movements in tax rates and corporate debt ratios, it is possible that some of

          the effect of tax considerations has been felt in more subtle ways. One

          could argue on the basis of Table 4 that corporations have cut their dividend

          payouts somewhat in the wake of personal tax increases occurring in the l940s

           and have thus substituted internal for external equity. In addition,

           tax considerations have clearly influenced the design of securities,

          apart from their relative proportions. This can be seen through such

          recent innovations as original—issue discount bonds, adjustable rate

          preferred stock and the short—lived adjustable rate convertible note.

          C. Inflation

                 Inflation is a third factor that is often thought to affect corporate

          financing proportions. One argument is that inflation enables corporations

          to repay their debt with cheaper dollars, but it is hard to understand why

          investors would not try to protect themselves through higher interest rates.

          A more sophisticated argument revolves around the fact that as it causes

          interest rates to rise, inflation increases the effective real tax deductions

          associated with debt. The inflation premium in interest rates is, of course,

          also taxable to investors, but as long as the corporate tax rate exceeds

          the personal rate of the marginal bondholder, inflation may cause the net

          tax advantage of corporate debt to increase.

(FIG. 6          In Figure 6, annual inflation rates, as measured by percentage changes
HERE)
          in   the GNP deflator, are graphed against replacement value debt ratios.

          Although debt ratios have been relatively high in the inflationary years

          of the 1970s, it would be difficult to argue on the basis of Figure 6

          that there has been a close positive relationship between the movements in

          inflation rates and debt ratios.

                Again, as with tax considerations, some of inflation's effects may

          manifest themselves in more subtle ways. To see one such effect, consider

          the role of corporations in the financial system: Corporations perform an

          intermediary role, purchasing and managing productive assets and, in effect,

          repackaging these assets for investors in the form of debt and equity claims.

           Purely financial intermediaries may perform further repackaging.

           Through term lending, for example, commercial banks transform long—

           term business debt into shorter—term deposits,

                Now consider the effects of high and variable inflation rates on

           investors' demand for securities. If investors prefer short—term, or

          at least variable rate securities in such an environment, and if commercial

          banks no longer find maturity intermediation a viable activity, nonfinancial

          corporations will have to perform this function themselves. That is, they

          will repackage more of their assets in the form of short—term and floating

          rate debt instruments. Thus inflation, and in particular uncertain in-

          flation, may affect not so much the debt—equity mix, but rather the kinds of

          debt instruments corporations must issue to satisfy the needs of investors.

          D. Federal Government Borrowin

               Corporate financing behavior should also be influenced by the be-

          havior of other sectors in the financial system. For example, the supply

          of federal government debt will condition investors' willingness to absorb

          the relatively low—risk fixed claims represented by corporate debt. While

          not often cited as a determinant of the corporate financing mix, government

          borrowing may thus exert an important influence on the financing activities

          of the corporate sector as a whole.8

(FIG. 7        Evidence in support of such a relationship is presented in Figure 7,
 HERE)
          in which the ratio of federal government debt to that of all domestic non-

          financial sectors is graphed against the replacement value debt ratio for

          corporations. There appears to be a strong inverse relationship between the

          two series. In the early part of the century, when government debt was

          small, corporations satisfied investors' demands for safe, fixed claims

by issuing large proportions of their own   debt.   Then, as federal borrow—

ing swelled during the Depression years and World War II, corporate debt

proportions fell drastically.

     The inverse relationship is even more striking if we recall from

Table 4 that corporations held large proportions of government securities in

1945. Not only was the amount of government debt curtailing corporate

debt proportions, but, in effect, corporations were repackaging some portion

of that government debt in the form of corporate equity.

     Following World War II, the trend in the share of government debt has

been primarily downward, while corporate debt ratios have simultaneously

drifted upward. Moreover, many of the short—term swings in government debt

share have been mirrored by opposite movements in corporate debt proportions.

     When the evidence on determinants of corporate financing patterns is

viewed as a whole, the influence of the federal government stands out

sharply. Although their short—run impacts are more difficult to discern,

it has been argued that perceived business risk, the tax system and inflation

all appear to exert a broad influence on the financing of the corporate sector.

All three factors are in turn heavily influenced by federal government

activities. In addition, government regulations affect financial institu-

tions' ability to diversify their Portfolios, pay market interest rates, offer

new customer services and hence to fully perform their intermediation function.

Indirectly, then, such regulations influence the extent to which corporations

must perform this function themselves. Finally, as indicated by Figure 7,

the government's borrowing affects corporate financing behavior by altering

relative supplies of securities in the capital markets and hence their rel-

ative prices. Apart from the ebb and flow of investment opportunities and

internal funds, therefore, the activities of the federal government may be
                                   —17—



     the major underlying determinant of corporate financing patterns.

III. Conclusion

          Overall, the analysis of this paper suggests that the financial

     condition of U.S. corporations is subject to a number of powerful

     corrective mechanisms. These mechanisms are unlikely to allow the

     business sector by itself to be the leader of an unchecked slide

     toward financial disaster.

          First, there is some evidence that a rise in perceived business

     risk causes firms to moderate their reliance on debt financing. This

     tendency is hard to observe during short—run business cycle swings,

     but as business risk changes over prolonged periods it is more notice-

     able. It is certainly evident in the sharp cutback in debt proportions

     in the wake of the Great Depression, for example. It also seems likely

     that some of the moderation in debt financing in recent years has been

     motivated by perceptions of increased business risk.

          Second, long—run balance sheet targets send strong danger signals

     when financing proportions get too far out of line. This is particu-

     larly apparent in the Flow of Funds data in Tables 2 and 3, as debt

     financing was curtailed after reaching historically high levels during

     1969—73.

          Moreover, it does not appear that these traditional balance sheet

     targets have been adjusted for inflationary distortions. The data in

     Table 3 suggest that, once corrections are made for changes in real

     indebtedness, corporate financial policies were quite conservative in

     recent years. This may stand as testimony to the difficulty of con-

     vincing lenders that traditional balance sheet ratios do not have the
                               —18—

 same meaning in inflationary periods. Indeed, U.S. corporations

 have severely curtailed dividend payments and have placed heavy re-

 liance on internal funds since the mid l970s in an effort to reduce

 their dependence on external suppliers of funds.

      Finally, the behavior of other sectors in the capital market,

particularly the federal government, can act as an important check

on corporate borrowing. Any one corporation is probably small

enough that it need not worry about the effects of its own securities

issues on the relative supplies of different types of instruments. The

corporate sector as a whole, by contrast, must compete with the other

sectors who are primarily issuers of debt. As the federal government

in particular increases its borrowing, investors' appetite for cor-

porate debt will be less strong and corporations may turn toward other

financing sources, especially internal equity.

     While these forces act as checks against excessive risk—taking, it

should not be inferred that U.S. corporations face no financial problems

whatsoever. In the presence of inflation and volatile interest rates,

corporations have increasingly had to take on some of the intermediation

functions that traditional financial institutions have no longer been

able or willing to perform. This has led them to rely more heavily on

short—term liabilities and has necessitated more frequent rolling over

of their outstanding debt.

     The outlook for inflation and economic stability, then, is one of

the keys to future corporate financing patterns. These forces will

determine whether corporations face the same sharp swings in internal

funds availability that they experienced in the 1970s and early l980s.

They will also influence the allocation of financial intermediation

activity between corporations and financial institutions.
                            —19—


    A second major problem that business corporations face is the

future course of government financing. To the extent that potential

corporate borrowing is crowded out by the federal government, the

corporate sector faces some potentially painfulchoices: it must cut

dividends in order to increase internal funds, it must raise external

equity, or it must cut back on capital spending.

     In part, uncertainties about future corporate financing patterns

reflect uncertainty over the future course of inflation, economic

stability and government borrowing. It should also be clear, however,

that a good part of any residual uncertainty stems from the fact that

we still have much to learn about these patterns. The effects of

business risk, taxes and inflation leave traces in the data, but these

forces do not appear to be the whole story. Moreover, their effects

are more subtle and more difficult to uncover than has commonly been

thought.

     At least two remaining issues require a better understanding. One

of these is the behavior of equity issues. Why, for example, were

corporations so much more willing to issue equity earlier in the

century than they have been in the postwar years? Is this entirely a

tax—related phenomenon or are other forces at work? A second important

issue is the precise nature of the linkage between the borrowing activity

of the federal government and the financing, dividend and investment

policy of the corporate sector.

1. This feeling is especially prevalent among members of the business

    press (see Bennett 1984; Business Week 1974, 1982; and Carson—Parker

    1981) and analysts of the financial system (see Kaufman 1981, Mains

    1980, Nassaro 1977 and Moran 1984). Government officials have also

    expressed concern over corporate financing trends, particularly in the

    wake of the leveraged buyout boom (e.g. Shad 1984).



2. Perceived trends, of course, are always dependent on the observer's

    reference point. Miller (1963) examined the same data from 1926

    through the mid—1950s and concluded, quite reasonably, that there had

    been no trend in corporate debt ratios over this period.



3. Gordon and Malkiel (1981) present evidence for the pefiod 1973—78

    suggesting that inclusion of lease and pension obligations would in-

    crease reported debt ratios by approximately one—third.



4. Some portion of bank loans should in fact be classified as long—

   term, but the actual fraction is impossible to estimate with any

   degree of confidence. There is no evidence of any trend toward in-

   creasingly long—term bank loans from, say, the mid—l960s onward. More-

   over, the predominance of floating rate loans in recent years implies

   that even bank term loans have many of the characteristics of short—

   term debt.
5. See also Mitchell (1983) for an elaboration of the argument that,

     even if liquidity ratios have declined, the growth of bank loan

     commitments and the commercial paper market have increased cor—

     porations' ability to raise funds on short notice.




6. Other measures indicate an increase in business risk around this time

     as well. Wood (1981), for example, shows that the volatility of real

     interest rates increased sharply after 1972. Bodie, Kane and McDonald

     (1984) show that the real risk premium on long—term bonds suddenly jumped

     in 1979.


7. Specifically, the debt incentive tax ratio is (t —     t)/(l t), where
                                                               —

     t is the corporate tax rate and t is the lowest personal rate. In
