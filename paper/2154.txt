                 Specification of the Joy of Giving:
                         Insights from Altruism


                                 ABSTRACT



     This paper analyzes the joy of giving bequest motive in which the utility

obtained from leaving a bequest depends only on the size of the bequest. It

exploits the fact that this formulation can be interpreted as a reduced form

of an altruistic bequest motive to derive a relation between the value of' the

altruism parameter and the value of the joy of giving parameter. Using

previous discussions of an a priori range of plausible values for the altruism

parameter we then derive plausible restrictions on the joy of giving

parameter. We demonstrate that this parameter may well be orders of' magnitude

larger than assumed in the existing literature.

        Bequest motives by individual consumers have important implications for

the behavior of financial markets, the macroeconomic impacts of various fiscal

policies and the intergenerational transmisssion of inequality in the

distribution of wealth. There are at least four reasons for the existence of

bequests which have been discussed in the recent literature: (1) bequests may

be the unintentional by-product of precautionary savings and a stochastic date

of death in the absence of' an annuity market (Abel (1985)); (2) the prospect

of bequests is used by parents to induce children to behave in certain ways

desired by the parents (Bernheim, Shleifer, and Summers (1985)); (3) bequests

may arise from intergenerational altruism, that is, consumers obtain utility

from their heirs' utility as well as from their own consumption (Barro (19714)

and Becker (19714)); and (14) bequests may arise from what may be termed the

"joy of giving," that is, consumers leave bequests simply because they obtain

utility directly from the bequest.

        For some theoretical and empirical analyses of the issues affected by

voluntary intergenerational transfers, the specification of the bequest motive

is critical. For example, the validity of the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem

depends crucially on an altruistic motive rather than a joy of giving

motive. For many other purposes, however, the specification is not crucial.

Many economists, including Yaari (1965), Hakansson (1969), Fischer (1973), and

Abel (1986), have chosen the joy of giving model, either out of the belief

that it captures the true reason for bequests, or more likely, because it is a

convenient "reduced form" representation of altruistic preferences.

Furthermore, the joy of giving formulation has the practical advantage that it

is more easily tractable. This tractability is especially important in

simulation models, particularly those simulation models in which closed-form

solutions are needed.

        In most applications of the altruism model and the joy of giving model,

the bequest motive is parameterized by a small number of parameters. Economic

theory provides substantial guidance on the admissible, or at least plausible,

values of' the parameters in the simple formulations of the altruism model and

these implications have been discussed by Drazen (1978), Burbidge (1983,

198)4), Buiter and Carmichael (198)4), and Weil (1984). However, there has

evidently been no systematic discussion of the range of appropriate parameter

values for simple formulations of the joy of giving model, despite the

popularity of this formulation in empirical work.

        The purpose of this paper is to explore the implications of economic

theory for the appropriate range of parameter values for a popular

specification of the joy of giving motive. The strategy pursued in this paper

is to assume that the bequest is actually motivated by altruism and then to

use the well—known restrictions on a simple formulation of the altruism model

to derive restrictions on the parameter of a simple form of the joy of giving

model. A striking result of this analysis is that the weight on the utility

obtained directly from a bequest may be orders of magnitude larger than the

values which appear in the literature (Fischer (1973), Blinder (1974)).


I. A Model of Individual Behavior

        We consider consumers who live for L periods. For now, we suppose that

the only source of disposable income is from past accumulation, that is,

consumers receive only property income. This assumption will be relaxed in

Section V. We consider a family in which J periods elapse between the birth

of successive generations. For simplicity, we assume that private

intergenerational transfers from parent to child, that is, bequests, are made

at the beginning of the child's life. Let J be the wealth received by a

generation j consumer at the beginning of his life. Defining c,


1.3.1
                                                 —3—



 1      1,   .   .   ., L   as the consumption of a generation j consumer when he is age

 i, and letting R be the (gross) rate of return on the homogeneous wealth, we

 can write the lifetime budget constraint as a relation between the inheritance

received by the generation j consumer, J, and the bequest left by this

consumer,
                                          L
                                               R'1c +    R_NWj                         (1)
                                          i1

        We specify the utility function to be time separable in the consumer's

own consumption and to display altruism. Letting V be the present value of

lifetime utility of the generation j consumer we assume that the consumer has

the following time—separable altruistic utility function



                                  V max 3u(c) +                                       (2)


where u' > 0, u" < 0, 8 is discount factor reflecting time preference

(0 < 8 < 1) and a > 0 indicates the strength of the bequest motive. The

maximization in (2) is subject to the constraint in (1) and to the

transversality condition urn R...NJWJ ? 0.


        It has been noted by several authors (for example, Buiter and Carmichael

(198)4), and Weil (1985)) that in order for the maximization problem in (2) to

be well—posed, we must restrict the weight on the heir's utility, 81a, to lie

between 0 and 1. This restriction does not require a to be less than or equal

to 1. To obtain some guidance on the appropriate range of' values for a, it is

useful to define the term "full altruism." By "full altruism" we will mean

that in every period in which both the generation j consumer is alive and the

generation j +          1   consumer is alive, the optimal allocation of family

consumption is for the parent and child to have equal consumption



1.3.1
                                             _14 —




(cjL1            i     1,..., L —   N).   With the specification of the utility

function in (2), full altruism corresponds to a           1.    If a < 1 then we will

say that the utility function displays less than full altruism.1

        If all generations in an infinitely—lived altruistic family are identical

except for their dates of birth and the inheritances they receive at birth,

then the utility of the generation j consumer can be written as a function of

the inheritance received at birth v V(W). Therefore equation (2) may be

written as

                       V(W) max {L B1u(c) + BNV(WJ+l)}                                  (3)




Recalling that WJ1 is the bequest left by the generation j consumer, equation

(3) expresses the utility of the generation j consumer as a function of his

own consumption and the bequest he leaves. That is, equation (3) has the

appearance of a "joy of giving" bequest motive. Strictly speaking, it is not

a joy of giving bequest motive because the function V( ) cannot be specified

independently; it is the solution to a functional equation. The strategy we

will employ in this paper is to solve the functional equation implied by

altruism and to use interpretable restrictions on altruistic preferences to

derive restrictions on the parameters of the joy of giving specification.

        We begin by solving the maximization problem on the right-hand side of

(3) subject to (1) and a given value of W. The first-order conditions can be

expressed

                      u'(c) (R)1uI(c) ,              i   2, .   . ., L              ('4a)




                                u'(c)       (RB)NczVt(W3)                           (ib)


It is useful to obtain an expression for V'(W) in terms of the utility

function u( ).       It follows immediately from the envelope theorem that



1.3.1
                                           -5—




                                              u'(c1)                                      (5)


Finally, use (14a, b) and (5) to obtain an expression relating consumption at a

given age i across successive generations


                      u'(c?)   ci(BR)Nu(cl)                I     1,   .   .   .,L         (6)


II. Implications for the Steady State

        In this section we briefly analyze the life-cycle consumption pattern of

an individual and the cross-sectional distribution of consumption in the

steady state. To analyze the steady state, we assume that there are N types

of families of consumers which are identical in all respects except for the

dates at which births (and deaths) occur. We assume that there is an equal

number of each type of family so that there is a constant number of consumers
born each period.
        A steady state is characterized by c c1 , i 1, . . ., L                     and
        W1. It follows from (6) that in the steady state

                                                 =   1                                    (7)


Although ci and @ are preference parameters and R is assumed to be given to the

individual, a more complete aggregate analysis could specify R to be a

declining function of the aggregate capital stock. Such a formulation, which

would allow for the endogenous adjustment of R to the steady state value

implied by (7), is beyond the scope of this paper. Our purpose here is simply

to characterize the life-cycle and cross-sectional profiles of consumption.

        We observe that under full altruism (ci          = 1),   condition (7) implies that

SR = 1.     It is thus apparent from ('4a) and (6) that both the life-cycle and

cross-sectional profiles of consumption are flat. That is, in the steady

state c =     C for   all i and j where c > 0 is constant.


1.3.1
                                           —6—



        The steady state behavior of consumption is more interesting in the case

of less than full altruism. In this case, with a < 1, condition (7) implies

that RB > 1. With the rate of interest greater than the rate of time

preference (R >             (14a) implies that the path of optimal consumption over

an individual's lifetime is monotonically increasing with age. Every consumer

has the same lifetime path of consumption, and in a cross—section at a point

in time old consumers have higher consumption than young consumers. Thus, in

every period in which two successive generations in a family are alive, the

parent's consumption exceeds the child's consumption, which is simply a

reflection of less than full altruism.


III. One-Period Non-Overlapping Generations

        Before deriving the utility function corresponding to the joy of giving

motive in the general multi-period life case, it is useful to analyze the

simple case with L      N      1 and to focus on the steady state. This simple case

gives the flavor of the result that the weight on the joy of giving function

may be quite large, and does so without a burdensome amount of algebra.

        With L    N   1, we can write constraint (1) in the steady state as


                                      W   c + R1W                                (8)


where c                in the steady state. Evaluating the utility function (2)
             c'
in the steady state yields


                                     V    u(c) + aBV                             (9)


Now using (8) to substitute for c in (9) and using (7) to replace c&8 by R1,

we can rewrite (9) as

                                                                                (10)




1.3.1
                                                  —7—



        Equation (10) expresses the steady state utility of an individual as a

function of the inheritance he receives at birth. Much of the research using

the joy of giving motive assumes that u(c) is isoelastic

                                              1        1—a
                               u(c)                c                                       (11)
                                          1 —


        In addition, the joy of giving function is assumed to be isoelastic with

the same elasticity as u(c). This formulation of the joy of giving function

is consistent with (10) as may be seen by combining (10) and (11) to obtain


                               v

                                                        '
Observing that R          > 1, we see that                   1) the weight on the joy of
                      1

giving function, might be quite large. To determine how large this weight

might be, we must go to the more general model which can accommodate more

realistic values for L and N.


IV. The Multi-Period Model

        In this section, we allow both N and L to be large and we calculate the

function         V(W3) under the assumption that u(c) has the isoelastic form in

(11). We will verify that under isoelastic utility, the solution to the

functional equation in (3) has the form


                                   V(W)
                                                   1         a

where • is the weight to be derived in this section.

        Using the expressions for u(c) and V(W) in (11) and (13), respectively,

we can rewrite the first—order conditions (ka, b) as

in the functional equation (3).      Using the specifications of u(c) and V(W) in

Now use (15a) to express the right-hand side of (16) as a function of                                            and

         In order to make our findings more easily interpretable in terms of, for

 example, Fischer (1973), note that under isoelastic utility, the utility

 function in (3) can be written as



                   V(W) {           i_l(CJ)1_a      +       X(W)}/(l         -       c)    (20a)



where                                         A                                           (20b)



We have defined A so that it is comparable to the bequest weight bt in Fischer

(1973). Substituting (18) into (20b) yields



                                                        r

                                             (BNRN)O -        R_N


If we restrict our attention to the steady state, then (21) can be simplified

using (7) to obtain



                                     r
                        R_N                                  if     a(8R)N       1         (22)
                                  1 - R N


        Table 1 presents the implied values of A and                 corresponding to various

rates of time preference and steady state interest rates. Looking across the

last four columns of each row, it is clear that the weight A is an increasing



1.3.1
                                          -10-



function of the coefficient of relative risk aversion o. The striking result

in Table 1 is that even with a coefficient of relative risk aversion as low as

2, the value of x can be orders of magnitude larger than the values assumed by

previous authors. For example, Table 1 of Fischer (1973) indicates that for

four sets of his simulations, Fischer used a rate of time preference of .014

(actually    B   .96),   a net interest rate of .06, and a coefficient of relative

risk aversion of 2.0. Although he uses a time-varying weight on the bequest

motive, this weight is roughly equal to 1 (it always lies between .142 and

1.20). The first row of Table 1 indicates that for o              0.5 a value of X

around 1 is consistent with altruism but for o          2, a value of X around 100 is

required to be consistent with altruism in the steady state.

        The calculations reported in Table 1 are limited to the steady state in

which condition (7) implies a restriction on B, R and ci.           If   we relax the

assumption that we are in a steady state, then ci can be specified

independently of B and R. We can use this extra degree of freedom on the

parameters to answer the following question: given a time preference discount

factor B, a gross interest rate R, and a bequest weight A, what is the implied

degree of altruism ci? Straightforward manipulation of (21) yields



                             ci   (BR){R    + (RMX)0    r}                                 (23)



It is clear from (23) that for given R and B there is a monotonically

increasing relation between ci and A. However, this relation is nonlinear. In

Table 2 we report values of        corresponding to R     1.06,          —   1   .04 and

various values of a and A. The last entry in Table 2 indicates that the

implied degree of altruism in Fischer (1973) is quite small relative to full

altruism for the case with a        2.

 V.     Non-Property Income

         In previous sections we have assumed that the only source of disposable

resources is wealth inherited at birth. In this section we assume that a

generation j consumer receives an exogenous deterministic income y when he is

age i.

        Let ii denote the inheritance of tangible (non-human) assets received at
                                                             L      .

birth    by the generation j consumer and let           =    E    R' 'y denote the value
                                                            1=1

of the human wealth of the generation j consumer. Now let H1 be the present

value of the human wealth of the generation j consumer and all of his

descendents

                                 H1    E    (R_N)I<Y1                               (2L)
                                       kO

        Next, let Wi now denote the total wealth, human plus non-human, of the

generation j consumer and his descendents, as of the beginning of the

generation j consumer's life,


                                      W1=11+H1                                      (25)


        Finally, let Bi denote the bequest left by a generation J consumer so

that I' B1. Therefore, equation (25) implies that


                                        = B3   +   H11                              (26)


        The analysis of previous sections continues to apply if we now interpret

Wi to include human as well as non-human wealth. In particular, we can write

the isoelastic altruistic utility function in (20a) as



                V(W1)    {z 81(c)1 +           x(B1 +       H11)1}/(1   - a)        (27)




1.3.1
                                                  —12—




        Equation (27) expresses the utility of the generation j consumer as a

function of his own consumption c ,               i      1, .   . ., L   and the bequest he makes,

BJ. This equation is equivalent to a joy of giving formulation. Unlike the

joy of giving functions in Abel (1986), Blinder (1971), Fischer (1973),

Friedman and Warshawsky (1985), Hakansson (1969), and Richard (1975), however,

it is not isoelastic, although the period utility function u( ) is

isoelastic. Treating the exogenous human wealth term HJ as a parameter, the

joy of giving function is a member of the more general HARA class of utility

functions.

        In terms of consumer behavior, it is, of course, the marginal utility

function rather than the utility function per se which is important. In the

altruistic formulation in (27) the marginal utility of leaving a bequest is



                                                                                              (28)
                                     aB3


Recalling that Bj      I
                           j+1 we may rewrite (28) as



                                     j             j+1
                                              x('. 1)a(BJ)_                                   (29)
                                                  wJ+


        Now consider a joy of giving specification of the bequest motive. If, as

is typical in the joy of giving framework, the bequest motive is specified to

have the isoelastic form X*(B3)           1(1 -         ci), the   marginal utility of a bequest

would be
                                         Tj
                                              -
                                                   x*(BJY°                                    (30)




where X is the weight on the bequest motive. In order to calibrate X so




1.3.1
                                            —13--




 that the calculated marginal utility in (30) would equal the marginal utility

 in (29), we would equate the right-hand sides of (29) and (30) to obtain




                              1j+1         M         r(TJ+h/I1J+l\

                                •
                                     ja                                        (31)

                                                    (8NRN) a — R_N



The second equality in (31) follows from (21). Of course, the adjustment
           1j+1
factor (
           WJ
             •1ja   in (31) depends on the bequest B. However, since the goal of

this adjustment is merely to choose an appropriate magnitude for X in

empirical and simulation work, some rough proxies for                may be used

such as the population average ratio of inheritances to total wealth, or a

particular family's (or group of families') historical average value of this

ratio. At this level of analysis, all we can say is that I j+1 < W j+1 so that

X" < A where A is given by (20a). Put differently, the parameter a of the

altruistic bequest motive corresponding to a particular value of X is larger

than the a corresponding to the same value of A in the model without human

wealth. We can, using (31), calculate the value of a corresponding to a given

value of A' as



                          (BR)N{R +       (13+l/j+l)(N*)                      (32)


        Equation (32) can be used to interpret the bequest parameters derived by

Friedman and Warshawsky (1985) in a joy of giving framework. Friedman and

Warshawsky point out that the observed reluctance of most individuals in the

United States to purchase individual life annuities, and the concomitant

approximately flat age-wealth profiles of retired consumers, stand in sharp

contradiction to the standard (no bequest motive) life-cycle model of



1.3.1
                                        114


consumption    and saving behavior. Simulation of an extended model of life-

cycle saving and portfolio behavior, allowing explicitly for uncertain

lifetimes, Social Security, and empirically observed annuity prices, indicates

that an intentional bequest motive must be present in order to explain the

observed limited participation in annuity markets. Friedman and Warshawsky

derive the minimum values for the bequest motive parameter which will

eliminate purchases of individual annuities under various assumptions about

the gross interest rate, R, the proportion of Social Security in the average

retired individual's portfolio, 5, the degree of risk aversion and the degree

to which annuity prices exceed the actuarially fair prices. Their results,

which are reproduced in the top panel of Table 3, might explain the apparent

failure of most consumers to buy annuities as the consequence of apparently

strong bequest motives.

        An alternative measure of the strength of the bequest motive is the

implied value of the altruism parameter ci.    Since the expected present value

of Social Security income is not bequeathable, Social Security wealth is

appropriately treated as human, or non-property, wealth rather than as a

tangible asset. Because of the presence of human wealth, we use equation (32)

to calculate the altruism parameter. The bottom panel of Table 3 reports the

calculated values of ci using (32) with N     30, L   60, and B   (1.01Y1.

The assumed values of R and the calculated values of ci are reported in Table

3. For the ratio of tangible property wealth to total wealth, 1/W, we use

1-S, where S is the share of Social Security wealth in total wealth reported

in the top panel of Table 3. Finally, the values of X are taken from the top

panel of Table 3. The picture which emerges from the bottom panel of Table 3

is quite different from that in the top panel. In all cases the degree of the

implied altruism parameter is quite small. In assessing these small values of



1.3.1
                                        -15—



 a it must be kept in mind that the Friedman and Warshawsky calculations

 produced a lower bound on the strength of the bequest motive. Additionally,

 the present value of human wealth of future generations has been ignored. The

 bequest motives may, therefore, be substantially larger than the implied lower

 bounds presented in Table 3. Nevertheless, the findings indicate that given

 the actual pricing of annuities, a weak altruistic bequest motive will be

sufficient to eliminate the purchase of private annuities.


VI. Conclusions

        This paper analyzes the joy of giving bequest motive in which the utility

obtained from leaving a bequest depends only on the size of the bequest. It

exploits the fact that this formulation can be interpreted as a reduced form

of an altruistic bequest motive to derive a relation between the value of the

altruism parameter and the value of the joy of giving parameter. Using

previous discussions of an a priori range of plausible values for the altruism

parameter we then derive plausible restrictions on the joy of giving

parameter. We demonstrate that this parameter may well be orders of magnitude

larger than assumed in the existing literature.

        Despite its analytic tractability, there has been some reluctance to use

the joy of giving formulation even in analyses where only a generic bequest

motive is necessary. This reluctance may owe to the difficulty of making

reasonable assumptions about, and in empirical work and simulation models

reasonable interpretations of, the joy of giving parameter. In removing this

difficulty, this paper takes an important step in interpreting empirical work

and simulation results which are directed at understanding actual economic

phenomena related to bequests.
