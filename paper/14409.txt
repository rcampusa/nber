Information Disclosure Policy: Do States’ Data Processing Efforts Help More than the Information
Disclosure Itself?

                                                ABSTRACT

The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) was expected to reduce health risks stemming from emissions
of hazardous chemicals by increasing public pressure on polluters. However, it is a massive and complex
dataset, requiring significant expertise to interpret in its raw form. State governments have attempted
to mitigate the TRI's information processing burden on the public via two types of policies: (1) selection
and dissemination of raw TRI data for plants within the state, and (2) data processing activities producing
more refined reports and analysis. This study assesses the effectiveness of those policies. Our results
show that state-level data dissemination efforts lowered the total number of pounds of chemicals released,
but had little effect on health risks. State-level data processing efforts, in contrast, did lead to significant
reductions in health risks. We conclude that simple dissemination of the data was ineffective (and
even counterproductive in some instances), and that the states' data processing efforts have played
a critical role in achieving the TRI's underlying goal.

INTRODUCTION

        The command-and-control approach has been the predominant form of US

environmental regulation for the past three decades (Case, 2001; Esty, 2004). However, it has

often generated high direct costs (Bui and Mayer, 2003) and more recent regulation has been

moving toward market-based methods and other more indirect and flexible approaches.

        One type of indirect and flexible strategy is compulsory information disclosure. The most

salient example in environmental regulation is the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). The TRI was

established in 1986 by the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)

which was part of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA). The TRI does

not directly regulate plants’ emissions. Rather, it simply requires manufacturing firms to report

releases or transfers of toxic chemicals to the EPA. The EPA then discloses and disseminates the

data to the public. The TRI was expected to drive plants to improve environmental performance

to avoid adverse reactions by markets and the public: it was an explicit effort at “regulation-

through-information.”

        The TRI was intended to be used by many sectors and parties, such as private individuals,

businesses, public non-profit organizations, or other governmental bodies. In principle, it can be

used for evaluating current environmental conditions, for assessing the status of various

environmental programs, or for setting environmental agendas at local and state levels. In

practice, however, it can be quite difficult for many individuals and organizations to use. The

volume of data is massive, including information from nearly 49,000 plants on releases of more

than 400 chemicals. Although the EPA publishes a national summary report, and fact sheets for

each state as an appendix to the raw data, it is still difficult for most users to find information




                                                   1
relevant to their specific interests at an appropriate level of detail, and it is not easy for them to

customize the dataset by re-packaging or restructuring it for further analysis. Moreover, in raw

form the TRI reports the number of pounds of each chemical released without adjusting for

toxicity, despite the fact that the ultimate purpose of the data is to reduce health risks rather than

just the quantity of chemicals released. Thus, use of the TRI necessarily involves significant

information processing, including procedures for interpreting and structuring the data.

          As a result, the TRI may not be as effective as hoped when it was established. An

extensive recent literature on mandatory information disclosure policies in health care shows that

simple publication of large volumes of raw data can have little or no effect on the outcomes of

most interest. Since the first release of TRI data in 1988, EPA has made an effort to make it more

accessible to the public. However, for more than a decade, EPA’s activities were largely limited to

providing supporting information that facilitates interpretation of TRI data, such as toxicity

information on chemicals, or to the provision of risk analyses focused on relatively narrow issues

and conducted at the national level.1

          A number of empirical studies have tried to measure the effect of the TRI including:

Kennedy, Laplante, & Maxwell (1994); Grant & Downey (1995); Grant (1997); Konar & Cohen

(1997); Klenindorfer & Orts (1998); Tietenberg (1998); Grant, Jones, & Bergesen,(2002); Bui &

Mayer (2003); Grant & Jones (2004); Shapiro (2005); Bui (2005); Cohen & Santhakumar (2006).



1 This partial risk analyses have been conducted by the Office of Health Research, the Office of Information
Resource management, and Office of Research and Development in the EPA. A more comprehensive and complete
risk analysis using the TRI data, which considers toxicity, media, and affective population factors, and is applicable
from the national to the local level, was released first in 1999 and was entitled the Risk Screening Environmental
Indicators (RSEI), developed by the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT). (EPA, 2003)




                                                           2
However, the results from these studies have been inconsistent: some have shown the effect to be

significant while others have not.

        EPCRA also required individual states to set up systems to facilitate public use of the

TRI data, although it did not specify particular state-level actions to be carried out. As a result,

states have implemented a wide range of TRI programs. State programs include: disseminating

hard copy or electronic files of the raw data, providing analyses of the data, creating customized

database reports, providing assessments of health effects or carrying out risk analyses, and

allowing public access to the state’s computer database. State-level data analyses and reports have

usually focused on risk-related factors specific to the state (sometimes down to the level of

individual plants) and thus provide a more disaggregated level of analysis than available from the

EPA.

        Prior empirical studies that have tried to identify the overall impact of the TRI have

generally not focused on the nature of the disclosed information, and no attempt has been made to

analyze the impact of state-level provision of interpreted and processed information. Due to the

complexity of the raw data, however, analytical activities by states may play a critical role in

determining the effectiveness of the policy. In this study, we extend the empirical literature on the

TRI by explicitly examining the effect of state-level policies. We classify various state programs

into two broad categories: (1) efforts at straightforward data dissemination, and (2) policies

involving more detailed data processing and analysis. We then evaluate the impact of these two

types of effort on toxic releases. To explore whether better information leads to better outcomes,

we examine the effects of each policy on two outcome measures: total releases measured in

pounds (“Toxic release level”), and releases adjusted for the toxicity of each chemical (“Toxic




                                                   3
risk”). We expect that processed and structured information is likely to do more to reduce toxic

risk than simple disclosure of raw data.

        We proceed by constructing a panel of raw and toxicity-weighted TRI release levels in

US counties in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1999. We then regress those releases on county

demographic characteristics, economic status, related state policies and, as a key explanatory

variable, state TRI-related policies. We also contribute to the literature by using fixed effects

estimation, which has not been used in prior studies of the TRI (Grant, 1997; Grant & Downey,

1995; Grant et al., 2002; Shapiro, 2005; Hamilton, 2005). The fixed effects approach allows us to

distinguish between the effects of TRI programs and time-invariant differences in emissions

across counties.



PRIOR STUDIES AND THEORY

        The disclosure of TRI information involves major actors including firms, local

governments, media, shareholders and citizens. Among these, citizens and firms are most

important and the others can be regarded as intermediaries (Stephan, 2002). Interactions between

plants and their surrounding communities should reveal most clearly the effect of the TRI as a

regulatory instrument (Stephan, 2002). It is intended to reduce information costs for communities,

which is likely to lead to more frequent and more significant negotiations or other actions,

including lawsuits against plants. This increased community activity should drive plants to

improve their environmental performance.

        However, information disclosure policies do not always work as well as intended. Since

the 1980s, a range of disclosure policies have been adopted in attempts to improve the quality of




                                                  4
health care. Empirical studies have shown that the results have been mixed at best, raising various

utilization issues beyond the availability of information. First of all, publicly released information

is often ignored and is not used. Mennemeyer, Morrisey and Howard (1997) examined the effect

of hospital mortality rate data, released to the public by the Health Care Financing Administration

(HCFA), on hospital choice by consumers. They found that consumers generally ignored the

mortality reports and made little use of the data. On the basis of their findings, the policy was

abandoned. This implies that information release itself does not guarantee its utilization and the

availability of information is often not enough to influence information users’ behavior.

         Grant (2005) shows that the attributes and quality of information certainly influence

information recipients’ behavior. Grant found that data made available on the rates of Cesarean

sections by hospitals and physicians was not being used by consumers because it was

insufficiently accurate and too aggregated to give correct, useful signals to consumers. He argued

that the value of health care quality information might be enhanced by increasing its accuracy,

which is determined by the abundance of data, the method of processing data, and the degree of

detail conveyed.

         These results highlight the importance of providing appropriate information, not just raw

data. Abundant information may be useless or irrelevant if it requires too much processing and

interpretation on the part of recipients. Too much information can lead to “information overload,”

a familiar phenomenon that has been formally studied in many fields, including organizational

science and the management of information systems.2 Information overload arises when the



2 Several other terms have been used in the same context of information overload--data smog (Shenk, 1997),
analysis paralysis (Stanley & Clipsham, 1997) and information fatigue syndrome (Oppenheim, 1997).




                                                        5
supply of information exceeds the processing capacity of the recipient (Butcher, 1998; Eppler &

Mengis, 2004). When it occurs, it degrades decision quality and decreases decision accuracy

(Eppler & Mengis, 2004). Recipients often fail to identify relevant information and relate key

details to their overall objectives (Jacoby, 1977).

          Although the classic view of information overload focused mainly on the quantity of

information, recent literature suggests that the characteristics of the information are also

important (Galbraith, 1974; Tushman & Nadler, 1978; Owen, 1992; Iselin, 1993; Sparrow, 1998).

Schneider (1987) suggests that ambiguity, uncertainty, or complexity of the information can

cause information overload. Providing smaller volumes of higher value-added, more structured

information reduces the phenomenon (Simpson & Prusak, 1995; Edmunds & Morris, 2000;

Koniger and Janowitz, 1995).3 Increasing the quality of information reduces the likelihood of

information overload; in effect, it improves the information processing capacity of the recipients

(Simpson & Prusak, 1995).

          Even when appropriate information is provided, disclosure policies do not always

produce the results intended. Dranove et. al. (2003) found that mandating the disclosure of

information on hospitals’ and doctors’ performance led to improvements in only exactly what the

report cards report. Disclosure of information on patient health outcomes caused providers’

selections to instantly create a better status for the next published report card, but failed to

increase the welfare of patients, particularly of sicker patients. This implies that the outcome of

information disclosure often causes only superficial improvement in the way the information

3 Simpson & Prusak (1995) suggested five elements that comprise the value of information which are truth,
guidance, scarcity, accessibility and weight. High value-added information represents improved information in terms
of these five elements.




                                                         6
appears on the surface, compromising the intended goal of information disclosure. In essence, the

form in which information is disclosed determines how related actors respond and finally what

we get as a policy outcome.

         The lessons from information disclosure policies in health care suggest that the raw data

published via the TRI may have little effect on emissions. The volume of information is

tremendous: the TRI reports annual data on emissions of almost 400 chemicals by nearly 49,000

plants. Moreover, releases are reported separately by media, including air, ground water, surface

water, land, or off-site transfer. In addition to emissions, each plant reveals basic information

about its production and also pollution-related information, such as the height of its smoke stacks.

         Not only is the volume of information large, it is likely to be of relatively low value to

recipients because it focuses on pounds of chemicals released without adjusting for toxicity. Thus,

it does not directly address the issue that is likely to be most important to most recipients: health

risks. The chronic health risk posed by an emitted chemical depends on its toxicity, on the

characteristics of the population exposed, on the release media and on the local climate, among

other factors. Interpreting the TRI, therefore, requires enormous expertise. The high volume of

data combined with its level of complexity and uncertainty suggests that the TRI could easily

result in information overload. Since the resources available to community groups are often

limited, recipients may be unable to use the data at all, or may be at risk of using it incorrectly.

         A case in point is ActionPA, a Pennsylvania-based non-governmental organization in the

grassroots environmental justice movement. It uses the TRI to construct its own analysis of trends

in Pennsylvania’s toxic emissions.4 ActionPA’s analysis, which is done on the basis of raw TRI

                                                   7
data, shows that Pennsylvania is the fifth most polluted state in the nation, and that there has been

a gradual decreasing trend in emissions since 1999. However, adjusting for risk, which ActionPA

does not do, shows a sharply different picture: Pennsylvania’s risk related to toxic emissions is

the highest in the country.5 Moreover, despite a decrease in the quantity of emissions from 1999

to 2002, the toxicity of emissions rose sharply enough that risk during that period actually rose 43

percent. In addition, by focusing on pounds of emissions rather than risk, ActionPA ends up

suggesting that action be focused on the wrong industry. It concludes that coal and metal mining

are the largest polluters, but the main source of health risks in Pennsylvania is actually the metals

industry, which as of 2002 accounted for about 79% of the state’s total toxic risk. As with the

health care policy discussed by Dranove et. al. (2003), disclosure of high-volume, complex data

led the actors involved to focus narrowly on the data itself, rather than on the implications of that

data: in this case, on the quantity of emissions rather than the actual risks to human health.

           Several prior studies have examined the effect of the TRI program on plants and their

neighboring communities (Grant, 1997; Grant & Downey, 1995; Grant et al., 2002; Shapiro, 2005,

Bui, 2005; Hamilton, 2005). Grant & Jones (2004) used an organization-theoretic framework to

evaluate the impact of state-level TRI programs and the characteristics of neighboring

communities on emissions by plants. With cross-sectional plant-level data, they found that state

expenditures for TRI programs had no significant net effect on toxic emission level Bui (2005)

examined plant level responses of petroleum refineries to the TRI program. She found that states’

supplementary actions to the TRI disclosure explain lower level of toxic release.6

5 These risk indicator measures are based on the RSEI version 2.1.2 by the EPA.
6 States’ supplementary actions that Bui (2005) included in her model are technical assistance, educational programs,
data clearinghouses, tax incentives, government grant to help firms reduce wastes and the establishment of a




                                                         8
          Shapiro (2005) and Hamilton (2005) observed that emissions at many plants dropped

sharply after the first release of TRI data and tried to identify the factors that influenced the size

of the reduction. Using a cross-sectional approach, Shapiro found that state-level TRI programs

and community characteristics explain risk reductions over ten years after the TRI’s

establishment. Hamilton found that the emissions reductions during a three year period after TRI

disclosure could be explained by community characteristics indicating the potential for collective

action and the toxicity and health risks associated with the emissions.7 However, Hamilton is

unable to isolate the effect of the TRI itself since toxic release data prior to the TRI is not

available (Hamilton 2005, p. 107).

          Given the volume and complexity of the data, activities undertaken by individual states

to process and interpret TRI data might play a critical role in achieving the original policy goal of

the TRI as a regulatory instrument, which was to reduce the risks to human health. States may

carry out comprehensive analyses of human health effects and trends in risks. They can also filter

the data, providing information on major local polluters and relevant chemicals at the level of

individual communities.8 Additionally, states can facilitate monitoring and follow-up measures




statewide quantitative goal as regulations for toxic pollutants.
7 Shapiro (2005) and Hamilton (2005) incorporated actual health impact by interpreting emission in quantity into
human health risk measure. Shapiro (2005) used human health risk measure as a dependent variable rather than using
release in pound and Hamilton (2005) considered toxicity and human health level as one of factors that influence
plants’ emission behaviors.
8 EPA summary reports and web-based resources give users some ability to find detailed release information on one
specific spot at a specific point in time. However, it is still difficult for users to manipulate or tailor the raw dataset to
subtract the information relevant to their own specific interests. Moreover, the availability and accessibility of web-
based resource was limited before popularization of Internet in mid-90’s.

by communities by conducting and publishing analyses on a regular basis.9

          Our study examines the effectiveness of state-level TRI policies in the 1990’s. We

classify state programs into the two categories noted above: efforts focused purely on

dissemination of data, and deeper analysis with more extensive data processing. We evaluate the

effect of each type of activity on the quantity of emissions and the overall toxic risk at the county

level. We expect that data dissemination alone may affect total emissions but have little effect on

risk. Reductions in risk are likely to be associated with analytical activities instead.



DATA AND METHOD

          We examine the impact of state TRI programs on toxic releases and risks using a panel

data set covering four years: 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1999; 1998 is excluded because data on key

variables are not available for that year. We conduct our analysis at the level of individual

counties since those are the jurisdictions most likely to match the level of community monitoring

and collective action.10 The data set consists of a balanced panel of 1700 counties that

experienced at least one pound of toxic emissions per year during all four years. We augment the

TRI data with a range of demographic variables in order to isolate the impact of state TRI

programs by controlling for other factors that might affect toxic release levels in each county.


9 Communities’ monitoring and follow up measures could be setting up the target emission reduction goal,
negotiating plants’ emission scenarios, taking legal suits, pressure on governments’ further regulatory action and so
on.
10 While we focus on the effect of state policies, we use counties as the level of analysis to account for variation in
factors such as community characteristics and regulatory stringency, either through direct measurement or as county
fixed effects.   We focus on releases in the county, rather than by individual plant, as we expect communities to be
influenced by the overall environmental quality in the community, rather than releases from a specific plant.




                                                          10
Dependent Variables

          We construct two dependent variables to represent the ostensible and the true policy

effect. The first is the “toxic release level,” which is simply the sum of TRI emissions for the

county. It can be obtained relatively easily from the raw TRI data and does not include any

adjustment for the effects of different chemicals on long-term human health. It is often

mistakenly used as an indicator of the health risks of different counties but it differs significantly

from the true toxic risk.

          Chronic human health risks not only depend on the quantities of chemicals released but

also on the characteristics of each chemical, such as its toxicity or the media type where it was

emitted. Moreover, the natural environment and weather of the county also play a role. As a result,

a county may experience a high release level but have low risk. Focusing on total pounds rather

than toxicity might encourage plants to substitute smaller amounts of more toxic chemicals.

Lowering toxic release volumes without lowering actual toxic risks would be a failure to achieve

the intended policy effect.

          Our second dependent variable is “toxic risk,” which more accurately represents the true

policy effect. Toxic risk is constructed by multiplying each chemical by a measure of its toxicity

and summing the results, an approach based on EPA’s Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators

(RSEI) Version 2.1.2, which was published in 2004.11 Figures 1 and 2 show the trends of the


11 EPA’s RSEI model provides two different indicators to measure human health risks. The first is a “hazard score”,
which considers only the toxicity of each chemical. It is constructed by multiplying the amount of emissions by a
numerical weight reflecting the chemical’s toxicity. The weights range from 0.01 for sulfuric acid to 1,000,000 for
thorium dioxide. The second, a more sophisticated indicator, is a “risk score”, which takes into account the




                                                         11
dependent variables during the past fifteen years.12 Both variables are normalized by their 1988

values.13 While the toxic release level has been steadily decreasing since the first TRI

information was disclosed in 1988, toxic risk seems to have stagnated and continued to decrease

only very slowly after a dramatic decline in the early years. It is worth noting that in 1989,

immediately after the first disclosure of TRI information, toxic risk slightly increased, implying

that plants changed their emissions to release more high-toxicity chemicals even though they

reduced the total quantity of releases in that year. After that spike, plants began to reduce the

actual risk.14




population affected as well as toxicity. Even though the risk score is a more comprehensive measure, we use the
hazard score as a risk indicator because county population is already accounted for on the right side of our estimating
equations (or is absorbed by fixed effects).
12 The media included in the construction of toxic release measures in this study are fugitive air, stack air, direct
water air and water release. The toxic release level and toxic risk measures in this study are constructed using
chemicals with unchanged reporting requirements over the study period 1994-1999. The toxic release level variable
is constructed with only the number of pounds of chemicals that are modeled and accounted for in toxic risk measure.
Thus, the toxic release level and the toxic risk measure contain exactly same set of chemicals.
13 The initial year’s toxic release is 1.97 billion pounds. The initial year’s toxic risk is a score of 1.70 trillion. Even
though the toxicity considers whether the toxin causes cancer or not, the risk score is not a quantitative risk estimate
(e.g., excess cases of cancer) (EPA, 2004). It is based on toxicity weights derived from various factors. The expected
outcomes of the high level of risk scores and how much more that high risk score is harmful is uncertain. This also
reveals the difficulty and uncertainty of interpretation.
14 This could result from a delayed response by the public due to the burden of interpretation of raw TRI data,
preventing them from pushing plants to decrease releases of high toxicity chemicals. It is also possible that the
trends in the toxic release level and toxic risk could be the result of simple correlation between the two. Even if
public attention focused only on reduction of the toxic release level, without any effort to interpret this quantity
information into risk, a reduction in the release level without a change in the mix of chemicals being emitted would
lower toxic risk.

Explanatory Variables

         To isolate the impact of state TRI programs on toxic releases, other factors that might

affect county-level emissions are included as controls. Time-invariant factors will be controlled

by county-level fixed effects. Categories of time-varying factors appearing as explanatory

variables in the regression model include: county demographic characteristics, economic

conditions, related state policies, and state TRI programs. All explanatory variables are all lagged

in order to link the impacts of the explanatory variables to toxic release levels for subsequent

years.

         Demographic characteristics are associated with the potential for collective action by

communities, which might affect the toxic release levels of neighboring plants. Variables that

capture community capacity for collective action include: percent Hispanic (%Hispanic), percent

African American (%Black), and median household income (Income). All else being equal,

counties with high percentages of minorities tend to have higher toxic release levels, so the

coefficients of Hispanic and Black are expected to be positive. Conversely, median household

income might have a negative impact on toxic release levels, implying a negative coefficient on

the Income variable. Percentages of Hispanics and African Americans are measured at the county

level from Census data.15 Median household incomes are from Small Area Income and Poverty


15 The Census data are collected decennially. The county-level demographic characteristic data are estimated by the
Census Bureau, using a mathematical formula to take into account differences between the postcensal time series
population estimates for the 1990s and Census 2000. More details on the estimates data can be found at
http://www.census.gov/popest/topics/methodology/2006_st_co_meth.html

          Economic status is included as an explanatory variable, as it reveals not only the

economic activity of counties, but also economic resources that counties might have. We

include the unemployment rate (Unemploy) as a measure of economic status, as a higher

unemployment rate may reflect a downturn in manufacturing activity, resulting in reduced

emissions. Thus, the coefficient of Unemploy is expected to be negative. Unemployment rate data

come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and are measured at the county level.

          Variables representing related state policies are included because state efforts to deal with

pollution might influence the toxic release level in addition to the TRI program.18 State health

expenditure per capita (Health) is included as an explanatory variable. Per capita health

expenditure is state spending for general health activities and improvement of public health,19

which includes spending for the regulation of air and water quality, plus expenditures for EPA-




16 The annual county-level median household incomes come from estimates produced by SAIPE. The estimates are
based on statistical models that use decennial census data, household survey data, administrative records data, and
population estimates. More details on the estimates can be found at http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/saipe/
17 Even though demographic characteristic variables are included as explanatory variables, there seems to be little
variation over time..
18 Bui (2005) found in her plant-level panel data analysis that states’ regulatory stringency of non-toxic pollutants
lowered toxic emission levels in petroleum refineries. While Bui used state-level attainment/non-attainment status for
the criteria air pollutants as a proxy for states’ regulatory stringency of non-toxic air pollution, this study uses the
Health variable as a proxy for states’ general environmental regulatory stringency. We also explored the possibility of
using county attainment/non-attainment status as an additional control variable. However, over the years of our
sample, this is a fixed effect for all but a few counties, so that attainment status is insignificant when included.
19 States’ per capita health expenditure does not include public assistance programs such as the Medicaid/Medicare
program spending and nursing home operation.




                                                            14
funded programs, such as the Superfund program for the cleanup of hazardous waste sites.20 It is

a state-level variable (rather than county) and is obtained from government censuses. Thus, per

capita health expenditure is expected to represent the intensiveness of the state’s associated

environmental policy. It is expected to have a negative effect on the toxic release level, with a

negative sign of Health coefficient.

          As key explanatory variables, we include state TRI dissemination efforts (Dissemination)

and state data processing efforts (Processing). These variables are generated using the annual

States’ TRI Program Assessment Survey done by the National Conference of State Legislatures

(NCSL).21 This survey collects basic information about state TRI programs and includes various

questions on state implementation status regarding the TRI data.22 Among a diverse range of

questions, items associated with state information provision efforts for the public are selected and

categorized into two types, as noted above – the TRI data dissemination efforts and the TRI data

processing efforts. Using these, we generate the two key explanatory variables, Dissemination


20 The Superfund program, which was enacted by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act of 1980, establishes funds and authority to cleanup toxic releases and abandoned hazardous waste,
including long-term remedial action to deal with toxic releases. Furthermore, the Superfund designates parties
potentially responsible for the contamination of a Superfund site, which affects the efficacy of the TRI program. For
instance, Hamilton (1995) also found that the impact of TRI disclosure on stock price was significantly smaller for
companies that were already known as polluters through Superfund Liabilities.
21 From 1992 to 1999, The NCSL has annually conducted the State TRI Program Assessment Survey at the request
of the Toxic Release Inventory Project of the Forum on State and Tribal Toxics Action (FOSTTA). All 50 states have
completed the assessment during 8 years. However, only 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1998 survey data were used for this
study since the target questions are commonly found only for those years.
22 The NCSL’s State TRI Program Assessment Survey collects basic information and status about states’ TRI
programs, including states’ data use and management, the TRI data dissemination efforts to the public, states’ own
data processing and health risk analyses, and staffing and funding.

and Processing. If a state provides one of the following – EPA’s TRI data document, EPA’s TRI

data diskette, or a TRI data reading room – the Dissemination variable is coded as 1, indicating

that the state is making an effort to facilitate the public’s ability to obtain and access to the EPA’s

TRI raw data. If a state provides one of the following -- the state’s own data analysis, annual TRI

reports, and other state TRI documents -- the Processing variable is coded as 1, indicating that the

state is making an effort to provide structured and interpreted information such as health effects

and risk analysis or trend and ranking analyses. Table 1 shows the survey questions used to

construct these key explanatory variables and the correlations between questions.



                                           [Insert Table 1]



        Out of the fifty states, 27 (54%) provided at least one type of dissemination effort during

all four years, and only one (2%) did nothing regarding data dissemination during that period.

When it comes to data processing efforts, 24 states (48%) provided at least one type of data

processing effort during all four years, while seven states (14%) made no data processing efforts

during that period. The rest of the states have changed their data dissemination and processing

efforts over time, producing time-variant Dissemination and Processing variables. Table 2 shows

each state’s status regarding its data dissemination efforts and data processing efforts during the

four target years. Two types of state TRI programs show a slight positive correlation (Pearson’s

R=0.203, P-value=0.004).

Regression Models

         The regression models are presented in Equation (1). The dependent variable in the first

model is the toxic release level measured in pounds; in the second model it is toxic risk. The

dependent variables are converted into logarithmic form to reflect relative scales of toxic release

values. All explanatory variables are lagged to incorporate the impact of variables on the toxic

releases in subsequent years. Year dummies are included to capture year-specific effects. Time-

invariant factors are controlled using county-level fixed effects.

ESTIMATION RESULTS

          Table 4 presents the ordinary least square estimation results of the toxic release level

model and the toxic risk model. Estimation results report standard errors that are robust to

heteroskedasticity and serial correlation.24 F-statistics for the 1699 county-level fixed effects

confirm that the fixed effects are jointly significant for both models (F=31.90, P-value=0.000;

F=25.83, P-value=0.000). Joint significance tests for the year dummies show that they are jointly

valid in the toxic release level model (F=18.28, P=0.000) but are not significant in the toxic risk

model (F=2.03, P-value=0.107). This is consistent with Figure 1 and 2, in which toxic release

level show a dramatic decreasing trend while toxic risk shows a relatively stagnant trend from

1995 to 1999.



                                                   [Insert Table 4]



          Among the race variables, %Hispanic is positive and significant in the toxic release level

model, implying that a one percent increase in Hispanic population is associated with 5.6 percent

increase in the release level. On the other hand, race is not significant in the toxic risk model

regression. However, this result should be interpreted with caution. Since the racial composition



24 The test for serial correlation in the panel data shows there are significant AR(1) serial correlations for the toxic
release level model (F=7.425, P-value=0.007) and the toxic risk model (F=9.684, P-value=0.002).




                                                           18
of counties is almost time-invariant over the period of this study, there is little time-series

variation in the race variable and most effects associated with race are likely to be absorbed by

the county fixed effects.

        Median household income is insignificant for both toxic release level and toxic risk. The

unemployment rate, however, has a significant impact on both toxic release and toxic risk,

indicating that a one percent higher unemployment leads to 3.4 percent fewer pounds of

emissions and a 4.2 percent reduction in toxic risk. This result might arise because a high

unemployment rate could mean a depressed local economy and limited manufacturing activity,

resulting in lower levels of emissions. Additionally, while state per capita health expenditure has

a significant impact in the toxic release level model, it is not significant in the risk model. One

dollar of additional health expenditure per capita lowered the toxic release level by 0.15 percent.

        The coefficients on the year dummies in both models are all negative, consistent with the

observation that release levels and risk have decreased significantly year by year. The coefficients

of the year dummies in the level model are higher than those of the risk model. This result is

consistent with the trends in Figures 1 and 2, which show a relatively steady decreasing trend of

toxic release level than toxic risk during the years 1995-1999.

        When it comes to the impact of state TRI programs, state dissemination efforts

significantly lowered the level of releases but did not have a significant impact on risk. If states

made an effort to disseminate the raw TRI data by providing EPA’s data document, EPA’s data

diskette, or a reading room, their efforts reduced the release level by 10.3 percent. However, the

same activities are not effective at lowering toxic risk. This implies that state efforts to

disseminate raw TRI data do not help to achieve the policy goal; rather, like similar policies in




                                                  19
health care they only lead to superficial improvements.

        On the other hand, state data processing efforts had a significant negative impact on risk,

but not on release levels. If a state provides processed information to the public through its own

data analysis, annual TRI reports, or other state TRI documents, it lowers risk by 14.2 percent,

even though those efforts show no significant impact on toxic release level. State data processing

efforts thus play a critical role in lowering risk, the underlying goal of the policy.



CONCLUSIONS

        This study evaluated two distinct types of state TRI programs: those that disseminate

data with little analysis and interpretation, and those that provide deeper analysis based on more

extensive data processing. As predicted by information overload theory, programs that produce

low-volume, high-quality data are much more effective than those that simply disseminate large

volumes of complex data. Although the TRI is intended to lower transaction costs for

communities to obtain information and initiate collective action, driving plants to reduce their

toxic releases, our results show that the raw data is too large and complex to be useful without

further interpretation. State data processing efforts, which provide more structured and

interpreted information, contribute significantly to the underlying goal of the TRI by improving

the quality and usefulness of the information for end users. Moreover, we also find that simple

publication of raw data leads to superficial reductions in emissions that are not necessarily

accompanied by real reductions in risk.

        Beyond the TRI itself, our findings confirm the predictions of information overload

theory. Providing processed or value-added information played a significantly role in reducing




                                                  20
information overload and improving the ability of end users to apply the information.

        Finally, this study provides an important general lesson for the design and use of

information disclosure strategies as a regulatory tool. Our findings confirm the results seen in

health care studies that simply making data available may have little effect. Data will be used

only when it clearly and correctly signals underlying information important to end users. Data

released without appropriate processing may exceed the analytical capacity of the target user

group, fail to be utilized at all, or fail to induce the intended behavioral changes on the part of

targeted actors. Thus, the nature of disclosed information and of the information processing

capacity of targeted actors must be considered for policies to be designed effectively. In essence,

our findings highlight the importance of providing information processed to the degree at which

recipients can find the signals they need.
