Social Protection and Economic Development: Are the Poorest Being Lifted-Up or Left-Behind?

                                           ABSTRACT

Standard measures of poverty may reveal nothing about whether the poorest of the poor are being
lifted-up or left-behind, yet this is a widespread concern among policy makers and citizens. The
paper assesses whether public spending on social protection benefits the poorest and hence lifts
the floor, and what role economic development plays. Evidence is presented for the developing
world and the US. Across developing countries, a higher mean income comes with a higher floor.
The bulk of this income effect is direct rather than via higher spending on social protection. That
spending generally lifts the floor though this is mainly due to social insurance; on average, social
assistance adds only 1.5 cents per day to the floor. Turning to the US, the paper finds that the
floor has been sinking over the last 30 years, associated with an inequitable growth process. Food
stamp spending partially compensates the poorest, and helped stabilize the floor in the wake of
the 2008 financial crisis. The poorest in the US gain more from food stamps than average
spending on food stamps, though the program’s impact on the floor per $ spent has fallen over
time.

1.       Introduction

         Development policy discussions often emphasize the need to assure that the poorest are
not being “left behind.” For example, the title of the 2017 Policy Paper of the UK’s Department
for International Development (DFID) is “Leaving No One Behind: Our Promise,” and the
paper’s main theme is DFID’s goal of prioritizing “the poorest of the poor.” One can find many
prominent examples of public claims suggesting that DFID’s concern is neither isolated nor
unjustified—claims that the poorest are in fact being “left behind.” 2
         This concern about the poorest echoes an important school of moral philosophy that has
argued that we should judge a society’s progress by its ability to enhance the living standards of
the poorest, as exemplified by the principle of justice proposed by Rawls (1971). This principle
is often advocated for practice, including in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, which
advocate effort to “ensure no one is left behind” (UN, 2017), and the Swiss Constitution, which
states that: “…the strength of a people is measured by the well-being of its weakest members.”
         But how can we implement this idea, and test whether or not the “poorest are left
behind”? This can be interpreted as referring to the lowest level of material living. That lower
bound can be called the “floor.” If the poorest have been left behind then the floor will have
stayed put; if the poorest benefit then it will be lifted. This idea of the floor should not be
confused with the “biological floor.” Human physiology makes it highly plausible that there is a
biological minimum, given that there are strictly positive nutritional requirements for basal
metabolism and normal activities. However, economic development and the institutions of
(private and public) redistribution can in principle assure that the lower bound is lifted above the
biological floor. The question is whether, and to what extent, that happens in reality.
         The idea of lifting the floor above the mere biological minimum for survival has long
played a prominent role in social policy discussions. Direct interventions have been used against
poverty in rich countries and are becoming popular in poorer ones. The policies concerned are of
various types with various labels, including “anti-poverty programmes,” “targeted interventions,”

2
 For example, in 2011, the U.N.’s Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon claimed that: “The poorest of the world are
being left behind. We need to reach out and lift them into our lifeboat.” (This was at the launch of the report: United
Nations, 2011). Similarly, in 2014, the International Labor Organization’s Director-General, Guy Ryder, wrote that
“Poverty is not yet defeated. Far too many are being left behind.” Also, the Vatican’s representative to the United
Nations claimed in 2015 that the poorest of the world are being left behind (James, 2015).


                                                           2
“social safety nets,” “social assistance,” “social insurance” and “social protection.” Following
the World Bank’s usage, we shall put them all under the heading “social protection” (SP). 3 SP
coverage in the developing world has expanded rapidly over the last 20 years, with one or more
programs now found in most countries (Ravallion, 2017). In terms of population coverage, the
two largest social assistance programs are clearly China’s Di Bao program (a cash program
targeted to the poor) and India’s National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (a workfare
scheme), both of which can be interpreted as efforts to lift the floor—to assure a minimum
standard of living above the biological floor. However, there are continuing concerns that such
efforts are not having much impact on poverty. 4 Various reasons are given including a lack of
political will, weak administrative capacity for policy implementation, ignorance of their rights
among poor people, and social stigma associated with targeted programs.
         The main approach to assessing the poverty impacts of social policies has been to
compare measures of poverty before and after policy intervention. For transfer policies, this is
typically done by comparing measures based on the observed gross income distributions with
those for the distributions obtained by subtracting reported transfer receipts for each household. 5
This can be called the “counting approach.” There is a large literature on that approach, in which
various axioms for a desirable poverty measure have been proposed. The aggregate measure is
usually a population-weighted average of individual measures across the population (counting
the non-poor as having zero poverty); Atkinson (1987) characterizes the class of additive
measures in the literature. The most widely used measure in practice is the headcount index,
giving the proportion of the population living below the poverty line. Higher weight can also be


3
  Public spending on SP is sometimes called “social spending” although this term might also be taken to include
public health and education spending. To avoid any confusion we will use the more precise term “SP spending.”
4
  With regard to the two examples above, on the Di Bao program see Ravallion and Chen (2015) and on the India
program see Dutta et al. (2014). Evidence on the under-coverage of poor people in cash transfer programs (in Latin
America) can be found in Robles et al. (2015). Casual observations of specific antipoverty policies in practice have
also expressed concerns about leaving the poorest behind. For example, an article in the Economist magazine (2015)
on China’s poor-area development programs asked how much those programs have helped reduce poverty, and the
article’s answer referred to how little living standards had risen in one clearly very poor village (in Shanxi) that had
apparently been left behind.
5
  This has been the main approach in the literature on benefit-incidence analysis (Kakwani, 1986; van de Walle,
1998). Recent examples include Lindert et al. (2006), Martinez-Vazquez (2008), the country studies summarized in
Lustig et al. (2014) and Piketty et al. (2018). There is also a literature on the effects of social spending on health and
education outcomes for which a different approach is required since one cannot simply net out the gains from social
spending; examples include Anand and Ravallion (1993), Bidani and Ravallion (1997) and Haile and Nino-Zarazua
(2018). Here we focus on (cash or imputable in-kind) transfers.

                                                            3
put on poorer people. An example is the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) (1984) squared poverty
gap (SPG), which weighs poverty gaps by poverty gaps in forming the aggregate measure.
           The literature on the counting approach has found that absolute poverty measures tend to
be lower in countries with a higher mean income, and that these measures tend to fall in growing
economies. 6 There is also evidence that social protection spending has generally reduced poverty
when measured using the counting approach. For example, in the cross-country data set that we
use in this paper we find that SP spending in developing countries roughly halves the average
poverty gap index (the agregate gap below the poverty line normalized by the line). Despite
often-heard claims to the contrary, the evidence also suggests that America’s antipoverty
programs have reduced poverty, though there has been debate on the extent of this impact. 7 The
counting approach suggests that, as a rule (and there are exceptions), economic development and
social protection tend to reduce poverty.
           While the counting approach is of obvious interest and importance, it does not adequately
address prevailing concerns about whether the poorest are being left behind. To illustrate the
inadequacy of prevailing approaches, Figure 1 shows two pairs of cumulative distribution
functions with and without a social protection policy (or before and after economic growth).
There is first order dominance in both panels (a) and (b)—an unambiguous change in the
aforementioned class of standard (additive) poverty measures. But there is a big difference. In
(a), the floor has not risen, but in (b) it has. The poorest in (a) have been “left behind.” Existing
poverty measures (including those that give higher weight to poorer people) can readily fall
without any change in the floor, as in Figure 1, panel (a). Instead, we need to measure the floor,
side-by-side with the counting approach.
           This is not easy. There are limits to how well we could ever hope to measure the floor
from standard household surveys. The sampling frame is typically those who live in some form
of dwelling, so homeless people and those living in institutions (such as worker dormitories or
prisons) are under-represented or even excluded, and they could well be concentrated among the
poorest stratum. For example, recent rural migrants in cities living in dormitories or slums could
well be under-represented. Ideally one would use something like the lower bound of mean
household consumption or income, measured accurately over a much longer period than what is

typically measured with survey data. If we were to know the true consumption observed over a
long enough period in panel data for a large-enough sample we could reliably estimate the floor
directly as this long-run mean. But that is not the data normally available. And we must
recognize the existence of measurement errors in the cross-sectional survey data available for
most countries. There are also likely to be transient effects in those data, whereby observed
incomes (or consumption expenditures) in a survey fall temporarily below the floor (such as due
to seasonality or a spell of illness), but recover later. Given the measurement errors and transient
factors, there is a non-negligible chance that the observed consumption or income of potentially
anyone within some stratum of low observed values could in fact be the level of the floor. Some
form of averaging is clearly necessary.
       Here we follow the approach to measuring the floor in Ravallion (2016b). The essential
idea is to estimate the floor by taking a weighted mean of the observed consumptions or incomes
(depending on the data) within some stratum that is agreed to be poor. The weights reflect our
uncertainty about who is the poorest, but highest weight is given to the lowest observed value,
declining thereafter within the stratum. Ravallion (2016b) did not study national values of the
floor or the role played by social protection. Here we do national estimates, and explore how the
floor varies with social protection spending and what role a higher mean income plays.
       The following section outlines our approach to measuring the floor, while Section 3
discusses how social protection and economic development might impact the floor. We then turn
to illustrative evidence. First we look at cross-country evidence on the level of the floor across
developing countries, how much it responds to aggregate public spending on SP, and the
differences between countries in the efficacy of that spending in lifting the floor (Section 4).
Then we turn in Section 5 to the US where we focus on a single program, the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), including SNAP’s role in preventing the floor from
falling in a period of inequitable economic growth and financial crisis. Section 6 concludes.

2.     Measuring the floor

       We need an estimator for the floor that does not require panel data but can be
implemented with (single or repeated) cross-sectional surveys, while recognizing that the lowest
observed income in such a survey is unlikely to be a reliable indicator. We follow the approach
in Ravallion (2016b), which this section summarizes for completness.

                                                  5
        Without loss of generality, we can postulate that any observed income level within a
stratum of poor people has some probability of being the floor. These probabilities are not data,
but there are some defensible assumptions we can make in lieu of the missing data. While we are
uncertain as to whether the lowest observed value is the floor, it seems reasonable to assume that
this value has the highest probability of being the floor—that our data are sufficiently good to
believe that the probability is highest for the person who appears to be the worst off. It also
seems reasonable to assume that the probability of being the poorest household declines as the
observed measure of income rises. And beyond some point it would be reasonable to say that
there is no chance of finding the true floor.
        We have an observed distribution of household income, 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 , i=1,…n, the quantiles of
which are denoted 𝑞𝑞(𝑝𝑝); the mean is denoted m and the median is denoted 𝑦𝑦 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 𝑞𝑞(0.5). There
is a corresponding (unobserved) distribution 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖∗ after eliminating the transient effects and
measurement errors. Let the floor of the 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖∗ distribution be denoted 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
                                                                         ∗
                                                                                = min(𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖∗ , 𝑖𝑖 = 1, … 𝑛𝑛).
               ∗
We can treat 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 as a random variable, with a probability distribution given the data. The task is
to estimate the mean of that distribution based on the observed incomes. We can write this as:
                              ∗
                         𝐸𝐸(𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 |𝑦𝑦) = ∑𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖=1 𝜙𝜙(𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 )𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖                                   (1)
Here the probability that person i, with yi , is the worst off person is φ ( yi ) . This attains its

maximum value for 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = min(𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 , 𝑖𝑖 = 1, … 𝑛𝑛) and then falls monotonically with 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 , until it
reaches zero at some threshold z, above which there is no chance of someone with that income
being the poorest. Those living below the threshold z can be called the “reference group.” (In
applications, it is natural to use prevailing poverty lines for z, but this is not essential.) The
specific functional form satisfying these assumptions proposed by Ravallion (2016b) is:
                       φ ( yi ) = k (1 − yi / z )α for y i ≤ z                                      (2)
                               = 0 for yi > z
Here there are three parameters, k, α and z, all positive constants. The k parameter assures that the
probabilities add up to unity, which requires that k = 1 /(nPα ) where Pα is the FGT measure:
                                 1
                         𝑃𝑃𝛼𝛼 = 𝑛𝑛 ∑𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 ≤𝑧𝑧(1 − 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 /𝑧𝑧)𝛼𝛼                                        (3)

SPG is for 𝛼𝛼 = 2 and the poverty gap (PG) index is for 𝛼𝛼 = 1. However, the interpretation of α
is different to that of the FGT index. Here 𝛼𝛼 determines how fast the chance of being the poorest
person falls with y, rather than the aversion to inequality among the poor, as in the FGT index.

                                                               6
         We can then derive the following formula for the expected value of the floor:
                                ∗
                           𝐸𝐸(𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 |𝑦𝑦) = 𝑧𝑧(1 − 𝑃𝑃𝛼𝛼+1 /𝑃𝑃𝛼𝛼 ) (𝛼𝛼 ≥ 1)                                             (4)
For example, if we assume that the probability of being the worst off person falls linearly with y
up to z (𝛼𝛼 = 1) then the expected value of the floor is 𝑧𝑧(1 − 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆/𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃). (Note that α = 0 is ruled
out by our assumption that the probability falls as y increases among those with y i ≤ z . 8) We will
call (1 − 𝑃𝑃𝛼𝛼+1 /𝑃𝑃𝛼𝛼 ) the “floor ratio.” Note that the 𝑃𝑃𝛼𝛼 poverty measures and the threshold z are all
measured on the observed distribution of income. Thus the proposed measure of the floor is
operational, in that it can be implemented on readily available data.
         Notice that there is nothing to guarantee that a specific process of poverty-reducing
growth, or a specific spending program that benefits poor people, lifts the floor, based on this
measure. From (4), for a fixed z, lifting the floor requires a larger proportionate reduction in 𝑃𝑃𝛼𝛼+1
than 𝑃𝑃𝛼𝛼 , i.e., a greater response of the more distribution-sensitive measure. 9 For example, for 𝛼𝛼 =
1, and denoting the mean of the observed distribution by m, we have:
                                      ∗
                           𝜕𝜕 ln 𝐸𝐸(𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 )        𝜕𝜕 ln 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃       𝜕𝜕 ln 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆         𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆/𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃
                                                 =�                −                  ��                   �             (5)

Later we address the empirical question of how the floor responds to a higher mean. But first we
need to address some theoretical issues that arise when we introduce social protection spending.

3.       Social protection, economic development and the floor

         We now explore further how one might expect the floor to respond to both economic
development—defined as a rising mean income—and public spending on social protection.
                                                                                                               ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
         Introducing social protection: We now distinguish the pre-transfer floor (𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ) from its
                         ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝                                                    ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
post-transfer value (𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ). We are interested in how 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 varies with both SP spending per
capita, denoted 𝜏𝜏, and overall economic development as measured by the mean m of the observed
distribution (y). It is assumed that SP spending is financed by domestic taxes, so that m is the
same before and after transfers.




8
  If one uses 𝛼𝛼 = 0 then every consumption below z is deemed equally likely to be the lowest, so z(1-PG/H) is the
equally-weighted mean for the poor, where H is the headcount index.
9
  This is a natural consequence of putting higher weight on lower observed incomes when calculating the floor.

                                                                       7
                                              ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
        We can start by thinking of 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 as being determined by how the overall mean, m, is
                                                                                                      ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝      ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
shared within an economy, while the gain in the floor from SP spending, 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 − 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 , is
determined by how that spending is shared. This suggests a separable structure of the form:
                          ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
                         𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 𝜗𝜗(𝑚𝑚) + 𝜑𝜑(𝜏𝜏)                                                                            (6)
Here 𝜗𝜗(. ) and 𝜑𝜑(. ) are the sharing functions determining the pre-transfer floor and the gains
from SP respectively. These functions need not be increasing; for example, the nature of the
growth process may put downward pressure on the floor. A special case is when the poorest
receive the mean SP spending, which we test as the null hypothesis that:
                          ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝      ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
                         𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 + 𝜏𝜏                                                                              (7)
                                           ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝            ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
There are numerous reasons why 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 − 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 could differ from 𝜏𝜏, including successful efforts

at targeting the poorest (𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 − 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 > 𝜏𝜏), administrative costs, losses due to corruption, or
                                                                          ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝       ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
social exclusion of the poorest (all resulting in 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 − 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 < 𝜏𝜏).
        Our empirical analysis follows standard practice in benefit-incidence analysis of
estimating the pre-transfer distribution by subtracting transfers received at the household level.
This ignores behavioral responses such as through saving, labor supply or private transfers. In
defense, it might be argued that strong behavioral responses are unlikely among the poorest, who
have the least scope for substitution. However, that might be considered a strong assumption.
        We can provide a partial test of that assumption, which can be thought of as a consistency
check on our empirical analysis. The transfer received by the poorest is denoted 𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 . If there
                                                                   ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝            ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
are behavioral responses by the poorest then 𝑦𝑦�𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 − 𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 will underestimate the true
         ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝                                                                                    ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝       ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
value, 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 . The extent of the error due to behavioral responses is 𝑏𝑏 ≡ 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 − 𝑦𝑦�𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ≥ 0. Our
                                                      ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
test assumes that: (i) the true value of 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 is a function of the mean, m, as discussed above, and
(ii) the behavioral effect b is non-decreasing function of mean spending. Thus:
                          ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
                         𝑦𝑦�𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 𝜗𝜗(𝑚𝑚) − 𝑏𝑏(𝜏𝜏)                 (𝑏𝑏′(𝜏𝜏) ≥ 0)                                             (8)
The test is then to see if there is a partial correlation between the estimated pre-transfer floor and
                                                                                                                                     ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
mean spending at a given value of mean income. Intuitively, when it is correctly measured, 𝑦𝑦�𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
should not vary with the level of SP spending at a given mean income.
        The separability in (6) might be considered a strong assumption. A higher mean income
may well come with administrative capabilities (including better information systems) that allow
governments to better reach the poorest. To see how, suppose that economic development brings

                                                                      8
structural changes such that a rising share of national income is derived from formal-sector
activities amenable to taxation. Engels Law implies this as long as the income elasticity of
demand for informal sector activities is less than unity. Given that agriculture is the main
informal sector in developing countries it is reasonable to assume that economic growth in such
countries comes with formalization, generating greater administrative capability including for
effective SP. Then it can be expected that economic development allows higher public spending
on SP and supports a greater capacity to make that spending effective in reaching the poorest. To
give another example, lack of knowledge about how to access public programs has often been
identified as a factor weakening the coverage of poor people by social protection policies. 10 At
the same time, economic development tends to come with higher literacy rates, which can be
expected to promote greater knowledge, and greater efficacy in dealing with public
administrations. Then the marginal gains to the poorest from higher SP spending will tend to rise
with mean income when comparing different countries.
         Instead of equation (6) we write the relationship in the more general form:
                             ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
                           𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 𝑓𝑓(𝜏𝜏, 𝑚𝑚)                                                                  (9)
Here 𝑓𝑓 is some (smooth) function. (Following the discussion in the previous section, we do not
                                                                                                        ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
assume that this function is increasing in its arguments.) So the pre-transfer floor is 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 =
𝜗𝜗(𝑚𝑚) = 𝑓𝑓(0, 𝑚𝑚). We shall test separability. When the cross-partial derivative 𝑓𝑓𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 is positive we
will say that there is weak complementarity. The degree of complementarity plays a role in how
economic development impacts the floor, as discussed further below.
         It is also of interest to know how much differences in the impact of SP on the floor stem
from differences in the overall level of spending versus differences in transfer efficiency. For this
purpose we measure what we term Floor Transfer Efficiency (FTE), defined as:
                                         ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝   ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
                           𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 = (𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 − 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 )/𝜏𝜏                                                     (10)
We also measure the efficiency of transfers in reaching poor people as a whole. Here a standard
measure in the literature is what we term Gap Transfer Efficiency (GTE), defined as the share of
total transfers received by the poor, which is the reduction in the aggregate poverty gap per $
spent. 11

   GTE is standard output in the ADePT Social Protection software used by the World Bank (Tesliuc and Leite,
2010), although there it is called the “cost-benefit ratio.” We prefer our terminology.

        Economic development and the floor: We can identify two channels in how economic
development impacts the floor. The first is direct, in that it holds at any given level of SP
spending. This channel arises through the distribution of the market income gains associated with
economic growth. Intuitively, the more “pro-poor” the growth process—such as the more it
augments demand for relatively unskilled labor—the stronger is this direct channel. However,
being “pro-poor” is not the same thing as reaching the poorest, as discussed in the Introduction
and Section 2; poverty measures can fall yet the poorest are left behind. Indeed, we may see a
sinking floor with certain growth processes. Suppose, for example, that growth is generated by
greater trade openness and technological change, both of which put downward pressure on
unskilled wages and hence the floor. Then we could see the floor fall as the mean rises.
        The second channel is indirect, via higher SP spending. As has long been recognized, a
potentially important channel by which economic growth can reduce poverty is via higher SP
spending. 12 But is this channel important in practice, and does it embrace the poorest? The
growth may be heavily concentrated among an elite who use their economic power to further
reinforce their positions by promoting political opposition to redistributive tax and spending
policies, with implications for the poorest as well as many others. Alternatively, the growth may
come with similar or even large gains to electorally influential middle-class citizens who then
support anti-poverty efforts, for either altruistic reasons or as insurance given the down-side risks
they face. We will be interested in the combined effect of these two channels as well as the
components, to see how the level of the floor varies with the level of economic development
allowing social policies to adjust.
        A simple theoretical model of the political economy of the indirect channel provides
some insights. 13 In keeping with Meltzer and Richard (1981), let us assume that the overall level
of SP spending is chosen by the median voter. In the present context, what is the relevant
distribution for identifying the median voter? Even if 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖∗ − 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 has zero mean, the observed
median need not equal the true median. One might argue that the observed median is more
relevant to the political economy of transfer policy, as this reflects transient factors that could
still sway electors. Against this view, the observed distribution also includes measurement errors



12
   See, for example, the discussion in Anand and Ravallion (1993). The UN’s Human Development Reports have
often emphasized this channel; see, for example, United Nations (2016).
13
   This is not the only model one can write down, but it will suffice for this purpose.

                                                     10
that may or may not matter to electoral outcomes. Here we will assume that the relevant median,
𝑦𝑦 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 , is that of the observed distribution. The model can be modified to allow the alternative
assumption that it is the median of the 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖∗ distribution that matters. Of course, for our empirical
work we have no choice but to use the observed medians.
         A uniform tax 𝜏𝜏 is levied to finance SP spending, which depletes the current net income
of the median voter. 14 The median voter is assumed to also care about the floor. This could be
due to altruism or a self-interested concern about personally falling to the floor in the future. And
the median voter is assumed to take account of the effects of higher SP spending on the floor.
The utility function is 𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦) which is strictly increasing and concave. The median voter faces the
average tax needed to finance the spending on SP, so the choice of 𝜏𝜏 maximizes:
                                                                                          ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
                                      𝑢𝑢(𝑦𝑦 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 − 𝜏𝜏) + 𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌(𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 )                                  (0 < 𝜌𝜌 < 1)            (11)
Where 𝜌𝜌 is the altruism weight on the utility of the poorest, or the probability of falling to the
floor in the future. We allow the possibility that 𝑓𝑓𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 > 0, but that this is bounded above such that:
                                                                  ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
                                       𝑓𝑓𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏        −𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 �𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 �
                                                <              ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝                                                            (12)
                                       𝑓𝑓𝜏𝜏2           𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦 �𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 �

When combined with our assumption that u(y) is strictly concave for all y, the condition in (12)
assures that the second-order condition for a unique optimal level of SP spending is satisfied.
         The median voter’s optimal spending on SP, given 𝑦𝑦 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 and m, solves the first-order
condition:
                                      𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦 (𝑦𝑦 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 − 𝜏𝜏) = 𝜌𝜌𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦 (𝑓𝑓(𝜏𝜏, 𝑚𝑚))𝑓𝑓𝜏𝜏 (𝜏𝜏, 𝑚𝑚)                                      (13)
We can write the solution as:
                                       𝜏𝜏 = 𝜏𝜏(𝑦𝑦 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 , 𝑚𝑚)                                                                      (14)

14
   Instead one can posit a tax on the median voter that is an increasing function of 𝜏𝜏 without changing the main
argument.
15
   We treat 𝜌𝜌 as a constant in the following derivation. Instead, one might prefer to assume that altruism develops as
the mean income rises—that altruism gets little weight in very poor societies. Then 𝜌𝜌 can be treated as a rising
function of m. This adds an extra positive effect to 𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚 in the following analysis.

                                                                              11
While 𝜏𝜏𝑦𝑦 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 > 0 (given (10) and 𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 < 0), the sign of 𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚 is ambiguous. The model allows the
possibility that a higher mean at given median—interpretable as higher “inequality”—lowers SP
spending. A key issue here is the degree of complementarity between SP spending (higher 𝜏𝜏) and
economic development (higher m) in raising the floor, as indicated by the cross-partial derivative
𝑓𝑓𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 (equation 15.2). Complementarity can arise in a number of ways. Countries that are more
developed economically may well have greater administrative capabilities for reaching the
poorest of the poor. This may also reflect specifics about the type of SP spending; if this
facilitates the promotional objective whereby poor people receiving transfers are empowered or
incentivized to participate directly in economic development then there is complementarity.
Suppose that 𝑓𝑓𝜏𝜏 > 0, 𝑓𝑓𝑚𝑚 > 0 and that:
                                                                   ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
                                          𝑓𝑓𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏         −𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 �𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 �
                                                     >           ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝                          (16)
                                         𝑓𝑓𝜏𝜏 𝑓𝑓𝑚𝑚        𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦 �𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 �

If this condition holds then we will say that there is strong complementarity between economic
development and SP spending in how they influence the level of the floor. It is evident from
(15.2) that strong complementarity implies that 𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚 > 0. However, suppose instead that the
separability in (6) holds, or that there is substitutability between a higher mean income and SP
spending in determining the floor (𝑓𝑓𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 < 0). Then we have 𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚 ≤ 0.
        When we consider the bivariate relationship between SP spending and economic
development we need to bring in the effect of a higher mean on the median. The total effect of
economic development on SP spending is:
                               𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                           𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
                               𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
                                    = 𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚 + 𝜏𝜏𝑦𝑦 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚                                            (17)

Intuitively, the higher the impact of m on 𝑦𝑦 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 the more “equitable” the growth process can be
said to be. (Indeed, we can think of 𝑚𝑚/𝑦𝑦 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 as an indicator of inequality as noted.) Of course,
the implications for the floor also depend on the incidence of SP spending.
        Though our model is simple, it can be used to illustrate a wide range of possibilities.
Consider the following stylized, but illustrative, cases.
        Case 1: Equitable growth brings both a direct and indirect gain to the poorest. In this
case, growth in the mean lifts the floor directly (𝑓𝑓𝑚𝑚 > 0) as well as indirectly via SP spending.
Sufficient conditions for the latter channel to work are that growth in the mean also lifts the
          𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
median,                 ≥ 0, and that there is strong complementarity. Then the effect on the floor is:

Recall that if the function 𝑓𝑓(𝜏𝜏, 𝑚𝑚) only exhibits weak complementarity (or substitutability) then
                                                                                                                                ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝

that neither SP spending nor the level of the floor respond positively to a higher mean income.
                                                                                                       ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
                                                                              𝑓𝑓𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏      −𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 �𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 �
To illustrate one possible scenario, suppose that 𝑓𝑓 𝑓𝑓 ≤                                            ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝     , and that economic growth (a

mean (𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚 < 0). Furthermore, suppose that the poorest do not share directly in overall economic
gains (𝑓𝑓𝑚𝑚 = 0). Then 𝑓𝑓𝑚𝑚 + 𝑓𝑓𝜏𝜏 𝜏𝜏𝑚𝑚 < 0, i.e., the floor falls as the mean rises.

4.      Cross-country evidence

        We first take the ideas of the last two sections to a cross-country setting. Here we mainly
rely on the World Bank's “Atlas of Social Protection” (ASPIRE) as accessed mid-2017. 16 This
draws on 262 household surveys in 122 countries in the developing world, from 1998 to 2014. 17
All currency conversions were done at purchasing power parity (for 2005 as the base).
        In the World Bank’s classification, SP spending comprises social insurance (mainly
public pension schemes covering old age and disability), social assistance (cash and in-kind
transfers and workfare schemes, often targeted to the poor), and labor market programs (training,
entrepreneurship support, unemployment benefits). There is clearly a degree of substitutability

16
   ASPIRE is essentially a cross-country compilation of the outputs from a software program produced by the World
Bank, ADePT Social Protection. Tesliuc and Leite (2010) provide a user manual. The ASPIRE team kindly provided
detailed output tables from this software by country which we used to build our data set.
17
   We dropped Zimbabwe from the ASPIRE data as there were clearly serious data quality problems. (There have
been numerous problems with Zimbabwe’s data in recent times, so this problem was not unexpected.) Whenever SP
spending data are used we also dropped Sierra Leone, for which the ASPIRE data show an extremely small positive
level of spending relative to the estimated gain in the floor. This may well be a data error. When we take logs the
very large negative value for Sierra Leone creates a clear outlier.

                                                                         13
among these components; if a country is less generous in social insurance it may make up for
this using social assistance. We include all components of SP in our analysis. However (as we
will see), a large share of SP spending is contributory pensions. 18 We shall comment on the
implications of separating out this component as it is rather different given that receipts reflect,
in part, past contributions (though governments can still influence current disbursements). Thus
we also provide results for social assistance on its own.
          One option is to estimate the floor by fixing the poverty line across countries at (say) the
World Bank’s international line. This approach was rejected as it yields very small subsamples
for estimating the floor in many countries, and hence volatile measures. Instead we use poverty
lines set at 𝑞𝑞(0.2) across all countries, i.e., the poorest 20% in each country define the reference
group. The ASPIRE data set provides PG and SPG, and we use these two measures to construct
our estimates of the floor for 𝛼𝛼 = 1. The value of 𝑞𝑞(0.2) is then held constant for a given
country when re-calculating the poverty measures net of transfers. In the ASPIRE dataset, the
computations for SPG and PG pre-transfer are done assuming no behavioral responses. We
maintain that assumption, though we provide the test described in Section 3. ASPIRE also
provides data on SP transfers received per capita, which we use as our measure of 𝜏𝜏.
          Summary statistics: Table 1 provides summary statistics. Mean SP spending is $0.88 per
person per day. The bulk of this is contributory pensions ($0.67); social assistance accounts for
almost all the rest ($0.19). The (un-weighted) mean floor post-transfers is $1.69 a day, though
varying widely, from $0.12 to $7.34. There is undoubtedly measurement error; it is very hard to
believe that anyone lives at $0.12 per day. While acknowledging the likely measurement errors,
we focus on the overall patterns in the data, i.e., the (conditional and unconditional) means.
                                      ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝    ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
Figure 2 plots the densities of 𝑦𝑦�𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 and 𝑦𝑦�𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 . The densities are skewed to the right. As we can
observe in panel (b) of Figure 2, a log transformation helps to normalize the distributions of both
floors. We use this transformation in the bulk of the following analysis. When we study the
covariates of the gain in the floor due to SP spending we will use the proportionate gain,
     ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝   ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
ln(𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 /𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ), as our preferred measure.
          SP lifted the floor by $0.48 a day on average (Table 1, comparing post- and pre-
transfers). This is well below the mean spending per capita of $0.88. The estimated value of

  Contributory pensions are classified as social insurance by the World Bank; non-contributory social pensions are
classified as social assistance.

     ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝      ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 − 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 − 𝜏𝜏 is significantly different from zero (t = -3.968). Thus, we can reject the null
hypothesis in (7). We also observe in Table 1 that SP spending reduced the headcount index by
about 7% points on average (recall that the post-transfer index is 20%). There is also a
substantial decline in the average poverty gap index, from 10.9% to 5.8%.
                 The bulk of the impact of SP in developing countries is due to public pensions, which lift
the floor by $0.38 a day (Table 1). This too is below the mean spending on such pensions, which
is $0.67 per day. Social assistance on its own only raised the floor by $0.015 per day on
average—merely 8% of the (already low) level of average spending on social assistance (Table
1). The bulk of the impact of SP on the headcount index (5% points) is also due to contributory
pensions. Social assistance on its own reduced the poverty rate by 2% points.
                 Countries that spend more on social protection tend to have a higher floor. Figure 3 plots
the data; the correlation coefficient is 0.751. Mechanically, this relationship reflects both
differing levels of SP spending and differing transfer efficiencies. Transfer efficiency in reaching
the poorest varies greatly. Figure 4 gives the empirical density function for FTE. 19 (Recall that
this is the ratio of the gain in the floor due to SP to mean spending.) We see that very few
countries attain a value of FTE of unity or more. For the bulk of countries (87% of the sample),
the gain to the poorest is less than mean SP spending. FTE tends to be better for social assistance
on its own, for which the median value is 0.934, as compared to a median of 0.630 for all SP;
43% of countries have FTE for social assistance greater than unity.
                 In addition to FTE, we measure the efficacy of SP in reaching the poorest 20%, giving
our second measure of transfer efficiency, GTE. The two measures are correlated (r = 0.505), but
certainly not perfectly; some countries are better than others at reaching the poorest people given
their efficacy in reaching the poorest 20%. GTE is positively correlated with spending per capita
(r = 0.656), but that is not true for FTE (r = -0.021). As countries spend more on social
protection, a larger share of that spending tends to reach the poorest 20% but not the poorest.
Figure 5 plots the relationships with average SP spending for both FTE and GTE (it is easier to
see if one logs spending per capita). This points to a notable difference in efficacy in reaching the
poorest quintile versus the poorest households. By implication, relative efficiency in reaching the
poorest (FTE/GTE) declines with mean spending (r = -0.430).



19
     Recall that Sierra Leone is dropped; this makes the bulk of the density function easier to see in Figure 3.

                                                             15
        However, the bulk of the variance in the impact of higher SP spending on the floor (as
evident in Figure 3) is due to the variance in aggregate levels of that spending, rather than its
                                                                               ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝   ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
efficiency in reaching the poorest. If one decomposes the variance in ln(𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 − 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ) into the
variance in log spending per capita, the variance in the log of FTE, and the covariance, the first
component accounts for 77%, with the variance in log FTE accounting for 14% and the
covariance representing 9%. (Recall that FTE has a low correlation with sending per capita.)
        It will be recalled that our political economy model in Section 3 suggests that a key factor
in determining the impact of economic growth on the floor is how much the median rises with
the mean. We find a positive relationship. Indeed, the OLS elasticity of the median to the
mean—the regression coefficient of log median on log mean—is not significantly different from
unity; the regression coefficient is 1.012 with a robust standard error of 0.017. Figure 6 plots the
data, showing the strong positive relationship in logs.
        Countries with a higher median tend to have higher SP spending (Figure 7), as in our
theoretical model. The correlation coefficient (between logs) is 0.711. For social assistance on its
own the correlation is lower but still significant (r = 0.545). Given the pattern in Figure 6, it is no
surprise that the bivariate relationships are very similar with the mean, though as we will see
below, the stronger partial correlation is with the median, once one controls for the mean.
        Richer countries tend to have a higher floor. Figure 8 plots the (log) floor, both pre- and
post-transfer, against the (log) mean. Also notice that the two regression lines diverge. The pre-
transfer floor has an elasticity of about 0.8 to the mean, while it is 0.9 for the post-transfer floor.
The income elasticity of the pre-transfer floor is significantly less than unity (t = 3.2), implying
that the (pre-transfer) floor tends to fall as a share of the mean as the latter rises. By contrast, the
income elasticity of the post-transfer floor is not significantly different from unity, implying that
the floor does not fall relative to the mean as economies develop. Thus we see that, on average,
SP spending in developing countries is able to negate the tendency for the pre-transfer floor to
fall as a share of the mean as the mean rises with economic development.
        These elasticities also imply substantial absolute divergence between the floor and the
mean. At the mean points from Table 1, a $1.00 increase in mean income comes with a $0.11
increase in the pre-transfer floor, and a $0.19 increase in the post-transfer floor.
        Despite this strong correlation between the floor and mean income, the FGT poverty
measures do not provide reliable indicators of the level of the floor. Indeed, the (post-transfer)

                                                   16
PG and SPG measures have only weak negative correlations with the (post-transfer) floor; r = -
0.179 and -0.150 respectively. Differences in income distribution (at a given mean) are clearly
clouding these relationships. A much better indicator of the floor is the quantile of the poorest
1% (𝑞𝑞(0.01)) for which r = 0.945. However, for the reasons noted in Section 2, 𝑞𝑞(0.01) could
be a noisy measure. It is no harder to calculate our measure in (4) from the same primary data.
       In terms of the model in Section 3, the strong positive relationship between the level of
the floor and mean income reflects both higher SP spending in richer countries and a direct effect
at given spending. We will now use regressions to separate out these effects.
       Partial correlations: To allow for multiple covariates, we now explore these
relationships further using regressions. (We do not intend that these are to be given a casual
interpretation, but only as a convenient means of testing for partial correlations.)
       First, we reexamine how SP spending varies with the mean, but now controlling for the
median. Recall that our model of the political economy of SP spending implies that the median
matters independently of the mean (equation 13), but only the comparative static effect of the
median is predicted in sign. The expected positive effect of the median is confirmed by the
regressions in Table 2. By contrast, the (log) mean has a negative effect but not significantly
different from zero. This pattern is also found for social assistance on its own (Table 2). This is
inconsistent with strong complementarity (Section 3), although a weaker form of
complementarity may still be present, with 𝑓𝑓𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 > 0 even if equation (16) does not hold. (We will
return to this point.) Note also that the elasticity w.r.t. the median is high, though at mean points
the slope (for total SP) is much lower at 0.49. Of course, this is the partial elasticity, holding the
mean constant. As we have seen, the two variables co-move with an elasticity of about unity; the
elasticity falls by one third if the mean increases at the same rate. What is clear from Table 2 is
that the median is a far stronger predictor of SP spending across countries than the mean.
       Next, we test for behavioral responses by the poorest. Recall that an implication of our
assumption that the pre-transfer floor is the post-transfer value less SP spending received by the
poorest is that we should not find a correlation between the estimated pre-transfer floor and mean
spending (Section 3). While there is a significantly positive (zero-order) correlation between the
pre-transfer floor and average SP spending (r = 0.511), this vanishes when we control for the
mean. The partial correlation falls to 0.068; Figure 9 plots the two series (with log floor predicted
at mean income) while Table 3 gives the regression where we also see clearly that countries with


                                                  17
a higher overall mean have a higher pre-transfer floor. The restriction that SP spending does not
affect the pre-transfer floor at a given mean performs well. This provides support for our
estimation method ignoring any behavioral responses of the poorest.
          Table 3 gives the regressions for the gain in the floor attributed to SP, i.e., our estimate of
     ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝    ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
ln(𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 /𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ). We see that higher aggregate transfers contribute to a larger impact of transfers
on the floor. Noting that we can obtain the regression for the post-transfer floor by adding that
           ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝    ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝          ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
for ln(𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 /𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ) to that for ln(𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ), we see that there is both a direct effect of higher mean
income on the post-transfer floor and an indirect effect, via higher SP spending; the direct effect
is 0.642 (s.e.=0.070). However, when normalized by the total income elasticity of 0.923 (Figure
8), we see that the bulk (70%=0.642/0.923) of the effect is direct.
          We find that there is a positive interaction effect between average transfers and the mean,
which helps in raising the impact of SP on the floor (Table 3, Column 5). This suggests weak
complementarity between SP spending and economic development in how they influence the
efficacy of SP in raising the floor; a higher mean income comes with higher marginal gains to
the poorest from higher public spending on SP.
          One clue to the role played by heterogeneity in transfer effectiveness is to augment the
regressions with gap transfer efficiency; recall that this is the impact of SP spending on the
aggregate poverty gap for the poorest 20% per $ of spending. Here we are interested in seeing
whether countries that are more efficient at reaching the poorest 20% also tend to do better at
lifting the floor, and here we can expect both an additive effect and an interaction effect with
mean transfers. We can go further and allow a complete set of interaction effects, including with
the mean. This augmented specification is in Column (6) of Table 3.
          As expected, there is a strong interaction between GTE and transfer spending in their
effects on the extent to which SP lifts the floor. There is also a negative interaction effect
between mean income and transfer efficiency; it is in poor countries where the effectiveness in
transferring money to the poorest 20% tends to matter more to lifting the floor. When we
evaluate the total effects at the mean points, we find a significant positive effect of SP spending
and GTE on the extent to which those transfers succeed in raising the floor (Table 3, lower
panel). Once we control for the level of transfers and transfer efficiency we do not find that
higher average incomes come with a greater impact of transfers on the floor.

5.       Evidence for the US

         It is of obvious interest to also look at time-series evidence. 20 One reason for choosing
the US for this purpose is the availability of the required data over a long period. Another reason
is that there has been a strong tendency of rising inequality in the US, and limited progress
against poverty pre-transfers. For example, our data indicate that the real value of median family
income grew at only 0.5% per annum over 1988-2016, while 𝑞𝑞(0.2) and the official poverty rate
were essentially stationary. 21 Yet there was sizable growth in top incomes over this period; for
example, 𝑞𝑞(0.99) grew 1.6% per annum in real terms (as shown later). The questions here are:
What happened to the floor in the US over time, and what role did SP play?
         We focus on the largest direct intervention against poverty in the US, the food stamps
program (SNAP). 22 SNAP is a Federal program (administered by the Department of Agriculture)
that helps poor families purchase food. In (fiscal) 2016, SNAP covered about 44 million
Americans (14% of the population) at a cost of $71 billion, representing $125 per person per
month for food stamp beneficiaries. The program is targeted to poor families (below 130% of the
official poverty threshold), and aims to provide larger benefits to poorer families. 23 There are
concerns that the program does not reach all those who are eligible. 24 As a case study, SNAP is
also of interest given that spending levels change substantially over time (as we will see).
         Time series data for a single country are unlikely to have much power for testing the
political economy model of SP spending in Section 3, and so we will not try to explain SNAP
spending by the time series variation in median income (though this may still be an underlying
longer-term property of the data). There are, however, two significant policy changes worth
noting. First, a series of reforms in 1996-98 put emphasis on reducing perceived “leakage” to
those not considered eligible, including greater use of work requirements, though this can also


20
   All standard errors reported in this section are robust to residual autocorrelation as well as heteroscedasticity. We
use the method for estimating robust standard errors in Newey and West (1987), as programmed in EViews 10. We
used the automatic lag specification with the degrees of freedom adjustment.
21
   The trend rate of growth in the median based on the Current Population Survey (discussed below) is 0.528% per
annum (s.e.=0.122%). (All growth rates for incomes in this paper are estimated by the regression coefficient of log
income on the year.) The corresponding growth rate for 𝑞𝑞(0.2) was -0.107% per annum (s.e.=0.161%). Over 1988-
2016, the regression coefficient of the official poverty rate (in %) on the year is 0.016 (s.e.=0.035).
22
   Spending on SNAP overtook the next largest program, the Earned Income Tax Credit, in 2010 (Hoynes, 2012).
23
   For further information and analysis on SNAP see Bartfeld et al. (2016) and Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2016).
On the benefits to children from poor families see Jolliffe et al. (2005). For a broader overview of antipoverty
policies in the US see Ben-Shalom et al. (2012).

   See, for example the discussion in The Economist (2011).

reduce participation by eligible participants including some of the poorest. 25 Time limits and
recertification became stricter; legal immigrants were variously eligible, then ineligible, then
eligible again, but growing concerns about status reduced their participation. Able-bodied adults
without dependents found it harder to access SNAP. Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) was also
introduced around the turn of the century (earlier in some states). 26 It is unclear on a priori
grounds whether this would help the poorest, although the bulk of the decline in FTE appears to
have preceded EBT. Second, spending on the program surged in the aftermath of the 2008
financial crisis and the subsequent rise in unemployment. As a part of the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act, SNAP benefits increased by 14% in April 2009. 27 This “SNAP stimulus”
is consistent with a longer-term pattern of (countercyclical) co-movement between SNAP
spending and the unemployment rate (Hoynes and Schanzenbach, 2016).
         To assess the effects of SNAP on the floor, we use the micro data from the Annual Social
and Economic (ASEC) Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS). 28 We use 29 years
of CPS-ASEC data from 1989 to 2017, which allows us to estimate the floor and SNAP benefit
levels from 1988 to 2016. The CPS is administered by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of
Labor Statistics and collects data from a nationally representative sample of households on
employment, unemployment, earnings, occupation, and hours of work. We are measuring the
floor in terms of income not consumption. 29 The measure of family income we use is the same as
that for the US official poverty estimates. This includes money income before taxes from several
sources (such as wages, salary, net-income from self-employment, social security payments,
pensions, interest, dividends, alimony, other forms of periodic monetary income), but excludes
capital gains and non-cash benefits such as fringe benefits or noncash government social


25
   The first reform was the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act of 1996 (with most
provisions effective from mid-1997), followed by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Agricultural Research,
Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 (USDA, 2017). For further discussion of these reforms to SNAP and
their implications see Currie and Grogger (2001).
26
   EBT entailed that SNAP recipients paid for food using a “debit card.” (If the pin code is verified and the account
balance is adequate then payment is accepted.)
27
   For example, the maximum SNAP benefit for a household of three rose from $463 to $526 per month. Under
ARRA, states could suspend time limits for unemployed able-bodied adults. Subsequent legislation imposed an
expiration date of November 2013 for the 13.6% SNAP benefit increase.
28
   Further information on the CPS can be found in United States Census Bureau (2017).
29
   There has been a debate on the choice between consumption and income as measures of economic welfare,
including in the US (Slesnick, 2001; Meyer and Sullivan, 2012). We do not take a position on this issue here, as we
have little choice for the present purpose given both the data available and the fact that (unlike consumption) income
is additive with respect to SP spending.

                                                         20
assistance programs. 30 As has been noted in the literature on poverty in the US, the official
poverty measure does not reflect the impact of SNAP or the next largest antipoverty program, the
Earned Income Tax Credit, because these income sources are omitted from the income
aggregates used for the official measures. 31 To obtain our “post-SNAP” income distribution, we
add in the face value of the food stamps (or in later years, the credit value on the EBT card).
         We provide results for the US assuming that the poorest household has an observed
income below the official US poverty threshold, which is fixed in real terms over time. However,
the official poverty thresholds vary by family size and composition. 32 It is thus simpler to
express the floor for the US as a proportion of the threshold, though to aid interpretation we
provide some illustrative calculations for a family of four with two children. For consistency
with our cross-country analysis we will also provide calculations using the poorest 20% as the
reference group, i.e., using 𝑞𝑞(0.2) as the fixed threshold for calculating the floor before and after
SNAP. 33 However (unlike the cross-country data), 𝑞𝑞(0.2) is virtually constant, with no trend in
either direction (a regression coefficient of the log of the real value on time of -0.001, with
s.e=0.002). Nor does 𝑞𝑞(0.2) change much over time in real terms; the CV of ln 𝑞𝑞(0.2) is 1.22%.
For most of the analysis we treat 𝑞𝑞(0.2) as fixed before and after SNAP, which appears to be the
most common practice in the literature (as exemplified by the World Bank’s ASPIRE data set
discussed in Section 3). Thus, similarly to the official threshold, we focus on the floor ratio.


30
   The CPS public-release measure of income imposes top-codes on income components, and the methodology for
top-coding changed over our time period in a manner that affects a small number of observations in our analytical
sample. Because top-coding is done by income components and not total income, and because it has not (typically)
been based on winsorizing but rather a hot-deck method, it is possible for poor families to have public-release
income estimates that are greater than the poverty threshold. Some important information on these households can
be extracted from the data because the variable (povllin the unit-record CPS public-release data) creates a series of
bins based on the ratio of family income (as measured by the confidential data) to the family’s poverty threshold.
For example, in the 2008 CPS data there are nine sample observations (from a total of more than 206,000
observations) where income as reported in the public-release files, is greater than the poverty threshold, but these are
poor families as identified by povll (which is based on the confidential income data). In the 2008 CPS files, all nine
of these observations had income that was less than the poverty line, but greater than 75 percent of this line. For
these nine observations, we re-assign their income to be the mid-point of their bin. This re-assignment occurs in nine
of our years. The number of re-assignments made in any given year is less than 24, with a total count of 90 re-
assignments overall years from the more than four million total observations we examine.

   The literature has pointed to a number of limitations of the official poverty measures, related to both the income
concept and the poverty lines; for further discussion see Citro and Michael (1995), Blank (2008) and Meyer and
Sullivan (2012). The Census Bureau has recently introduced an alternative “supplemental” measure that addresses
some of these concerns (Short, 2011). Here we only address the problem related to the exclusion of SNAP from the
official income aggregates based on the CPS.

   The thresholds can be found here.

   For computational convenience, the quantile for p=0.2 is fixed prior to adding SNAP receipts, while in the cross-
country analysis it is fixed in the post-transfer distribution.

However, we recognize that this is a methodological choice that might be questioned, so we also
present some key results on the response of the real quantile to SNAP spending.
         The floor can respond to transient changes in the level of prices—inflationary shocks.
When the price level increases the nominal poverty line rises, expanding the reference group.
This effect will be negligibly small for a small change in prices, given that income at the poverty
line has zero weight in equation (2), though larger changes can alter the floor. However, there
will also be some short-term impacts below the line, as the weights depend on the threshold, as
can also be seen from (2). As we will see, the transient effect of inflation on the floor is positive.
We address this issue by including a control for the inflation rate—change in the log of the
CPI—in all our regressions for the (log) floor. Note that if it is only a temporary change in the
price level, with no real effects, then the floor will return to its previous level in due course.
         Summary statistics: Table 4 provides summary statistics; a more complete addendum is
available from the authors. Figure 10a plots SNAP spending per capita, while 10b gives spending
per recipient and the participation rate. We see that spending per capita fluctuated over time, due
mainly to participation rates, which closely tracked spending. Spending per recipient grew over
time, with a growth rate of 1.342% per annum (s.e.=0.135%). There was a marked increase in
spending per capita in the 2000-11 period; spending doubled between 2006 and 2012, but has
tended to fall again in recent years.
         Figure 11 plots our estimates of the floor ratio before and after food stamps, using both
the official threshold and the poorest 20%, and for both 𝛼𝛼 = 1 and 𝛼𝛼 = 2. 34 Naturally, the floor
is lower for 𝛼𝛼 = 2, whereby the probability of a given income being the floor declines as a
quadratic rather than linearly, but the trajectories are similar, and r = 0.998 for the official
threshold and 0.997 for the poorest 20%. The following discussion focuses on 𝛼𝛼 = 1, in keeping
with the cross-country analysis. The pattern over time is similar between the two thresholds.
         We find a trend decline in the post-transfer floor. Using the official threshold, the trend
rate of change (regression coefficient of the log floor on time) is -1.321% per annum (s.e.=
0.110%). Using the poorest 20%, the rate is somewhat lower, at -0.812% per annum (s.e.=
0.033%). The floor stabilized in the period 2003-12; the bulk of the decline (especially using the



34
   Note that expressing the floor in $’s makes no difference to the pattern over time for panel (a) since the threshold
is fixed in real terms. The threshold does vary over time when using the poorest 20% but (as noted) the fluctuations
are small with no trend. So the pattern in Figure 11, panel (b), is very similar if one calculates the floor in $s.

                                                          22
official threshold) was in the period 1996-2001, coinciding with the aforementioned social policy
reforms. There are clear signs that the post-SNAP floor stabilized from the early 2000s. There is
no significant trend in the post-SNAP floor from around 2003, though the fall in the pre-SNAP
floor continued, albeit at a slower pace (Figure 11). However, the last few years of the series
have seen a resumption in the floor’s decline (Figure 11). While we find that food stamps lifted
the floor, the sharp decline in the floor 1996-2001 cannot be attributed to changes in SNAP alone
since we also see a similar decline in the pre-SNAP floor, though less than we find post-SNAP.
        Standard poverty measures are not highly correlated with the floor. This can be seen by
comparing Figure 11 with 12, which gives the three standard FGT poverty measures. For
example, the periods 1993-2000 and 2012-16 saw declining poverty measures but a sinking
floor. And the sharp rise in poverty measures in the crisis period (2008-10) came with a
relatively stable floor post-SNAP. The proportionate changes over time in the floor are roughly
                                                                              ∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
orthogonal to those for the (post-SNAP) headcount index (r(∆ln(𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 , ∆H)=0.041) and not
highly correlated for the two poverty gap indices (r = -0.268 for changes in PG and r = -0.492 for
SPG). Tracking standard poverty measures alone is clearly not very informative about what is
happening to the floor.
        To help put the level of the floor in perspective, Figure 13 plots the overall mean and
various quantiles—the median (𝑞𝑞(0.5)) and top income quantiles, 𝑞𝑞(0.9), 𝑞𝑞(0.95) and 𝑞𝑞(0.99).
The latter quantiles fluctuate around a strong positive trend, as indicated. A marked divergence is
evident between the top incomes and the mean, median and (especially) the floor (shown for the
official threshold). Note also that these are quantiles based on the CPS. There is a likely bias in
the CPS at the high end, associated with under-reporting and selective compliance. 35 The bias is
unlikely to be confined to the top 1%, or even 10%, so the quantiles will be affected, implying
that correcting for these problems would show even greater divergence from the floor. 36
        Relative divergence is also evident. The growth rate of the (pre-SNAP) floor over the
whole period is -1.28% per annum (s.e.=0.061), while it is -1.32% (s.e.=0.110) for the post-
SNAP floor. As noted, 𝑞𝑞(0.2) shows essentially zero growth while the median has a small

  See, for example, the estimates combining CPS with income tax and national accounts data in Piketty et al. (2018)
and Worldwide Inequality Database. Of course, such adjustments to survey data require a great many assumptions.

                                                        23
positive growth rate. By contrast the growth rate of 𝑞𝑞(0.99) is 1.63% per annum (s.e.=0.320).
For a family of four people, the floor fell from about 9.2% of 𝑞𝑞(0.99) in 1988 to 3.9% in 2016.
        Food stamps raised the floor by 0.03 on average (as a proportion of the official poverty
line). Using the official threshold, the mean post-SNAP floor is about 36% of the official poverty
threshold, which was $24,036 a year in 2015 for a family of four (two adults and two children) or
$16.50 per person per day (rounding up slightly). So the mean floor in that year’s prices is $5.89
a day, while the pre-transfer value is $5.40; the corresponding numbers in 2010 prices are $5.41
a day post-SNAP and $4.95 pre-SNAP, corresponding to an official poverty threshold of $15.15
a day. 37 The floor for the US is about the level of the highest floors in the developing countries.
        Unlike the cross-country data set, the mean gain to the poorest now exceeds mean
spending on food stamps; the difference between the mean gain for the poorest and mean
spending of $0.12 a day (in 2010 prices) is statistically significant (s.e.=0.041). 38 So (again) the
null in (6) is rejected, but this time the gain to the poorest exceeds mean spending.
        Similarly to the cross-country data (Figure 6), we find that the US median increased with
the overall mean. However, the ratio of the median to the mean has been falling over time, from
around 0.78 to 0.71 (Table 4). While the median rises with the mean, as in the cross-country data
set and consistently with our model in Section 3, unlike the cross-country data, it does so with an
elasticity less than unity. 39 This decline in the median relative to the mean as the latter increases
is another aspect of the inequitable growth process of the US. The Gini index of inequality in
family income rose from 0.40 to 0.48 over this period (Table 4).
        We find that there has been a decline in FTE—the ratio of the gain in the floor that we
attribute to SNAP to spending per capita on the program (Figure 14). The program is reaching
the poorest, but efficiency in raising the floor has declined appreciably over time. In the late
1980s, the gain in the floor was about 2.5 times mean spending, but by the last five years of the
series it had fallen to about the same level (an FTE of unity). Food stamps used to be much more
effective in reaching the poorest, although the welfare-reform period starting in the mid-1990s
appears to have come with a slowing down in the rate of decline in FTE (Figure 14). Note also
that the decline in FTE largely preceded the large expansion in SNAP spending under ARRA in


37
   The poverty threshold was $22,113 a year in 2010 for a family of four (two adults and two children).
38
   Note that SNAP spending in Table 4 is monthly.
39
   The OLS regression coefficient of the log median on the log mean is 0.611 with a standard error of 0.037. One can
reject the null that the coefficient is unity with t = 10.64.

                                                        24
the latter sub-period (including the crisis) but the latter expansion clearly did not come with
better performance in reaching the poorest.
         Partial correlations: Given that these data are a time series we include the lagged
dependent variable. As noted, we also include a control for price inflation, which can have a
transient effect on the floor. Table 5 provides regressions analogous to those for the cross-
country data set (Table 2). Columns (1)-(2) use the official threshold while (3)-(4) give the
corresponding results using the poorest 20%. Serial dependence in the floor is evident. 40 We
also find a significant effect of price inflation on the pre-SNAP floor based on the official
threshold to define the reference group, though this is smaller using the poorest 20%.
         Similarly to the cross-country data, we find that the pre-SNAP floor is unaffected by food
stamp spending (Table 5, Columns (1) and (3)). So the US evidence is consistent with our
assumption of no behavioral effects at the floor. However, similarly to the cross-country data,
SNAP spending has a significant positive effect on the gain to the floor from SNAP, though the
elasticity is quite low at around 0.03 (Table 5). On further decomposing log SNAP spending per
capita into log spending per recipient and log participation rate we find that the latter accounts
for the spending impact. 41 Unlike the cross-country sample, there is no sign of interaction effects
between mean income and SNAP spending in determining the gain from SNAP. 42
         In contrast to the cross-country data, food stamp spending in the US does not exhibit a
positive mean income effect; regressing log food stamp spending on its own lagged value and the
log of the mean, the coefficient on the latter is -0.139 with a standard error of 0.176. So in the
case of food stamps in the US there is only the potential for a direct effect on the floor.
         A notable difference between the cross-country results and those for the US is that
growth in mean income in the US has come with a lower floor. This is not because growth in
mean income has bypassed poor people as a whole. Using the (fixed) official poverty threshold,
the empirical elasticities of both SPG and PG to the mean are both negative; regressing ∆ ln 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆
and ∆ ln 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 (using the official lines) on ∆ ln 𝑚𝑚 the elasticities are -1.339 (s.e.=0.197) and -1.437


40
   Without the lagged dependent variable as a regressor, the regressions exhibit significant autocorrelation in the
errors, as revealed by (say) the Durbin-Watson statistic. We also tested the robustness of each regression to adding
an independent time trend. The key findings were robust to adding a time trend.
41
   For example, replacing ln 𝜏𝜏 by the log spending per recipient and the log participation rate, the latter has a
coefficient of 0.039 (s.e.=0.006) while the effect of the former is not significantly different from zero. This is not
surprising given that the participation rate closely tracks spending per capita (Figure 10).
42
   For example, adding ln 𝜏𝜏. ln 𝑚𝑚 to the regression in Column (2) its coefficient is 0.105 (s.e.=0.120).

                                                          25
(0.156) respectively. It is the fact that the (absolute) elasticity w.r.t. the mean is lower for SPG
than for PG that is driving our result on the (negative) growth effect on the floor (equation 5).
This also implies that price inflation will have a short-term positive effect on the floor. 43 As
discussed in Section 3, this negative growth effect can also be given an economic interpretation
as the combination of (i) only weak complementarity (or even substitutability) between SNAP
and economic development with (ii) a distributional effect, whereby growth has come with
changes in relative distribution that have gone against the poorest.
        The use of the poorest 20% to define the reference group offers a further insight because
for this case the fixity of the poverty rate cuts off this channel linking growth in the mean to
poverty reduction when one uses a fixed poverty line. Thus, there is no need to add a control for
inequality; the negative effect of higher mean income on the floor evident in Table 6 can be
directly interpreted as a distributional effect.
        The last two columns of Table 5 provide regressions for the log of 𝑞𝑞 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (0.2)/𝑞𝑞 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (0.2)
(in obvious notation). No variable is individually significant in Column (5), but one can also
reject the joint restriction that only SNAP sending matters (F=0.577; prob.=0.637), and Column
(6) gives this regression. As noted, it is a methodological choice whether to fix the quantile or
the percentile when comparing poverty measures with and without transfers. If one prefers to fix
the percentile then this almost doubles the elasticity of the floor to SNAP spending (adding 0.028
from Column 6 to the elasticity of 0.034 from Column 4).

6.      Conclusions

        To test whether public spending on social protection has reached the poorest we must be
able to measure and monitor the floor—the lower bound of the distribution of income. It is
clearly not enough to look at the evolution of any standard poverty measure, which can fall with
or without an increase in the level of living of the poorest. Instead, we need to focus on the floor
directly, and we must recognize that the lowest observed income in a cross-sectional survey need
not be a good indicator of the true floor of living standards given transient effects and
measurement errors in the data. To address these concerns we have measured the floor as a



43
  Note that our measure of the floor is homogeneous of degree zero in the mean and the poverty line given that this
also holds for the 𝑃𝑃𝛼𝛼 poverty measures.

                                                        26
weighted mean for those in a chosen reference group deemed to include the poorest, with highest
weight on those observed to be poorest.
       To help motivate our empirical analysis, we have outlined a simple model of the
determination of the floor, which is taken to depend on public spending on social protection and
on economic development, measured by mean income, while the level of social protection
spending depends in turn on the mean. Thus, there is both a direct effect of economic
development on the floor, and an indirect effect via social protection. A key role is played by the
extent of complementarity between SP spending and development; complementarity exists when
higher SP spending increases the marginal gains to the poorest from growth. If this
complementarity is not too weak, and the growth process is not too inequitable, then the floor
will rise with economic development; the poorest will not be left behind. But that need not hold,
and there is no guarantee that the poorest will see any gain from overall economic development.
       We have assembled illustrative evidence from both cross-country data on social
protection spending in developing countries (the bulk of which is social insurance) and time
series data for a specific social program in the US, namely food stamps. We find that higher SP
spending helps to lift the floor in both data sets. The poorest benefit from this spending. There is
considerable variability across countries, the bulk of which (in terms of variance) is due to
differences in the level of SP spending rather than the transfer efficiency of that spending.
However, for the cross-country sample, the gain from SP for those living at the floor is
significantly less than aggregate spending per capita. Social insurance (mainly public pensions
for old age and disability) does the “heavy lifting” of the floor in developing countries. Social
assistance on its own lifts the floor by merely 1.5 cents per day. For food stamps in the US, the
gain to the poorest is significantly greater than mean spending, though substantially less so over
time. We find a marked decline in the efficacy of food stamps in reaching the poorest since the
mid-1990s.
       We also find that higher average income tends to come with a higher pre-transfer floor,
though not enough to prevent a relative decline in the floor with overall growth, and large
absolute divergence. This is the sense in which it can be said that the poorest tend to be “left
behind” with economic development. The bulk of the efficacy of economic growth in lifting the
floor appears to be direct, rather than via higher SP spending. Nonetheless, SP spending comes
close to assuring that the post-transfer floor does not sink relative to the mean when comparing


                                                 27
low and high-mean countries. Statistically, while the pre-transfer floor tends to fall relative to the
mean as the latter rises, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the post-transfer floor stays at a
constant share of the mean.
       There is also evidence for the cross-country data, but not the US, of complementarity
between SP spending and economic development, as evident in a strong positive interaction
effect between SP spending and mean income in regressions for the gains to the poorest from
higher SP spending. Along with rising SP spending, this complementarity plays a positive role in
helping to assure that the poorest benefit from growth.
       In contrast to the cross-country sample, for the US we find that economic growth has
come with a sinking floor. We interpret this as the combined effect of relatively weak
complementarity with a quite strong distributional effect; controlling for the rise in overall
inequality, growth in mean income has had little effect on the floor. The floor in the US fell most
markedly in the 1990s, but began to stabilize in the 2000s. The financial crisis put downward
pressure on the floor, but the expansion of the food stamps program in the wake of the crisis was
able to prevent a fall in the floor despite the inequality-increasing growth process. The expansion
of SNAP in the 2000s partly compensated for the downward pressure on the floor coming from
the unequal nature of the growth process. Extra food stamps helped assure that the poorest could
at least maintain their (low) living standards.
       While our results are suggestive of causal interpretations, there are warnings to note. Our
estimates of the impacts of SP on the floor can only be interpreted as the true causal impacts
under the assumption that there are no behavioral responses by the poorest. For both the cross-
country data set and the US data, we have shown that our estimates of the pre-transfer floors
under this assumption are uncorrelated with mean transfers (at a given mean income) across
countries. This test is broadly consistent with our assumption of behavioral neutrality for the
poorest, but it cannot be deemed conclusive. There may still be some bias in our estimates due to
behavioral responses by the poorest. We also warn against giving our regressions a causal
interpretation; we provide them as only descriptive tools for measuring (partial) correlations.
       In thinking about further work on this topic, we point to two directions. First, measuring
and monitoring the floor over time should now be feasible for many countries, using the methods
in this paper. We suggest that an estimate of the floor should become a staple in the existing



                                                  28
dashboard of social indicators. Doing so would make poverty measurement more relevant to the
ongoing concerns among policy makers and citizens about not leaving the poorest behind.
       Second, further research is called for on the causal interpretation of the link to social
protection. The greater concern here is possibly not behavioral responses by the poorest but
rather the endogeneity of SP spending. Our regression error term includes the (likely)
heterogeneity across countries in the impact of SP on the floor. The regression coefficients we
have estimated are interpreted as average impacts. Suppose that countries that are more effective
at using aggregate SP spending to reach the poorest tend to spend more on SP. Then our variable
for SP spending per capita will be positively correlated with the error term, implying that OLS
overestimates the true mean impact on the floor. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of
the opposite direction of bias, as would be the case if the countries that are better at using SP
spending to reach the poorest tend to spend less on SP.
       Identifying behavioral responses of the poorest and impacts of social protection on the
floor remains a challenge, though probably one that is better addressed by a more micro-
empirical and program-specific approach using impact evaluation tools. We hope that this study
has at least pointed to the desirability and feasibility in such efforts of including a focus on the
living standards of the poorest. Doing so will remove an obvious disconnect between how social
policy makers view their objectives and how economists assess their progress. Greater interest in
measuring the floor will hopefully also come with extra effort in survey design and processing to
more accurately measure the living standards of the poorest.
