                                             ABSTRACT

Changes in technologies for reproducing and redistributing digital goods (e.g., music, movies, software,
books) have dramatically affected profitability of these goods, and raised concerns for future development
of socially valuable digital products. However, broader illegitimate distribution of digital goods may
have offsetting demand implications for legitimate sales of complementary non-digital products. We
examine the negative impact of file-sharing on recorded music sales and offsetting implications for
live concert performances. We find that file-sharing reduces album sales but increases live performance
revenues for small artists, perhaps through increased awareness. The impact on live performance revenues
for large, well-known artists is negligible.

1           Introduction

New information technologies in the past decade have radically changed the methods of
distributing information goods (i.e., products that can be digitalized). These technologies
make new distribution channels available to consumers, but also raise the risk of illegitimate
redistribution. Understanding how firms can create and distribute information goods while
still protecting their intellectual property has been the core issue of many policy debates, in-
cluding those surrounding the passage of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA), the
Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA), and a landmark U.S. Supreme
Court case (MGM v. Grokster). The fundamental economic concern is that redistribution
technologies may threaten markets for information goods by making it difficult for producers
to capture the returns to their investments.

However, concerns about the viability of markets for digitally redistributable products may
be tempered if firms can recover their investments through the sale of complementary, non-
digital goods. Redistribution of the digital good may increase demand for the complementary
good, partially offsetting the losses due to illegal redistribution of the digital good. The
implication, as argued by Teece (1986), is that public policy aimed at promoting innovation
should not ignore the impact of an innovation on goods or assets that are complementary to
it.

In this paper we study firms’ responses to digital redistribution technologies in the specific
context of the music industry. Large-scale file-sharing of recorded music began with the entry
of Napster in 1999, and recorded music has been at the forefront of debates about the impact
of digital distribution ever since. Several empirical studies have focused on measuring the
extent to which illegal downloads displaced legal sales.1 In contrast, our primary focus is to
examine how file-sharing affected the complementary market for live concert performances.
To address this question, we construct an extensive dataset of concert events and album
sales. The concert data contain information on over 200,000 concerts between 1995 and
      1
          See, for example, Blackburn (2004), Hong (2005), Liebowitz (2004), Oberholzer and Strumpf (2004),
Rob and Waldfogel (2004), and Zentner (2003).

2004 performed by over 12,000 artists. We are able to combine detailed sales data with the
concert data for a sample of 1,806 artists.2

We expect two kinds of effects of recorded music file-sharing on live concert performances.
One effect is a demand shift: if recorded music and live performances are complements (e.g.,
because a concert is more enjoyable if you have listened to the recorded music ahead of
time), then increases in the consumption of recorded music due to file-sharing should lead
to increased demand for live performances. The second effect is a supply shift: to the extent
that file-sharing reduces the profits from selling recorded music, we would expect artists to
reallocate effort toward concert tours and away from recording new albums. Both of these
effects imply that concert activity should increase after the entry of Napster in 1999 and the
adoption of large-scale file-sharing. In fact, the number of concert events increased sharply
beginning in 2001, as shown in Figure 5. The surge in the number of concerts is a sharp
contrast to the concomitant decline in album sales, which the record industry blamed on
file-sharing.

Our objective is to document various trends in the production of recorded music and live
performances, and ask whether those trends are consistent with the two effects described
above. At the most basic level, we look for breaks in trend like the one shown in Figure
1. Further, we examine variation in trends across artist types. File-sharing may increase
awareness of smaller, more obscure bands by making their music available from more sources
and at a much lower cost (or for free in the case of illegal file-sharing). Broader awareness
of these bands could increase demand for their concert performances. Similarly, while file-
sharing may offset some album sales, for small bands this may be mitigated by increased
sales resulting from a larger potential fan base, again due to increased awareness. On the
other hand, file-sharing may have a relatively small impact on concert performances for large,
“superstar” bands. These bands were already well-known and their music was already widely
   2
       We collect data in both markets going back to 1993. In several of our analyses, we construct variables
(e.g., growth rates) that limit our analyses to start no earlier than 1995, and for consistency we report all
analyses for the period of 1995 and later. The general implications of the analyses are not sensitive to the
inclusion or exclusion of data prior to 1995.



                                                       3
played prior to file-sharing, so file-sharing may have had little impact on demand for their
concerts. Similarly, for large bands we expect file-sharing to substantially displace album
sales with little mitigating expansion in overall listenership. In summary, we expect small
bands to experience a greater increase in concert revenues and less of a decline in album
sales than large, highly popular bands following the entry of Napster.

We examine this hypothesis by ranking artists by concert revenues and album sales, and
then calculating growth rates in concert revenues and album sales by rank (i.e., we calculate
the growth rate by comparing the concert revenues of the 5th -ranked artist in 1996 to the
5th -ranked artist in 1995). Consistent with prior studies, we find a substantial decline in
album sales following the entry of Napster. We also find that concert revenues grew at a
substantially higher rate following the entry of Napster. Furthermore, we find that concert
revenues for the highest-ranked artists were mostly unaffected by the entry of Napster, while
revenues for smaller, lower-ranked artists grew at a much faster rate following Napster than
before Napster. On the other hand, album sales for top-ranked artists fell dramatically
following the entry of Napster, while album sales for small artists experienced a relatively
smaller decline. Hence, superstar artists appear to receive little or no benefit from file-
sharing in terms of increasing demand for their concerts, presumably because people were
widely aware of their music prior to file-sharing. For smaller artists, however, our findings
are consistent with file-sharing increasing awareness of the artists’ music and consequently
increasing demand for live concert performances by those artists, as well as mitigating any
loss in recorded music sales from illegal downloading. These results appear to be fairly
consistent whether the analysis is conducted at a national level or separately for different
markets.

While our study focuses on the music industry, the economic phenomena we analyze are
clearly relevant in many other markets. For example, digital copies of movies may cut into
home video sales, but may also lead to higher demand for movie-related merchandise. An
author’s royalties from book sales may be reduced if the book is digitally shared, but the
increased readership may lead to profits on the lecture circuit. Mass sharing of a pirated soft-
ware program may displace paid licenses for that program, but may also generate increased


                                               4
sales of complementary physical products or technical support services.

The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section we provide a brief description of the music
industry, and we describe our data sources. In Section 3 we describe aggregate trends in
concert activity and recorded music sales; in Section 4 we analyze more detailed artist-level
data for the sample of 1,806 artists for whom we observe both concert revenues and CD
sales. Section 5 provides a discussion of our findings and concludes.




2         Background & Data

2.1         Music Industry Background

Professional music artists earn revenues principally from recorded music sales and from live
performances.3 Recorded music is produced under contract with a record label: the artist
records an album as a work-for-hire, and the record label markets and distributes the album.
Typical production costs during this period are in the neighborhood of $100,000-$250,000,
and industry executives report that marketing and distribution costs during this period often
eclipsed the cost of production. The standard contract is a royalty contract: the artist is paid
royalties on album sales, and receives an advance against those royalties in order to cover
living expenses and studio costs during the production of the album. Royalty rates range
between 10-18% of retail, with the typical rate being 12%; however, artists earn somewhat
less than this due to various deductions that are usually built into the contract. For the time
period we study, a reasonable estimate is that the artist earns around $1.00 for every CD
she sells.4 Record labels during this period hold a negligible stake in the live performance
    3
        Some very successful songwriters also earn significant revenues from music publishing fees, and some star
artists have substantial income from endorsements, but the typical artist relies mostly on recorded music
sales and concerts.
   4
     Instead of using a standard royalty contract, some artists negotiate “penny contracts” specifying artist
payments as a fixed dollar amount per CD sold. The typical artist share in these contracts is reportedly
$1.25 per CD; however, artists who negotiate such contracts have more bargaining power than the average
artist.


                                                         5
business. Although labels usually offered some nominal touring support to new artists as part
of the recording contract, and sometimes coordinated with concert promoters to advertise a
show, they do not take a share of the touring revenues.5 More recently, these contracts have
begun to change, so that recording labels contract explicitly over some share of the artist’s
touring receipts.

Artists’ live performances are coordinated and underwritten by concert promoters. The
promoter finances almost every aspect of the concert production, including renting the venue,
paying the artist and staff, and advertising. Artists are paid as a percentage of ticket
revenues, subject to some minimum (called the “guarantee”). Artists also make money
from merchandise sales; for some artists this can be a significant component of the net
earnings. A typical deal gives 70-80% of merchandise revenues and 70-85% of the gross
ticket revenues to the artist, although the actual percentages may be somewhat lower because
various deductions are made to the gross ticket revenues before the artist’s cut is taken.

Although artists have virtually no say in the pricing of recorded music, most industry sources
identify the artist as the primary agent with responsibility for setting concert ticket prices.
The artist and/or artist’s manager sets prices in consultation with the promoter and venue
owner. The parties can have conflicting incentives; for example, aside from the rental fee for
the venue, the venue owner’s revenue comes primarily from concessions and parking, so they
tend to push for low ticket prices in order to fill the house.

In May of 1999, the software program Napster introduced an easy-to-use interface by which
consumers could share and download digital copies of songs. Napster and similar programs
represented a dramatic shift in the distribution technology for recorded music.6 Napster
gained currency quickly, with a reported user base of over 20 million unique accounts at its
peak and over a half million unique IP addresses connected at any given time on a routine
   5
       Tour support is typically a recoupable expense, but it is recouped from recorded music revenues. This
convention may be a holdover from an earlier era: historically, labels subsidized concert tours only as a way
of promoting albums, and concerts were often not expected to be profitable on their own.
   6
     Although earlier technologies also allowed for illegitimate reproduction (e.g. cassette tapes are easily
copied), they were much more limited in scope, and typically had greater quality degradation.



                                                      6
basis.7 The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) claimed that the presence
of Napster eroded sales of CDs by facilitating copyright violations, and sued to have Napster
dismantled in December of 1999. In 2003, the RIAA began suing individual participants
of file sharing networks, and subsequent activity on these networks was reported to have
declined.8



2.2        Data

The data we use in this study come from several sources. The data on concerts come from
Pollstar, a company that tracks virtually all concert activity in the United States. The
data describe 227,230 concert events performed by 12,356 artists in the period 1993-2004.
For concerts performed between 1993-2002, the data provide detailed box office information,
including tickets sold, total ticket revenues, and high and low ticket prices. For 2003 and
2004, we observe the dates, locations (city and venue name), and identities of all performing
bands, but we do not have data on box office receipts. Although data for years past 2004
are obtainable, we truncate at 2004 because the company implemented a significant change
to its reporting mechanism in 2005 that makes later years’ data difficult to compare with
the period in which we are primarily interested (i.e., the years around 1999).

The dramatic increase in concert activity shown in Figure 1 is based on Pollstar data. Given
the change in reporting in 2005 (and consequent change in coverage), one might worry that

events specifically, see Blackburn (2004).
   8
     The Supreme Court ruling in MGM v. Grokster in June 2005 represented a significant legal victory for
the RIAA, as the court held that distributors of file-sharing software could be held secondarily liable for
copyright infringements facilitated by their software, essentially allowing the RIAA to go beyond merely
suing individuals who shared files illegally to suing the companies whose software enables the sharing. In
addition to the legal front, the music industry has also battled file-sharing on the technological front, using
various encryption and digital rights management technologies to curb the flow of illegal music downloads.
Park and Scotchmer (2004) analyze the impact of such technologies on the pricing of digital goods. Legal
channels of digital music distribution are, by now, becoming well established. Most notably, iTunes launched
in October, 2003.


                                                      7
the increase in concert events after 2000 also reflects a change in data coverage rather than
a change in actual concert activity. To address this concern, we conducted an extensive
audit of the Pollstar data during the years of 1996-2002 for concerts in the Boston area
using a local weekly newspaper that has a reputation as the best guide for music in the area.
Pollstar did not have complete coverage of all events (particularly events at small venues).
The coverage rate increased slightly over time, but the increase was gradual. In particular,
there was no evidence that the coverage rate increased sharply after 2000.9 In 2005, Pollstar
made changes that did lead to a dramatic increase in coverage. We do not report data from
2005 onward because we do not feel it is comparable to the data used in the rest of our
analyses.

Our data on album sales come from Nielsen SoundScan, a company that tracks music sales
at the point of sale.10 Some of the results we report below are based on aggregate sales
by DMA (designated market area), covering the years 1993-2002.11 We also observe highly
disaggregated data for a subsample of 1,806 artists who we can match to the concert data
from Pollstar. We refer to these artists as our “matched sample.” For these artists we
observe weekly CD sales by DMA at the individual album level; for the analyses in this
paper, we summarize over the artists’ albums and simply examine total album sales by
artist/DMA/week. The matched sample may not be perfectly representative of the broader
universe of artists, and we discuss sample selection issues in Section 4 along with running
concert analyses both on the matched sample and the full Pollstar data.

We collect additional data on recorded music for individual albums from MusicBrainz, which
is an online database that tracks detailed album information for official album releases for
the purpose of documenting or “tagging” downloaded music tracks.12 The MusicBrainz
   9
       The local weekly newspaper used for the audit was The Boston Phoenix. Details of the audit are available
from the authors upon request.
   10
      For our sample period, SoundScan’s coverage rate was reported to be approximately 80% of all music
sales.
  11
     A DMA is similar to an MSA.
  12
     The MusicBrainz database is used by a wide range of complementary “tagging” software programs, and
is widely cited in the music community as a reliable source of information on recorded songs and albums.




                                                        8
database has extensive coverage of recorded music releases, tracking 240,000 albums from
100,000 artists, and provides information on the date of release, length and title of each
song, album credits, and so on. The data from MusicBrainz are useful for documenting the
timing of album releases, and also for characterizing the population of recorded releases over
time.13

In addition to the detailed data on concerts and recorded music, we supplement our analyses
with a number of characteristics about artists and recorded releases that are collected from
several other sources. We use artist characteristics from allmusic.com’s online database
of artists, and data from Recorded Industry Association of America (RIAA) to measure
cumulative album sales prior to 1993 for artists that were established before that date. We
also use data from BigChampagne (collected during 2007) to measure a cross-section of
downloading activity across artists and cities.14




3      Aggregate trends

Since file-sharing technologies made millions of songs freely downloadable over the inter-
net, they were naturally expected to displace legal sales. Most empirical studies have found
evidence of this displacement. However, while file-sharing decreased legal sales, it almost cer-
tainly increased the overall consumption of recorded music. Evidence from time-use surveys
indicates a dramatic increase in music listening between 1998 and 2001. In one survey, re-
spondents in 2001 reported spending 3 times as much time listening to music as respondents
from 1998. More tellingly, among respondents who reported having below-median internet
usage rates, the increase in music listening was negligible (just over 10%), whereas the in-
crease for those with above-median internet usage was more then tenfold.15 Since recorded
music and live performances are complementary, an increase in the consumption of recorded
  13
     This allows for a comparison of our matched sample to the population of releases over time.

     We cite these additional sources and provide additional detail throughout the analyses as appropriate.

music should increase the demand for concerts: the more people who are listening to an
artist’s music, the larger is the market for a concert by that artist.

In addition to this demand-side effect, file-sharing may also have shifted artists’ incentives
on the supply side. To the extent that file-sharing eroded the profitability of selling recorded
music, artists had an incentive to reallocate effort away from recording new albums, instead
performing more frequent and/or more extensive concert tours.

As a first step in documenting the empirical relevance of these effects, in this section we
describe aggregate trends in concert activity and music sales in the years before and after
file-sharing technologies became pervasive. Time trends alone cannot establish any causal
link; our purpose in this section is simply to examine whether the patterns of change within
the music industry are consistent with the anticipated effects of file-sharing.



3.1        Live performances

Figure 5 documents the sharp increase in the number of live performances after the year
2000. Table 1 provides more detail on trends in live performances between 1995-2004.16
The first column reports the number of concerts, and matches figure 5. The second column
reports the number of artists on tour, which also increases sharply after 2000. The number
of concerts per artist is reported in the third column. This number is falling before 2000, and
then rising in 2001-02 and and falling again in 2003-04. We suspect that the entry of many
new artists, especially in 2003-04, means that the marginal artist on tour performs fewer
concerts in those years. The number of cities in which an artist tours falls from 1995-1999,
and then levels off. The percentage of concerts performed in the 20 largest cities in the US
is relatively stable over time. The number of tickets per concert rises from 1995-2000, and
then falls. Combined with the first column, this suggests a trend toward a larger number of
smaller concerts. Note that the fall in the number of tickets per concert is smaller than the
  16
       As noted earlier, we focus on the time periods 1995 to 2002 or 1995 to 2004 depending on availability
of the relevant variables. Including data for ealier years (e.g., 1993 and 1994) does not impact the general
implications of the analyses and is not feasible for the analyses in Section 4.


                                                      10
rise in the number of concerts performed. Thus, total ticket sales increased over the period.

The table also shows that average ticket prices rose steadily (especially after 1999). Since
both prices and quantities (total ticket sales) increased, the changes in this industry can not
be solely attributed to a shift in supply. Demand must have increased for these patterns to
hold.

In addition to changes over time, we also observe cross-sectional variation in concert per-
formances over time across cities. The top panel of Table 2 reports average annual growth
rates in concert performances for the 1996-1998 and 2000-2002 periods for different types of
cities over time. We classify cities based on two different measures of the likely importance
of filesharing. In the first classification, we designate a DMA as “low (high) broadband”
if its broadband penetration is below (above) the median. Second, we classify cities into
high- and low-download markets based on whether a city’s downloading activity was dis-
proportionately high or low relative to population, based on the BigChampagne data from
2007.17

Growth in concert performances accelerated sharply for both high- and low-broadband mar-
kets in the post-Napster period, and the acceleration was significanly more pronounced in
the high-broadband markets. A similar pattern holds for the high- vs. low-download classifi-
cation. While we do not know how accurately these groupings proxy for actual file-sharing,
the patterns in the table are at least consistent with our hypothesis that increases in concert
activity were driven partly by the arrival of file-sharing.



3.2        Recorded music

The bottom panel of Table 2 shows analogous comparisons for growth rates in album sales.
Annual sales were growing at double-digit rates in the years just before file-sharing, but
began shrinking after file-sharing. In contrast to concert performances, however, the trends
  17
       Specifically, we regress the log of total downloads (by city) on population rank, and then classify cities
based on the residuals. (Cities with residuals above the median are the “high-download” cities.)



                                                        11
were essentially the same in high- and low-broadband markets (and high- and low-download
markets). Thus, sales declines were not more pronounced in the markets that one might
associate with greater file-sharing activity. This could reflect the coarseness of our proxies
for file-sharing and the difficulty of measuring the degree of sales displacement that results
from file-sharing. (The studies that have found convincing evidence of a displacement effect
have used individual-level data, not market-level comparisons.)

Regardless of its cause, the decline in album sales after 1999 may have reduced artists’
incentives to produce recorded music, and the apparent increase in demand for concerts
would have further pushed artists to reallocate effort away from recording albums toward
performing concerts. One of the empirical implications of this reallocation would be an
increased lag between album releases. Table 3 reports trends in the time between album
releases, based on the MusicBrainz database. The table reports a backward-looking measure
(time since last release); the patterns are similar if we use a forward-looking measure (time
until next release). The lag between album releases increased after 1999, primarily because
more artists took 3 or more years between album releases. However, there is no obvious
break in trend around 1999-2000. The trend toward longer lags appears in the 1995-1999
period as well.

While Table 3 examines the album production of existing artists, file-sharing may also have
affected the entry of new artists. This effect is more subtle, however. To the extent that
file-sharing reduced the profitability of recorded music, we could expect record labels to sign
fewer artists and release fewer albums. On the other hand, if touring became more profitable
because of the greater accessibility of recorded music to potential listeners, more artists may
have been able to profitably exist, and also to release CDs.18 Table 4 documents the entry
of new artists and new albums over time, again based on the MusicBrainz database. Both
series increase over time; neither exhibits any sharp breaks in trend.
  18
       Relatedly, if digital technology lowers the cost of producing recorded music, we may also get greater
entry into the market for recorded goods in spite of the potential for file-sharing to have some displacement
effect.

4     Artist-level analyses

The impact of file-sharing on concerts and album sales may differ substantially between large
and small artists. File-sharing may increase awareness of smaller, more obscure artists and
their music by making the music available from more sources and at a much lower cost (or for
free in the case of illegal file-sharing). Broader awareness of these artists should be reflected
in increased demand for their concert performances. Similarly, while file-sharing may off-set
some album sales for small artists this may be mitigated in part by increased sales from
the larger potential fan base that may result from increased awareness of those artists. On
the other hand, file-sharing may have a relatively small impact on the awareness of music
for large, “superstar” artists. The music for these artists was already widely played prior to
file-sharing, and thus file-sharing may have had little impact on concert demand for these top
performers. Similarly, file-sharing is likely to primarily displace album sales for large bands
with little or no compensating increase from a potentially larger fan base. In summary, we
expect small bands to experience a greater increase in concert revenues and less of a decline
in album sales than large, highly popular bands following the entry of Napster.



4.1    Defining variables of interest

A key challenge to undertaking artist-level analyses in concert and album data is appro-
priately defining the level of observation to track empirically. This challenge is common to
analyzing markets for information goods generally. Demand for many information goods
peaks at or near the release date, and then decays rapidly (e.g., movies and music), and
production occurs in discrete jumps (e.g., the release of a new movie or album). In the
music industry, these types of dynamic considerations are important for any given artist
or band. Over time, an artist will create and release new songs and albums, spend time
touring, and experience life-cycle effects (both in their own costs of effort and in the de-
mographic background of their fan base). The nature of these dynamic effects makes any
analysis of individual artists fraught with difficulty, as dynamic considerations often swamp



                                               13
other industry-level effects of interest.

We address this challenge by defining an observation as a year-rank pair. For example, to
track concert revenues over time we rank artists based on their aggregate concert revenues
in each year. Rather than analyze changes in a particular artist’s concert revenues over
time (which can vary dramatically from year-to-year), we analyze changes in revenues at the
rank-level over time (i.e., changes in concert revenues for the 10th-highest grossing artist in
each year). Patterns based on the concert revenue rank observations are much more stable
over time than revenues for a given artist, and allow us to analyze the impact of file-sharing
without the noise of dramatic changes over time in content release, concert tour schedules,
and life-cycle effects that plague artist-specific data. Therefore, we analyze how file-sharing
impacts concert revenues for the 50 highest-grossing artists in each year compared to the
201st to 300th highest-grossing artists.

To analyze the impact of file-sharing on a consistent basis for both concerts and album sales,
we create a matched sample for the 1,806 artists for whom we have detailed album sales and
concert revenue information. All concert-based analyses are carried out for the same set of
artists used to analyze album sales. We also implement the concert-based analyses on the
full Pollstar concert data to ensure that any findings based on the matched sample are also
consistent with the population of concerts more generally. The concert revenue findings based
on the matched sample and the full Pollstar data have very similar implications, suggesting
that our findings for the matched sample are representative of all artists more broadly.

Our main outcome variables of interest are growth rates for concert revenue and album
sales, and we analyze these outcomes separately at three levels: (1) the national level, (2)
specific DMAs (i.e., New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and all other DMAs combined), and
(3) groups of DMAs based on broadband internet penetration in 1999. At the national level,
we calculate growth rates for concert revenues by aggregating annual concert revenues to the
national level and ranking each artist based on his aggregate concert revenues in that year.
Using these individual year-rank observations, we calculate a growth rate as the difference
between the log of concert revenues in the current and preceding years for artists of the same


                                              14
rank. We repeat the exercise using album sales.

Artists are also assigned to cohorts based on their aggregate national concert revenues. We
create identifier variables for each cohort group (e.g., for the matched concert revenue data,
cohort 1 reflects nationally ranked artists 1 to 50, cohort 2 is 51 to 100, and so on). We use
only year-rank observations of 409 or better because that is the lowest rank for which we
maintain a balanced sample from 1995 to 2002.19 Finally, we calculate a dummy variable to
identify years following the entry of Napster (i.e., 2000 to 2002) and interact this variable
with our cohort groups.

Analyses conducted for specific DMAs or for groups of DMAs we refer to as “regional level”
analyses. For these analyses, the growth rates are calculated based on the artists’ regional
ranks (rather than the national ranks) in the corresponding region of analysis. For example,
when we analyze album sales for the New York DMA, we rank artists based on their aggregate
album sales in just the New York DMA and calculate album sales growth rates based on the
change in the log of current album sales for a given New York DMA-ranked artist.20 While
growth rates are calculated at the regional level, artists continue to be assigned to cohorts
based on their national aggregate concert revenues or album sales. Calculating growth rates
based on ranks that correspond to the region of analysis, but assigning cohort groups based
on national outcomes addresses two issues. First, using the rank for the region of analysis to
calculate growth rates ensures that growth rates are based on artists who have a similar level
of popularity in a given region (i.e., the 10th-ranked artist in the region this year compared
to the 10th-ranked artist in the region last year) and results in smoother and more reasonable
  19
       There are 409 artists with positive concert revenues in 1993 in our matched sample, and this count of
artists increases for every year following 1993. Similarly, there are 703 artists with album sales in 1993 in our
matched sample, and this count of artists also increases for every year following 1993. To ensure that annual
concert revenues (album sales) are not overly impacted by the growth in the number of artists performing
(recording) during the course of the year we drop 1993 from the analyses. Using the remaining data we can
then calculate growth rates for concert revenues (album sale) starting in 1995.
  20
     When several DMAs are represented in a given region, we aggregate concert revenues and album sales
for each artist across all of the DMAs in that region, and then calculate ranks and growth rates based on
those regionally aggregated data.



                                                       15
growth rates. Second, relying on the national ranks to assign artists to cohorts ensures that
the cohorts and their corresponding coefficients are comparable across analyses.21

In all analyses the cohort 1 indicator and the interaction of the Napster and cohort 1 in-
dicators are excluded from the analyses. The constant term captures the average growth
rate for cohort 1 for the pre-Napster period, while the Napster term captures the relative
change in cohort 1’s growth rate for the post-Napster period compared to the pre-Napster
period. The cohort 2 and higher indicators capture the difference between the individual
cohort pre-Napster growth rates and the cohort 1 growth rate; while the Napster and cohort
2 and higher interaction terms capture the relative change between pre- and post-Napster
growth rates for that cohort compared to the change in growth rate for cohort 1.



4.2       National and DMA-Level Analyses

Table 5 reports results of analyses on concert revenue growth rates for the matched concert
and album sales sample of artists. The column labeled “National” reports the regression
results of concert revenue growth on cohort identifiers, and cohort identifiers interacted with
the post-Napster identifier. Consistent with file sharing having a larger impact on concert
demand for smaller, more obscure artists than for larger, better-known artists, we find no
positive impact of Napster on the concert revenue growth rate for the largest artist cohort,
but substantially higher concert growth rates following entry of Napster for smaller artists.
The results for the largest artists (cohort 1, rank 1 to 50) are captured by the constant term
for the period 1995 to 1999 (0.12), and the Napster term captures the difference between
the growth rate for cohort 1 in the 2000 to 2002 period compared to the 1995 to 1999 period
(-0.05). The results indicate that the concert revenue growth rate for artists in cohort 1 had
a statistically significant decline following entry of Napster. However, the next largest group
of artists (cohort 2) experienced a significantly higher growth rate following Napster. The
Napster-cohort 2 interaction term compares the change in the growth rate for cohort 2 before
 21
      For example, it may not be appropriate to compare the top ranked concert in the Albuquerque DMA to
the top ranked concert in the New York DMA.



                                                   16
and after Napster to the change in the growth rate for cohort 1 before and after Napster,
and the coefficient of 0.12 indicates that cohort 2 experienced a significantly more positive
impact on its concert revenue growth rate following Napster than cohort 1. Furthermore,
the relative growth rate in concert revenue post Napster is successively larger for the lower
ranked artist cohorts: 0.17 for cohort 3, 0.21 for cohort 4, and 0.23 for cohort 5. These
results indicate that concert revenues for small artists grew substantially faster following
entry of Napster, and that this increase in growth rate for small artists was significantly
more positive than the change in concert revenue growth rates for superstar artists following
entry of Napster.

Table 5 also reports results at the DMA level separately for the three largest DMAs and for
all other DMAs combined.22 While the results of the analyses for New York, Los Angeles,
Chicago, and all other DMAs differ somewhat in terms of the levels of the coefficients, they
are consistent in terms of the overall implications. In every region, the concert revenue
growth rate for cohort 1 (the largest artists) declines following entry of Napster although the
decline is not statistically significant for New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. On the other
hand, the concert revenue growth rates for smaller artists increase significantly following
entry of Napster. Table 6 reports the corresponding results using the full Pollstar sample of
artists. The implications of the results using the full Pollstar data are almost identical to
those using the matched sample.

Table 7 reports results for the album sales analyses. These analyses are constructed in a
comparable manner as those for concert revenues in Table 5, but artists are instead ranked
based on album sales and growth rates are calculated using album sales. Again, results at
the national and DMA level are extremely consistent. Virtually all artist cohorts experience
a decline in album sales following entry of Napster, which is consistent with the findings
in prior papers. However, the largest artists (cohort 1) experience by far the most severe
  22
       Calculating growth rates at the DMA level works well for large DMAs. However, smaller DMAs often
have fewer concerts in a given year and greater variance in the quality of concerts from year-to-year. Cal-
culating concert revenue growth rates for smaller DMAs can therefore introduce substantial noise into the
analysis.



                                                    17
decrease in album sales. In the national level analyses, the coefficient on the Napster variable
is -0.17 and indicates a significantly lower album sale growth rate for cohort 1 following entry
of Napster compared to before Napster (when the growth rate was 0.07). All of the smaller
artist cohorts also experienced lower growth rates following Napster; however, the effect is
far more muted for the smaller artists. Cohorts 2 through 8 all have positive (and except for
cohort 8, statistically significant) Napster interaction coefficients, indicating that the decline
in album sales growth rates for cohorts 2 through 8 was significantly less than for cohort 1
following Napster. Similar to the results based on concert revenue growth rates, the results
using album sales growth rates are also consistent with file sharing increasing awareness of
smaller artists and potentially having a positive impact on demand for small artists’ concerts
and albums. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the positive demand implications of
file sharing should be much stronger for small, more obscure artists than for larger, better-
known artists. Results for the New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and all other DMAs are
very consistent with the national results.



4.3    Broadband Penetration Level Analyses

As a final sensitivity analysis, we investigated whether the results differ depending on the
level of broadband penetration. Rather than segment the analyses for the three largest DMAs
as in the previous set of analyses, we segmented the DMAs based on quartiles for broadband
penetration (as measured in 1999). Tables 8 and 9 report the results for concert revenues for
the matched sample of artists and the full Pollstar data respectively, and Table 10 reports
the results for album sales. If broadband penetration is a good proxy for the incidence of
file-sharing, one would expect to find that the impact of file sharing on concert revenues and
album sales was more pronounced for DMAs with greater broadband penetration. Instead,
the results appear to be quite similar across all of the quartiles for broadband penetration
and similar to the national results. One possible explanation for this finding is that our
measure of broadband penetration covers each DMA as a whole. Ideally, one would like a
measure of broadband penetration for that demographic in each DMA that are most likely



                                               18
to attend concerts and purchase albums. Unfortunately, such a measure is not available. A
further complicating factor is that the sub-population that most frequently attends concerts
and purchases albums may be early to adopt broadband access regardless of their DMA (e.g.,
college students). Finally, variation in broadband penetration across DMAs for the relevant
sub-population that attends concerts and purchases albums may be quite small. If this is
in fact the case, then we would expect to find little difference in the impact of file-sharing
across DMAs on concert revenue or album sales.




5    Discussion and Conclusion

We find evidence consistent with illegitimate redistribution of digital goods increasing rev-
enue from non-digital complementary products. As with the earlier literature, we find that
sales of recorded music declined precipitously with the entry of Napster and large-scale file-
sharing. While file-sharing may have substantially displaced album sales, it also facilitated a
broader distribution of music, which appears to have expanded awareness of smaller artists
and increased demand for their live concert performances. Concert revenues for large artists,
however, appear to have been largely unaffected by file-sharing. Music for large artists was
likely widely available prior to file-sharing, and as a result it is not surprising that demand
for those artists’ concerts would have been largely unaffected by file-sharing. Similarly, the
decline in album sales is much more pronounced for large artists than for small artists. Again,
for small artists, file-sharing may have increased awareness of their music and encouraged
some additional album sales from a larger fan base even as it displaced album sales to others.

While our findings are consistent with file-sharing affecting concert revenues and album sales,
we cannot entirely rule out the influence of other contemporaneous changes in the music
industry. During the time period of our analysis, the concert promotion industry became
increasingly concentrated, with Clear Channel Entertainment (now Live Nation) gaining an
increasingly large share of concert promotion activities. At the same time, Clear Channel was
also expanding the breadth of radio stations under its control. Finally, digitization not only



                                              19
affected the reproduction and redistribution of recorded music, but also changed production
technologies more generally. While all of these factors could have influenced growth rates for
concert revenues and album sales, we would expect their influence to have been more gradual
and more consistent across large and small artists than what we observe in the data. Given
the dramatic changes that we observe over a very short period of time around the entry
of Napster, and the varying impacts for large and small artists, the findings in this paper
appear to be most consistent with the result of file-sharing and not other contemporaneous
factors.

More generally, increased digitization of information and entertainment content over the past
decade, along with dramatic technological changes in the reproduction and redistribution of
such goods, has raised substantial concerns with respect to the future viability of many
information and entertainment goods markets. Recorded music, newspapers, and magazines
have all undergone radical changes through on-line distribution and pricing that have either
facilitated illegitimate redistribution of their content or generally increased the availability
of legitimate but free content. Markets for television, books and movies have just recently
started to embrace digital distribution channels, but have also faced challenges from free
and/or illegitimate distribution of their content (e.g., YouTube). Finally, software has long
fought against illegal copying and is also taking some steps toward free legitimate distribution
through “cloud” computing rather than personal licensing. These changes are undoubtedly
having profound impacts on the market structure of these industries, making it more difficult
to generate revenue from traditional sources but also greatly expanding overall distribution
and availability of content. To the extent that content in these industries becomes available
to a larger potential customer base, some of the decline in revenue from traditional sources
may be offset by increased demand for complementary products.

t-stats are reported in brackets and are calculated using robust standard errors. Analyses
rely on the matched artist sample for concerts and albums. The concert revenue growth
rate is calculated as the log of current year concert revenues minus the log of previous year
concert revenues for the same revenue rank artist in both years based on revenues in the
region of analysis. Cohorts are based on national concert revenue ranks for all analyses.

t-stats are reported in brackets and are calculated using robust standard errors. Analyses
rely on the matched artist sample for concerts and albums. The album sales growth rate is
calculated as the log of current year album sales minus the log of previous year album
sales for the same sale rank artist in both years based on album sales in the region of
analysis. Cohorts are based on national album sales ranks for all analyses.
