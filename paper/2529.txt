                       Onthe Determi nants of the Value of
                       Call Options on Default—Free Bonds




                                    ABSTRACT



Models of interest—dependent claims that imply similar term structures and

levels of interest rate volatility also produce similar estimates of bond

option values.   This result is established for simple option forms with known

closed-form solutions am well as for more complex options that require

numerical methods for evaluation.   The finding is confirmed for a wide range of

economic conditions, and it is robust with respect to the number and nature of

factors that generate interest—rate movements.

     Early contributions to the theory of bond options suggest             that
techniques   for pricing options on stock can be adapted with relatively minor

refinementaj Subaequent research indicates potential difficulties.           For

example, Gourtadon (1982) and Buser and Hendershott (1984) show that call
values are sensitive to multiple unobservable parameters even in the simple

case of a one-factor interest-rate process. Brennan and Schwartz (1983,

1985) and Dietrich-Campbell   and Schwartz (1986) conclude that call values

are sensitive to the number as well as the nature of interest rate factors.

Difficulties in specifying and estimating numerous unobservable parameters

of an uncertain interest rate process would thus appear to present a

formidable barrier to the implementation   of bond option pricing models.2

     In this paper, we re-examine alternative models for pricing debt

options and conclude that practical application is not substantially more

difficult than in      the case of stock options.    The term structure and

volatility of interest rates serve as summary characteristics     of the economy

for bond options, just as the stock price and volatility of stock returns

are summary characteristics   of the economy for stock options.    Traditional

comparative-staticexperiments that reportedly test for the specific effects
of a given parameter   (or model) are misleading in so far as the summary

characteristics of the economy typically change in the experiment. We

control for these fundamental determinants of bond option values and show
that    alternative   models of the interest-rate process produce similar

estimates of bond option values.       Accordingly, even if researchers disagree

about the determinants of either the term structure or the level of

volatilityof interest rates, they should still agree on the implications of
a given term structure and level of volatility for bond option values.

       Our results are robust with respect to the interest rate environment.

Cases of high versus low interest-rate uncertainty are examined for three

term structures: steeply upward sloping; gently upward sloping; and downward

sloping.    To guard against the chance that our results are unique to one

particular contract, we examine three very different options including: (I)
a 2-year call option on a 10-year zero-coupon bond, <2) a 2-year call option

on a 30-year coupon bond, and (3) the borrower's option to prepay a 30-year

fully-amortizing   mortgage.

       The remainder of our paper is divided into six sections.         The first

presents our formal assertions about the fundamental determinants of bond

option values.     Section II describes the alternative models of the interest

rate process that we consider.         Procedures for comparing alternative models

are discussed in Section III, and simulation results are presented in

Sections IV and V.    A   brief summary concludes the paper.



                       I. Properties    of Bond-Option Values



       Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1976/85), hereafter CIR, show that the

equilibriumvalue of any interest-dependent        claim can be represented as a

solution to a fundamental pricing equation subject to appropriateboundary




                                            3
conditions.      We describe this equation in detail in the next section.               Here
we simply let            denote the set of parameter values which, together with the

current interest rate, r, describes the fundamental pricing equation.                       The

primary contention of this paper is that as few as two characteristics                      of 8

may be sufficient to value options on default-free debt.                The measures that
we propose are y, the slope of the term structure of yields on default-free

zero-coupon bonds, and a, the level of interest-rate volatility.

     These summary characteristics allow us to clarify and extend two

propositions     that have been established for specific options and specific

models of the interest-rate process.                    Our third proposition asserts that

any remaining bond-optionpricing effects are of secondary                importance.



Proposition #1:           For a given level of uncertainty about future interest

rates, the value of a call option on a default-free bond is a decreasing

function of the slope of the term structure.                This result was illustrated by

Courtadon     (1982) and Buser, Hendershott and Sanders (1985) for specific

contracts in the case of one-factor models.                  We extend and formalized the
                                                                              —
result.     If 81 and     2   denote distinct models such that
                                                                    a(r,82)       a(r,81)   and

          >               then             < C(r,81).

Pronosition #2:      For a given term   structure,   the value of a call option on a

default-free bond is an increasing function of the level of uncertainty

about future interest rates.       As in the case of proposition #1, this result

was established by Courtadon (1982) and Buser, Hendershott and Sanders

(1985) for specific contracts in the case of one-factor models.               We extend

and formalize the result.          If     and 9             distinct models such that
                                                  2denote

y(r,82)    y(r,81)




jion#3:               Given appropriate controls for the effects of the term

structure and the level of uncertainty about future interest rates, call

values are relatively insensitive to the number or nature of the factor

processes that generate interest rates.           If 81 and   2   denote distinct models


such that y(r,82)                 and u(r,82) —               then C(r,82)
                        y(r,81)                    c(r,81),                   C(r,81).




      Propositions    1, 2   and 3 together imply that there are two and only two

fundamental  determinants of bond option values, namely the term structure
and the volatility of interest rates. In the next section we describe the
various pricing models used to substantiate this claim.


                      II, Models of the Interest Rate Process



      We begin this section with a general model of the interest-rate process

and then specify one-factor and two-factor versions that we use to identify

the   determinants of bond option values.

General Model

      Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1976/85), hereafter                      dR.       present a general

theory of interest-dependent          claims based on the premise that the state of

the economy is fully described by a finite number (M) of state variables or

factors,        which follow a joint diffusion process:
           X,
                              —                          i —   1        K

the corresponding    state variables and, in general, may vary with time (t)

and the current values of the factors.

      Because the factors describe the economy completely, security values

are uniquely determined.           Hence, CIR are able to apply Ito's lemma and

represent the instantaneous change in value of an arbitrary security V (with

given boundary conditions      and cash flow) as a related diffusion process



                                      dV — Fdt + GdZ     .                                       (2)


In equation (2), F is the drift in the value of the contract, and C is the

stochastic component of the price path.             By virtue of Ito's lemma, these

parameters are, respectively,

     To preclude     arbitrage       profits, CIR impose Merton's (1973) risk/return

equilibrium condition on the drift in (3) and variance in (4)

the market-determined price of the ith source of risk in the economy, and r

is the instantaneous rate of return on riskless investments, hereafter

referred to as the spot rate.            CIR use expression (3) to rewrite (5) as:



                MM                           H
                                                                        rV — 0.

     Equation (6) uniquely determines the value of any security subject to

appropriate boundary conditions.             Based on this observation, CIR refer to

(6) as the Fundamental Partial Differential Equation for Contingent Claims.

CIR also show that subject to an invertablity restriction it is possible to

use interest rates as instrumental variables in place of the true, but

possibly unobservable,     state variables or factors.

       Initial efforts to derive explicit models of the term structure [CIR

(1976), Vasicek (1977) and Dothan (1978)1 focus on the simplest of cases:           a

single factor which, without loss of generality,                 is taken as the

instantaneous riskless spot rate of interest (r).         In terms of the notation

of equation (1), the diffusion process is expressed as



                                dr —   fdt +   adZ.                              (1')



Various specifications of the drift and variance of this process have been

employed such as a mean-reverting drift with constant elasticity of
variance:

                                   f—    k(u-r)                                   (7)


and                                 a—    sra.                                    (8)



In equation (7), k measures the expected rate of adjustment toward the long-

run value u. In equation (8), s is the scale of the variation, and a is the

elasticity of the variation in the process with respect to the level of the

spot rate.    Vasicek sets a equal to zero.       CIR sets a equal to 0.5 (the

"square-root" process), and Dothan sets a equal to 1.            In each of the

corresponding models, the risk premium in (5) is presumed to be a linear

function of the level of interest rates:3




3.    Arbitrage considerations rule out certain combinations of (8) and (9)
      In particular, for cs,0, risk vanishes if r—0 which implies that the risk
      premium should be zero as well, i.e., a—0 in (9). The specific models
      we consider rule out the potentially inconsistent special cases.

      Substituting equations (7)                  (8) and (9) into a one-factor variant of

equation (6) yields a class of one-factor models of the following form:



                               [(ku-a)                                                rV — 0.

             l/2s2r2°V11



      Two-factor models were initially proposed                       by CIR and Richard (1978)

in these models, the spot rate is the sum of two factors:4



                               r —   r1   +       r2.


That is, X1                                   Both factors are presumed to exhibit mean
                r1 and X2        r2,

reversion:

                                                   and            —                             (7')
                    f1 —k(u1-r1)                             f2       k2(u2-r2),


where u1 and u2 are constants.                    We allow for a general elasticity of

variation:

                           —                      and                 —                         (8')

 4.   CIR and Richard (1978) interpret the additive factors as the real
      interest rate and inflation, Ayres and Barry (1979) take the factors to
      be a long rate and the spread between the short rate and the long rate.



                                                        9
We further presume that risk premia are linear in the corresponding factors.

Substituting equations (7'), (8') and (9') into equation                         (6)   with M—2 yields
a class of two-factor models of the following form:

        Together equations (6') and (6") describe the various models examined
in this paper.     In the next section we discuss how to compare alternative

models without contaminating the experiment with changes in the term
structure or interest-rate volatility.



                 III. Procedures for Comparing Alternative Models



Risk-Neutral    Analogs for Risk-Averse Models

     CIR observe that it is always possible to construct a risk-neutral

analog for any risk-averse specification of the fundamental equation (6).
In the case of a single-factor mean-reverting model (6'), the mean and speed

of adjustment for the matching risk-neutral process are:



                                   u — (ku-a)/(k+b),                                               (11)




                                                    10

Because the risk-neutral analog replicates the pricing equation exactly,
                                    as well.             Hereafter, we presume that the
security values should be identical

        Equations (13), (14) and (15) are not based on precise analytic
rules.     Nevertheless, these ad hoc controls reflect our intuition about
models of the interest rate process, and, as we show in the remainder of the

paper, they provide an adequate summary of interest-rate volatility for the

purpose of pricing bond options.




                       IV. Call Options on Zero-Coupon Bonds



        Closed-form solutions for the value of a call option on a zero-coupon

bond have been developed by CIR (equation 32, p.396), Ball and Torous (1983,

equation 8, p528), and Jamshidian (1987, equation 7a,      p7).   In all three

formulas, the price of the option (C) is a weighted difference between the
values of two default-free bonds:     the underlying zero-coupon bond; and
                                  B1,

      a zero-coupon bond with maturity equal to that of the option:
82,



                   C   —          -
                                                                            (16)
                           B1N1       B2KN2.




                                               12
In equation (16), K is the exercise price of the option, and the weights are

determined               of the respective models. CIR employ the square-
               by parameters
root form of elastic volatility (a—l/2), and use the chi-square distribution

to define    and N2. Volatility is inelastic in the Jamshidian model (a-O)


      N1 and N2 are determined by the normal distribution.
and


       Equation (16) bears a striking resemblance to the familiar Black-

Scholes (1972) equation for a stock option; the long bond (B1) corresponds

to the stock, and the short bond (B2) corresponds to the present value

factor (exp-rT).        Ball and Torous draw the analogy even more tightly by

observing that their version of (16) is identical to Merton's (1973)
extension of the Black-Scholes equation that incorporates stochastic
interest rates.

      The closed-form solutions of CIR and Jamshidian correspond to special

cases of the one-factor model represented by equation (6').      By focusing on
these cases, we can examine our basic propositions without relying on

numerical methods.      We can then use the closed-form results to verify the

numerical procedures     that are required under more general conditions.



Economic Environments

       Panel   A   of Table 1 reports option values for four specifications of

one-factor models that have been fit to nine very different economic

environments; three term structure slopes are examined for each of three
different levels of interest rate volatility,      The slopes cover the gamut

from a downward sloping yield curve (minus 100 basis points) to a steeply

upward sloping yield curve (plus 300 basis points).      The intermediate case




                                          13
corresponds to a "normal" slope of plus 100 basis points.            The choice of

volatility levels ranges from a value that is low by historical standards

(so_0.0l5) to one that is high (s°—0.045).     An intermediate case was chosen

as well (s0_003)

       Each of the models was fit to the prespecified economic environments in

two.     In a "risk neutral" approach, we set the risk aversion parameters

equal to zero and varied the mean to generate each of the term structures.
In a "risk averse" approach, we set the mean equal to the initial spot rate

in order to minimize the role played by expectations.      We   then used equation
(12) to solve for the risk-aversion parameter.    As noted previously,    models

paired in this way should produce identical value estimates for interest-

dependent claims.     In all cases, the initial spot rate is 0.10 and the speed

of mean reversion is 0.25.    Specific parameter values for each case examined

are identified in Panel B of Table 1.



Results

       The rows of Panel A are organized into four groups each of which

corresponds to a distinct version of the one-factormodel.           In turn, each

group of rows contains three price estimates:    (1) a value based on numerical

integration with 12 changes in interest rates per year;     (2) a value based on

numerical integration with 96changes in interest rates per year; and        (3)   a
value based on the closed-form solution (which presumes that interest       rates
change    continuously).
       Values computed by numerical methods differ   little from values computed

by   closed-form solutions. The error based on 96    intervals per year is never
more     than   one Cent per hundred dollar face amount of bonds.        With 12




                                        14
intervals, the numerical solutions are systematically higher (by 2 to 7

cents).      Yet even these   estimates are within 10 percent of the closed-form

solutions and serve as a verification of our numerical procedures.                 As

previously noted, we must rely exclusively on these procedures for the
balance of the paper because closed-form solutions do not exist for the

additional    contracts examined.

     The results in Panel A clearly support proposition 1; call values fall

sharply as the term structure is increased.     Moreover,    the percentage effect

is roughly uniform across term structures.     At the low level of volatility

call values fall by approximately 50% when the slope of the term structure

is changed from downward to normal,      Call values fall by 50% again when the

slope of the term structure is changed from normal to steeply upward.              Ac

the high level of volatility the percentage    decline is roughly 40% in the

analogous experiments.
     The results in Panel     A   also support proposition 2; call values are

substantially larger in cases of higher volatility.         However, the effect is

not uniform,     The percentage change in call values declines with the level

of volatility and increases with the slope of the term structure.

     With respect to proposition 3 (model-specific effects)        ,   the   value of

the call option is clearly insensitive to whether risk aversion or risk

neutrality    is used to generate the term structure; values are identical in

all cases as required by the theory.      The effect of the elasticity parameter

is more difficult to evaluate.        Call values are reliably lower for the

square-root process; the difference exceeds the numerical approximation
error if volatility is moderate or high and the term structure is not

steeply upward sloping.        However, even in extreme cases, the value of the




                                          15
call option    is   only   12%   less   in the elastic model.    These results suggest

two possibilities: 1) there is a small but nontrivial negatIve relationship

between bond call values and elasticity; or 2) our ad hoc procedures for

standardizIng the levels of volatility in the models are not sufficiently

precise. In support of the second possibility, we note that models with

different elasticities cannot provide the same level of volatility at all

interest rates,       Our procedures      standardize volatility at the prevailing

interest rate, but in so doing, we assure that                        a model with hIgher

elasticityhas a lower probability of very low interest rates (the range
most relevant for call options).            A   lower risk-adjusted



               V. Calls on Coupon Bonds and Amortizing Mortgages



     The results reported in Table 1 could be contract specific.                 To guard

against this possibIlity, we repeat our analysis of bond-option values for
two additional types of contracts.              These additIonal results are identified

in Table 2.     Panel A reports simulated values for a two-year option to call

a 30-year bond with a semiannual coupon that is set such that the bond is

initially priced at par.           The exercise price for the option is the par value

of the bond.        Panel B provides estimates of the prepayment         option in a fully
                                                               the mortgage
amortizing 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a coupon such that
value plus the option equals par. The exercise price for the option is the

amortized value of the mortgage.                Under this specification, the values

reported in Panel            represent "points" charged at the origination of the

mortgage.




                                                  16
     The construction of Panels A and B differs from that for Panel A of

Table 1 in three respects.       First, we only report numerical results based on

12 changes in interest rates per year.             Second, we only report results for

risk-neutral specifications because, as in the case of Table 1, results for

appropriately matched risk-averse models are identical.                Third, we expand

the class of models to include two-factor models as well as well as one-

factor models, and we examine the unit-elastic case in addition to the

inelastic and square-root specifications of the interest-rate process.



Economic   Enviroents
     To design appropriate tests of our claim that one-factor analogs can be

found for two-factor price structures, we must take care to avoid trivial

comparisons.    For example, we should not focus on cases where the factors

are highly correlated or where one factor clearly dominates the other.                Even
factors that are uncorrelatedbut which are similar in structure
                                                                               (symmetric)
can be replicated by one-factor models with relative ease.               These concerns

suggest that the speeds of adjustment should differ for the individual

factors.       Yet neither speed of adjustment should be so              large    that it
inhibits volatility nor so small that it enhances volatility to a
                                                                  point
where its factor dominates the remaining factor.            These considerations,       in

conjunction with reasonable empirical bounds on interest-rate movements,

helped to shape     the following   experiments.
     The   option   values shown in Panels    A   and B of Table 2 are    computed    for
an interest rate of 0.10.           The respective initial values for two-factor

models are r1— 0.07 and     r2   0.03.   We also Set
                                                       k1 0.25   and   Ic2—   0.50. These




                                             17
choices meet our objectives for nontrivial asymmetric processes.                  In

particular, while the k values differ, neither factor is dominated in the

uncertainty structure because it has a speed of mean reversion that is too

large (which would inhibit volatility), nor does either factor dominate by

virtue of too little mean reversion (which would enhance volatility).            From

(13), the value for a matching one-factor model is k
                                                     —         0.2619   for T * 30.

Scale parameters are chosen as follows,            First, we assume that the two

factors are uncorrelated      (p—O) in order to maximize separation between the

factors.       This structure presents the greatest challenge for the task of

finding a matching one-factor model,            For a similar reason we choose

different levels of variance for the individual factors.                 In the low

volatility case, we set      s and s°2equal    to 0.02 and 0.01, respectively.

Based on (14)      the   corresponding value for a matching one-factor model is
s°—0.02l6.     In the high volatility case, the respective volatility constants

are 0.03 and 0.015 and 0,0324.

      As in Table I, option values are reported for three term structures

which can be generated either by varying the mean-reverting rate (u) with b
— 0 or by varying the risk-aversion parameter (b) with u —        r.    In the two-

factor case, the ratios of the means to the corresponding spot rates (u1/r1

and            are held constant.   Parameter values for the various cases are
      u2/r2)

listed in Panel C of Table 2.



Results

       The additional simulations indicate that our findings for propositions

I and 2 in the case of options on zero-coupon bonds are                not contract




                                          18
specific.    In Panels   A   and B of Table 2, an increase in the slope of the

term structure clearly lowers call values, and an increase in volatility

clearly raises call values.        In addition, the patterns for the effects

appear to be similar to those established for call options on zero-coupon
bonds.   For either the coupon bond or the mortgage,   an increase in the slope

of the term structure (from downward to normal or from normal to steeply

upward) cuts the value of the option by roughly one third in the case of low

volatility and by roughly one fourth in the case of high volatility.       The

percentage effect of a change in volatility increases with the slope of the
term structure but at a much lower rate than in the zero-coupon case; the

increase is roughly 40% with the downward sloping term structure and 70%

with a steeply upward term structure.

     The additional simulations also confirm our earlier findings regarding

model-specific effects.      Option values are insensitive to whether risk
aversion or expectations accounts for the slope of the term structure.

(Results are omitted because they are identical.)      Option values are also
insensitive to the number of interest-rate factors used to generate the term

structure.   Only the elasticity parameter emerges as a potential model-

specific determinant of simulated option values; call values are noticeably
smaller when the elasticity parameter is increased.     Patterns in the effect

are similar to those established for options on zero-couponbonds.          The

percentage effect of increasing elasticity is greatest when volatility is

high and the yield curve is downward sloping; differences in value estimates
are as large as 10% for the bond option and 15% for the mortgage option.

     Part of the effect we have attributed to elasticitymay in fact be due

to our inability to match volatilities precisely at all interest rates.




                                        19
Accordingly,    even the apparent effect of elasticity could be due more to the

general effect of volatility than to a truly model-specific effect,          In

support of this interpretation, we note that         the apparent effects of

elasticity are uniform in sign and magnitude.      Specifically, call values

decline at a uniform rate as elasticity is increased, and the magnitude of

the effect declines as the slope of the term structure is increased.     These

patterns suggest that it may be possible to improve on our procedures for

controlling for differences in volatility.     For example, the apparent effect

of elasticity might be reduced if interest-rate expectations were used       ifl



the volatility control.5Alternatively, we note that even if models are

constructed to provide comparable levels of volatility at the prevailing

interest rate, an increase in elasticity reduces the probability of very low

interest rates (the range most relevant for call options).     Thus it might be

more appropriate to standardize models on the basis of the probability of

interest rate less than some critical value.

     Although we are guardedly optimistic that such improvements are

possible, the pursuit of such refinements is beyond the intended scope of
this paper.     Our purpose was simply to show that differences in estimates

between models are far less than is currently perceived, provided that




 5. Alternatively, it might be possible to extract an implied variance
measure for one model that equates the option estimate with a matching model
for some benchmark case. Such an adjustment would be contract-specific,
contrary to the spirit of our current investigation. Nevertheless the    fit
technique would be of interest if it could be shown to improve the
between models for all contracts over the full range of economic
environments.

comparable   term structures   are used and some attempt, however crude, is made

to impose comparable levels of interest-rate
                                             volatility.



                                 VI. Conclusions



     The -value of a given call option on a default-free bond is a
                                                                   decreasing
function of the slope of the term structure and an increasing function of

the volatility of interest rates.            Little else seems to matter.     In

particular, bond option values are not sensitive to either the number of

factors driving the interest-rate process or the reason that the term

structure has a given slope.     Bond option values appear to be moderately

sensitive to the degree of interest-rate elasticity in volatility, but even

this result may say more about our ad hoc controls for volatility than it

does about the fundamental determinants of bond option values.          Thus we
conclude that even if elaborate models of the interest-rate
                                                            process are
required to estimate volatility, they are not needed to price bond options.
     In the absence of analytic results, we can not claim confirmation for

all possible specifications of multiple factor models.        Nevertheless,   we

regard our simulations as sufficiently compelling to encourage, if not

require, future advocates of multiple factor models of bond-option values to

make relevant comparisons vis a vis a comparable one-factor models.       As a
minimum, the slope of the term structure and the level of interest-rate

volatility must be the same for competing models.
