                                            ABSTRACT


This study uses the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the National Comorbidity Survey
(NCS) to explore the causal relationship between alcohol abuse (binge drinking and clinically
defined alcohol use disorders) and suicide attempts among youth. We use an empirical approach that
allows one to assess the existence and strength of a causal relationship without relying on identifying
assumptions. Our results suggest that a causal relationship between binge drinking and suicide
attempts is very unlikely. The findings, however, support a causal relationship between clinically
defined alcohol use disorders and suicide attempts among girls.

                                               INTRODUCTION

         Recent years have witnessed widespread public concern over the alarming rate of youth

suicide, as signaled by the publication of the Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Prevent Suicide

(US Public Health Service 1999). More young adults die from suicide in the U.S. than from all

leading natural causes of death combined, including cancer, heart disease, AIDS, and congenital

defects. In 1999, 1,615 teenagers aged 15-19 years old took their own lives, making suicide the

third leading cause of death among youth behind accidents and homicides (Centers for Disease

Control and Prevention 2002). Suicide attempts are much more common than completed

suicide; as many as 150 youths attempt suicide for every completed suicide.1 A previous suicide

attempt is considered a leading risk factor for completing a suicide. Moreover, suicide attempts,

regardless of whether or not they are completed, impose real health care and other costs. The

costs associated with both completed and medically treated suicides by youths under 21

amounted to 3.7 billion dollars in 1996 (Children’s Safety Network Economic and Insurance

Resource Center 2003).

         A growing body of research implies that alcohol abuse is an important and independent

risk factor for suicide attempts among youth. The strong association between alcohol abuse and

suicide attempts is significant from a policy perspective because it suggests that alcohol use

prevention policies may be effective tools in reducing suicide attempts and completed suicides

among youth. Of course, this possibility depends on whether or not the association between

alcohol abuse and suicide attempts is truly causal. No previous study, however, has tested a

causal hypothesis directly among youth, either because of reliance on state-level rather than on

individual-level data, or because of statistical problems associated with obtaining causal

1
 Data from the National Comorbidity Survey, used in this study, indicate that 2 percent of the respondents aged 15-
24 reported a suicide attempt in the past year. With a suicide death rate of 13.1 per 100,000 in 1991, this translates

estimates. The absence of such information undermines the formulation of effective public

policies.

        The objective of this study is to use individual-level data on boys and girls from the

Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and individual-level data on girls from the National

Comorbidity Survey (NCS) to explore the causal relationship between alcohol abuse (including

both self-reports about binge drinking and clinically defined alcohol use disorders) and suicide

attempts among youth. We use both of these data sets in order to take advantage of the superior

binge drinking measures and larger sample size in the YRBS, as well as the rich information on

clinical diagnoses and family background in the NCS. To achieve our objective, we use a novel

empirical approach, recently proposed by Altonji et al. (2001). There are two parts to this

approach. The first step involves obtaining estimates of the effect of alcohol abuse on suicide

attempts from a bivariate probit regression model in which the effect of unobservable variables is

fixed at various levels. This part of the analysis allows us to gauge how sensitive estimates of

the effect of alcohol abuse are to selection on unobserved variables. The second step calculates

the amount of selection on observed variables and obtains estimates of the effect of alcohol

abuse on suicide attempts under the assumption that the selection on unobserved variables is

equal to the selection on observed variables.

        The advantage of the Altonji et al. (2001) procedure is that it allows researchers to assess

the existence and strength of a causal relationship without requiring the use of identifying

assumptions that are often not credible—for example, the existence of valid instruments in an

instrumental variables context. As a result, without any other identifying assumptions,

researchers can estimate the amount of selection on unobservable factors using the observed



to 153 attempts for every completion.


                                                2
data, and in our case identify a lower bound on the causal parameter estimate.2

        Our results indicate that although self-reports of binge drinking probably do not play a

causal role in suicide attempts, clinically defined alcohol use disorders may cause a significant

increase in the risk of a suicide attempt, at least among teenage girls. We show that there is

considerable selection both into alcohol abuse and into suicide attempts along observable

characteristics. This finding implies the existence of at least some degree of selection on

unobservable characteristics. Our analysis of constrained bivariate probit models, however,

demonstrates that even very modest amounts of selection on unobservable characteristics would

eliminate the effect of binge drinking on suicide attempts. This result provides evidence that a

causal relationship between binge drinking and suicide attempts is very unlikely. In the case of

clinically defined alcohol use disorders, even a large amount of selection on unobservable factors

does not completely eliminate the positive effect of clinically defined alcohol use disorders on

suicide attempts among girls. This finding supports a causal relationship between clinically

defined problem drinking and suicide attempts among girls.

        Overall, the results imply that while binge drinking may be an important marker for a

youth at elevated risk for a suicide attempt, preventing binge drinking among youth will not be

effective in preventing suicide attempts. On the other hand, effective treatment for youth who

meet clinical criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence, which may include a significant number

of binge drinkers, may reduce the risk of suicide attempts. The prevalence of alcohol use

disorders in the general youth population is about 15%, but prevalence rates can be 50% or

higher among special populations of youths, such as juvenile offenders (Martseller et al. 1997;

Teplin et al. 2002). Interventions that identify and assist these youths, such as accessible

 The lower bound is based on the assumption that selection on unobservable variables is no greater than selection
on observables. Below, we provide justification for this assumption.

screening and treatment programs, may be more effective in reducing suicide attempts than

broader policies, such as responsible drinking programs and minimum legal drinking ages, that

are aimed at all youth who use alcohol.

                                               BACKGROUND

        In his classic work on suicide, Durkheim (1951) asserts that the suicide rate is inversely

related to the degree of social integration. While his work does not consider the linkage between

alcohol and suicide, one can postulate a theoretical link between alcohol abuse and suicide

attempts based on this channel. Several studies document that excessive alcohol use leads to a

deterioration of social ties.3 In addition to this indirect link via social disintegration, more direct

ones also have been documented. There is an extensive literature linking alcohol and drug abuse

to aggression and violence.4 Arguably, suicide is a special class of violence, the result of

aggression and violence against oneself rather than against another individual (Dawson 1997).

An acute state of intoxication due to alcohol may reduce the individual’s self-control, impair

cognition, and thereby trigger suicidal tendencies (Norstrom 1995).5

        Given the plausible mechanisms specified above, numerous social scientists have studied

the empirical relationship between alcohol abuse and suicide attempts among young people. In

samples of high-risk youth, there is a strong correlation between clinically defined alcohol

dependence and abuse and suicide attempts (Deykin & Buka 1994). Retrospective studies of

completed adolescent suicides demonstrate that 12 to 44% of females and 27 to 42% of males

met diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder before their deaths (Marttunen et al 1991;

  See Norstrom (1995) and Rossow and Lauritzen (1999 & 2001).

  See for example Dawson (1997) and Markowitz (2001).

  Alcohol and drugs are sometimes used by mentally ill individuals to relieve depression and psychological distress
(Saffer and Dave, 2002; Gruenwald et al, 1995). However, such self-medication may actually end up exacerbating
depression, anxiety, and psychological stress. Other biochemical risk factors such as serotonin depletion may also
be aggravated due to alcohol use. Rogers (1992) notes that these effects of alcohol may additionally induce myopia



                                                      4
Shaffer et al 1996). Alcohol abuse also is associated with suicide attempts in non-clinical

samples of youth (Workman & Beer 1990; Wagner et al. 1996; Felts et al.1992).

         Despite this strong correlation in both clinical and general population samples,

researchers have not established that alcohol use and abuse have causal effects on an adolescent's

risk of attempting suicide (Crumley 1990). Alcohol use and abuse often are correlated with

other, sometimes hard to measure, determinants of suicide attempts, making it difficult to

establish causation. In particular, many researchers report that, in addition to alcohol use

disorders, other psychiatric conditions have been linked to suicide attempts among youth,

particularly depressive disorders (Deykin and Buka 1994; Shaffer et al. 1996; Runeson, 1990;

Crumley, 1990). For example, in a study of teenagers who completed suicide, approximately

61% appeared to have experienced a clinically significant mood disorder at the time of death,

and approximately 35% appeared to have had a substance use disorder (Shaffer 2000).

         Some research has addressed this issue and found that even after controlling for other

psychiatric disorders, alcohol abuse remains a strong, independent predictor of suicide attempts.

Wagner et al. (1996), for example, note that while co-morbid depression and conduct problems

increase the probability that an alcohol abusing youngster attempts suicide, alcohol abuse also

independently increases the probability of attempting suicide. Similarly, Cutler et al. (2001) find

that among adolescent respondents in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health,

alcohol use is a statistically significant predictor of suicide attempts, after controlling for

depression. While offering stronger evidence than other studies that alcohol abuse is a cause of

suicide attempts, these studies are still limited by the incomplete measures of co-morbid

conditions available in the data. Thus, in the end, these studies remain less than definitive.


by restricting the individual’s attention to immediate situations, leading to an increased focus on the distressing
issues, inhibiting their ability to solve current problems, and limiting hope for the future.


                                                         5
        Several recent studies based on state-level data suggest that higher minimum legal

drinking ages and higher beer taxes, through their impact on teenage alcohol use, reduce the

number of completed suicides among young people. Jones et al. (1992), using state-level data

from 1979 to 1984, find that the suicide rate among 15-24 year olds was 9.7% greater among

youth living in states where they could drink legally compared to youth of the same age who

lived in states where they could not drink legally. Birckmayer & Hemenway (1999) find that the

suicide rate among 18-20 year olds was 8% higher in states with a minimum legal drinking age

(MLDA) of 18 years old compared to youth living in states with a MLDA of 21 years old. In

contrast to these studies, Hingson et al. (1985) fail to find an association between the minimum

legal drinking age in Massachusetts and suicides.

        These studies are limited, however, in that none address the issue of causation directly.

First, there is the ecological fallacy problem; the existence of an aggregate relationship does not

necessarily imply the existence of an individual causal relationship (Greenland & Robins 1994).

Second, these studies are based on reduced form models, which link state-level policies directly

to state-level suicide rates. Thus, they do not test the direct relationship between alcohol abuse

and suicide and they fail to assess the reasonableness of their findings in terms of the direct

effect of alcohol abuse on suicide. For example, Birckmayer and Hemenway (1999) find that

minimum legal drinking age laws affected suicide rates of those 18 to 21 and those 21 to 23

years of age, even though minimum drinking age laws are not applicable to persons 21 to 23

years of age.6 Third, these studies cannot account for the fact that state minimum drinking age

laws are not exogenously determined. It is not random that Louisiana was the last state in the

country to raise the minimum drinking age to 21.


6
 Birckmayer and Hemenway (1999) suggest that this is a plausible effect since alcohol use of those 21 to 23 may be
affected by minimum legal drinking ages, although there is relatively little evidence to support such a conclusion.


                                                      6
       To summarize, there is considerable evidence that alcohol abuse is associated with

suicide attempts and completed suicides. However, the non-experimental nature of all of these

studies limits their ability to establish a causal relationship. Thus, as is usually the case in social

science research, additional study is warranted in order to provide enough evidence so that policy

makers can make decisions with confidence using a “weight of the evidence” criterion. In this

paper, we extend the literature in this area by using a novel methodology that will significantly

add to the weight of evidence on this issue.

                                  ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

       Our objective is to assess the existence and strength of a causal relationship between

alcohol abuse and suicide attempts. This task is complicated by two factors. The first is what we

refer to as statistical endogeneity wherein an individual’s suicide attempts and alcohol abuse may

depend on a common set of unobserved factors (for example, mental illness or family history).

The second is what we refer to as structural endogeneity wherein both outcomes may directly

influence each other. For instance, in addition to alcohol abuse causing suicide attempts, a

person with suicidal impulses may binge drink to facilitate a suicide attempt.

       We begin with a simple, linear specification of the structural production function for

suicide attempts (Si) and a demand function for alcohol abuse (Ai):7

(1)    Si = α1Ai + α2Xi + α3µi + εi,

(2)    Ai = β1Si + β2Xi + β3µi + ηi.

Equation (1) is a production function for suicide attempts (Si), which is a function of alcohol

abuse (Ai), observable characteristics that affect suicide attempts such as age, gender, and race

(Xi), and unobservable characteristics such as personality traits or a social environment that

encourages risky behavior (µi). Equation (2) is the demand for alcohol. The vector Xi represents




                                                 7
observed individual characteristics that determine alcohol abuse; these characteristics are the

same as the observed determinants of suicide attempts (Xi). Similarly, the vector µi represents

unobserved determinants of suicide attempts that also may influence alcohol abuse. The

subscript i refers to the individual, and εi and ηi represent random disturbance terms. Intercepts

are suppressed for convenience.

           The parameter of interest is α1, the structural effect of alcohol abuse on suicide attempts.

However, single equation estimation methods, such as Ordinary Least Squares will yield biased

estimates for two reasons. To see why, we derive the reduced form demand function for alcohol

abuse by substituting equation (1) into equation (2).

(3)        Ai = (α2β1 / 1-α1β1) Xi + (β2 / 1-α1β1) Yi + (α3β1+ β3 / 1-α1β1) µi + β1 εi + ηi

           Ai = π1 Xi + π2 Yi + π3 µi + β1 εi + ηi

The bias in equation 1 arises if there are common unmeasured factors (µi) that determine both

suicide attempts and alcohol abuse (α3 ≠ 0 and β3 ≠ 0). In such cases, unmeasured factors are

likely to be correlated with alcohol abuse (π3 ≠ 0).          A second reason that alcohol abuse may be

correlated with the error term is structural endogeneity, or the possibility that suicide attempts

are a determinant of alcohol abuse (β1 ≠ 0).




                                                 ESTIMATION

           Our estimation strategy proceeds in a stepwise fashion. Initially, we ignore the

endogeneity problems and estimate equation (1) using a standard probit regression model. We

start with a probit model that includes a parsimonious set of covariates. Next, we estimate a

7
    This model is derived from the model of violence in Markowitz and Grossman (1998).

                                                       8
probit model with an expanded set of covariates. Estimating both the basic and the extended

models allows us to evaluate how much of the association between alcohol abuse and suicide

attempts appears to be driven by omitted individual heterogeneity. If the magnitude of the

marginal effect of alcohol abuse is highly sensitive to the inclusion of additional covariates, then

one could surmise that unobservable factors also play some role in this relationship. This

assumption is especially reasonable if one is using a multi-purpose, secondary data set, where the

information collected on respondents may not include all information relevant to the outcome

under study (Altonji et al. 2001).

       In this paper, we call this problem selection on observables and selection on

unobservables (Altonji et al. 2001). These two terms are used to acknowledge that teenagers are

not sorted randomly into suicidal and drinking behaviors. Selection on observables refers to the

existence of observed factors (such as age and race) that are correlated with suicide attempts and

with alcohol consumption and will therefore influence the point estimates of the coefficients on

alcohol. Selection on unobservables refers to the possible existence of factors that are not

available in the survey data and that also may be associated with both alcohol use and suicide

attempts (such as family problems). The degree of selection on the observables can be gauged

by comparing the estimated coefficients on alcohol abuse that result from the parsimonious and

expanded models. Unfortunately, the degree of selection on the unobserved characteristics

cannot be measured directly. However, we will attempt to bound this latter effect using an

approach proposed by Altonji et al, and thereby draw inferences about the unbiased relationship

between alcohol use and suicide attempts.

       The observed correlation between alcohol abuse and suicide attempts is likely to be

influenced, at least to some degree, by the selection biases discussed above. For this reason, the




                                               9
estimated coefficients on alcohol abuse from the extended models may be considered upper

bound estimates of the impact of alcohol abuse on suicide attempts. Since we expect that

unobservable factors that determine suicide attempts and alcohol abuse are positively correlated,

further efforts to control for selection bias only would attenuate the estimated effect of alcohol

abuse on suicide attempts.

         Selection bias is a common problem in applied social science research. In cases such as

ours, previous researchers have used full information maximum likelihood strategies, such as the

bivariate probit, to account for the problem. The bivariate probit model is based on the

assumption that the unmeasured determinants in equations (1) and (3) have a joint, bivariate

normal distribution. This procedure is applicable when suicide attempts (Si) and alcohol abuse

(Ai) are measured as dichotomous variables. The bivariate probit model obtains estimates of

equations (1) and (3) jointly.8 But in our case, since the same vector of socioeconomic and

demographic factors is included in both equations, identification comes purely from functional

form restrictions. In practice, however, such functional form restrictions generally are

inadequate and are difficult to defend.

         For this reason, as in the case of instrumental variables, implementation of the bivariate

probit model requires valid exclusion restrictions – variables that affect alcohol abuse but do not

directly affect suicide attempts. However, it is difficult to find valid instruments. A common

strategy in models related to ours is to use alcohol prices and alcohol control policies as

instruments, but this strategy is often inadequate because the instruments are only weakly



8
  We also could estimate jointly the two structural equations (1) and (2) using the bivariate probit model, which is
equivalent to estimating (1) and (3). If the bivariate probit model is applied properly, both should yield a consistent
estimate of α1. The only difference is that the correlation between the disturbance terms in equations (1) and (3) is
greater than that between equations (1) and (2). This difference occurs because the reduced form alcohol abuse
equation (3) has netted out the effect of suicide and thus its error εi now also appears as part of the disturbance term
in the reduced form alcohol abuse equation.


                                                        10
correlated with alcohol abuse. Under such circumstances, the bivariate probit model performs

poorly, yielding estimates with very large standard errors.9

         We rely on an alternative approach proposed by Altonji et al. (2001) that is based on the

bivariate probit model, but does not rely on alcohol control policies as identifying variables.10

First, we estimate a bivariate probit model without any identifying assumptions but with a

constrained correlation coefficient, ρ. We constrain ρ to be 0.10 initially and then examine the

effects of increasing ρ in increments of 0.10 to 0.20, 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50. In this way, we impose

on the model increasingly greater amounts of (positive) selection on unobservables and examine

whether or not the effect of alcohol abuse on suicide attempts is robust to such changes. This

analysis allows us to determine the threshold of selection on unobservables, if any, at which

alcohol abuse no longer has a statistically significant effect on suicide attempts.

         Altonji et al. (2001) argue that if the observable determinants of an outcome are truly just

a random sub-set of the complete set of determinants, selection on observable characteristics

must be equal to selection on unobservable characteristics. 11 This assertion of equal selection is

unlikely to be true, and in fact, given our specialized data sets, we would expect selection on

observable factors to be greater than selection on unobservable factors. Thus, estimates obtained

under the assumption of equal selection will be biased downwards. Moreover, there is no

theoretical or empirical evidence that alcohol abuse has the potential to inhibit or prevent a

such circumstances.

   See Grossman et al. (2002), which studies the relationship between adolescent alcohol use and sexual behavior
using bivariate probit techniques similar to those used in the present study.

   Altonji et al. (2001) show that this condition implies: cov(S*, X’γ)/var(X’γ) = cov(S*, ε)/var(ε), where S* is an
unobserved, continuous measure of the net benefits from a suicide attempt, X’γ is the vector of observed variables
that affect S* weighted by their corresponding coefficients, and ε is the unobserved determinants of variables that
affect S* weighted by their relevant coefficients. We observe a suicide attempt (S=1) if S* is positive and no suicide
attempt (S=0) otherwise. Because of very strong selection on some exogenous, observable variables, such as age,
we impose this condition excluding variables that are thought to be exogenous (age, gender, race, region, state-level
characteristics, and survey year in the YRBS, and age and race in the NCS).

estimate obtained under the assumption that selection on unobservable variables is equal to

selection on observables. The upper bound effect is the estimate from the naïve single equation

probit model that assumes no selection on unobservable variables.




                                          DATA AND MEASURES

The Youth Risk Behavior Survey

         The Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) samples a nationally representative group of

teenagers in grades 9-12. Data were collected in 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997 and 1999. In each

year, a different group of students numbering between 10,000 and 15,000 is surveyed. The

primary strength of the YRBS data set is its large size, which allows us to estimate models

separately by gender. Estimating models separately for boys and girls is important because

numerous studies indicate that the prevalence of suicide attempts as well as the epidemiology of

suicide attempts varies considerably between adolescent females and males.12 In total, we use

four YRBS samples in the study: (1) all girls (N = 29,870); (2) all boys (N = 27,108); (3) girls

who report any level of alcohol use in the past year (N = 13,410); and (4) boys who report any

level of alcohol use in the past year (N = 13,737). By restricting one set of analyses to

drinkers—a more homogenous group—we reduce the potential for very high degrees of selection

on observed variables. The existence of extremely high levels of selection on observed variables

   Although completed suicides are much more common among male adolescents, female adolescents are about
twice as likely as male adolescents to report suicide attempts. Major depression is a strong predictor of suicide
attempt for both girls and boys. However, girls who attempt suicide are more likely to have family dysfunction, low
self-esteem, anxiety disorders and to have been sexually abused than boys. Boys who attempt suicide are more
likely than girls to report chronic stress, alcohol problems, and financial problems (Beautrais 2002, Weyrauch et al.
2001, Kelly et al. 2001, Wunderlich et al. 2001)

undermines the effectiveness of the bivariate probit models where selection on observed

variables is constrained to be equal to selection on unobserved variables.13

        We measure suicide attempts among YRBS youth using a dummy variable indicating

whether or not the respondent reported attempting suicide at least once in the past year. The

weighted percentage of respondents attempting suicide in the complete sample (drinkers and

non-drinkers) is about 7.5 percent during the sample period. The measure of alcohol abuse is not

a clinical diagnosis; clinical information is not available in these data. Instead, we use an

indicator of whether or not the respondent had five or more drinks of alcohol in a row within a

couple of hours on at least one occasion in the past 30 days. About 31.3 percent of respondents

in the complete sample report at least one of these binge drinking episodes in the past month.

        The YRBS contains only limited socioeconomic and demographic information on

respondents. Only survey year, state of residence, age, grade-level, and gender are consistently

reported in all surveys. The availability of state of residence allows us to include the state-level

unemployment rate and per capita real state-level income as covariates. These state level

variables are included to proxy family and community economic conditions, which are not

available in the data. The state characteristics also may capture unobserved attitudes towards

risky behaviors that respondents living in the same state might share. The YRBS also does not

have information on mental disorders, family background and stressful life events, which are

important risk factors for a suicide attempt. However, it does have data on risky behaviors; in

particular, the data include an indicator of frequent seat belt use and an indicator for whether or

not the respondent is a daily smoker. Many studies have shown that smoking is a strong

correlate of psychiatric disorder, although tobacco use is not expected to have a direct impact on


13
  A high degree of selection on observable variables implies a very high rho, sometimes greater than 1, which
usually results in the lower bound estimate of the effect to be zero.


                                                     13
suicidal behaviors (Brown et al. 2000; Breslau et al. 1998; Choi et al. 1997). Thus, this variable

may be a reasonable proxy for psychiatric disorder. We also include an indicator variable that

captures participation on any sports teams, which may reflect the respondent's attachment to and

involvement in school and the community.



The National Comorbidity Survey

       Although the YRBS offers a very large sample of adolescents with information on

alcohol use and suicide attempts, the data set lacks information on some of the most important

correlates of suicide attempts, particularly mental disorders. Moreover, the alcohol use

information available in the YRBS does not include a measure of a clinical diagnosis of alcohol

abuse or dependence. For this reason, we also estimate all models using The National

Comorbidity Survey, a second data set that is very strong in these areas. Our estimates generated

from the NCS sample enhance the YRBS analysis in two ways. First, we can evaluate the

robustness of the YRBS binge drinking estimates to the inclusion of a much richer set of

covariates, which is available in the NCS data. Second, we can examine the association between

clinically defined alcohol abuse and dependence and the risk of attempting suicide.

       The NCS is a congressionally mandated, nationally representative survey designed to

study mental illness in the United States. The survey respondents are 8,098 individuals aged 15-

54 between 1990 and 1992, with the majority of interviews being conducted in 1991. In order to

create a sample that is comparable in terms of age to the YRBS sample, we focus on a sub-

sample of females aged 15-19, resulting in a sample size of 364 individuals. We could not

estimate models for 15-19 year old males because only five males reported suicide attempts in




                                              14
this age group. In addition, the small sample size precluded limiting the sample to drinkers;

instead, we use a combined sample of females that includes drinkers and non-drinkers.

         As in the YRBS analysis, we measure suicide attempts using an indicator of whether or

not the respondent attempted suicide in the past year. About five percent of NCS respondents

report that they attempted suicide at least once during the past year. The rates of suicide attempts

in the YRBS and NCS samples are somewhat different, probably because of major differences in

the objectives and contexts of the surveys. If we consider suicide attempts that required medical

treatment, the rate for NCS females aged 15 to 19 is 3.3%. The rate of medically treated suicide

attempts for YRBS females ages 12 to 18 is 3.0%.14 Those rates, therefore, are almost identical.

For rates of all female suicide attempts, however, there is a larger difference between the surveys

(7.5% in the YRBS versus 5.0% in the NCS), apparently because NCS respondents were less

likely than YRBS respondents to report suicide attempts that did not require treatment. We

conjecture that the NCS respondents tended to only report serious suicide attempts because (1)

they were questioned by a trained interviewer collecting information about all of their mental

disorders; (2) the NCS instrument is designed to capture serious mental illnesses, unlike the

YRBS; and (3) they were asked the questions as a part of a set of very probing questions about

mental illness and violence. The YRBS respondents answered questions in the classroom and in

the context of questions about all risky behaviors, not mental illness, which may have led them to

report all types of suicide attempts rather than just more serious attempts.

         We measure alcohol abuse using both a binge drinking measure (as in the YRBS

analysis) and a measure that captures clinically defined alcohol use disorders. The binge

drinking measure is an indicator of whether or not the respondent consumed five or more drinks

14
 We estimated all models with “any medically treated suicide attempt” as the dependent variable. Our results,
which are available upon request, were qualitatively very similar to the results for “any suicide attempt” model


                                                      15
on any given day in the past year. We term this binge drinking, though conventionally binge

drinking is defined as consuming five or more drinks in a row. About 20.0 percent of NCS

respondents report binge drinking in the past year.

         The NCS clinical diagnosis of alcohol abuse and/or dependence is generated using the

Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The CIDI was developed by the National

Institute of Health, the World Health Organization, and the University of Michigan, and is a non-

clinician administered instrument, which generates psychiatric diagnoses. The CIDI has

undergone extensive testing for reliability and validity. Alcohol abuse is defined as either

continued use despite knowledge of its adverse effect on health and social functioning or

recurrent use in situations when use may be physically hazardous. Alcohol dependence requires

the presence of physiological symptoms of tolerance and withdrawal and continued use despite

adverse consequences. We construct a dichotomous indicator that is set equal to one if the

respondent met diagnostic criteria for either alcohol abuse or dependence in the past year. About

7.0 percent of the sample met clinical criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence in the past year.

The NCS is the only nationally representative survey in the United States to collect detailed data

on diagnosed psychiatric disorders, including alcohol use disorders. Controlling for mental

illness is crucial in this study because mental illness has been shown to be a significant predictor

of both substance use and suicidal behaviors (Saffer and Dave 2002; Crumley 1990; Moscicki

1995). The NCS includes information on 12 non-substance related psychiatric disorders:

generalized anxiety disorder; social phobia; simple phobia; panic attack; panic disorder;

agoraphobia; post traumatic stress disorder; major depression; dysthymia; bipolar disorder;

mania; and non-affective psychosis. The criteria and definitions are based on the Diagnostic and

Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-III-R (American Psychiatric Association 1988).


results, which are presented in this paper.

                                               16
We construct a dichotomous indicator for past year occurrence of any of the 12 psychiatric

disorders from this information.15

        A series of socioeconomic and demographic variables are also defined, including the

respondent’s age, gender, race, family income, and indicators of religion. Since most of the

respondents in our sample have not completed their schooling, we include an indicator of high

school dropout, which is set equal to one if the respondent is not in school and has completed

less than 12 years of education. An indicator of poor physical health is also defined.

        The NCS also includes a rich set of information on family background and life events.

Previous studies document that in addition to psychiatric disorders and substance use, suicide

attempts also are correlated with family conflict, parental psychiatric disorder, interpersonal

difficulties, being a victim of physical or sexual abuse, and other adverse childhood experiences

(Brent et al. 2002; Johnson et al. 2002; Glowinski et al. 2001; Dube et al. 2001; Hagedorn &

Omar 2002; Simon et al., 2002; Beitchman et al. 1992). These factors are likely to confound the

relationship between substance use and suicide (Rossow and Lauritzen 2001; Cutler et al. 2001).

To capture some of these risk factors, we include in the models an indicator of whether or not the

respondent lived with both parents until age 15, and whether or not the respondent lives in an

urban area (in a MSA or other urban, non-MSA county). We also include covariates to capture

stressful life events such as whether or not the respondent was: (1) involved in a fire or natural

disaster; (2) sexually abused, physically abused or neglected as a child; (3) suffered through the

death of someone close; (4) witnessed a friend or family member have a major life crisis; and (5)

raped during her lifetime. As in the YRBS analysis, we include in the models variables that may

  We also ran models that excluded major depressive disorder from our mental illness variables. While suicide
ideation and suicide attempts are neither necessary nor sufficient for this diagnosis, they are factors listed under
DSM-III-R that may satisfy some of the criteria for major depression. We therefore excluded this disorder since it
may introduce spurious correlation between mental illness and the left-hand side suicide variables. Excluding major

belts and whether or not the respondent uses condoms during intercourse.



                                                    RESULTS

          Tables 1and 2 show selection into binge drinking and suicide attempts along observable

characteristics for the YRBS sample. Tables 3 and 4 show selection into binge drinking,

clinically defined alcohol use disorders and suicide attempts for the NCS sample. Tables 5 and 6

summarize results from the standard probit and bivariate probit models estimated using the

YRBS sample (Table 5) and the NCS sample (Table 6).

         Table 1 presents means and standard errors by binge drinking status for all females, all

males, female drinkers and male drinkers from the YRBS. These descriptive statistics show that

the observed characteristics differ greatly based on binge drinking status, thus providing

evidence that there exists important selection into alcohol abuse along observable characteristics.

For example, among both girls and boys in the YRBS sample (Table 1), avoiding seat belt use,

carrying a weapon, getting into physical fights and smoking every day are much more prevalent

among binge drinkers than among teenagers who do not binge drink. These behaviors also are

much more prevalent among those who have attempted suicide, as seen in Table 2. The striking,

observable differences between alcohol abusers and non-abusers, and those who do and do not

attempt suicide, suggest that selection into suicidal and drinking behaviors based on

unobservable factors may be important in the analysis of the YRBS sample. Our assumption of

positive selection on unobserved factors is buttressed by the fact that the set of observable risky

behaviors (i.e. no seat belt use, weapon-carrying, smoking, fighting) increases the probability of



depression, however, does not significantly alter our results.


                                                        18
both binge drinking and attempting suicide. This positive selection remains strong even when

the samples are limited to drinkers.

       These observations also hold true to some extent for the NCS sample, as seen in Tables 3

and 4. There is considerable, positive sorting into alcohol use disorders along observable

characteristics such as mental illness, living with both parents until age 15, and stressful life

events, such as having a close relative die (Table 3). Similar selection is observed for suicide

attempts (Table 4). Once again, this evidence strongly supports our assumption of positive

selection in the constrained bivariate probit models. That is, individuals who meet diagnostic

criteria for a psychiatric disorder, who did not live with both parents before age 15, and have

experienced the death of a close family member are more likely to both attempt suicide and to

abuse alcohol. We do not find strong selection into binge drinking, which may be due to our use

of a non-standard measure of binge drinking. Because of data limitations in the NCS, we define

binge drinking as “five or more drinks on any given day in the past year” instead of “five or

more drinks in a row within a couple of hours on at least one occasion in the past 30 days,” as we

did in the YRBS analysis. The latter measure is preferred because it better captures intense

drinking by stipulating that the drinks were consumed “in a row”, “within a couple hours” and

“on one occasion.” Moreover, a 30-day measure is superior to a past-year measure because it

maximizes the potential for accurate recall.

        Table 5 summarizes results from the suicide attempts models based on the YRBS

sample. The first row of Table 5 presents the marginal effects and t-ratios on binge drinking

from a parsimonious probit model that includes only a small set of covariates, and from a model

that includes a more extensive set of variables. The models are estimated separately for all boys

and all girls, as well for boys who drink and girls who drink. An F-test (reported in Table 5) of




                                                19
all covariates interacted with gender from a fully interacted model empirically supports our

estimation based on gender specific samples.

       In all of the probit models, the estimates indicate that binge drinking has a statistically

significant association with attempting suicide. Estimates from models with an extended set of

covariates indicate that binge drinking is associated with a 62% increase in the probability of

suicide attempt for girls and a 40% increase for boys at the sample means. When the samples are

limited to drinkers, binge drinking is associated with an increase in the probability of a suicide

attempt by 37% for girls and 33% for boys at the sample means. These estimates can be

considered upper bound estimates since the model is based on the assumption that binge drinking

is exogenous, and both theory and empirical evidence indicate that positive selection on

unobserved variables will diminish this effect. In all cases, however, the magnitude of the binge

drinking effect is considerably smaller when the full set of covariates, rather than the small set of

covariates, is included in the model. This finding indicates strong selection on observable

characteristics; the additional covariates included in the more inclusive models are both

significant predictors of suicide attempts and are highly correlated with binge drinking.

       Given the evidence that selection on observable characteristics is important, and therefore

unobservable variables are likely to be important as well, we attempt to assess the degree of

selection of unobservable variables that would be needed to reduce or even eliminate the large,

statistically significant association between binge drinking and suicide attempts. Table 5 shows

estimates of the association between binge drinking and suicide attempts from six bivariate

probit models (Models 1-6) estimated using the YRBS samples (all girls, all boys, girl drinkers,

boy drinkers). In the first five models, the correlation coefficient ρ is constrained to be 0.1, 0.2,

0.3, 0.4 or 0.5, with larger coefficients corresponding to stronger correlation between the




                                                20
unobservable determinants of alcohol abuse and suicide attempts. In the sixth model, the ρ is

constrained such that the degree of selection on unobservable factors is forced to be equal to the

degree of selection on observable covariates, which is the highest degree of selection on

unobservables that we would expect to encounter. The assumption of positive selection is clearly

justified based on the evidence in Tables 1 and 2.

       As models (1)-(5) clearly show, even a very modest amount of selection on unobservable

variables (ρ = 0.1 or 0.2) completely eliminates the positive effect of binge drinking on suicide

attempts in all four YRBS samples. In fact, as we increase the amount of correlation in

increments of 0.10, the estimated coefficient on binge drinking quickly becomes statistically

insignificant, and eventually negative and statistically significant. If we assume that the true

lower bound effect is non-negative, which seems appropriate given that there is little reason to

expect binge drinking to lower suicide attempts, then the only relevant range of selection on

unobserved variables is where the association between binge drinking and suicide attempts is

positive. As noted, this occurs when rho takes on a value between 0.1 and 0.2, suggesting that it

is unlikely that binge drinking has a true causal effect. This inference is further supported by the

estimates from model (6), which reveal a significant amount of selection on observed variables,

as measured by the estimates of rho; indeed, when the sample is not restricted to drinkers, the

estimate of rho is outside the feasible range. Thus, in order for binge drinking to have a true

positive causal effect on suicide attempts, selection on unobserved variables would have to be

close to zero, or only a fraction (10 to 15 percent) of the amount of selection on observed

variables. This appears unlikely, especially since we believe that many important, unobserved

determinants of suicide attempts and binge drinking remain in the error term.




                                               21
       Table 6 presents results from the same estimation approach with the NCS sample; the

results pertain to females only because of the small sample sizes and the low incidence rate of

suicide attempts among males in the NCS data. In this analysis, we consider the effects of binge

drinking as well as clinically defined substance use disorders on suicide attempts. As in the

YRBS analysis, estimation of small and more fully specified models indicates that selection on

observed factors is important since the coefficients fall by 89% and 79% for binge drinking and

alcohol use disorder, respectively. The more fully specified models indicate that binge drinking

is associated with an increase in the probability of suicide attempt of about 17%, while a

diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder is associated with an increase in the probability of suicide

attempt of 79% at the sample means. These estimates are our upper bound estimates of the effect

of alcohol abuse on suicide attempts. The estimate of the effect of binge drinking on girls’

suicide attempts is somewhat smaller than the estimate generated from the analysis of YRBS

girls. This is expected given that the binge drinking measure defined in the YRBS is more likely

to capture intense drinking occasions.

       When we estimate the constrained bivariate probit models, the NCS analysis of binge

drinking yields similar results to the YRBS analysis of binge drinking (Table 6). As we increase

the amount of positive selection imposed on the model, the association between binge drinking

and suicide attempt quickly becomes less positive and statistically insignificant and eventually

becomes negative in sign and not statistically significant. As in the YRBS analysis, even small

amounts of positive selection on unobserved factors eliminate the positive, statistically

significant effect of binge drinking on suicide attempt that we find in the standard probit models.

       However, the same exercise yields very different results when we use the NCS sample to

consider the effect of clinically defined alcohol use disorders on suicide attempts (Table 6). As




                                              22
we impose increasingly greater amounts of positive selection on the bivariate probit model, the

effect of alcohol use disorder on suicide attempt grows smaller, as expected, but remains

statistically significant, even when the correlation coefficient is constrained to be 0.4. Second,

when selection on unobserved variables is set equal to selection on observed variables, the

estimate remains positive and statistically significant. Estimates from model (6) indicate that a

diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder increases the probability of a suicide attempt by about 27

percent. The estimated correlation coefficient in the equal selection model is considerably larger

than the correlation coefficient estimated in the binge drinking analysis (0.307 versus 0.189),

which suggests that selection along observed factors is more important for clinically defined

alcohol use disorders than for binge drinking. This result is consistent with Tables 3 and 4.

       Because the NCS was conducted specifically to study the determinants of mental illness,

it is very unlikely that selection on unobservable factors is equal to selection on observables; in

other words, the covariates we can observe, such as mental illness or family background, are

likely to be the most important determinants of suicide attempts. Our lower bound, therefore, is

extremely conservative. Nevertheless, if we use this estimate as a lower bound on the effect and

the standard probit estimate as the upper bound, we conclude that clinically defined alcohol use

disorders increase the probability of suicide attempt, and the magnitude of this effect falls

between 27 percent and 79 percent. This range is broad, as there is no way of knowing how

much selection on unobservable factors exists. However, this range provides strong reason to

believe that the relationship between clinically defined alcohol use disorders and suicide attempts

is indeed causal, and that the magnitude of this effect is meaningful from a policy perspective, at

least among adolescent girls.

                                          DISCUSSION




                                               23
       Previous research supports a causal relationship between alcohol use and suicide

attempts, and suggests that state-level alcohol policies, such as minimum drinking ages, beer

taxes and driving while intoxicated laws, can reduce suicide attempts and completed suicide rates

among youth. This study tests the plausibility of this idea by using two data sources to explore

the causal relationship between alcohol abuse and suicide attempts among youth. We find little

evidence that binge drinking and suicide attempts are causally related. This finding implies that

broad-based alcohol use policies and prevention programs will not be very effective in reducing

suicide attempts among youth. Clearly, more research is needed to reconcile these competing

findings and to provide policy makers with a more definitive base of evidence.

       However, our study supports the existence of a causal link between clinically defined

alcohol use disorders and suicide attempts among female adolescents. Therefore, identifying and

treating girls who meet diagnostic criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence may be an effective

way to reduce the risk of suicide attempts among youth. To date, there is very little evidence that

any existing suicide prevention policies actually reduce the risk of suicide. This research

suggests that suicide prevention policies may be useful if they focus on moving substance

abusing and dependent youth into effective treatment.
