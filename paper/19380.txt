                                              ABSTRACT

Banking reforms—that reduced interest rates—boosted college enrollment rates among able students
from middle class families. We define “able” students as those with learning aptitude scores in the
top two-thirds of the U.S. population. We define “middle class” as families in which both parents are
not highly-educated (above 12 years of education) and that are neither in the bottom fourth nor in the
top 10 percent of the distribution family income in the U.S. Our findings suggest that credit conditions,
the ability of an individual to benefit from college, and a family’s financial and educational circumstances
combine to shape college decisions. The functioning of the financial system plays a powerful role
in shaping the degree to which a child’s educational choices—and hence economic opportunities—are
defined by parental income.

                                                           Consider two observations about education and income. First, there is a positive association

between education and income. On average, people who receive more education go on to earn

higher incomes. Second, there is a positive association between parental income and the education

of their children. Thus, higher-income parents tend to have children that receive more education and

this additional education is associated with those children earning higher incomes as adults.1

                                                           These two observations motivate a hotly debated question among social scientists: If the

returns to education are so high, why do children from lower-income families obtain less education

than children from higher-income families? If education boosts future incomes, what constrains

children from lower-income families from attaining more education?

                                                           One view focuses on the costs: lower-income families do not have the money—and

borrowing is too expensive—to pay for more (Becker, 1975; Kane, 1994; Kane and Rouse, 1999;

Ellwood and Kane, 2000; Belley and Lochner, 2007; Brown, Scholz and Seshadri, 2007). From this

perspective, financial reforms that lower interest rates will boost education, including college

enrollment rates, among children from disadvantaged families that were unable to afford college

when credit was more expensive.

                                                           A second view stresses the benefits: the returns to higher education for children from

disadvantaged families are comparatively low, and so they invest less in education (Cameron and

Heckman, 1998, 2001; Shea 2000; Keane and Wolpin, 2001; Carneiro and Heckman, 2002; Keane

2002). That is, if children from lower-income families experience family, community, and grade

school environments that are less conducive to their cognitive and noncognitive development than

children from higher-income families, then their expected benefits from attending college will be

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1	  	  
	  
corresponding lower. Consequently, by the time students are deciding whether to work or go to

college, their childhood environments have already determined their expected benefits from going

to college. From this perspective, financial reforms that reduce the cost of credit will have a minor

effect as disadvantaged families accurately view the expected benefits as low.2

                                                           To assess these views empirically, numerous empirical studies use indirect methods—that

do not rely on directly observing interest rates—to infer whether interest rates materially shape

educational choices because of the difficulties associated with identifying exogenous changes in

interest rates. As we review in greater detail below, a large body of research devoted to estimating

the causal effects of schooling on income (see Card, 1999, 2001) has found that the instrumental

variable estimates of the returns to schooling exceed the OLS estimates. In theory, credit

constrained individuals will have higher returns to education on the margin than less constrained

individuals. This implies that if the instrumental variables capture the schooling choices of credit

constrained individuals more than others, the instrumental variable estimates will be larger (Lang,

1993; Card 1999, 2001). However, it might be inappropriate to interpret the differences between IV

and OLS estimates as reflecting the impact of the cost of credit on educational choices since other

factors can produce these differences (Carneiro and Heckman, 2002; Cameron and Taber, 2004).

                                                           A second, but much more limited body of research, directly assesses the impact of interest

rates on education, but there are serious methodological limitations with this line of inquiry too. In

an influential study, Card and Lemieux (2001) find that changes in U.S. interests do not account for

changes in educational choices over the period from 1968 to 1996. But, it is inappropriate to treat

the United States as an integrated capital market with a single interest rate during the 20th century

with corresponding effects on state-level interest rates.

 Rather than focusing on reducing the cost of credit, this “benefits” view holds that the most efficacious way to boost
college graduation rates among lower-income families is through early childhood interventions that enhance cognitive
and noncognitive development and thereby boost the returns to education.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2	  	  
	  
influenced the cost of credit in each state. And, states reformed their regulations in different years

during the second half of the 20th century. Consequently, both the level and dynamics of interest

rates differ across states. Furthermore, since many factors might be correlated with both interest

rates and education, it is important to use instrumental variables to identify the impact of interest

rates on education.

                                                           By integrating labor and financial economics, we contribute to the study of the impact of

credit conditions on educational choices in several ways. First, we assess whether state-specific

banking reforms that intensified competition among banks and reduced state-specific interest rates

increased the probability that students from those states attended college. Previous research on

education and credit conditions typically fails both to recognize that U.S. credit markets were highly

segmented due to state-specific regulations on banks for virtually the entire 20th century and to

exploit the cross-state heterogeneity in the timing of banking reforms that lowered interest rates. In

one of the largest, if not the largest, financial regulatory reform in the history of the United States,

every state relaxed geographic restrictions on bank branching—intrastate bank branching reform—

during the second half of the 20th century, where the state-specific timings of these deregulations

were independent of interest rates and education. Although these intrastate bank branch

deregulations eased credit conditions, we are—to the best of our knowledge—the first to assess the

impact of these regulatory reforms on educational choices.3

                                                           Second, using state-level bank branch deregulation as an instrumental variable for interest

rates, we assess whether this component of state-level interest rates affects the probability that

students from that state attend college. However, one must be cautious in drawing sharp inferences

from the IV analyses, since bank branch deregulation does not necessarily satisfy both conditions

for a valid instrument. Although there is no evidence that educational choices or interest rates

influence the timing of bank deregulation in a state, the exclusionary condition might not hold. For

example, bank deregulation might accelerate economic activity and boost the demand for skilled

workers, encouraging more students to attend college. Put differently, exogenous bank branch

deregulation might reduce interest rates and boost college enrollment rates, but it might not boost

college enrollments by lowering interest rates; it might boost college enrollments by increasing the

demand for skilled workers. Thus, to interpret the instrumental variable analyses as providing

information about the impact of an exogenous change in the cost of borrowing on the decision to

attend college, we separately evaluate whether demand side factors are driving the results.

       Third, we assess whether an easing of credit conditions triggered by intrastate bank branch

deregulation influenced only those particular children within particular families implied by Becker’s

(1967) model of human capital accumulation. The model suggests that the impact of lowering

interest rates on attending college depends in an interactive manner on family income and the ability

of the individual child to benefit from college. This framework suggests that a reduction in interest

rates will have a larger impact on high-ability students that would benefit materially from college

but whose parents were previously unable to afford college than it will on high-ability children from

families that are unconstrained when making decisions about college. Thus, the model predicts that

the impact of a change in credit conditions will differ depending on the ability of the individual

student to benefit from college and on the ability of the family to pay for college. We are the first to

assess this prediction using both the simple reduced form analyses of education and bank

deregulation and the IV analyses that use bank deregulation as an instrument for interest rates.

       To make these contributions, we primarily use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youths,

1979 (NLSY79) because of its unique characteristics. First, the NLSY79 traces individuals through



                                                   4	  	  
	  
time, so that we know the educational attainment of each person. Second, the NLSY79 contains

information on learning aptitude. It gave respondents the Armed Forces Qualifications Test (AFQT)

in 1980 when they were between the ages of 15 and 22. We use the AFQT score as a measure of

learning ability, i.e., ability to benefit from education. Third, the NLSY79 has information about

each respondent’s family, including family income in 1979 and the educational attainment of both

the mother and father. Given the tight connection between education and income and the problems

associated with measuring permanent income using only one year of data, we sometimes use

parental education as a proxy measure of the permanent income of the family instead of family

income in 1979. Fourth, the NSLY79 has information two psychometric traits, as measured in 1980

self-esteem and the degree to which the person believes that chance, fate, and luck control their

lives. Thus, in assessing the impact of changes in credit conditions on educational choices, we can

control for many individual and family characteristics. To complement the NLSY79, we use the

Current Population Survey (CPS), which surveys more people than the NLSY79 but it does not

information on learning ability, parental education, or personality traits. Thus, we use the CPS to

make broader assessments about the impact of bank deregulation on interest rates and the Mincerian

returns to education and the NLSY79 to assess how changes in credit conditions influence the

decision of individuals to attend college.

       We find that intrastate bank deregulation substantially increased the probability that

individuals with particular learning abilities and family traits attended college. Specifically, bank

deregulation had no effect on students in the lower third of the distribution of learning ability, as

measured by AFQT: for students where the expected benefits of college are low, changes in credit

conditions have no appreciable effect on the probability of attending college. But, bank deregulation

did boost the probability that “able” students—students in the upper two-thirds of the AFQT



                                                   5	  	  
	  
distribution—go to college. For example, five years after a state deregulated, the probability that

able students attend college was 13 percent greater than before deregulation. Moreover, and

consistent with theory, it is the able students from families in which both parents have a relatively

low level of education (less than 12 years of completed schooling) that an easing of credit

conditions has the biggest impact. Indeed, for able students from families in which both parents

have more than 12 years of education, bank deregulation has no effect. To the extent that parental

education is an accurate signal of the family’s permanent income (or the family’s taste for

education), changes in credit conditions do not have much of an influence on the decisions highly-

educated, affluent parents to send their children to college. However, in more disadvantaged

families (as measured by parental education), bank deregulation has a large effect: five years after

deregulation, able students from disadvantaged families have an almost 20 percent greater

probability of attending college. The results are consistent with the view that credit conditions

materially influence the educational opportunities of a particular segment of society: able students

from disadvantaged families.

       When dividing the sample by family income instead of parental education, we find that

easing intrastate bank deregulation boosted college enrollment rates among able students from

middle and upper-middle class families. Even among students in the upper two-thirds of the AFQT

distribution, an easing of credit conditions did not influence children from lower-income families

(below the 25th percentile of the income distribution) or high-income families (above the 90th

percentile). At these income levels, marginal changes in interest rates did not alter decisions about

college. However, for able students from families with incomes between the 50th and 75th percentile

of the income distribution, bank deregulation materially altered college decisions.




                                                   6	  	  
	  
       The results are very similar when we use bank deregulation as an instrumental variable for

interest rates. Only for able students from middle and upper-middle class families is the reduction in

interest rates associated with an increase in the probability of attending college. For lower-income

families or high-income families, such changes in the cost of credit do not influence college

decisions. And, reductions in interest rates do not increase the probability of attending college

among students with AFQT scores in the bottom third of the sample. Consistent with theory,

changes in the cost of credit influence a particular, but meaningful, segment of society.

       Finally, we show that our results do not simply reflect the impact of intrastate bank

deregulation on the demand for skilled labor; rather, bank deregulatory reforms boosted college

enrollment rates among able students from middle and upper-middle class families at partially by

lowering the costs of credit. In particular, a legitimate concern with our analyses is that perhaps

branch deregulation boosted economic activity (Jayaratne and Strahan, 1996) and thereby boosted

the demand for skilled labor. Perhaps, this “demand side” effect is driving the increase in college

enrollments and we have misinterpreted the findings as arising from a reduction in the “cost of

credit.” While reasonable conceptually, the “demand side” channel is not the only channel through

which bank deregulation increased college enrollments. If the results were purely a demand side

effect, then bank deregulation should boost the demand for college-educated workers and the

returns to a college education. But, we show that that bank deregulation reduced the returns to a

college education, which is fully consistent with a reduction in costs boosting the supply of college-

educated workers. Although we do not rule out the demand-side channel as a contributing factor,

the findings suggest that the supply side mattered too, as deregulation eased credit conditions and

this boosted the supply of college-educated workers.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sketches the theoretical

framework and its empirical predictions. Section 3 provides a literature review and details how we

propose to contribute to existing research. In section 4, we discuss the data on bank deregulation,

interest rates, and education. Section 5 presents the results and section 6 concludes.




2.     Theoretical Framework and Empirical Predictions

       Building directly on Becker (1967) and Mincer (1974), this section first presents a

theoretical model of human capital and then details the empirical predictions emerging from the

theory. In its simplest form, the Becker (1967) model assumes that each individual i maximizes the

discounted present value of lifetime earnings, W(si), by choosing the optimal level of investment in

human capital, si, which we call “schooling” or “education” but which represents all investments in

human capital skills that boost earnings.

                                                     ∞
                                       W ( si ) =   ∫ y( s ) exp(−(r − θ ))dt,
                                                                       i   i   i
                                                    t =s                                                 (1)

where y(si) denotes the annual earnings of an individual with a schooling level si, ri is the interest

rate facing individual i, which reflects her cost of capital and subjective rate of time preference, and

θi is the individual’s preference for schooling over work. For simplicity, we assume an infinite

planning horizon.

       To complete the model, let earnings reflect the spot market value of a unit of human capital

(P) multiplied by the individual’s stock of accumulated human capital (H(si)):

                                                y ( si ) = P * H ( si ).                                 (2)

Further, following Grilliches (1977) and more recently Card (2001), define the human capital

production function as follows:

                                                           8	  	  
	  
                                                                        γ
                                         H ( si ) = exp(ai si −             si2 + µi ),
                                                                        2                                (3)

where individual i’s human capital is positively related to her schooling (si), ability to benefit from

schooling ( ai ) and initial level of general skills (µi). The beneficial effects of additional schooling

face diminishing returns ( γ ), which we assume to be the same across all individuals for simplicity.

                                                                                   *
        Solving, the optimal level of schooling for individual i ( si ) is

                                                    ai − ri + θ i
                                            si* =                   .
                                                            γ                                            (4)

Across individuals, differences in the optimal amount of education reflect differences in the ability

to benefit from education (ai)—modeled as the technological efﬁciency with which learning time,

effort and resources augment the value of human capital, the cost of credit (ri), and the (dis)utility

from schooling (θi). Clearly, if an individual’s marginal benefit from education in terms of future

income is relatively large (i.e., a large ai ), then this individual will tend to invest relatively more in

schooling than a low-ability person. And, if an individual’s preference for education, θi, is relatively

high, then such an individual will invest more in education than comparable individuals with

weaker tastes for schooling. The model is silent about the source of heterogeneity in the “ability to

benefit” from education (Ben Porath, 1967) and the “ability to pay.” Separating between the ability

to benefit from education and the ability to pay for it is challenging, especially since family and

community environments affect both.

        While it is appropriate to model human capital as a stock and investment in human capital as

a flow, schooling—especially higher level education—is often a discrete choice. Therefore, there

are discrete educational choices, such as attending college, for which the impact of easing credit

conditions will depend on the initial conditions facing the family and individual student. For


                                                        9	  	  
	  
example, a high-ability student in a high-income family that has a strong taste for education might

have an optimal level of schooling that includes college and even a postgraduate degree. In this

case, lowering interest rates will not affect the decision to attend college. As another example, a

low-ability student from a disadvantaged family with weak tastes for education might have an

optimal level of schooling that does not even include graduating from high school. In this case,

lowering interest rates is unlikely to affect the decision to attend college. However, for some high-

ability children from families in which initial interest rates cause the expected costs of college to

outweigh the expected benefits, an easing of credit conditions could influence the decision to go to

college. Thus, the impact of credit conditions on the decision of an individual student in a particular

family to attend college may depend materially on the student’s ability to benefit from college and

the initial financial conditions facing the family and its taste for education.




3. The Literature and Our Contribution

       3.1 Debates

       Why do lower-income families not invest more in the education of their children? An

enormous literature documents large disparities in high school and college graduation rates across

family income groups over the 20th century (Behrman and Taubman, 1990; Hauser, 1993; Kane,

1994; Mayer, 1997; Manski and Wise, 1983; Cameron and Heckman, 1998, 2001; Shea, 2000;

Caneiro and Heckman, 2002). Since education is so highly correlated with income, this motivates

research on the persistence of inter-income group disparities in education.

       As the model highlights, there are two major, though not mutually exclusive, explanations

for why disadvantaged families invest comparatively little in the education of their children. The

first emphasizes the costs: lower-income families do not have the money to pay for more education


                                                    10	  
                                                     	  
	  
and their borrowing costs are high. These costs hinder lower-income families from providing the

same level of education to their kids as higher-income families, perpetuating intergenerational

income differences. From this perspective, lowering interest rates will lower the costs of education,

so that high-ability children from lower-income families can now afford college. Thus,

improvements in financial systems can reduce inequalities of opportunity and the inefficient

persistence of relative income differences.

       The second explanation of why lower-income families do not invest more in education

stresses the benefits: the children of disadvantaged families frequently face lower expected returns

to additional education, i.e., their ai’s are low. According to this view, family, community, and

school environments affect the cognitive and non-cognitive development of children and hence the

ability of those children to benefit from a college education. That is, by the time children are

deciding about whether to work or go to college, the expected benefits of college have largely been

determined. Thus, children from disadvantaged families, which tend to provide family, community,

and school environments less conducive to the cognitive and noncognitive development of their

children, will disproportionately, and accurately, view college as a relatively low-return activity.

From this perspective, lowering interests rates will not induce lower-income families to invest much

more in sending the kids to college.

       3.2. Existing Evidence

The evidence on whether the credit conditions influence educational choices is inconclusive. Given

the difficulties associated with measuring the credit conditions facing individuals, a large body of

research has used indirect methods— that do not require researchers to observe interest rates or

other measures of credit conditions—to draw inferences about the influence of credit conditions on

educational choices.

       Numerous studies have tackled this question by studying the correlation between

educational attainment and family income (or other family characteristics). The positive correlation

between educational attainment and family income has been widely interpreted as evidence that

borrowing constraints hinder educational choices (see for example: Kane, 1994; Kane and Rouse,

1999; Ellwood and Kane, 2000; Belley and Lochner, 2007; Brown, Scholz and Seshadri, 2012).

However the step from correlation to causation is a precarious one as family income is also strongly

correlated with family resources that foster cognitive and non-cognitive traits that boost the ability

of a student to benefit from more education. The connection between family resources and the

nurturing of cognitive and noncognitive traits that increase the productivity of formal schooling has

been emphasized by Cameron and Heckman, 1998, 2001; Shea 2000; Keane and Wolpin, 2001;

Carneiro and Heckman, 2002; Heckman and Rubinstein, 2001; Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua, 2006;

Keane 2002 and Cameron and Taber, 2004.

       In addition, a large literature finds that the instrumental variables (IV) estimates of the return

to schooling exceed OLS estimates (see Card, 1999, 2001). Credit conditions are one possible

source of this difference between IV and OLS estimates, a point first offered by Becker (1967). In

particular, instrumental variables estimates can be interpreted as estimating the return for those

randomly assigned to schooling by the instrument. Finding higher returns using IV is consistent



                                                  12	  
                                                   	  
	  
with the view that that those affected by the “instrument” are credit constrained (Lang, 1993; Card,

1999, 2001) and therefore consistent with interest rates curtailing the educational opportunities of

lower-income families. Similarly, Shea (2000) finds that family income matters for children’s

human capital investment in a sample of low-income families, but not for the broader population.4

                                                           Substantial work, however, challenges the methodological efficacy of these indirect methods

for drawing inferences about the impact of credit conditions on educational choices. For example,

Heckman (1995), Cameron and Heckman (1998, 2001), and Carneiro and Heckman (2002) suggest

that it is inappropriate to interpret the difference between OLS and IV estimates in the sample of

low-income families as signaling the importance of liquidity constraints, criticizing econometrically

the use of invalid instruments and pointing, economically, for alternative explanations including

sorting to schooling on comparative advantage.

                                                           Hence, larger coefficients in IV regressions of income on education might not imply the

existence and impact of interest rates on schooling. That is, without directly measuring exogenous

changes in interest rates, it is difficult to distinguish between cross-family differences in interest

rates (ri) and attitudes toward education (θi). Furthermore, Cameron and Taber (2004) question the

robustness of the instrumental variable results to using alternative instruments, and Keane and

Wolpin (2001) estimate a structural model of schooling behavior and find that relaxing interest rates

tends to increase consumption, not investment in education

                                                           A much more limited set of papers assesses the direct linkage between interest rates and

schooling decisions. As a leading example, Card and Lemieux (2001) find that changes in U.S.

interest rates over the period from 1968-1996 do not account for changes in educational choices.

interest rates and educational choices. First, it is inappropriate to treat the United States as an

integrated capital market with a single interest rate, especially with regards to household loans

during the 20th century. Each state exerted a powerful regulatory role over banks until the mid-

1990s, so that interest rates, and their evolution over time, differ markedly by state. Second, it is

valuable to identify an exogenous source of variation in credit conditions to assess the impact of

interest rates on educational choices. Some third factor, such as aggregate economic activity, could

affect both interest rates and education decisions, creating a spurious correlation between them.

       After first distributing our research in the NBER Working Paper series, we learned that Sun

and Yannelis (2013) examine the impact of bank deregulation on educational choices and

borrowing to fund education. They find a positive relationship between deregulation and both total

state college enrollment and borrowing for education. In contrast to our paper, they do not

distinguish students by their ability to benefit from additional education or by the educational and

income characteristics of their parents, which theory predicts is important for assessing how an

easing of credit conditions influences educational choices.




                                                    14	  
                                                     	  
	  
       3.3. Our Contribution

       We propose to contribute to existing research in the following interrelated ways. First, we

will directly examine the relationship between educational choices and credit conditions, as

measured by exogenous changes in bank regulations that lowered interest rates. This contrasts with

the large literature that draws inferences about the importance of credit conditions in explaining

educational choices through indirect methods, i.e., by examining differences between IV and OLS

coefficient estimates of the relationship between wages and education.

       Second, we will assess the impact of the exogenous relaxation of regulatory restrictions on

bank branching—that lowered interest rates—on college enrollment rates. As we describe in greater

detail below, these deregulations occurred across all states in varying years during the second half

of the 20th century. Since these state-level regulatory reforms occurred in different years, we control

for all national influences by including year fixed effects. Furthermore, whereas past studies take

the United States as an integrated financial system with one interest rate, we allow interests rates to

differ at the state-year level. This is crucial for drawing accurate inferences about the relationship

between credit conditions and educational choices because state regulations heavily and

differentially influenced credit conditions across the U.S. states for much of the 20th century and

these regulations were liberalized in different years in different states.

       Third, we assess the relationship between interest rates and college enrollment rates, using

exogenous cross-state, cross-year variation in bank deregulation as an instrumental variable (IV) for

interest rates. Unlike much existing work, it is valuable to use instrumental variables because

interest rates and schooling choices might be simultaneously determined. In these analyses, we

argue that bank deregulation is exogenous to educational choices, but we do not claim that bank

deregulation influences schooling only through its effect on interest rates; we do not claim that bank



                                                    15	  
                                                     	  
	  
deregulation satisfies the exclusionary restriction. In particular, bank deregulation might boost the

demand for skilled workers and thereby induce more people to attend college. Despite these

limitations, we present evidence that deregulation boosted college enrollment rates by reducing the

cost of college, not simply by increasing the demand for skilled workers.

       Fourth, we provide an empirical bridge between those that focus on the costs of education

and those that focus on the benefits of education in seeking to explain why the children of lower-

income families tend to obtain less education. To do this, we will evaluate the impact of easing

credit conditions (“costs of education”) on an individual’s educational choices while differentiating

by proxies for (1) the person’s learning aptitude (“benefits of education”) and (2) the family’s initial

conditions as measured by family income and the education of the parents. Thus, we will assess

how the costs and benefits of college combine to shape an individual’s educational choices.

       Furthermore, by differentiating by each individual’s cognitive abilities and the traits of each

person’s parents, the framework advertises an addition line of inquiry: Credit conditions can

influence the ability of a person to benefit from college. For example, if a reduction in interest rates

allows a family to purchase a home in a better school district and this school district enhances the

cognitive and noncognitive capabilities of the children, then interests can increase the returns from

additional education for these children: a reduction in ri can boost ai, with a concomitant increase in

education and lifetime earnings. We are pursuing this line of research in a companion paper.

4. Data: Bank Deregulation, Interest rates, and Education

       4.1. History and timing of bank deregulation

       Geographic restrictions on banks have their origins in the U.S. Constitution, which limited

states from taxing interstate commerce and issuing fiat money. In turn, states raised revenues by

chartering banks and taxing their profits. Since states received no charter fees from banks

incorporated in other states, state legislatures prohibited the entry of out-of-state banks through

interstate bank regulations. To maximize revenues from selling charters, states also effectively

granted local monopolies to banks by restricting banks from branching within state borders. These

intrastate branching restrictions frequently limited banks to operating in one city.

       By protecting inefficient banks from competition, geographic restrictions created a powerful

constituency for maintaining these regulations even after the original fiscal motivations receded.

Indeed, banks protected by these regulations successfully lobbied both the federal government and

state governments to prohibit interstate banking and intrastate branching (White, 1982).

       In the second half of the 20th century, however, technological, legal, and financial

innovations diminished the economic and political power of banks benefiting from geographic

restrictions. In particular, a series of innovations lowered the costs of using distant banks. This

reduced the monopoly power of local banks and weakened their ability and desire to lobby for

geographic restrictions. For example, the invention of automatic teller machines (ATMs), in

conjunction with court rulings that ATMs are not bank branches, weakened the geographical link

between banks and their clientele. Furthermore, the creation of checkable money market mutual

funds made banking by mail and telephone easier, thus further weakening the power of local bank

monopolies. Finally, the increasing sophistication of credit scoring techniques, improvements in




                                                   17	  
                                                    	  
	  
information processing, and the revolution in telecommunications reduced the informational

advantages of local bankers, especially with regards to small and new firms.

       These national developments interacted with preexisting state characteristics to shape the

timing of bank deregulation across the states, which are listed in Table 1. As shown by Kroszner

and Strahan (1999), deregulation occurred later in states where potential losers from deregulation

(small, monopolistic banks) were financially stronger and had a lot of political power. On the other

hand, deregulation occurred earlier in states where potential winners of deregulation (small firms)

were relatively numerous.

       Thus, unlike many types of regulatory reforms that occur at the national level, geographic

bank deregulation took place on a state-by-state basis over an extended period. Table 1 lists the

timing of these reforms across the 50 states plus the District of Columbia. For example, we often

use the number of years since a state deregulated intrastate branch banking in 1979, which has a

mean value of 3.6 and a standard deviation of 7.1, as shown in Table 2.



       4.2. Interest rates

       To measure the cost of credit, we use data on mortgage rates at the state-year level. Since

consumers frequently use homes as collateral, these rates provide information on general credit

conditions. The mortgage interest rate data are based on a monthly survey of major lenders that are

asked to report the terms and conditions on all conventional, single-family, fully amortized,

purchase-money loans closed in the last five working days of the month. The data excludes FHA-

insured and VA-guaranteed mortgages, refinancing loans, and balloon loans. The “effective interest

rate” includes the amortization of initial fees, points, and charges over a 10-year period, which is the




                                                  18	  
                                                   	  
	  
historical assumption of the average life of a mortgage loan and is computed by the Federal

Housing Finance Board. We then deflate by the national consumer price index.



       4.3. Education and other individual level data

       We primarily use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79). The NLSY79 is a

nationally representative sample of 12,686 young men and women who were 14-22 years old when

they were first surveyed in 1979. Interviewees have been surveyed annually since the initial wave of

the survey and on a biennial basis after 1994. The NLSY is made up of three subsamples: (1) a

random sample of 6,111 non-institutionalized civilian youths, (2) a supplemental sample of 5,295

youths designed to oversample civilian Hispanics, blacks, and economically disadvantaged whites,

and (3) a sample of 1,280 youths who were ages 17–21 as of January 1, 1979, and who were

enlisted in the military as of September 30, 1978. We use the random sample and the black and

Hispanic oversamples and use the weights provided by the NLSY79, so that the weighted and

analyses provided a representative sample of the U.S. population.

       In the analyses, we control for information on family background, including family income

and the highest grade completed by a person's mother and father. Specifically, Mother’s Education

and Father’s Education equal the number of years of education of the mother and father

respectively; and Family Income in 1979 measures the income of the individual’s household in

1979, computed in 2010 dollars. (In the regressions we divide Family Income in 1979 by 100,000.)

As shown in Table 2, the mean value is about $62,300 and the median value is about $56,400.

There are missing values for Family Income in 1979. Consequently, when we use Family Income in

1979 as a regressor, we impute the sample mean and include a dummy variable that equals one for

observations in which Family Income in 1979 is missing. When we use Family Income in 1979 to



                                                19	  
                                                 	  
	  
divide the sample, we do not impute a value for missing observations and instead use a smaller

sample of individuals. Therefore the number of observations is not identical in these different

specifications.

       The major dependent variable is the binary indicator Attended College, which equals one if

the individual attended college and zero otherwise. This variable equals one for individuals that

attended college but did not graduate, those that graduated from college, and those that went on

graduate school. As shown in Table 2, about half of the individuals attended college. We focus on

whether the person attended college since it focuses on the decisions whether to go to college or

work, which is the central decision in the theoretical framework. The results, however, are robust to

focusing on whether the individual graduated from college or not.

       Key explanatory variables are as follows:

       AFQT Percentile is the individual’s AFQT (Armed Forces Qualification Test) score as a

percentile of the entire NLSY79 sample, where the AFQT Percentile is measured in 1980 and where

50 is the median of the NLSY79 sample and is 51 for our main regression sample due to missing

values on parental education. The AFQT is a weighted sum of four tests of the ten-part Armed

Services Vocational Aptitude Battery. We use the AFQT Percentile as a proxy of an individual’s

“ability to benefit from additional education.” To guarantee that AFQT test scores were not

influenced by school attendance, AFQT score is standardized by age of the individual at the time of

the test (Cameron and Heckman, 1993; Neal and Johnson, 1996; and Altonji and Pierret, 2001). We

exclude observations with missing AFQT scores, parental education, state of residency, and

education attainment.

       External Locus of Control Score (computed in 1980) measures the degree to which

individuals believe that external factors, such as chance, fate, and luck control their lives relative to



                                                   20	  
                                                    	  
	  
the degree that the individual has internal control over his or her life, where values range from four

to sixteen—higher values signify more external control. The average value is 8.5

        Self-Esteem Score (computed in 1980) measures the degree of approval or disapproval of

one’s self, where values range from six to 30— higher values signify greater self-approval. As

shown in Table 2, the mean value of Self-Esteem Score is about 22.6, with a standard deviation of 4.

        In some specifications, we use the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (hereafter,

CPS). We use the March Annual Demographic Survey files for the sample years 1976 to 2007,

taken from IPUMS. We use this much larger sample of individuals to compute the Mincerian

returns to education as discussed below.



5. Results

        5.1. Bank deregulation and interest rates

        We begin by assessing the impact of bank deregulation on interest rates using the following

specification:
                                                          !
                                           rjt = αDjt + !"!" + δj + δt + ejt.

In the equation, rjt is a measure of real interest rates in state j in year t, δj and δt are vectors of state

and year fixed-effects, and ejt is the error term. The variables of interest, Djt, and !!"! , equal the

number of years since state j deregulated (and zero before state j deregulated) and the number of

years since deregulation squared. In total, we have data for 48 states plus the District of Columbia.

Consistent with the literature on bank branch deregulation, we eliminate Delaware and South

Dakota because the structure of their banking systems were heavily affected by laws that made them

centers for the credit card industry.




                                                      21	  
                                                       	  
	  
       Table 2 shows that intrastate bank deregulation was associated with a substantial reduction

in interest rates when controlling for year and state effects. The significant, negative relationship

between interest rates and bank deregulation only emerges when controlling for both year and state

effects. This is consistent with the view that capital markets were segmented across the states of the

United States and that one needs to abstract of national fluctuations in credit conditions to identify

the independent impact of state-level deregulations on state interest rates.



       5.2. Bank Deregulation and College: Reduced Form Results

       We next assess the reduced form relationship between the removal of geographic restrictions

on banks and college enrollment, where we differentiate individuals by AFQT scores and by

parental education or family income. Since family income in one year might be a poor proxy for

permanent income and since education is highly correlated with income, parental education might

provide a more accurate signal of the family’s long-run financial situation.

       Based on the theoretical framework above, consider the linear-in-the-parameters probability

model for whether a person attends college (sij):
                                                               !
                             sij = !! !"#$! + !!! !!,!" + !!! !!,!" + βXXij + εij,

where the subscript i indicates a person and j designates a state. We include one observation per

person. We use AFQT to proxy for an individual’s “ability to learn.” In many specifications, we

split the sample by AFQT score to assess whether the impact of bank deregulation on educational

choices differs by a student’s “ability to learn.” Dj,79 is the number of years since deregulation for

state j in 1979. We choose 1979 because it is the first year of the NLSY79 and it corresponds to a

period in the lives of respondents when interest rates and credit conditions are likely to influence

educational choices. Survey respondents are between the ages of 15 and 22 in 1979. By using a


                                                    22	  
                                                     	  
	  
quadratic for years since deregulation, we allow for changes in credit conditions to have nonlinear

effects on educational choices.	  	  

         As additional regressors, Xij, we include the following. External Locus of Control Score

(computed in 1980) measures the degree to which individuals believe that external factors, such as

chance, fate, and luck control their lives relative to the degree that the individual has internal control

over his or her life. Self-Esteem Score (computed in 1980) measures the degree of approval or

disapproval of one’s self. Mother’s and Father’s Education measure the number of years of

education of the mother and father respectively. Family Income in 1979 measures the income of the

individual’s family in 1979, computed in 2010 dollars and divided by $100,000 (as a regressor). In

several specifications, we split the sample based on parental education or family income to assess

whether the impact of deregulation on college enrollment differs by these family characteristics.

Furthermore, in all specifications, we control for regional, racial, gender and year of birth effects,

and include a dummy variable that equals one if we imputed Family Income in 1979.

         Tables 4 and 5 provide the regression results, where Table 4 provides the OLS estimates and

Table 5 gives the Probit results. In both tables, column (1) provides the results for the full sample,

columns (2) and (3) provides results splitting the sample between those with AFQT Percentile

above and below 33, respectively. The NLSY79 sample mean value of AFQT Percentile is 50. In

columns (4) and (5), we only consider individuals with AFQT scores above 33 and further split the

sample by the education of the parents: column (4) includes individuals where either parent has 12

years or less of education and column (5) includes individuals where both parents have more than

12 years of education. Since the dependent variable is binary, we focus on the results using Probit

regressions. The OLS regressions yield very similar inferences. For the Probit analyses, the reported

coefficients are the estimated marginal effects, evaluated at the mean values of the regressors. The

standard errors are clustered at the state level and corrected for heteroskedasticity using the Huber-

White adjustment.

       Bank regulation boosted the probability that individuals with particular abilities and family

traits attend college. In particular, bank deregulation has no effect on relatively low ability people,

i.e., people with AFQT scores lower than 33 (Table 5, column 3). But, deregulation does have a

positive impact on “able” students—students with AFQT scores greater than 33 (Table 5, column

2). For instance, one year after deregulation, the probability of attending college rose by about 3.5

percent; five years after deregulation, the probability is 13 percent greater than before deregulation;

10 years after deregulation, the probability is 15 percent greater; and 15 years after, the probability

is 8 percent greater than it was before the state deregulated restrictions on intrastate branching.

       Furthermore, Table 5 shows that it is the able students from families in which both parents

do not have more than 12 years of education that experience the biggest boost in the probability of

going to college from bank deregulation. In particular, bank deregulation has no effect on attending

college for individuals with AFQT scores above 33 but who are from families in which both parents

have more than 12 years of education. But, bank deregulation has a very large effect on attending

college for able students from less well-educated parents. The estimated effects are large. For

instance, one year after deregulation, the probability of attending college rises by about 4.1 percent;

five years after deregulation, the probability is 16 percent greater than before deregulation; 10 years

after deregulation, the probability is 21 percent greater; and 15 years after, the probability is 17

percent greater than it was before the state deregulated restrictions on intrastate branching.

       Besides the main results on bank deregulation, the analyses also show that AFQT and

parental education are positively associated with higher college enrollment even when splitting the

sample by AFQT and parental income. Self-esteem is also a good predictor of whether an individual



                                                   24	  
                                                    	  
	  
attends college, even after conditioning on the array of individual, family, regional, and national

factors included in the regressions.

       Overall, the results from Tables 4 and 5 are consistent with the theoretical model presented

above. To the extent that people with AFQT scores in the bottom third of the distribution are

unlikely to benefit from college, it is unsurprising that an improvement in credit conditions does not

influence their probability of attending college. Similarly, to the extent that able students from well-

educated parents have a high probability of attending college, we would not expect bank

deregulation to influence their likelihood of attending college either. Rather, theory and the

evidence in Tables 4 and 5 indicate that changes in credit conditions influence a particular, though

significant segment of society: able students from more disadvantaged family backgrounds.

Table 6 continues these analyses by splitting the sample by different levels of Family Income in

1979, rather than by the education of the parents. In these analyses, we only consider “able”

students, i.e., students with AFQT scores above 33. We present five Probit regressions of different

samples, where we consider families with family income of (1) less than the 25th percentile of

family income in our sample, (2) more than the 25th percentile, (3) more than the median, (4) more

than the 75th percentile, and (5) more than the 90th percentile of family income in our full sample.

We simply present the probit regression. The OLS regressions yield similar results.

       We find that easing credit conditions—as proxied by intrastate bank deregulation—boosted

college enrollments for able students from middle class and upper-middle class families. As shown

in Table 6, changing credit conditions had no impact on college enrollment for students with AFQT

above 33 but who come from lower-income families (families with incomes below the 25th

percentile). And, changing credit conditions had no impact on college enrollment for able students

from high-income families (families with incomes above the 90th percentile). When we consider



                                                   25	  
                                                    	  
	  
people from the middle and upper-middle of the income distribution, bank deregulation exerted a

positive effect on college enrollment rates. For families with incomes above the median, the results

from equation (3) indicate that five years after bank deregulation, an able person’s probability of

attending college are on average 20 percent greater; ten years after deregulation, they are one-

quarter greater; even 15 years after deregulation, the probability of an able person attending college

are 15 percent greater than they were before deregulation.



       5.3. 2SLS

       We now employ a two-stage least squares (2SLS) Probit estimator to examine the impact of

interest rates on the probability of attending college. That is, we estimate the following Probit

equation of whether a person attends college or not (sij):

                            Pr(sij =1|!"#$! , !! ,  Xij ) = Φ(!! !"#$! + !! !! + βXXij)

where Φ( ) is the cumulative distribution function of the unit-normal distribution, rj is the real

interest rate in 1979 in state j and the other variables (X) are as defined earlier. The excluded

                                               !
instrumental variables for rj are !!,!"   and !!,!" . Recall from Table 3 that bank deregulation helps

account for cross-state, cross-time variation in interest rates. The first stage here is different from

Table 3 because there is no time variation; there is one observation per person. However, the

coefficients estimates from the first stage correspond with those presented in Table 3. In presenting

the 2SLS Probit estimates, Table 7 uses a similar structure to that of Table 6, i.e., we split the

sample by an individual’s AFQT scores and family income.

       For able students from middle and upper-middle class families, we find that a reduction in

interest rates from bank deregulation during an individual’s formative years is associated with an

increase in the probability of attending college. For the full sample of individuals, there is not a


                                                    26	  
                                                     	  
	  
significant relationship between attending college and interest rates (Table 7’s column 1). And,

there is not a significant relationship between interest rates and attending college when we only

examine able students from lower-income families (families with incomes below the 25th

percentile), or when we only examine able students from high-income families (families with

incomes above the 90th percentile). Only when we consider able students from middle-class or

upper-middle class families, i.e., when we restrict the sample to able students from families with

incomes above the median or above the 75th percentile, do we find that changes in interest rates

triggered by bank deregulation are negatively and significantly associated with college attendance.

       The economic magnitude of the relationship between interest rates and college attendance is

large for the sub-sample of students with AFQT scores above 33 who are from middle and upper-

middle class families. The coefficient estimate for the sample of able students from families with

incomes above the median indicates that a reduction in real interest rates of one percentage point is

associated with an increase in the probability of attending college of almost 40 percent. For a not

inconsequential segment of society, credit conditions are importantly linked with college

attendance.

       As noted earlier, we must interpret these 2SLS estimates cautiously because the instruments

are unlikely to satisfy the exclusion restriction. Although there is no evidence that educational

choices influence the timing of intrastate branch deregulation, there is evidence that intrastate

branch deregulation influenced many features of the economy. Branch deregulation accelerated

economic activity (Jayaratne and Strahan, 1996), reduced income inequality by disproportionately

helping the poor (Beck, Levine, and Levkov, 2010), and reduced discrimination against black

workers (Levine, Levkov, and Rubinstein, 2013). Thus, bank deregulation might influence college

enrollment rates through a variety of channels beyond its effect on interest rates. It could very well



                                                  27	  
                                                   	  
	  
be that deregulation boosted the demand for skilled workers and it is this “demand side” effect that

drives the increase in college enrollment, not the “cost side” effect associated with the drop in

interest rates.

        Although the exclusionary restriction might not hold, two observations suggest that bank

deregulation is pushing up college enrollment rates by reducing the cost of college, not just by

increasing the demand for skilled workers. First, Beck, Levine, and Levkov (2010) show that bank

deregulation increased the demand for unskilled workers, not skilled workers. Thus, bank

deregulation does not seem to have increased the demand for skilled workers, which is the starting

point of the “demand side” story.

        Second, we now assess whether bank deregulation increased or decreased the returns to

education. According to the demand side story, bank deregulation should increase the demand for

skilled labor and hence the returns to education. In contrast, the supply side view suggests that bank

deregulation lowered the costs of a college education, boosted the supply of college workers, and

thereby lowered the returns to education. We assess which prediction holds in the data.

        In Table 8, we regress the Mincerian returns to education on bank deregulation over the

period from 1976 through 2002 using the following specification:



                                                       !
                                       MRjt = αDjt + !"!" + δj + δt + ejt.

The dependent variable, MRjt, equals the Mincerian Returns to education in state j during year t and

is computed by regressing – by state and year - log wages on years of education and a quartic in

potential work experience and collecting the estimated coefficient on years of education. To

compute MRjt, we use the CPS March Supplements and make the computations over the years 1976

through 2002, for the sample of full-time, full-year, white males between the ages of 25 and 55, and


                                                   28	  
                                                    	  
	  
excluding people living in group quarters and working in either the military or agriculture. We use

the CPS, rather than the NLSY79, because the CPS samples a much larger cross-section of

individuals and we do not need the longitudinal nature of the NLSY79 to compute the returns to

education at the state-year level.

       As shown in Table 8, bank deregulation reduced the returns to education, after controlling

for state and year effects. This is consistent with the “cost” side channel playing an important role,

whereby bank deregulation lowered the costs of education, shifted out the supply curve of skilled

workers, and reduced the returns to education. These findings are inconsistent with a purely

“demand” side story, in which bank deregulation only boosted the demand for skilled labor, shifted

out the demand curve, and increased the returns to education.

       The results presented in Tables 7 and 8 suggest that by lowering the costs of a college

education, bank deregulation boosted college enrollment rates among able students from middle and

upper-middle class families. While these results do not indicate that bank deregulation only

increased college enrollment by lowering costs, the results do suggest that bank deregulation

increased college enrollments by lowering costs. Although we focus on the impact of deregulation

on interest rates, it is possible that deregulation boosted college enrollment rates by increasing

family incomes and thereby reducing the utility costs of funding a child’s college education. While

the income channel is feasible, Beck, Levine, and Levkov (2010) show that deregulation boosted

the incomes of families in the lower third of the income distribution and we find that the major

impact of deregulation on college enrollment rates occurs in families between the median and 90th

percentiles of the income distribution. Thus, while we cannot nail down the interest rate channel per

se the evidence indicates that improvements in credit conditions triggered by bank deregulation

increased college enrollment rates.

6. Conclusions
       In this paper, we find that intrastate branch deregulation—that lowered interest rates—

boosted college enrollments among able students from families in which middle and upper-middle

class families. Our findings suggest that credit conditions, the ability of an individual to benefit

from college, and a family’s financial circumstances combine to shape decisions about attending

college. Banking reforms that ease credit conditions boost college enrollment rates among

significant proportion of the population.

       The analyses suggest that the functioning of the financial system exerts a powerful influence

on shaping economic opportunities, as emphasized by Levine (2005). While many factors shape the

economic opportunities available to a child, affording a good education is one of them. The results

presented in this paper indicate that improvements in the functioning of the financial system help

make education affordable to more students.

Notes: Attended College equals one if the individual attended college for any period of time and zero
otherwise. Years Since Deregulation equals the number of years since the state deregulated restrictions on
intrastate branch banking and is computed for the year 1979; AFQT Percentile is the individual’s AFQT
(Armed Forces Qualification Test) score as a percentile of the entire NLSY79 sample, which is measured in
1980, and where 50 is the median of the NLSY79 representative sample; External Locus of Control Score
(computed in 1980) measures the degree to which individuals believe that external factors, such as chance,
fate, and luck control their lives relative to the degree that the individual has internal control over his or her
life, where values range from four to sixteen—higher values signify more external control; Self-Esteem Score
(computed in 1980) measures the degree of approval or disapproval of one’s self, where values range from six
to 30— higher values signify greater self-approval. Mother’s and Father’s Education measure the number of
years of education of the mother and father respectively; and Family Income in 1979 measures the income of
the individual’s household in 1979, computed in 2010 dollars. In the regression tables, we divide Family
Income in 1979 by $100,000. Interest Rate is the annual real interest rate based on mortgage rates from a
monthly survey of major lenders that are asked to report the terms and conditions on all conventional, single-
family, fully amortized, purchase-money loans closed in the last five working days of the month. The data
excludes FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgages, refinancing loans, and balloon loans. The rate includes
the amortization of initial fees, points, and charges over a 10-year period, which is the historical assumption of
the average life of a mortgage loan and is computed by the Federal Housing Finance Board. We deflate by the
national CPI. For variables from the NLSY79, the reported summary statistics use the NLSY79 sample
weights.

Notes: This table presents the results of four regressions, where the dependent variable equals the Interest Rate, which is
computed at the state-year level. Interest Rate is the effective interest from on mortgages, which includes amortization of initial
fees, points, and charges over a 10-year period and is computed by the Federal Housing Finance Board. Consistent with previous
research the sample includes data on the District of Columbia and all states except Delaware and South Dakota, which are
dropped due to large concentrations of credit card banks. The sample covers the period from 1976 through 2002. Regressors:
Years Since Deregulation equals the number of years since the state deregulated restrictions on intrastate branch banking. This
varies at the state-year level. Standard errors are clustered at the state level and corrected using the Huber-White adjustment. The
symbols ***, **, and * signify significance at the one, five, and ten percent levels respectively.

Notes: This table presents the results of five OLS regressions, where the dependent variable equals one if the individual attended college and zero
otherwise. There is one observation per person. Regressors: Years Since Deregulation in 1979 equals the number of years since the state deregulated
restrictions on intrastate branch banking and is computed for the year 1979; AFQT Percentile is the individual’s AFQT (Armed Forces Qualification
Test) score as a percentile of the entire NLSY79 sample, which is measured in 1980, and where 50 is the median of the NLSY79 representative
sample; External Locus of Control Score (computed in 1980) measures the degree to which individuals believe that external factors, such as chance,
fate, and luck control their lives relative to the degree that the individual has internal control over his or her life, where values range from four to
sixteen—higher values signify more external control; Self-Esteem Score (computed in 1980) measures the degree of approval or disapproval of one’s
self, where values range from six to 30— higher values signify greater self-approval. Mother’s and Father’s Education measure the number of years of
education of the mother and father respectively; and Family Income in 1979 measures the income of the individual’s household in 1979, computed in
2010 dollars and divided by $100,000. The regression includes regional, racial, and gender fixed effects, the individual’s year of birth, and a dummy
variable that equals one if we imputed Family Income in 1979 with the sample mean, due to missing values. Sample: Besides the core NLSY sample,
we also include the supplementary dataset on Blacks and Hispanics. Standard errors are clustered at the state level and corrected using the Huber-

Notes: This table presents the results of five probit regressions, where the dependent variable equals one if the individual attended college and zero
otherwise, and where the reported coefficients are the estimated marginal effects, evaluated at the mean values of the independent variables. There is
one observation per person. Regressors: Years Since Deregulation in 1979 equals the number of years since the state deregulated restrictions on
intrastate branch banking and is computed for the year 1979; AFQT Percentile is the individual’s AFQT (Armed Forces Qualification Test) score as a
percentile of the entire NLSY79 sample, which is measured in 1980, and where 50 is the median of the NLSY79 representative sample; External
Locus of Control Score (computed in 1980) measures the degree to which individuals believe that external factors, such as chance, fate, and luck
control their lives relative to the degree that the individual has internal control over his or her life, where values range from four to sixteen—higher
values signify more external control; Self-Esteem Score (computed in 1980) measures the degree of approval or disapproval of one’s self, where
values range from six to 30— higher values signify greater self-approval. Mother’s and Father’s Education measure the number of years of
education of the mother and father respectively; and Family Income in 1979 measures the income of the individual’s household in 1979, computed in
2010 dollars and divided by $100,000. The regression includes regional, racial, and gender fixed effects, the individual’s year of birth, and a dummy
variable that equals one if we imputed Family Income in 1979 with the sample mean, due to missing values. Sample: Besides the NLSY sample, we
also include the supplementary dataset on blacks and Hispanics. Standard errors are clustered at the state level and corrected using the Huber-White
adjustment. The symbols ***, **, and * signify significance at the one, five, and ten percent levels respectively.

There is one observation per person. When designating the sample, Family Income >X% signifies the sample is restricted to individuals for
which their Family Income levels in 1979 were above the X percentile of the sample. Regressors: Years Since Deregulation in 1979 equals the
number of years since the stat deregulated restrictions on intrastate branch banking and is computed for the year 1979; AFQT Percentile is the
individual’s AFQT (Armed Forces Qualification Test) score as a percentile of the entire NLSY79 sample, which is measured in 1980, and where
50 is the median of the NLSY79 representative sample; External Locus of Control Score (computed in 1980) measures the degree to which
individuals believe that external factors, such as chance, fate, and luck control their lives relative to the degree that the individual has internal
control over his or her life, where values range from four to sixteen—higher values signify more external control; Self-Esteem Score (computed
in 1980) measures the degree of approval or disapproval of one’s self, where values range from six to 30— higher values signify greater self-
approval. Mother’s and Father’s Education measure the number of years of education of the mother and father respectively; and Family Income
in 1979 measures the income of the individual’s household in 1979, computed in 2010 dollars and divided by $100,000. The regression includes
regional, racial, and gender fixed effects, the individual’s year of birth, and a dummy variable that equals one if we imputed Family Income in
1979 with the sample mean, due to missing values. Sample: Besides the core NLSY sample, we also include the supplementary dataset on blacks
and Hispanics. Standard errors are clustered at the state level and corrected using the Huber-White adjustment. The symbols ***, **, and *
signify significance at the one, five, and ten percent levels respectively.

Notes: This table presents the results of six probit regressions, where the dependent variable equals one if the individual attended college and zero otherwise, and where the reported coefficients are the
estimated marginal effects, evaluated at the mean values of the independent variables. There is one observation per person. When designating the sample, Family Income >X% signifies the sample is
restricted to individuals for which their Family Income levels in 1979 were above the X percentile of the sample. Regressors: Years Since Deregulation in 1979 equals the number of years since the state,
in which the individual was living in 1979, deregulated restrictions on intrastate branch banking and is computed for the year 1979; AFQT Percentile is the individual’s AFQT (Armed Forces Qualification
Test) score as a percentile of the entire NLSY79 sample, which is measured in 1980, and where 50 is the median of the NLSY79 representative sample; External Locus of Control Score (computed in
1980) measures the degree to which individuals believe that external factors, such as chance, fate, and luck control their lives relative to the degree that the individual has internal control over his or her
life, where values range from four to sixteen—higher values signify more external control; Self-Esteem Score (computed in 1980) measures the degree of approval or disapproval of one’s self, where
values range from six to 30— higher values signify greater self-approval. Mother’s and Father’s Education measure the number of years of education of the mother and father respectively; and Family
Income in 1979 measures the income of the individual’s household in 1979, computed in 2010 dollars and divided by $100,000. The regression includes regional, racial, and gender fixed effects, the
individual’s year of birth, and a dummy variable that equals one if we imputed Family Income in 1979 with the sample mean, due to missing values. Sample: Besides the core NLSY sample, we also
include the supplementary dataset on blacks and Hispanics. Standard errors are clustered at the state level and corrected using the Huber-White adjustment. The symbols ***, **, and * signify significance
at the one, five, and ten percent levels respectively.

Notes: This table presents the results of four regressions, where the dependent variable is Returns to Education. For each
state-year, Returns to Education is computed by regressing log wages on years of education and a quartic in potential
work experience and collecting the estimated coefficient on years of education, using data from CPS March Supplement,
over the years 1976 through 2002, for the sample of full-time, full-year, white males between the ages of 25 and 55, and
excluding people living in group quarters and working in either the military or agriculture. Consistent with previous
research the sample includes data on the District of Columbia and all states except Delaware and South Dakota, which are
dropped due to large concentrations of credit card banks. Regressors: Years Since Deregulation equals the number of
years since the state deregulated restrictions on intrastate branch banking and is computed at the state-year level. Standard
errors are clustered at the state level and corrected using the Huber-White adjustment. The symbols ***, **, and * signify
significance at the one, five, and ten percent levels respectively.
