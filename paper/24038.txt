Service-level Selection: Strategic Risk Selection in Medicare Advantage in Response to Risk
Adjustment

                                          ABSTRACT

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has phased in the Hierarchical Condition
Categories (HCC) risk adjustment model during 2004-2006 to more accurately estimate capitated
payments to Medicare Advantage (MA) plans to reflect each beneficiary’s health status.
However, it is debatable whether the CMS-HCC model has led to strategic evolutions of risk
selection. We examine the competing claims and analyze the risk selection behavior of MA plans
in response to the CMS-HCC model. We find that the CMS-HCC model reduced the
phenomenon that MA plans avoid high-cost beneficiaries in traditional Medicare plans, whereas
it led to increased disenrollment of high-cost beneficiaries, conditional on illness severity, from
MA plans. We explain this phenomenon in relation to service-level selection. First, we show that
MA plans have incentives to effectuate risk selection via service-level selection, by lowering
coverage levels for services that are more likely to be used by beneficiaries who could be
unprofitable under the CMS-HCC model. Then, we empirically test our theoretical prediction that
compared to the pre-implementation period (2001-2003), MA plans have raised copayments
disproportionately more for services needed by unprofitable beneficiaries than for other services
in the post-implementation period (2007-2009). This induced unprofitable beneficiaries to
voluntarily dis-enroll from their MA plans. Further evidence supporting this selection mechanism
is that those dissatisfied with out-of-pocket costs were more likely to dis-enroll from MA plans.
We estimate that such strategic behavior led MA plans to save $5.2 billion by transferring the
costs to the federal government.

1. Introduction
       Recent health care reforms have facilitated the transition from volume- to value-based
payment models in hopes of achieving cost control and enhancing the quality of care. One such
example is that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reimburses Medicare
Advantage (MA) plans with a capitated amount per beneficiary to encourage coordinated care in
managed care settings. It has been shown that MA plans save money without sacrificing quality.
However, as an unintended consequence, MA plans have selectively enrolled healthier people to
receive overpayments, known as favorable selection. It remains inconclusive whether cost
savings are attributable to cost-effective care management or to risk selection. To reduce risk
selection, CMS has adjusted payments to MA plans to reflect the health status of their enrollees,
a process known as risk adjustment (Pope et al. 2000). To more accurately estimate capitated
payments, in 2004, CMS introduced a new risk adjustment model—the CMS-Hierarchical
Condition Categories (HCC) model—which uses extensive inpatient and outpatient diagnostic
information from the prior year to generate risk scores (Pope et al. 2004).
       It is debatable whether the CMS-HCC model has been effective in reducing risk selection
(Newhouse et al. 2015) or whether it has led to strategic evolutions of risk selection (Brown et al.
2014). On one hand, it has been shown that the CMS-HCC model considerably reduced the
phenomenon of avoiding sicker beneficiaries (i.e., those with high-risk scores) in traditional
Medicare (TM) plans (McWilliams, Hsu, and Newhouse 2012, Newhouse et al. 2015, Morrisey
et al. 2013, Newhouse et al. 2012). As risk adjustment leads to neutral payments for beneficiaries
with conditions included in the risk adjustment formula, MA plans no longer have incentive to
avoid those with high-risk scores if their conditions are included in the CMS-HCC model.
       On the other hand, there is suggestive evidence showing that MA plans could
strategically respond to the CMS-HCC model. Brown et al. (2014) argue that the HCC model
merely shifted the profitable population from healthy people (i.e., those with low-risk scores) to
sick ones who are over-compensated, within their risk-score. This can be achieved because, first,
there is considerable variability in actual expenditures of beneficiaries around their risk-adjusted
payments. For all beneficiaries with a given health condition, the CMS-HCC model is designed
to adjust payments to MA plans by the same rate. However, the severity of the condition and
thus the cost of treating it can vary within a given condition (Medicare Payment Advisory




                                                                                                  1
Commission 2012). 1 Second, the variability of the within-risk-score expenditures is larger for
those with higher risk scores. 2 Because the CMS-HCC model only accounts for about 100 major
conditions, this generates underpayments for those whose conditions are not accurately measured
by the model, who tend to have multiple chronic conditions (Frogner et al. 2011). 3
           We examine these competing claims and analyze the risk selection behavior of MA plans
in response to the CMS-HCC model. Specifically, we hypothesize that MA plans engage in
service-level selection, in which they provide relatively lower coverage levels for some services
to discourage enrollment of certain beneficiaries. While the CMS-HCC model encouraged MA
plans to accept TM beneficiaries with high-risk scores, we claim that MA plans strategically
behave to avoid beneficiaries who could be unprofitable under the CMS-HCC model (i.e., those
with higher expenditures than their risk-adjusted payments). Although there is a large literature
on investigating service-level selection as a risk selection strategy (McGuire et al. 2014, Ellis and
McGuire 2007, Ellis, Jiang, and Kuo 2013, Cao and McGuire 2003, Eggleston and Bir 2009,
Newhouse et al. 2013, Frank, Glazer, and McGuire 2000), to the best of our knowledge, there is
no research explaining mechanisms through which MA plans could engage in service-level
selection as a strategic risk selection behavior in response to risk adjustment.
           We find that the CMS-HCC model achieved the goal of reducing favorable selection
based on health; however, we also find that it led to increased disenrollment of unprofitable
beneficiaries from MA plans, leading MA plans to save costs of $5.2 billion in 2007-2009. We
explain this phenomenon via service-level selection. Building upon Ellis and McGuire (2007),
we theoretically show that MA plans have incentives to effectuate risk selection through service-
level selection, as unprofitable beneficiaries are more likely to use services that are expensive
and are thus more vulnerable to under provision by MA plans. Specifically, we show that those
with higher expenditures than their risk-adjusted payments are more likely to use services that
health plans would ration more tightly (i.e., services with higher service-level selection index).
This phenomenon is more likely to be pronounced for those with higher risk scores. Then, we
1
  For example, the coefficient for breast, prostate, colorectal and other cancers (HCC10) was estimated to be 0.187 by the CMC-HCC model
(Pope et al. 2004). This means that CMS pays 1.187 times higher rates for Medicare beneficiaries with breast, prostate, colorectal and other
cancers than those without the condition. Depending on cancer stage, however, their actual expenditures would vary. Specifically, those with
stage 4 cancer are more likely to incur higher expenditures than the rate set by CMS, whereas those with stage 1 cancer are more likely to incur
lower expenditures than the rate set by CMS.
2
  The variability of total health care expenditures for Medicare beneficiaries with high-risk scores is larger than that for Medicare beneficiaries
with low-risk scores because the mean total health care expenditures for the former is higher than the latter.
3
  Frogner et al. (2011) showed that the estimate for breast, prostate, colorectal, and other cancers (HCC 10) was only $1,835 despite its
seriousness of the illness. Moreover, it was found that the interaction between chronic kidney failure and congestive heart failure had a
statistically significant negative estimate, thereby reducing reimbursements for beneficiaries with these two diseases by $614. However, this is
unlikely because having multiple chronic diseases requires more complex care.




                                                                                                                                                 2
find evidence supporting our theoretical prediction that MA plans have actually raised
copayments disproportionately more for services with higher service-level selection index (i.e.,
ambulance, home health service, partial hospitalization, and inpatient hospital service) than
services with lower service-level selection index (i.e., outpatient substance abuse services,
outpatient X-rays, and outpatient hospital services). Such disproportionate increases in
copayment induced unprofitable beneficiaries to voluntarily disenroll from MA plans. In
additional analyses, we find evidence supporting this selection mechanism that those with
dissatisfaction with out-of-pocket costs were more likely to disenroll from MA plans.
Consequently, the variation of total Medicare expenditures for MA enrollees with high-risk
scores reduced over time. These findings indicate that service-level selection allowed MA plans
to avoid the risk of enrolling unprofitable beneficiaries.


2. The Medicare Advantage Program
           Medicare beneficiaries can choose to either enroll in a TM plan or an MA plan. Under the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997, private plans have contracted with CMS to provide the elderly
Medicare Parts A and B benefits. 4 When individuals become eligible for Medicare, they are
assigned to TM by default. Then, they can choose to stay in TM or switch to a MA plan,
depending on their preferences and needs. Because MA plans offer more generous benefits and
lower cost-sharing than TM plans, beneficiaries may prefer enrolling in the MA plan. In contrast,
as MA plans have limited providers’ networks (Jacobson et al. 2016), those with complex
diseases may prefer TM’s freedom of provider choice. To encourage beneficiaries to choose the
plan that efficiently provides them care while accounting for their individual preferences, CMS
adopted the “payment neutrality” approach, which sets MA payments equal to the average
Medicare expenditures of TM beneficiaries in the MA enrollee’s county (Medicare Payment
Advisory Commission 2014).
           Over several decades, policy-makers have promoted managed care in Medicare as a way
to improve quality of care while containing costs. As this approach creates incentives to
encourage preventive care and better care coordination, it is especially helpful in caring for
Medicare beneficiaries, 68.4 percent of whom had two or more chronic conditions and 36.4

4
  There are two rationales for privatization of managed care. First, capitated payments to private plans would incentivize them to actively manage
their enrollees’ care, leading to more efficient care provision. Also, privatization could lead to competition among private plans as well as TM
plans, possibly lowering health care costs while improving quality of care.




                                                                                                                                                3
percent had four or more chronic conditions (Lochner and Cox 2013). In line with the
encouragement of managed care, the benchmark levels have been increased to encourage plans
to enter in the MA market (Medicare Payment Advisory Commission 2014). 5 Consequently,
CMS paid $170 billion to MA plans on behalf of 16 million beneficiaries, reaching a historic
high of MA’s penetration of almost 31 percent of the Medicare population (Kaiser Family
Foundation 2015).
           However, benefit designs by MA plans may affect whether beneficiaries choose TM or
MA plans’. TM plans under the fee-for-service (FFS) payment system are paid for each test and
procedure, and thus theoretically they have no incentive to selectively accept beneficiaries with
certain characteristics. In contrast, MA plans under the capitated payment system are paid a fixed
amount per beneficiary, which would create an incentive to selectively accept healthier people
and avoid sicker ones. To effectuate favorable selection, MA plans could vary benefit designs.
For example, MA plans could increase cost-sharing for certain services to avoid unprofitable
beneficiaries. This is plausible because while MA plans must provide the same services covered
by TM plans (i.e., Medicare Parts A and B benefits), and the actuarial value of the total benefits
package must at least be equivalent to TM’s benefits, cost-sharing for any particular service can
vary between MA plans and TM. Moreover, MA plans could restrict physician networks to
distract unprofitable beneficiaries (Jacobson et al. 2016) or offer additional services (e.g., dental
care and vision care services) to attract profitable beneficiaries.
           To mitigate favorable selection of MA plans, CMS has used a risk-adjusted payment
methodology to estimate capitated payments to MA plans. Payment rates to MA plans are
determined by enrollee’s risk scores, county-level benchmarks set by CMS, and plan bids. 6
However, the fundamental goal of risk adjustment is to adjust payments to accurately reflect the
health status of each enrollee. CMS adjusts payments to MA plans, using risk scores estimated
based on each beneficiary’s demographics and diagnoses in a prior year. However, its ultimate
goal is not accuracy per se, but rather improved incentives (Glazer and McGuire 2000, Van de


5
  Prior to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, MA plans were paid based on 95 percent of a county’s average Medicare expenditures of TM
beneficiaries. In the Balanced Budget Act, Congress increased benchmark levels to encourage plans to enter in the MA market. Consequently, as
of 2015, MA plans are paid by 102 percent of TM costs.
6
  Since 2006, CMS has implemented a competitive bidding system to determine payments to MA plans. The payment is based on bids submitted
by MA plans, and then it is risk-adjusted by the CMS-HCC model. The plan bids for Parts A and B services are compared to the county-level
benchmark. If the plan bid is less than the benchmark, the plan receives its bid. In addition, CMS retains 25 percent of the difference between its
payment benchmark and bid. The remaining 75 percent of the difference must be returned to enrollees in the form of additional benefits or lower
premium. If the plan’ bid is higher than the benchmark, enrollees pay the difference in the form of a monthly premium in addition to the
Medicare Part B premium.




                                                                                                                                                 4
Ven and Ellis 2000). As such, risk adjustment intends to disincentivize health plans from
selectively enrolling and caring for healthy beneficiaries, and furthermore incentivize the plans
to compete based on providing high-value care. Up until 2000, the risk adjustment process only
accounted for age, gender, Medicaid eligibility, institutional status, and county of residence.
Starting in 2000, CMS began to use information on inpatient diagnoses to adjust payments to
MA plans through the Principal Inpatient Diagnostic Cost Group (PIP-DCG) model (Pope et al.
2000). 7 To more accurately estimate capitated payments, in 2004, CMS introduced a new risk
adjustment model—the CMS-HCC model—which uses extensive inpatient and outpatient
diagnostic information from the prior year to generate risk scores (Pope et al. 2004). 8


3. Previous Literature
           The literature on risk selection in the MA program has mainly focused on one aspect of
risk selection: whether TM beneficiaries with high-risk scores were less likely to enroll in MA
plans. Some studies found that such selection behavior was greatly reduced after the full phase-in
of the CMS-HCC model starting January 1, 2007. Using a 20 percent random sample of
Medicare claims in 2003-2008, Newhouse et al. (2012) found that differences in predicted
expenditure between TM-to-MA switchers (i.e., Medicare beneficiaries who enrolled in TM and
switched from TM to MA next year) and TM stayers (i.e., those who enrolled in TM and
remained in TM next year) declined between 2004 and 2008 by a factor of three. Also,
differences in adjusted mortality rates between these two groups narrowed between 1998 and
2008 by a factor of two. Using the 2001-2007 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS),
McWilliams, Hsu, and Newhouse (2012) observed that differences in health care use and self-
reported health between all TM and MA beneficiaries were narrowed from 2001-2003 to 2006-
2007. They also found that differences between TM-to-MA switchers and TM stayers were
narrowed. Using a five percent random sample of Medicare claims in 1999-2008, Morrisey et al.
(2013) showed that the implementation of the CMS-HCC model led to increase the number of



7
  The PIP-DCG model accounts for 24 age/sex cells, interactions of Medicaid status and age/sex cells, interactions of originally disabled status
and age/sex cells, working-aged status, and the 16 PIP-DCG diagnostic categories (Pope et al. 2000).
8
  The CMS-HCC model accounts for 24 age/sex cells, interactions of Medicaid status and sex and age/disabled entitlement status, interactions of
originally disabled status and sex, 70 HCC diagnostic categories, interactions of diagnostic categories with entitlement by disability, and six
disease interactions (Pope et al. 2004). For HCC diagnostic categories, tens of thousands of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9
codes are grouped into a small number of organized categories to generate a diagnostic profile of each person. Thus, each HCC diagnostic
category includes conditions that are clinically related to each other and have similar cost implications.




                                                                                                                                               5
new MA enrollees and decrease the number of MA disenrollees (i.e., those who enrolled in MA
and switched from MA to TM next year), resulting in increased MA enrollment.
       Another strand of the literature has examined on another aspect of risk selection: whether
MA enrollees with high-risk scores were more likely to disenroll from MA plans. There is
evidence showing that MA plans might change the targeted population for risk selection in
response to the CMS-HCC model. McWilliams, Hsu, and Newhouse (2012) found that compared
to MA stayers (i.e., those who enrolled in MA and remained in MA next year) or TM stayers,
MA-to-TM switchers (i.e., those who enrolled in MA and switched from MA to TM next year)
self-reported poorer health and used more health care after the full phase-in of the CMS-HCC
model. Morrisey et al. (2013) observed that after the full implementation, disenrollment from
MA plans was more pronounced among the high-expenditure beneficiaries. Using a five percent
sample of Medicare claims between 2006-2011, Jacobson, Neuman, and Damico (2015) found
that Medicaid-eligible beneficiaries and beneficiaries younger than 65 years with disabilities
were more likely to disenroll from MA plans. On the other hand, the low-expenditure
beneficiaries were more likely to stay in MA plans and relatively younger beneficiaries aged 65
to 69 years were more likely to switch from TM plans to MA plans.
       However, very little is known about the mechanism in which MA plans might engage in
risk selection beyond risk scores. To the best our knowledge, there is one paper that argued that
MA plans might strategically behave in response to the CMS-HCC model by risk-selecting based
on expenditures conditional on risk scores (Brown et al. 2014). Specifically, Brown et al. (2014)
found that the CMS-HCC model reduced the phenomenon of avoiding high-risk score
beneficiaries whose conditions are included in the CMS-HCC model because it increases
payments for them by accounting for additional information from outpatient claims. However,
the CMS-HCC model still generates underpayments for some of those with high-risk scores as
their complex health status cannot be accurately captured by the model (Frogner et al. 2011). As
such, Brown et al. (2014) found that in response to the CMS-HCC model, MA plans have
selectively enrolled beneficiaries with high-risk scores but low expenditures conditional on their
risk scores. This indicates that the CMS-HCC model cannot reflect the health status of
beneficiaries beyond health status captured through claims data (i.e., risk scores), creating an
incentive for MA plans to avoid those whose health status could be worse than estimated.




                                                                                                6
           Newhouse et al. (2015) re-examined the question of how MA plans have responded to the
CMS-HCC model and found that the combination of the CMS-HCC model and a lock-in policy9
largely reduced favorable selection after 2007, the year in which the CMS-HCC model was fully
phased in. Since the full implementation of the CMS-HCC model coincided with the introduction
of the lock-in policy, they acknowledged that it would be hard to distinguish the effect of the
CMS-HCC model from the effect of the lock-in policy on reducing risk selection. It is
worthwhile to note that Newhouse et al. (2015) intended to validate findings from a prior study
of Brown et al. (2014). Using the 1994-2006 MCBS, Brown et al. (2014) found evidence
showing that the CMS-HCC model did not reduce favorable selection due to MA plan’s strategic
response to the CMS-HCC model. 10 However, Newhouse et al. (2015) used a 20 percent random
sample of Medicare claims between 2001-2011 and found that the combination of the CMS-
HCC model and the lock-in policy reduced overpayments attributable to selection by roughly a
factor of five (from $1,984 in 2001-2002 to $320 in 2007-2011), thereby rebutting Brown et al.
(2014)’s claim. 11 However, it remains unanswered whether MA plans have changed risk
selection strategies in response to the CMS-HCC model to selectively disenroll those with high-
risk scores but high expenditures conditional on their risk scores. Determining this aspect is
critical to comprehensively understand the strategic risk selection behaviors of MA plans in
response to the CMS-HCC model.


4. Service-level Selection
           By law, MA plans are not allowed to deny coverage based on beneficiaries’ health status.
However, MA plans might practice risk selection in subtle ways so that unprofitable
9
  Beginning in 2006, CMS imposed a partial enrollment lock-in to prevent MA enrollees from switching from MA plans to TM plans monthly,
limiting temporarily switches to TM plans when more generous coverage or freedom of provider choice is desired.
10
   Brown et al. (2014) concluded that favorable selection was not decreased on net because the decrease in selection along dimensions included in
the formula of the CMS-HCC model was more than offset by the increase in selection conditional on the risk score. Specifically, they found that
there were smaller differences in risk scores between TM-to-MA switchers and TM stayers after its initial phase-in starting January 1, 2004. This
result is consistent with those of the studies showing the effect of the CMS-HCC model on reducing risk selection (McWilliams, Hsu, and
Newhouse 2012, Newhouse et al. 2012, Morrisey et al. 2013). However, they showed that compared to TM stayers, actual expenditures
conditional on the risk score of TM-to-MA switchers substantially fell after the initial phase-in period. This suggests that MA plans might
strategically behave to enroll those with expenditures lower than what is predicted by the CMS-HCC model.
11
   Such contradictory results are attributable to data and methodology differences. First, due to a relatively small sample in the MCBS, Brown et
al. (2014) had to pool the years from 1994 to 2002 and then compared selection in those years with selection during the pooled years from 2004
to 2006. This might be problematic because MA reimbursement policy changed markedly during the period. For example, the Balanced Budget
Act of 1997 established floors on reimbursement to MA plans for low-paying areas and restricted annual increases in reimbursement to MA plans
for high-paying areas to two percent. In contrast, Newhouse et al. (2015) used the sample for the pre-implementation period from 2001 to 2003
and compared selection during the pre-implementation period with selection during the post-implementation period. Moreover, using a large
sample size, the study estimated the degree of selection in each year, allowing them to control for various Medicare payment polices across years.
Also, Brown et al. (2014) included all MA enrollees from the MCBS. However, starting in 2004, CMS allowed MA plans to create plans for
enrollees with special needs (e.g., institutionalized or Medicaid-eligible enrollees), many of whom are non-elderly. As comparing those groups
before and after 2004 is problematic, Newhouse et al. (2015) limited to MA enrollees who were elderly, who were not institutionalized, and who
were not eligible for Medicaid.




                                                                                                                                                7
beneficiaries voluntarily disenroll from MA plans. To achieve such risk selection, MA plans
could risk-select through collecting additional data or advertising. However, because such
selection mechanisms would lead to substantial screening costs, MA plans are likely to seek
screening approaches with lowest costs. One such approach that generates relatively low
screening costs is service-level selection because MA plans do not need to predict each
beneficiary’s expenditures but rather only need to predict services more likely used by
beneficiaries who could be unprofitable under the CMS-HCC model.
           Service-level selection is one type of risk selection, which is based on the phenomenon
that unprofitable individuals are more likely to use services that are expensive to health plans
subject to capitated payments and are thus more vulnerable to under-provision by health plans.
As with risk selection, service-level selection occurs due to asymmetric information between two
parties, in which health plans do not know individuals’ private information about health status
and preferences for health care. 12 The health plan only knows the probability of using the service
at the population level, while the individual knows her need, or probability of need, for each
health care service and chooses the best health plan that can satisfy her need (Frank, Glazer, and
McGuire 2000, Ellis and McGuire 2007). Since rational individuals respond to health plan design
when selecting plans, reducing coverage levels for services related to financial losses (i.e.,
services more likely used by unprofitable individuals) would induce unprofitable individuals to
voluntarily disenroll from the plan. In this way, service-level selection would allow health plans
to reduce the scope of enrolling those who could be costly to them. Although unprofitable
individuals enroll in the plan, service-level selection would also enable health plans to reduce
their financial loss as they shift the costs to the individual.
           This paper builds on the existing theoretical and empirical work on service-level
selection. Frank, Glazer, and McGuire (2000) characterized plans’ rationing as a shadow price on
access to various types of care, and then showed how a health plan chooses the profit-
maximizing shadow price for each service. A shadow price is regarded as a device to capture
various rationing strategies by a plan, which determines access to care. For example, the shadow
price reflects plan decisions about capacity in various service areas as well as the makeup of

12
  Even with symmetric information, health plans can have incentives for risk selection if they are not allowed to use the private information to set
premiums or benefit features (Van de Ven and Ellis 2000). In the MA program, for example, CMS reimburses MA plans based on the costs
predicted by the CMS-HCC model that only partially accounts for clinically significant medical conditions with significant costs. Because the
model does not incorporate all diagnoses, payments to MA plans are too low for sicker beneficiaries and too high for healthier beneficiaries.
Consequently, the imperfect risk-adjustment model can create incentives for MA plans to engage in inefficient sorting of individuals across health
plans and distortion of plan benefits through service-level selection.




                                                                                                                                                  8
networks or payment to providers. Building upon Frank, Glazer, and McGuire (2000), Ellis and
McGuire (2007) derived a service-level selection index measuring the plan’s incentives to ration.
Using Medicare claims data for 1996-1997, they measured the relative magnitude of potential
selection across various types of services. For instance, hospice, home health care, durable
medical equipment, provider specialties of pulmonary care, oncology ambulance, and psychiatry
were shown to have potential for under-coverage by managed care plans. On the other hand, eye
procedures, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and provider specialties such as chiropractic
and gynecology were found to be candidates for over-coverage. Similar patterns of health plans
incentives for service-level selection were found in other studies, for example, Cao and McGuire
(2003) in Medicare, Eggleston and Bir (2009) in the state employee insurance program, and
Ellis, Jiang, and Kuo (2013) in commercial health plans.
          There is suggestive evidence showing that service-level selection occurs in the MA
program. Newhouse et al. (2013) estimated margins (i.e., the ratio of average revenue to average
cost) across 48 HCCs and unique combinations of HCCs from data on the cost of care from two
MA-health maintenance organization (HMO) plans. Despite no evidence of selection across
HCCs, they showed that margins in the two plans varied greatly across HCCs. Two additional
studies examine switching behavior for those with need for costly services such as nursing home
and home health care. 13 Rahman et al. (2015) found that a high proportion of MA enrollees with
need for nursing home or home health care disenrolled from MA plans the next year. Similarly,
Goldberg et al. (2016) showed that the switching rate for MA and TM beneficiaries without a
nursing home stay was the same, but those who required nursing home services in the prior year
were more likely to disenroll from MA plans. This phenomenon was more prominent for those
with the most costly, longest nursing home stays.
          However, there is no examination of the mechanisms through which MA plans could
engage in service-level selection against risk adjustment. This study focuses on cost-sharing as a
way to effectuate service-level selection. While cost-sharing is designed to protect people against
financial risk, it also affects incentives to use more or less health care services. In the presence of
low cost-sharing, an individual may use health care services more because she pays less for care
than it costs, which is known as moral hazard in health insurance. Health plans may exploit the

13
   Implications from Rahman et al. (2015) and Goldberg et al. (2016) may be limited due to different characteristics of the study population.
Compared to Medicare beneficiaries who are eligible only for Medicare, those with need for nursing home can use Medicaid-covered services in
addition to Medicare-covered services and can enroll in or exit MA plans at any time.




                                                                                                                                           9
mechanism designed to prevent moral hazard in order to engage in risk selection. Implementing
service-level selection through cost-sharing would likely be effective, as quantitative studies
found that cost was an important consideration most MA enrollees switching to TM.
Specifically, Government Accountability Office (2017) showed that cost-related concerns were a
leading reason for disenrollment of those with poor health as well as those with better health.
Moreover, McCormack et al. (2005) found that cost-related concerns were combined with other
reasons, amplifying the likelihood of disenrollment from MA plans.
       In this study, we present how MA plans effectuate service-level selection as a strategic
risk selection mechanism in response to the CMS-HCC model. First, we demonstrate that
Medicare beneficiaries who are expected to incur higher expenditures than their risk-adjusted
payments estimated by the CMS-HCC model are likely to use services that are expensive, which
are more vulnerable to under-provision by MA plans. If this pattern is widespread across CMS-
HCC-levels, then MA plans have strong incentives to engage in service-level selection. To avoid
those with significantly higher expenditures than their risk-adjusted payments, then MA plans
are likely to increase enrollees’ cost-sharing more for services that appeal to them than other
services after the full phase-in of the CMS-HCC model. If such disproportionate increases in
cost-sharing are large enough to affect individuals’ plan choice, it would induce those with
significantly higher expenditures than their risk-adjusted payments to voluntarily disenroll from
MA plans. Consequently, the variation of total health care expenditures for MA enrollees would
decrease after the full phase-in period. This effect would be more pronounced for those with
high-risk scores than those with low-risk scores.


5. Theoretical Predictions
5.1. Existing Model on Service-level Selection
       We build upon the two prior theoretical models on service-level selection: Frank, Glazer,
and McGuire (2000) and Ellis and McGuire (2007). A health plan’s profit is revenue less costs.
Health plans’ revenues from individual 𝑖𝑖, 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖 , typically comprise a risk-adjusted (capitated)
payment. Following Ellis and McGuire (2007), we assume that a premium that the plan charges
has been predetermined and thus does not influence plans’ strategies to effectuate risk selection.
On the other hand, the plan incurs costs for providing services. Frank, Glazer, and McGuire
(2000) characterized plans’ rationing as a shadow price on access to various types of care. From




                                                                                                 10
the perspective of an individual, this can be interpreted as a threshold of clinical need or benefit
that the individual must exceed to receive services. As such, a higher shadow price means tighter
rationing. For service 𝑠𝑠, the plan sets a shadow price to ration the service. Let 𝑞𝑞 = {𝑞𝑞𝑠𝑠 } be a
vector of shadow prices determined by the plan to ration services and 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 (𝑞𝑞) = {𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑞𝑞𝑠𝑠 )} be the
vector of expenditure on service 𝑠𝑠 that individual 𝑖𝑖 spends as a function of the service-specific
shadow price. The level of expenditure that individual 𝑖𝑖 spends on service 𝑠𝑠 , 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑞𝑞𝑠𝑠 ) , is
determined by the point at which the marginal benefit of expenditure for that individual is equal
to the shadow price 𝑞𝑞𝑠𝑠 . Therefore, the plan’s profit for individual 𝑖𝑖 can be expressed as 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖 −
∑𝑠𝑠 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑞𝑞𝑠𝑠 ).
            The plan’s total profit depends on who joins. Whether an individual joins the plan is
determined by her expectation of what she would receive in the plan. Let 𝑚𝑚
                                                                         � 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑞𝑞𝑠𝑠 ) be the services
that individual 𝑖𝑖 expects to receive in a plan that rations using service-specific shadow prices 𝑞𝑞𝑠𝑠 .
From the perspective of the plan, individual 𝑖𝑖 enrolls in the plan with a probability 𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖 (𝑚𝑚
                                                                                             � 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑞𝑞𝑠𝑠 ))
as a function of shadow prices. Therefore, the plan’s total profit can be expressed as:

(1)                                              � 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑞𝑞𝑠𝑠 )) �𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖 − � 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑞𝑞𝑠𝑠 )�
                                𝜋𝜋(𝑞𝑞) = � 𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖 (𝑚𝑚
                                            𝑖𝑖                                         𝑠𝑠

            The plan chooses each 𝑞𝑞𝑠𝑠 to maximize expected profits in the equation (1). To find profit-
maximizing values of each 𝑞𝑞𝑠𝑠 , the equation (1) is differentiated with respect to 𝑞𝑞𝑠𝑠 .
            By differentiating the equation (1) from Frank, Glazer, and McGuire (2000), Ellis and
McGuire (2007) derived the service-level selection index, which measures the plans’ incentives
to ration care tightly across services, 𝐼𝐼𝑠𝑠 :
                                                                        𝜎𝜎𝑚𝑚�𝑠𝑠

                                                                         𝑚𝑚
where 𝜋𝜋 is the plan’s net profits, 𝜎𝜎𝜋𝜋 is the standard deviation of 𝜋𝜋, 𝜙𝜙 is a uniform enrollment
function and is constant across service 𝑠𝑠, 𝜂𝜂𝑠𝑠 is the demand elasticity for service 𝑠𝑠 (a negative
number), 𝑚𝑚
         � 𝑠𝑠 is the individual’s expected expenditure on service 𝑠𝑠, 𝜎𝜎𝑚𝑚�𝑠𝑠 is the standard deviation
of 𝑚𝑚
   � 𝑠𝑠 , 𝑚𝑚
          � 𝑠𝑠 is the mean level of expected spending on service 𝑠𝑠, 𝜌𝜌𝑚𝑚�𝑠𝑠 ,𝜋𝜋 is the correlation between
𝑚𝑚

            The service-level selection index, 𝐼𝐼𝑠𝑠 , measures the relative magnitude of selection
incentives across services. It consists of three components: 1) the coefficient of variation of the




                                                                                                         11

expected expenditure (𝑚𝑚
                      � 𝑠𝑠 ) on service 𝑠𝑠 (predictability),                                 � 𝑠𝑠
                                                                                                    , 2) the correlation between the

expected expenditure on service 𝑠𝑠 (𝑚𝑚
                                    � 𝑠𝑠 ) and net profits (𝜋𝜋) (predictiveness), 𝜌𝜌𝑚𝑚�𝑠𝑠 ,𝜋𝜋 , and 3) the
demand elasticity for service 𝑠𝑠, 𝜂𝜂𝑠𝑠 . In this study, we focus on the first two components. 14
           First, predictability represents how well individuals can predict service-level use. If
individuals cannot predict service-level use well, service-level selection would have little to no
effect on enrollment or plan profits. If individuals cannot predict service-level use at all (i.e.,
everyone expects themselves to be average users), predictability is zero. Selective rationing of
health plans would not affect individual’s plan choices, and no distortion occurs. When
individuals can predict their service-level use, expected expenditures (𝑚𝑚
                                                                        � 𝑠𝑠 ) would vary, and
predictability increases. In this case, selective rationing would be effective in attracting or
deterring certain types of individuals. In other words, the better the information that individuals
have about their future health care use, the larger the distortion caused by the plan’s selective
rationing to avoid unprofitable individuals.
           Second, predictiveness represents how use of a service is correlated with net profit per
individual. This indicates whether a service is more likely to be used by those with financial
gains or losses for the plan. When use of a service is negatively correlated with profits (𝜋𝜋), the
plan would want to ration the service to avoid those individuals associated with financial losses.
When use of a service is positively correlated with profits, however, the plan would not want to
ration the service to attract those with financial gains.
           To summarize, Ellis and McGuire (2007) presented that the plan’s incentives to ration at
the service level are proportional to the product of predictability and predictiveness. For services
that are either not predictable or does not correlate with net profit, a health plan has no incentive
to ration. For services with a large positive value of 𝐼𝐼𝑠𝑠 (i.e., services that are highly predictable
and negatively correlated with net profit), however, the plan has incentives to ration these
services tightly. For services with a large negative value of 𝐼𝐼𝑠𝑠 (i.e., services that are highly
predictable and positively correlated with net profit), the plan has incentives to not ration these
services.



14
   Although the demand elasticity affects the magnitude of the index, it is unlikely to affect the order of the index. As shown in a literature review
of Ringel et al. (2002), the price elasticity of demand for health care services is in general low. Almost services were estimated to be relatively
less price-sensitive (in the range of -0.1 to -0.2 for inpatient, outpatient, and mental health services). Thus, we do not consider the demand
elasticity in further analysis.




                                                                                                                                                  12
5.2. Our Extended Model on Service-level Selection in Response to Risk Adjustment
           Building upon Ellis and McGuire (2007), we extend the model to show that MA plans are
likely to employ service-level selection as a strategic behavior in response to the CMS-HCC
model.
           MA plans must accept all Medicare beneficiaries who wish to join and offer at least the
same benefits as TM plans (i.e., services covered under Parts A and B). 15 CMS pays MA plans a
fixed capitated payment to cover the costs for services covered under TM. Using the CMS-HCC
model, CMS calculates payments to MA plans separately for each enrollee in the plan,
multiplying the plan’s payment rate by the enrollee’s risk score 𝑟𝑟. CMS uses the prior-year’s TM
data to estimate risk scores for current MA enrollees. 16 The capitation payment for an MA
enrollee is based on the estimated Parts A and B payments had a TM plan covered her directly.
Following Ellis and McGuire (2007), let 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖 denote total annual Medicare expenditure that
individual 𝑖𝑖 spends, and define 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖 = ∑𝑠𝑠 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑞𝑞𝑠𝑠 ). Let 𝐶𝐶(𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖 ) denote the risk-adjusted (capitated)
payment that an MA plan receives from CMS for individual 𝑖𝑖 with a risk score 𝑟𝑟. 17 The MA
plan’s profit for individual 𝑖𝑖 is expressed as:
(3)                                                         𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 = 𝐶𝐶(𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖 ) − 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖
           In an ideal risk-adjusted payment system, MA plans will have no incentive to select
Medicare beneficiaries. Under an imperfect risk adjustment model, however, MA plans have
incentives to discourage enrollment of those with predictably higher expenditures than their risk-
adjusted payments, 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 < 0. The incentives would be stronger for those with high-risk scores than
low-risk scores, as the CMS-HCC model underpredicts expenditures for those with the most
severe health status (Medicare Payment Advisory Commission 2012). This can be expressed as:
(4)                                                      𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖ℎ ) > 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑙 )
where 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣( ) indicates the variance of a variable. 𝑖𝑖ℎ and 𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑙 indicate those with high-risk scores
and low-risk scores, respectively.
           Given varying selection incentives across services, as shown in Ellis and McGuire
(2007), MA plans would be interested in figuring out the relationship between the magnitude of
15 Since risk-adjusted payments are based on services in Parts A and B, we focus on services covered by both TM and MA plans.
16
   The data includes TM beneficiaries entitled by age or disability with continuous 12-month enrollment in TM, and thus those entitled by end
stage renal disease or those without 12 months base year Medicare enrollment are excluded. For each of them, a separate risk adjustment model is
used to predict their next year expenditures.
17
   Since 2006, CMS has implemented a competitive bidding system to determine payments to MA plans. However, as a rebate must be returned
to enrollees as a reduction in premiums or additional benefits, the bidding system is unlikely to affect 𝐶𝐶(𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖 ).




                                                                                                                                            13
the incentive to ration services used by beneficiaries with a given risk score and the degree to
how far their total expenditures are from the mean of their conditional expenditure distribution.
If a service that is more likely to be used by those with substantially higher expenditures than
their risk-adjusted payment is the one that MA plans want to ration more tightly, then MA plans
would ration care by the order of the service-level selection index estimated from Ellis and
McGuire (2007). We assume that such rationing behaviors occur across MA plans competing for
beneficiaries. This suggests that switching to another MA plan is unlikely, since in a competitive
market MA plans behave similarly.
       We demonstrate how the probability of using a service by beneficiaries with expenditures
higher than their risk-adjusted payment is related to the Ellis and McGuire (2007)’s service-level
selection index. Define 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 as individual 𝑖𝑖’s actual use of services 𝑠𝑠. 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 takes the value 1 if
individual 𝑖𝑖 used service 𝑠𝑠 and zero otherwise. Let 𝑃𝑃�(𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) ∈ {0,1} denote the probability that
individual 𝑖𝑖 expects to use service 𝑠𝑠. To effectuate service-level selection, MA plans do not need
to forecast service use at the individual level but rather focus on forecasting at the population
level. Thus, define the population-level expected probabilities of using service 𝑠𝑠 given that an
individual 𝑖𝑖’s total actual expenditure is higher than her risk-adjusted payment as follows:
                            ∑𝑖𝑖�𝑃𝑃�(𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 < 0)�     𝑃𝑃�(𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )𝑃𝑃�(𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 < 0|𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )
(5)                                                     = ��                                  �
                                ∑𝑖𝑖 𝑃𝑃�(𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 < 0)                     𝑃𝑃�(𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 < 0)
                                                                𝑖𝑖

where the last equality of the equation (5) is drawn from Bayes’ theorem.
       Then, we re-express as follows:
                                            𝑃𝑃�(𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 < 0|𝑢𝑢�𝑠𝑠 )        𝑃𝑃�(𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )𝑃𝑃�(𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 < 0|𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )

which represents the average ratio of the probability that individual 𝑖𝑖 is expected to incur a net

that service 𝑠𝑠 is more likely to be used by those with financial losses. If �𝑁𝑁 ∑𝑖𝑖 �                                  𝑃𝑃� (𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 <0)
                                                                                                                                         ��   is

low, on the other hand, it implies that service 𝑠𝑠 is more likely to be used by those with financial
profits. Theoretically, predictiveness can have either negative or positive value. However, Ellis
and McGuire (2007) showed that all services (except for chiropractic services) were estimated to
have positive values.
        To sum up, where Ellis and McGuire (2007) stopped at showing the incentives for health
plans to ration care tightly across services, we go further and demonstrate the relationship
between the plans’ incentive to ration a service tightly and the probability of using the service by
unprofitable individuals across services.

                                          ∑𝑖𝑖 𝑃𝑃�(𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 < 0)
        The equation (8) presents that unprofitable beneficiaries under the CMS-HCC model are
more likely to use services that MA plans want to ration more tightly. This suggests that MA
plans have incentives to effectuate risk selection via service-level selection. This phenomenon is
more pronounced for those with high-risk scores, as the CMS-HCC model systematically
underpredicts expenditures for those with high-risk scores (Medicare Payment Advisory
Commission 2012), which indicates that net losses increase with an increase in risk score. Hence,
                           1      𝑃𝑃� (𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 <0|𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )
as risk scores increase, �𝑁𝑁 ∑𝑖𝑖 �     𝑃𝑃� (𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 <0)

6. Data
        We use two data sets: the 2001-2009 Plan Benefit Package (PBP) and the 2001-2009
Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS).



6.1. Plan-level Data: PBP
        The PBP provides information on the set of benefits that an MA plan offers (e.g.,
premiums, cost-sharing, and additional benefits by service). The data are submitted to CMS for
benefit analysis, marketing, and beneficiary communication purposes. Recently, CMS has used




                                                                                                                                          15
the data to review and approve all benefits yearly to ensure that MA plans do not discriminate
against beneficiaries with poor health or those who incur financial losses.
       We identify MA plans with complete information on cost-sharing for all services covered
under Parts A and B. We exclude private fee-for-service (PFFS) plans because their
characteristics are similar to TM plans despite that PFFS plans are classified as and paid like an
MA plan. We also exclude cost-based, demonstration, special needs, Medicare Savings Account,
and employer-sponsored plans because they are available only to small numbers of Medicare
beneficiaries. Thus, we limit analysis to HMO and preferred provider organization (PPO) plans.
       Table 1 shows summary statistics on MA plans by the three implementation periods of
the CMS-HCC model. The mean numbers of MA plans were 481 (SD = 72) and 2,843 (SD =
348) in the pre- and post-implementation periods, respectively. The shares of HMO plans were
98.75 percent and 71.26 percent in the pre- and post-implementation periods, respectively.


6.2. Individual-level Data: MCBS
       The MCBS is a longitudinal survey of a nationally representative sample of the Medicare
population. CMS annually surveys a nationally representative sample of roughly 11,000
Medicare beneficiaries each year, and link with Medicare claims data. In each MCBS dataset,
three rounds of interviews per year are conducted to collect detailed information on access to and
satisfaction of care, functional status, medical conditions, health care expenditures, health
insurance, and other health-related topics through the four-years.
       The MCBS is particularly well suited for studying service-level selection in MA plans.
First, it provides a nationally representative sample of the Medicare population with four-year
follow-up. This allows us to track the switching behavior between TM and MA plans over time.
Furthermore, the MCBS offers comprehensive information on health status and health care
utilization for both TM and MA enrollees. While Medicare claims data offers complete
information from Medicare-covered services for all TM beneficiaries in the sample, the claims
data for MA enrollees is not publicly available. However, the MCBS obtains information on
health status and health care utilization for all MA enrollees through survey. This enables us to
capture comprehensive information for all TM and MA enrollees in the sample over time. Lastly,
the MCBS offers comprehensive information on self-reported health outcomes and satisfaction
of care. It allows us to examine the reason for plan switching.




                                                                                               16
       We first identify a sample of Medicare beneficiaries who were eligible for both Medicare
Parts A and B coverage in the two consecutive years (𝑡𝑡 and 𝑡𝑡 + 1 years) during the study period.
We exclude the following types of beneficiaries from the sample: beneficiaries whose original
eligibility was attributable to disability or end-stage renal disease, newly eligible beneficiaries
(since no prior claims information is available), those who died, dual-eligible beneficiaries, those
who switched into Special Needs Plans, those who did not have 12 months of continuous
enrollment in Medicare (both Parts A and B benefits) in year 𝑡𝑡 , and those not enrolled in
Medicare in January of year 𝑡𝑡 + 1. Medicare beneficiaries are classified as TM enrollees if
enrolled in a TM plan for all 12 months of the calendar year, and classified as MA enrollees if
enrolled in an MA plan for at least one month of the year and enrolled in any Medicare plan in
every month of the year. Finally, we construct two comparison groups. To examine whether the
CMS-HCC model reduced the phenomenon that MA plans selectively avoid TM beneficiaries
with high-risk scores, we compare TM stayers (those enrolled in TM during year 𝑡𝑡 and remained
in TM during year 𝑡𝑡 + 1) and TM-to-MA switchers (those enrolled in TM during year 𝑡𝑡, but
switched from TM to MA during year 𝑡𝑡 + 1) (Panel A). To examine the MA plans’ strategic risk
selection behaviors in response to the CMS-HCC model, we compare MA stayers (those enrolled
in MA during year 𝑡𝑡 and remained in MA during year 𝑡𝑡 + 1) and MA-to-TM switchers (those
enrolled in MA during year 𝑡𝑡, but switched from MA to TM during year 𝑡𝑡 + 1) (Panel B).
       Table 2 shows baseline characteristics for the MCBS population by the three
implementation periods. We find that the number and proportion of TM-to-MA switchers
increased [76 (0.50 percent) and 470 (3.22 percent) for the pre- and post-implementation periods,
respectively], whereas the number and proportion of MA-to-TM switchers decreased after the
full phase-in period [272 (1.78 percent) and 131 (0.90 percent) for the pre- and post-
implementation periods, respectively]. Moreover, we find that the difference in total Medicare
expenditures between TM stayers and TM-to-MA switchers decreased after the full
implementation period ($3,377 and $555 for the pre- and post-implementation periods,
respectively). However, the difference in total Medicare expenditures between MA-to-TM
switchers and MA stayers increased after the period ($1,431 and $5,269 for the pre- and post-
implementation periods, respectively).



7. Did MA Plans Raise Copays More for Services Needed by Unprofitable Beneficiaries?



                                                                                                 17
7.1. Empirical Strategy
           To test whether MA plans employed service-level selection in response to the CMS-HCC
model, we compare changes in weighted average service-specific copayments between the pre-
and post-implementation periods. We calculate service-specific copayments of 33 services
covered under Medicare Parts A and B benefits (Table 3). Most MA plans use copayments, but
others use coinsurance rates. Assuming that there are marginal variations in service prices
between TM and MA plans 18 and across MA plans, we convert coinsurance rates to copayments
based on mean allowed charges or charges per TM beneficiaries for each service and year, which
was estimated from the MCBS. To map each claim or line item into the PBP services, we use the
service categories used in the Medicare Options Compare Out-of-Pocket Cost (OOPC) Estimates
Methodology (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2008). 19 For inpatient hospital,
skilled nursing facility, mental health specialty services, psychiatric services, and outpatient
substance abuse services, MA plans can set up varying cost-sharing by a length of stay or
number of visit. For these services, we calculate a copayment based on a typical length of stay or
number of visit (Government Accountability Office 2010). For other services, a copayment is
calculated per visit. All service-specific copayments are adjusted to 2009 US dollars by the
equivalent service-specific price index (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). To
account for varying numbers of MA plans across years, we adjust by weighting the number of
MA plans in each year. Then, we plot the changes with respect to the service-level selection
index estimated from Ellis and McGuire (2007), and compare the plotted relations between the
pre-and post-implementation periods.


7.2. Results
           Figure 1 presents evidence of service-level selection in the MA program after the CMS-
HCC model was fully phased in. Both of the fitted lines for the pre- and post- implementation
periods show an upward trend with respect to the service-level selection index, but the fitted line
for the post-implementation period is tilted upward more than the pre-implementation period.

18
   Trish et al. (2017) found that physician reimbursement in MA plans was similar to or slightly less than TM rates. For a standard mid-level
office visit with an established patient, the mean MA price was 96.9 percent of TM. For physician services, mean MA reimbursement ranged
from 91.3 percent of TM for cataract removal in an ambulatory surgery center to 100.2 percent of TM for the professional fee for interpretation of
a computed tomographic scan in an emergency department.
19
   The mapping identification for each service is conducted based on the Berenson-Eggers Type of Services (BETOS) codes, physician specialty
codes, service type, place of service, bill type code, and revenue center code. The service-specific mapping identification is described in Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (2008). We use the 2009 OOPC Methodology, which is the model close to the year in which the CMS-HCC
model was fully phased-in. Although the way of identifying each PBP service differs across years, dramatic changes are unlikely.




                                                                                                                                               18
This indicates that MA plans increased enrollees’ copayments disproportionately more for
services with higher service-level selection index than services with lower service-level selection
index after the full phase-in period. Specifically, MA plans increased copayments more for
services with higher service-level selection index [e.g., ambulance (the ratio of weighted average
copayments in the post-implementation period to the pre-implementation period: 3.38), home
health services (2.08), partial hospitalization (1.98), inpatient hospital—psychiatric (1.37), and
inpatient hospital—acute (1.36)] than services with lower service-level selection index [e.g.,
outpatient substance abuse services (0.92), outpatient X-rays (0.85), and outpatient hospital
services (0.85)].



8. Did the CMS-HCC Model Reduce Risk Selection or Induce A Strategic Behavior?
8.1. Empirical Strategy
           To examine whether the CMS-HCC model reduced the phenomenon of selectively
avoiding TM enrollees with high-risk scores, we replicate analyses from Newhouse et al. (2015),
which examined selection patterns at different implementation timings (i.e., after the initial and
full phase-in of the CMS-HCC model, respectively). We perform this analysis with two
purposes. The first is to examine whether a relatively small sample from the MCBS provides
consistent results with a larger sample from Medicare claims. Following Newhouse et al. (2015),
we compare selection during the pre-implementation period with selection during the post-
implementation period. If our findings are consistent with those from Newhouse et al. (2015),
then this indicates that our analysis with the MCBS provides generalizable results and insights.
The second is to examine whether the effectiveness of the CMS-HCC model was larger after the
full phase-in of the CMS-HCC model than the initial phase-in. For those who enrolled in TM
plans during year 𝑡𝑡, risk scores are estimated based on the risk adjustment methodology. 20 For
those who enrolled in MA plans during year 𝑡𝑡, since the claims data for MA enrollees is not




20
   The way of estimating their risk scores changed over the time period. Risk scores for the pre-implementation period (2001-2003) are estimated
based on the PIP-DCG model (Pope et al. 2000). The coefficients estimated from Pope et al. (2000) are used. Risk scores for the post-
implementation period (2007-2009) are estimated based on the CMS-HCC model (the HCC 2007 version 12 model). The coefficients estimated
from Pope et al. (2004) are used, which is also available at the National Bureau of Economic Research website (http://www.nber.org/data/cms-
risk-adjustment.html). Risk scores for the implementation period (2004-2006) are estimated by putting varying weights between the PIP-DCG
and CMS-HCC models across years. In 2004, the CMS-HCC model had 30 percent weight in determining payment, in 2005, 50 percent weight,
and in 2006, 75 percent weight. From 2004 to 2006, the remaining weight was on the PIP-DCG model.




                                                                                                                                            19
publicly available, we follow the risk score estimation method from McWilliams, Hsu, and
Newhouse (2012). 21
          To test the hypotheses, we conduct the following difference-in-difference analysis via
ordinary least squares (OLS).

1. 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 2002𝑡𝑡 takes the value one for the years after 2003 and takes zero otherwise. We
conduct the regression on those enrolled in TM plans all 12 months of the baseline years 2001-
2005. Also, we perform the same regression with 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 2005𝑡𝑡 on those enrolled in TM plans all
months of the baseline years 2001-2002 and 2006-2008. We include year fixed effects, and use
sample weights provided by the MCBS. Since we use repeated observations on individuals,
standard errors are clustered at the individual level.
          In the above equation, the key coefficients are those for 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡+1 and
𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡+1 × 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 2002(𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 2005)𝑡𝑡 . Following Brown et al. (2014) and
Newhouse et al. (2015), we interpret the results in a way that one simply assumes that TM-to-
MA switchers spent the entire next year in MA plans so that the share of the next year spent in
MA plans is one for TM-to-MA switchers and zero for TM stayers. Then, the predicted risk
score for TM-to-MA switchers in 2002 is 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼1 , whereas the predicted risk score for TM
stayers in that year is just 𝛼𝛼0 . For subsequent years, one simply adds the coefficient of the
interaction term. For those who switched beginning in 2004 or 2007, their predicted risk scores
are 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼1 + 𝛼𝛼2 . As such, we interpret the values of 𝛼𝛼1 + 𝛼𝛼2 as how much risk selection
decreased or increased after adopting the CMS-HCC model. To check the robustness of our
results, we perform additional specifications. We conduct the analysis excluding outliers (i.e.,
those with risk scores above the 95th percentile in each year), and estimate with quantile
regressions instead of OLS.
          We next examine whether MA plans selectively accepted TM enrollees with lower
Medicare expenditures conditional on their risk scores after the CMS-HCC model. For those who

   Enrollee-specific capitated payments to MA plans are calculated by multiplying county-specific benchmark rates by enrollee’s demographic
factors and individual HCC risk scores, modified somewhat by plan bids relative to benchmark rates. To obtain risk scores for MA enrollee each
year, we divide capitated payments by county benchmark rates available from CMS.

Parts A and B expenditures. For those who enrolled in MA plans during year 𝑡𝑡, total Medicare
expenditures for MA enrollees are estimated by summing any Parts A and B expenditures (if
enrolled in TM plans) and the self-reported MA expenditures. We evaluate selection pattern after
each of the two implementation points. To test the hypothesis, we conduct the following
difference-in-difference analysis via OLS:

where 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is beneficiary 𝑖𝑖 ’s total Medicare expenditure at year 𝑡𝑡 , and all other
notation are the same as in the previous analysis. As with the above regression, we perform the
regression on those who enrolled in TM plans all 12 months of the baseline years 2001-2005.
Also, we perform the same regression with 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 2005𝑡𝑡 on those who enrolled in TM plans all
months of the baseline years 2001-2002 and 2006-2008.
        To examine strategic risk selection behaviors of MA plans, we also perform the same
analyses for those who enrolled in MA plans in year 𝑡𝑡 (i.e., MA-to-TM switchers and MA
stayers). Previous studies, including Brown et al. (2014) and Newhouse et al. (2015), have
focused on examining whether the CMS-HCC model reduced the phenomenon of avoiding TM
beneficiaries with high-risk scores, mainly due to lack of data for MA enrollees. Since the
MCBS provides the data for MA enrollees, we can examine whether MA plans responded
strategically to the CMS-HCC model to induce voluntary disenrollment of unprofitable MA
enrollees. As with the above regression, we perform two regressions on those who enrolled in
MA plans for at least one month of the baseline years 2001-2005 as well as 2001-2002 and 2006-
2008, respectively. Using these results, we estimate cost savings attributable to such MA plans’
strategic behavior in 2007-2009. Assuming that the switching rate of MA-to-TM switchers is
generalizable to the entire MA population, we estimate the number of MA-to-TM switchers in
the entire MA population in 2007-2009 (Kaiser Family Foundation 2015), and then multiply it
by the average excess expenditures of MA-to-TM switchers beyond their risk-adjusted payments
(i.e., the values of 𝛽𝛽1 + 𝛽𝛽2).

                                                                                                           21
       Table 4 displays the results from re-estimating equations from Newhouse et al. (2015)
(Panel A) and our own analyses (Panel B). We find that the phenomenon of avoiding TM
beneficiaries with high-risk scores reduced after adopting the CMS-HCC model. For those who
enrolled in TM plans during year 𝑡𝑡, column (1) shows that while TM-to-MA switchers had
average risk scores roughly 0.14 points lower than TM stayers in the pre-implementation period,
the switchers’ risk scores increased by 0.1 after the initial phase-in, assuming they spent full year
in MA plans. As shown in column (2), the the risk score difference was almost identical in
magnitude after the full phase-in. When the outliers were excluded (columns 2 and 5) or the
equation was estimated via quantile regression (columns 3 and 6), we find similar results. On the
other hand, as shown in column (7)-(8), in the pre-implementation period, TM-to-MA switchers
had baseline expenditures roughly $2,400 lower than TM stayers, assuming they spent full year
in MA plans. The amount of favorable selection decreased during the initial phase-in period (by
$1,910), and dramatically decreased after the full phase-in period (by $84).
       However, we find evidence of strategic risk selection of MA plans in response to the
CMS-HCC model. For those who enrolled in MA plans during year 𝑡𝑡, column (1) shows that
while MA stayers had average risk scores roughly 0.01 points higher than MA-to-TM switchers
in the pre-implementation period, the stayers’ risk scores decreased by 0.15 after the initial
phase-in, assuming the stayers spent full year in MA plans and the switchers spent full year in
TM plans. After the full phase-in, as shown in column (2), the risk score difference slightly
increased. We also find robust results when the outliers were excluded or the equation was
estimated via quantile regression. Moreover, as shown in column (7)-(8), in the pre-
implementation period MA stayers had baseline expenditures roughly $1,400 lower than TM-to-
MA switchers. However, the amount of selection increased during the initial phase-in period (by
$3,022), and increased even more after the full phase-in period (by $4,996). Based on these
results, it is estimated that such strategic behavior led MA plans to save costs of $5.2 billion
(=$4,996 × 3.7% × 28.6 million) in 2007-2009.



9. Did    Service-level    Selection   Induce Voluntary        Disenrollment      of   Unprofitable
   Beneficiaries?
9.1. Empirical Strategy




                                                                                                  22
       To test whether service-level selection affected the individuals’ plan switching behavior
after the full phase-in period of the CMS-HCC model, we compare service-specific use between
switchers and stayers in the pre-implementation period with that in the post-implementation
period. We measure health care utilization by type of service. For those who enrolled in TM
during year 𝑡𝑡, we use claims to create a total of 29 types of services categories (Table 5). Part A
claims are classified into the following five types of service (hospital inpatient visit, hospital
outpatient visit, home health care, hospice, and other facility services). Part B claims are
classified into 24 categories by the Berenson-Eggers Type of Services (BETOS) code, which is
used to create clinically meaningful groupings of procedures and services to analyze Medicare
expenditures by type of service. For those who enrolled in MA plans during year 𝑡𝑡, we estimate
service-level use through the survey. In the survey, participants reported their use of health care
by the following 7 types of service: inpatient hospitalizations, outpatient department visits, home
health care, skilled nursing facility, medical provider events, office visits, and durable medical
equipment supplier use. Thus, we create a total of 7 types of services categories (Table5). To
examine whether TM enrollees who used services with lower service-level selection index were
more likely to switch to MA plans than those who used services with higher service-level
selection index after the full phase-in (“intensive-margin selection”), we estimate the ratio of the
proportion of TM-to-MA switchers with use of a particular type of service to TM stayers with
use of the service in the pre- and post-implementation periods, respectively. To examine whether
TM enrollees who used more services with lower service-level selection index were more likely
to switch to MA plans than those who used more services with higher service-level selection
index after the full phase-in (“extensive-margin selection”), we also estimate the ratio of average
number of services per enrollee of TM-to-MA switchers to TM stayers in the pre- and post-
implementation periods, respectively. Then, we plot the ratios with respect to the service-level
selection index estimated from Ellis and McGuire (2007), and compare the plotted relations
between the pre-and post-implementation periods. We perform the same analysis for those who
enrolled in MA plans in year 𝑡𝑡.
       To test whether service-level selection allowed MA plans to reduce the scope of enrolling
those with higher expenditures than their risk-adjusted payments, especially for those with high-
risk scores, we estimate the coefficients of variance of total Medicare expenditures for TM and
MA enrollees, respectively, over time by risk score. The coefficient of variance of total Medicare



                                                                                                 23
expenditures is estimated as the ratio of the standard deviation of total Medicare expenditures to
its mean. We divide the study population into enrollees with high-risk scores and other risk
scores. High-risk scores indicate above the 90th percentile of the risk score distribution in each
year.


9.2. Results
        The above two figures in Figure 2 presents changes in service use of TM-to-MA
switchers to TM stayers between the pre- and post-implementation periods. In both figures
showing results for intensive and extensive margin selection, respectively, we observe that for
most services, the ratios of service use of TM-to-MA switchers to TM stayers are lower than one.
Also, the fitted lines for the pre- and post-implementation periods show a downward trend with
respect to the service-level selection index, with an almost same slope and are below the ratio of
one. However, the intercept of the post-implementation period is higher than the intercept of the
post-implementation period. We also find that after the full phase-in period, TM-to-MA
switchers systematically used more services across all services compared to TM switchers (not
shown). However, even after the full implementation period, TM enrollees who used services
with higher service-level selection index were more likely to switch to MA plans than those who
used services with lower service-level selection index. When the outlier service with the highest
value of the service-level selection index (hospice) was excluded, we find similar findings
(Appendix Figure 1). However, we observe that the fitted line for the post-implementation period
is tilted upward more than the pre-implementation period. This indicates that TM enrollees who
used services with higher service-level selection index in the full phase-in period were more
likely to switch to MA plans than the equivalent population in the pre-implementation period.
        On the other hand, the below two figures show changes in service use of MA-to-TM
switchers to MA stayers between the pre- and post-implementation periods. In the left figure
showing results for intensive margin selection, we find that the fitted line for the post-
implementation period is below the fitted line for the pre-implementation period. Furthermore,
the fitted line for the post-implementation period is tilted downward more than the pre-
implementation period. This indicates that the ratio of the proportion of using a service between
MA-to-TM switchers and MA stayers reduced after the full implementation period. In the right
figure showing results for extensive margin selection, however, we observe the opposite




                                                                                                24
findings. The fitted line for the post-implementation period shows an upward trend with respect
to the service-level selection index, whereas the fitted line for the pre-implementation period
shows an almost flat trend. This indicates that MA enrollees who used services with higher
service-level selection index after the full implementation period were more likely to disenroll
from MA plans than the equivalent population in the pre-implementation period.
        The left and right figures in Figure 3 present the coefficients of variance of total
Medicare expenditures for TM enrollees and MA enrollees by risk scores, respectively. For TM
enrollees with both high-risk scores and other risk scores, the coefficients of variance of total
Medicare expenditures decreased over time. However, we observe different patterns for MA
enrollees by risk scores. The coefficients of variance of total Medicare expenditures for MA
enrollees with high-risk scores show a downward trend over time, whereas those for MA
enrollees with other risk scores show a slightly upward trend over time.



10. Why Did MA Enrollees Disenroll from MA Plans?
10.1.   Empirical Strategy
        To examine the reasons of disenrollment from MA plans, we conduct various analyses.
To test whether high-risk score enrollees who stayed in MA plans longer were more likely to
disenroll from MA plans than those who stayed in MA plans shorter, we estimate the coefficient
of variance of total Medicare expenditures for MA enrollees with high-risk scores by MA
enrollment periods. Due to a relatively small sample size of those with high-risk scores, we
categorize the population into those with 12 months enrollment in MA plans and those with less
than 12 months enrollment in MA plans. Moreover, we examine whether disenrollment from
MA plans was related to lower satisfaction on care costs, quality of care, or access to care.
Satisfaction is measured by four levels: very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, satisfied, and very
satisfied. To test this hypothesis, we conduct the following difference-in-difference analysis via
OLS:
(11)     𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛾𝛾0 + 𝛾𝛾1 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡+1 +

𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 includes age, race, female, and disabled status. 22 All other notations are the

for at least one month of the baseline years 2001-2002 and 2006-2008.


10.2.      Results
           Figure 4 displays the coefficients of variance of total Medicare expenditures for MA
enrollees with high-risk scores by MA enrollment periods. We find that the coefficients of
variance of total Medicare expenditures for those with 12 months enrollment in MA decreased
more steeply than those with less than 12 months enrollment.
           Table 6 shows the results from examining the relation of MA disenrollment and
satisfaction of care after the fully phase-in period. Column (1) shows that after the full phase-in
period, the relation of MA disenrollment and satisfaction on care costs was the most pronounced
among satisfaction measures considered in this study. Specifically, it was shown that relative to
MA-to-TM switchers, MA stayers were less satisfied with out-of-pocket costs by 0.004 points in
the pre-implementation period, assuming the stayers spent full year in MA plans and the
switchers spent full year in TM plans. However, MA stayers were more satisfied with out-of-
pocket costs by 0.176 points than MA-to-TM switchers after the full implementation of the
CMS-HCC model. As shown in column (2), the similar trend for satisfaction on overall quality
of care. Compared to MA-to-TM switchers, MA stayers were less satisfied with overall care
quality by 0.025 points in the pre- phase-in period, assuming the stayers spent full year in MA
plans and the switchers spent full year in TM plans. However, MA stayers were more satisfied
with overall care quality by 0.110 points than MA-to-TM switchers in the full phase-in period.



11. Discussion and Conclusion
           The goal of this paper is to shed light on the competing claims on the effectiveness of the
CMS-HCC model and to comprehensively understand strategic risk selection behaviors of MA
plans. We find that the CMS-HCC model reduced the phenomenon that MA plans avoid
beneficiaries with high-risk scores in TM plans, whereas it led to increased disenrollment of
high-cost beneficiaries, conditional on risk score, in MA plans. We explain this phenomenon

22
   We adjust for self-reported health status because individuals with poor health are likely to report negative feelings toward one’s health care. We
also control for age, race, female, and disabled status because different demographic groups are likely to evaluate their health and health care
differently.




                                                                                                                                                 26
through service-level selection. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that after
the full phase-in period of the CMS-HCC model, MA plans have the incentive to and did
increase copayments disproportionately more for services that appeal to beneficiaries who could
be unprofitable under the CMS-HCC model than other services. The disproportionate changes in
copayments led to voluntary disenrollment of beneficiaries with need for these services, who
tend to incur higher expenditures than their risk-adjusted payments. We also find evidence
supporting our hypothesis that those who were less satisfied with out-of-pocket costs were more
likely to disenroll from MA plans. Such strategic behavior led to MA plans to save $5.2 billion
in 2007-2009 by simply transferring the costs to the federal government, thereby placing
significant financial burdens on the federal government.
       Our study shows evidence of the intended effect of the CMS-HCC model on reducing
risk selection for TM beneficiaries with high-risk scores, consistent with findings from
Newhouse et al. (2015). Specifically, the differences in risk scores between TM-to-MA switchers
and TM stayers reduced by a factor of three. Also, the differences in total Medicare expenditures
between them decreased after the full phase-in period to $84. This shows the intended
consequences of the implementation of the CMS-HCC model. As risk adjustment leads to neutral
payments for those with conditions included in the risk adjustment formula, MA plans no longer
have incentive to avoid them. These findings add to earlier studies that found that a more
clinically detailed risk-adjustment model strengthens the incentives for MA plans to retain sick
enrollees. However, the risk selection did not disappear, but rather changed in form.
       The main contribution of this study is to show that MA plans magnified service-level
selection in response to the CMS-HCC model to avoid beneficiaries who could be costly under
the CMS-HCC model. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that MA plans have incentives to
effectuate risk selection via service-level selection, as unprofitable beneficiaries under the CMS-
HCC model are more likely to use services that are expensive and are thus more vulnerable to
under-provision by MA plans. It informs why MA plans more engaged in service-level selection
after adopting the CMS-HCC model. Then, our empirical analysis provides supporting evidence
showing that MA plans increased copayments disproportionately more for services that are more
likely to be used by them. This validates our theoretical analysis and contributes to providing
evidence-based policy implications. With the theoretical foundation and empirical evidence
based closely on the theoretical foundation, this study adds to the body of literature regarding




                                                                                                27
MA plans’ strategic response to the policy-induced change in financial incentives as an
important contributor to service-level selection.
       It is worthwhile to note that relatively large increases in copayments were found in two
types of services. First, increases in copayments for home health services and inpatient
psychiatric hospital services were likely targeted for disenrollment of beneficiaries with multiple
chronic conditions. This is because their expenditures were systematically underpredicted by the
CMS-HCC model. For example, the model, on average, underestimated expenditures for those
with more than six chronic conditions by $608 (Government Accountability Office 2011). Also,
increases in copayments for ambulance and acute inpatient hospital services were likely intended
to encourage disenrollment of those with potentially high risks because of poor health behaviors.
Consequently, such service-level selection would likely lead to voluntary disenrollment of those
who currently need these services as well as those who potentially have the need for these
services.
       Our study also shows the pronounced effect of service-level selection on MA enrollees
after the full phase-in of the CMS-HCC model. Specifically, we find that MA enrollees who used
services with high service-level selection index in the previous year were more likely to disenroll
from MA plans in the following years than those who used services with low service-level
selection index in the previous year. This phenomenon was observed during the initial phase-in
period, and it was magnified with the full phase-in, showing that the amount of selection
increased by $3,033 and $4,996, respectively. We also show that MA enrollees who were less
satisfied with their out-of-pocket costs were more likely to disenroll from MA plans. These
findings suggest that MA enrollees were more likely to disenroll from MA plans due to increased
burdens on out-of-pocket costs as a result of service-level selection. The effects were more
pronounced for those who stayed in MA plans longer, as they were more likely to be exposed to
high out-of-pocket costs. Service-level selection could result in poor health status, because it is
likely to lead to delayed care during the MA enrollment period, and inefficient or uncoordinated
cares following enrollment switching to TM plans. This is especially true for those with multiple
chronic conditions, which requires more integrated and coordinated care due to complex
conditions and treatment.
       Although the size of MA-to-TM switchers was only about one percent of the entire
Medicare population, risk selection in this population cannot be considered trivial with the




                                                                                                28
following three reasons. First, the size of the population increases over time. From our data, 3.7
percent of MA enrollees left their MA plans between 2007 and 2009. However, in 2014, nearly
12 percent left their MA plans (Government Accountability Office 2017). Also, the cost
implications for this population would be significant given that the top five percent of the US
population accounts for about 50 percent of total health care expenditures (Cohen 2014). If MA-
to-TM switchers keep experiencing delayed care or receiving fragmented care in non-managed
care settings, this would incur even higher treatment costs. Moreover, as MA payments are partly
determined by the average expenditures of TM beneficiaries at the county level, switching of
high-cost MA enrollees to TM plans could lead to MA payment increases, possibly placing
significant financial burdens on the federal government.
       Our findings provide key implications for CMS in developing a better risk adjustment
model. To ensure that MA plans’ benefit package designs do not discriminate against
beneficiaries in poor health with high health care expenditures, since 2010, CMS has reviewed
all benefit packages yearly (Government Accountability Office 2010). In addition to the review
process for MA plans’ benefit structures, developing a better risk adjustment model is inevitable
as MA plans would continue to engage in risk selection if a risk adjustment model does not
estimate capitation payments as sufficiently close to the actual expenditures. The new risk
adjustment model needs to be designed to generate economic forces to prevent MA plans’
strategic behaviors in engaging in service-level selection. Specifically, developing a risk
adjustment model that not only conditions on each beneficiary’s risk scores but also reflect each
beneficiary’s potential service-level use may contribute to reducing service-level selection. This
approach enables to provide overpayments for services that are more likely used by unprofitable
beneficiaries and underpayments for services that are more likely used by profitable
beneficiaries, thereby equalizing incentives in rationing all services (Glazer and McGuire 2000).
By regarding risk adjustment as a tax/subsidy scheme, overpaying for services in high demand
by unprofitable beneficiaries and underpaying for services in high demand by profitable
beneficiaries would redistribute health care costs away from profitable beneficiaries and toward
unprofitable beneficiaries. As the payment for profitable services is much smaller than the
payment for unprofitable services, this would penalize MA plans for attracting only those in need
of profitable services. Thus, the new risk adjustment model could reduce the potential for MA
plans to use service-level selection.




                                                                                               29
       This study has several limitations. First, we assumed that the magnitude of the incentives
to ration care tightly at the service level is consistent across time. However, it might not be true
because reimbursement policies and rates change over time, possibly affecting the magnitude of
the incentive across years. Following Ellis and McGuire (2007), we also assumed that all
individuals share the same elasticity of demand for a certain service. However, the demand
elasticity might differ across services (Manning et al. 1987) as well as individuals. Moreover,
Ellis, Martins, and Zhu (Forthcoming) further developed the service-level selection index by
accounting for variation in cost-sharing, risk-adjusted profits, and demand elasticities across
services. However, estimates of the new service-level selection index were empirically
calculated based on commercial claims data. Considered differences in demographic profiles and
health care utilization patterns between the Medicare population and the commercial insured, the
estimates are unlikely to be applicable to our study. Furthermore, we assumed small variations in
service prices and service utilization between TM and MA plans and across MA plans. Thus, we
converted service-specific coinsurance rates to copayments using mean allowed charges per TM
beneficiaries for each year and year. However, prices in MA plans are not equivalent to those in
TM plans (Trish et al. 2017, Baker et al. 2016). Also, there is substantial heterogeneity in cost
and market power across MA plans (Glazer and McGuire 2016). Moreover, we used self-
reported data to estimate utilization and Medicare expenditures for MA enrollees, which is
significantly underreported (Eppig and Chulis 1997). However, it is unlikely that such reporting
errors have systematically changed over the study period (McWilliams, Hsu, and Newhouse
2012). Finally, disproportionate changes in copayments could have induced to prevent
disenrollment of TM beneficiaries in high need of these services. Individuals generally consider
various aspects of plan benefits in changing a health plan (McCormack et al. 2005, Government
Accountability Office 2017) . However, this study focuses only on cost-sharing structures.
Therefore, there is the possibility that MA plans lessened other strategies of distorting service
offerings such as access to specialist or provision of additional benefits in order to accept sicker
TM beneficiaries who were no longer unprofitable under the CMS-HCC model, which is beyond
the scope of this study.
       Findings from this study indicate that the CMS-HCC model reduced the MA plans’ risk
selection of avoiding TM beneficiaries with high-risk scores, whereas it induced MA plans to
strategically behave in response to the CMS-HCC model via service-level selection. MA plans




                                                                                                 30
have raised copayments disproportionately more for services needed by high-need beneficiaries
than for other services, thereby inducing unprofitable beneficiaries to voluntarily disenroll from
their MA plans, mainly due to increased out-of-pocket costs. This allows MA plans to avoid the
risk of enrolling unprofitable beneficiaries. Our results provide key policy implications for CMS
in moving towards a better risk adjustment model that accounts for the enrollees’ predicted risk
scores while generating economic incentives for MA plans that discourage service-level
selection.

Notes: Medicare enrollees were classified as TM enrollees if enrolled in TM plans for all 12 months of the calendar year, and classified
as MA enrollees if enrolled in an MA plan for at least one month of the year and enrolled in any Medicare plan in every month of the
year. Total Medicare expenditures for TM enrollees were estimated by summing any Part A and Part B expenditures, and total Medicare
expenditures for MA enrollees were estimated by summing any Part A and Part B expenditures (if enrolled in TM) and the self-reported
MA expenditures. All expenditures were adjusted to 2009 dollars using the CPI-U. Risk scores for TM enrollees were estimated from
Medicare claims and risk scores for MA enrollees were estimated by dividing the reported capitation payments by county-level
benchmark rates. The way of estimating the risk scores for TM enrollees varied by the implementation periods, and thus risk scores
cannot be directly comparable across the three periods. Sample weights provided by the MCBS were used.

Notes: Services covered under Medicare Parts A and B were classified into 29 services.
Specifically, Part A claims were classified into the following five types of service (hospital
inpatient visit, hospital outpatient visit, home health, hospice, and other facility service). Part B
claims were classified into 24 categories by the Berenson-Eggers Type of Services (BETOS)
codes. Service-level selection index estimated from Ellis and McGuire (2007) was used and type
of service was presented by the order of the service-level selection index. Service-level use for
TM beneficiaries was estimated from MCBS claims data. Service-level use for MA enrollees
was estimated from self-reported data.

Notes: Each satisfaction measure took values from one to four (“very dissatisfied”, “dissatisfied”, “satisfied”, “very satisfied”). Self-reported health,
age, race, female, and disabled status were adjusted. Year fixed effects were included in all regressions. Sample weights provided by the MCBS were
used. Standard errors, in parentheses, were clustered by the individual.
