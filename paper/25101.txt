                                           ABSTRACT

We study how citation patterns differ between journal tiers in economics. Concretely, we analyze
citations patterns of more than 6,000 economics research articles published in top five, second
tier, and top field economics journals between 1992 and 1996. In line with previous literature, we
find that top five journals’ articles generally receive more citations and that the life cycles of
those citations are longer. However, their influence (in term of citations) is overestimated: in its
first twenty (five) years since publication, the median top five article accumulates 4.25 (around 3)
as many citations when compared to the second tier and top field median article. We show that
this ratio is strongly associated with the field of economics research (e.g. this ratio is the lowest
for econometric methods papers) and with articles’ impact (e.g. in all fields of economics
research, except for theory, this ratio decreases sharply as one moves toward high-impact articles
in term of citations).

1.   Introduction
Economics scholars place a strong emphasis on publishing in a narrow set of top general
research journals (Gibson, 2014; McKenzie, 2014; Heckman and Moktan, 2018), a trend
which seems to have deepened in the last decades (Card and DellaVigna, 2013). Annual
submissions to top five economics journals—i.e., the American Economic Review (AER),
Econometrica (ECA), the Journal of Political Economy (JPE), the Quarterly Journal of
Economics (QJE) and the Review of Economic Studies (RES)—nearly doubled from 1990
to 2012. However, since the total number of articles published in these journals actually
declined, publishing in these journals has become a much more difficult and slow process
(Card and DellaVigna, 2013).

This emphasis on top five outlets seems to have a powerful influence on the direction of
research in economics, the reputation and pay of economics scholars, the decision of funding
agencies, as well as on departments’ and universities’ rankings (Hamermesh, 2018; Serrano,
2018; Gibson, Anderson, and Tressler, 2017; Verma, 2015; Gibson, Anderson, and Tressler,
2014; Ellison, 2013; Zimmermann, 2013; Hamermesh and Pfann, 2012; Hazelkorn, 2011;
Hilmer et al., 2015; Oswald, 2007; Hilmer and Hilmer, 2005; Smith and Eysenck, 2002; Cole
and Cole, 1967). For this reason, it is not uncommon to read claims such as “The economics
profession rewards one research paper in a top five journal more than say five good
publications in journals outside this narrow set…” (McKenzie, 2014).

When the focus is placed on young faculty careers, literature (Schimanski and Alperin, 2018)
shows that, in academy in general, promotion and tenure reviewers commonly look at the
venue of publication as a proxy for quality. When the focus is placed on economics, recent
research (see, for example, Heckman and Moktan, 2018) shows that publishing in top five
journals is a powerful determinant of tenure and promotion. In particular, it shows that
publishing in top five journals greatly increase the probability of receiving tenure during the
first spell of tenure-track employment and through the seventh year of such employment. It
also shows that junior faculty members rank top five publications as having the greatest
influence on their tenure and promotion outcomes.

In parallel to top five publications counts, economics scholars also have drawn more and
more on quantitative indicators based on citation counts (or, alternatively, use metrics which

                                                                                             2
take citation counts as input) to assess researchers and research institutions performance (see,
for example, Seeber, 2019; Gibson, Anderson, and Tressler, 2017; Hazelkorn, 2015; Gibson,
Anderson, and Tressler, 2014; Ellison, 2013; Cole and Cole, 1967). However, exceling
performance in terms of citation counts does not necessarily go hand in hand with publication
venue reputation. An example may be illustrative: a top tier economics journal may focus its
articles on theory or econometric methods papers, while a second tier or top field one may
focus its articles on applied ones. As applied papers have been shown to receive, in general,
more citations than theory and econometric methods ones (see Anauati, Galiani and Gálvez,
2016; Angrist and Pischke, 2017), the second tier journal could end up surpassing the top tier
one in terms of citation performance.

Therefore, to better understand the relations between these two strategies for assessing
researchers’ performance, empirical evidence aimed at quantifying and characterizing how
journal tiers relate with citation performance is needed. In this article we delve into this issue.
Concretely, we do this by providing answers to the following questions: Do total received
citations differ between articles published in top five and well respected non-top five
economics journal (i.e., second tier and top field journals)? Do the dynamics of received
citations (i.e., life cycles) differ across journal tiers?1 If differences are to be found, do they
vary across articles’ impact? In other words, is a highly/slightly cited article published in a
non-top five journal more or less similar (in terms of received citation) to one published in a
top five journal? Importantly, are these patterns similar or different across fields of
economics research (i.e., applied, applied theory, econometric methods, and theory articles)?

To provide answers to these questions, we constructed a dataset containing detailed citation
and articles’ characteristic data. We did this by first listing all research articles published
between 1992 and 1996 in the top five economics journals, a sample of second tier general
interest journals and a sample of top field journals. We then collected data on how yearly
received citations evolved as articles grow older. Finally, we classified each article into one
of four fields of economics research (theory, applied research, applied theory and

 Note that as bibliometric indices usually restrict the range of articles that they use as input on the basis of the
number of years that have passed since their publication, annual trends in citations may strongly influence the
values of these indices.

                                                                                                                  3
econometric methods). Our final dataset contains detailed information on 1,313,314 citations
received by 6,083 economics’ articles.

We find that citation patterns effectively vary greatly across journal tiers, both in magnitude
and behavior. Our results show that these patterns are strongly associated to fields of
economics research and articles’ impact (as measured by citation counts), and suggest that
the great emphasis of academic economics on top five journals should be taken with care due
to articles’ heterogeneity. In view of that, and in line with previous research, our results point
out that it may be convenient to assign a greater weight in the determination of economic and
reputational rewards to factors such as citation counts (as suggested in Hamermesh, 2018)
and departmental peer-review of a candidates’ work (as suggested in Heckman and Moktan,
2018). However, we believe these criteria should also consider and be adjusted by fields of
economics research.

This paper contributes to a growing body of literature on quantitative economics that
addresses the relevant papers’ characteristics, their citation performance and journals’
decisions about what to publish. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to analyze
the heterogeneity in citation patterns across journal tiers considering fields of economics
research and articles’ impact. In general, most of the literature has focused on top five
journals leaving out second tier and field journals and/or ignoring the methodology used by
articles. For instance, in terms of the publishing process, it has been documented that it has
slowed down in top five journals (Ellison, 2002; Trivedi, 1993; Laband, 1990; Yohe, 1980;
and Coe and Weinstock, 1967) mainly due to lower acceptance rates and longer delays. In
relation to citation performance and fields of economics research, Chiappori and Levitt
(2003) use data on all empirical microeconomics papers published in AER, JPE and QJE
over 1999 and 2001 to assess whether theoretical economic research succeeds in influencing
the path of empirical microeconomics research. They find that theoretical papers cited as a
primary motivation for empirical research projects are surprisingly dispersed; with very few
theoretical papers having much of an influence on applied microeconomics papers. Anauati,
Galiani and Gálvez (2016) characterize how life cycles in yearly citations differ across fields
of economic research in top five journals, finding strong differences in citation patterns
across fields of economics research. The present article shares some methodological


                                                                                                4
decisions with Anauati, Galiani and Gálvez (2016) but aims at answering a different question:
in Anauati, Galiani and Gálvez (2016) the focus is placed on analyzing citation patterns
across fields of economics research, here we focus on characterizing citation patterns across
journal tiers.

Closely related papers focusing on how citations vary across economic journals are those of
Hammermesh (2018), Heckman and Moktan (2018), Wohlrabe and Bornmann (2017), Stern
(2013) and Oswald (2007). Using a sample of 230 articles published in the top five journals,
the Economic Journal and the Review of Economics and Statistics in 2007–2008,
Hammermesh (2018) finds substantial overlap in citations (adjusted for its length) between
these journals. According to this author, a very few papers in top journals generate immensely
more citations than other papers published in those journals or elsewhere. In other words, a
very few outliers determine our perceptions of journal quality and these perceptions ignore
the great heterogeneity of articles within and across journals. Heckman and Moktan (2018),
in a broader analysis that examines the influence of top five publication on promotion and
tenure decisions, find that a substantial share of influential publications appears in non-top
five outlets and that the comparability between top five and non-top five journals publications
increases considerably when one focuses on the lesser-cited top five journals. Wohlrabe and
Bornmann (2017) aim at facilitating fair research evaluations in economics by applying field-
and time-normalization of citation impact to articles published in 294 journals (containing
192,524 papers). By running their analysis, they identify 33 outstandingly cited economics
journals. Notably, although this set includes the top five outlets, it is not the case that top five
journals are the top five ranked journals in it. Oswald (2007) uses data on accumulated
received citations over twenty-five years by papers published in 1981 in issues of the AER,
ECA, Journal of Public Economics, Economic Journal, Journal of Industrial Economics, and
the Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics. He finds that the variation in the quality of
journals, as measured by cites, is strikingly large. He reports that the more highly-cited
articles in “good-to-medium” quality journals have 10 times the citation impact of the slightly
cited articles published in the top journals, and that the less highly cited articles in the top
journals are easily bettered by good articles in less prestigious outlets. The author also
highlights there is a noticeably imperfect match between the quality of the journal and the
lifetime cites of individual articles. Finally, Stern (2013) studies uncertainty associated with

                                                                                                  5
citations-based rankings by computing the standard error of impact factors for every
economics journal with a five-year impact factor in the 2011 Journal Citations Report. He
finds that outstanding impact factors of the top two journals are well defined, and that an elite
group of 9–11 mainstream journals can be fairly reliably distinguished. Additionally, he
reports that the four bottom ranked journals are also fairly clearly set apart.

Our paper differs from these articles in that it uses a fine-grained dataset including yearly
citations to more than 6,000 articles from top five, second tier general interest and top field
journals, while also categorizing articles fields of economics research. This allows us not
only to focus on general patterns across journal tiers, but also on the interactions between
journal tiers and fields of economics research (which we show are far from negligible). This
represents a novel contribution to previous literature focusing solely on journal tiers and with
respect to Anauati, Galiani and Gálvez (2016) which focuses only on top five journals and
fields of research.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes how we built our dataset.
Section 3 covers our empirical analysis and main results. Section 4 provides discussion and
concludes.

2.   Data
As a first step for constructing our dataset, we selected a set of journals to include into each
tier under analysis (i.e., top five, second tier and top field). Although, there is a consensus
regarding which journals are considered top five journals (i.e., AER, ECA, JPE, QJE, and
RES), classifying journals into second tier or top field tiers is more subjective. As second tier
general research journals we included a sample of well-respected journals publishing articles
covering general research topics; concretely, our sample of second tier journals includes the
Economic Journal, Economic Inquiry, the European Economic Review, the Journal of
Economic Literature (JEL), the Journal of Economic Perspectives (JEP), the International
Economic Review, and the Review of Economics and Statistics. As top field journals we
included a sample of well-respected journals known for focusing in one particular area of
research; concretely our sample of top field journals includes the Journal of Development
Economics, the Journal of Econometrics, the Journal of Economic Behavior and
Organization, the Journal of Economic Theory, the Journal of Health Economics, the Journal

                                                                                               6
of International Economics, the Journal of Labor Economics, the Journal of Law and
Economics, the Journal of Monetary Economics, the Journal of Public Economics, the
Journal of Urban Economics, and the RAND Journal of Economics.

A caveat should be made be made on the inclusion of the JEP and the JEL into the second
tier general research category. Even though these outlets publish articles on a broad range of
topics (which made us place them in the general research category) and are well regarded in
the discipline but are not considered top five (which made us placed them in the second tier
category), they also differ in content from other second tier journals selected. The JEP is a
journal that publishes articles normally solicited by the editors aimed at disseminating newer
economic ideas and findings. The JEL also publishes papers mostly invited by the editors,
and commonly offers literature reviews on selected topics (although original research is also
published in it). Both of these journals are known for having an exceling performance in
terms of citation counts and have even been found to surpass the citation impact of less cited
top five journals (see for example Wohlrabe and Bornmann, 2017). This is why, to check the
robustness of our results, the Online Appendix presents our main results excluding these two
outlets.

Once these journals were chosen, using EconLit we listed all articles published in each of
them from 1992 to 1996, and gathered their title, the name(s) of their author(s), their JEL
codes, and their publication information (pages, journal’s name and volume).2 Based on both
the title of the paper and subsequent checks, we excluded articles we identified as
comments/replies, addresses/speeches and corrections. Like Card and DellaVigna (2013), we
also excluded articles in the Papers and Proceedings of the AER. This left us with a final
dataset of 6,083 full-length refereed articles.

Then, from Google Scholar, we collected detailed data on citations received by each article
from two years before publication—to capture citations to preprints—up to and including
twenty years since its publication. We refer as total citations received by an article to the sum
of yearly citations received by and article during this time span covering 23 years. Data was


2
  We chose the window from 1992 to 1996 to cover a time span of at least 20 years. The reason behind this
choice is that, as shown in Anauati, Galiani, and Gálvez (2016), citations of top five journals' articles have been
found to have life cycle that lasts approximately 20 years.

                                                                                                                 7
retrieved from the end of March 2017 to the end of May 2017. For roughly 9.7% of all
articles, citation data could not be identified by automatic means.3 A few citations of articles
in Google Scholar do not have a timestamp attached to them; we noted that these citations
tend to have a low impact (i.e., they are associated with a null citation count or non-formal
scholarly documents), and we therefore decided to ignore the small subset of citations which
do not have a timestamp.

As in Hamermesh (2013) and Anauati, Galiani and Gálvez (2016), the field of research
corresponding to each paper was identified by skimming each paper. We classified each
article into one and only one of the following research fields: applied, applied theory,
econometric methods and theory. The criteria used to assign a paper to a category are as
follows: 1) Applied papers are papers that have an empirical or applied motivation. They rely
on the use of econometric or statistical methods as a basis for analyzing empirical data,
although they may deal with simple models that serve as a theoretical framework for the
analysis. This category also includes papers which do not use sophisticated econometric
methods, but do use descriptive statistics to analyze, for example, given features of an
economy and in which the empirical section figures as the central element. 2) Applied theory
papers develop a theoretical model to explain a fact; the empirical analysis is not the most
important feature of the paper, but a supplement. In these papers, the use of econometric or
statistical analyses is limited, although they may use simulations (even with empirical data)
or refine other techniques to test the implications of the models. 3) Econometric methods
papers are articles that develop econometric or statistical methodologies. They also include
papers that develop methodologies for collecting data and that address issues of
identification, data aggregation or optimization techniques. 4) Theory papers do not contain
an empirical fact section; they usually approach a topic by modeling and by making extensive
use of formal mathematics and logic. They may include a numerical example or a simple
model calibration with theoretical data to illustrate the proposed model or analyze its
comparative statics. Further information on the way in which we have classified papers into
these four categories can be found in Anauati, Galiani and Gálvez (2016). Figure S1 plots
the distribution of fields of economics research across the selected journals.

3.   Characterizing citation patterns across journal tiers in economics
3.1. Summary statistics of total citations across journal tiers and fields of economics
research
Before analyzing detailed citation patterns, Table 1 reports summary statistics at the article
level considering their total received citations across journal tiers and fields of economics
research (Table S1 reports this data across journals and Table S2 replicates Table 1 excluding
the JEP and JEL). In top five journals, total citations per article range from 0 to 10,836, with
a mean (median) of 491 (217) and 1,815 citations at the 95th percentile. For second tier journal
papers, total citations range from 0 to 5,741, with a mean (median) of 147 (51) and 651
citations at the 95th percentile.4 The statistics describing the distribution of citations of top
field journals papers are strikingly similar to second tier journal ones, with total citations
ranging from 0 to 8,676 and a mean (median) of 136 (51) and 491 citations at the 95th
percentile. Therefore, during the first twenty years since publication, the median top five
article accumulates 4.25 as many citations when compared to the second tier and top field
median article. Differences between mean and median values show that skewness in the
distribution of total citation at the article level is noteworthy.5 Additionally, Table 1 and
Table S2 reveal that citation patterns differ greatly across fields of economics research, no
matter the journal tier being analyzed.




4
  When the JEP and JEL are excluded, total citations per article range from 0 to 5,741, with a mean (median)
of 114 (46) and 423 citations at the 95th percentile. It should be noted that this shift to the left in the distribution
is caused mainly by a reduction of total citations received by applied papers, which predominate in the JEP and
the JEL (see Figure S1).
5
  Skewness in the distribution of citation counts has been also reported in Hamermesh (2018), Card and
DellaVigna (2013), Oswald (2007) among others.

            3.2.     Citation counts overlap analysis

            Table 1 shows a great heterogeneity of impact in terms of total citations. To better focus on
            this phenomenon, Figure 1 plots the distribution of total citations received by papers across
            journals as well as tiers as a whole.




                                                                                                                                   10
                    Figure 1. Distribution of Total Citations by Publication Venue




Note: 1 was added to the total citations of each article to avoid dropping articles with no citations when plotting in log10
scale.

One feature that arises from examining Figure 1 is that the JEL and the JEP behave quite
similar, in terms of total citations, to the top five journals. It should be mentioned that these
two journals have a high proportion of applied articles, specifically 57% and 82% in the JEL
and the JEP respectively (see Figure S1). A second feature is that after excluding these two
journals, top field journals slightly outperform second tier journals in terms of total citation
counts. This is reflected in that, for the former, total citations per article range from 0 to
8,676, with a mean (median) of 136 (51) and 491 citations at the 95th percentile, whereas, for
the latter, total citations per article range from 0 to 5,741, with a mean (median) of 114 (46)
and 423 citations at the 95th percentile. Finally, a third feature observed is that less highly-
cited articles in the top five journals are widely outperformed by articles in second tier and
top field journals. To quantify this overlap, Table 2 shows the fraction of articles in each
journal with total citations higher than the 10th percentile, the 25th percentile, the 50th
percentile, and the 75th percentile of the AER articles’ total citations distribution. Journals

Note: Journals are sorted in decreasing order by the fraction of citations greater than the 50th percentile of the AER

In line with previous literature (Hammermesh, 2018; Oswald, 2007) Table 2 shows that there
is a strong overlap in total citations across journals. Concretely, for all of the journals
considered, at least one third of their articles receive more citations than the 10th percentile
of the AER articles’ total citations distribution. Although top five journals rank high in this
table, it is notable that the JEL is the leading journal and that the JEP outranks two top five
outlets (ECA and RES, which specialize in econometric methods and theory papers—see
Figure S1). The highest ranked top field journal is the Journal of Monetary Economics (27%
of all its articles receive more citations than the median AER one), and the highest ranked
second tier journal is the Economic Journal (17% of all its articles receive more citations than
the median AER one).




                                                                                                                                   12
3.3. Time dynamics of received citations across journal tiers and fields of economics
research
To better understand time-dynamics of received citations, Figure 2, Figure S2 and Figure S3
plot the evolution of average and median yearly citations, as well as yearly citation
trajectories for each article, for every year since two years before its publication,
discriminating by journal tier and field of economics research. Concretely, being 𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑖,𝑡 the
number of citations paper 𝑖 receives in year 𝑡 since publication, 𝑟 a particular subset of papers
and 𝑛𝑟 the number of papers included in 𝑟, these figures plots the evolution ∑𝑖 ∈ 𝑟 𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑖,𝑡 ⁄𝑛𝑟
for successive values of 𝑡 as well as the evolution of the median values of these citations.
The main difference between Figure 2 and Figure S2 is that the former maintains a fixed y
scale across panels while the latter does not. The difference between Figure S2 and Figure
S3 is that the latter excludes from the analysis the JEP and the JEL.

Figure 2 shows that for every year the average and median yearly citations of top five journal
papers are higher than those of the second tier and top field journals (this goes in line with
Table 1 and Table S2 results). In the year of publication (i.e. year 0), the yearly average
citations of top five journals articles (4.06) more than doubles the average citations of second
tier (1.77—1.36 excluding the JEP and the JEL) and top field journals (1.44) articles. This
difference becomes bigger as time passes: after 15 years since publication the average
citations of top five articles (32.7) is around four times the average citations of second tier
(8.7—6.80 excluding the JEP and JEL) and top field (8.41) journals articles, suggesting a
better maturity for top five papers.

Figure 2, Figure S2 and Figure S3 show that, even without accounting for citation inflation,6
peaks in yearly citations are not reached at the same time across journals tiers. For articles
published in top five journals, a peak in median yearly citations is reached around the
fifteenth year after publication (Figure 2S allows a visual detailed inspection).7 This peak


6
  Note that since we are analyzing articles published in a very short time window, citation inflation, which refers
to the observed common rise in citation counts over the years, is not relevant for comparison across our sample
of articles, as all of them experienced the same inflation during this period. See Althouse et al. (2009), Anauati,
Galiani, and Gálvez, (2016), Galiani and Gálvez (2019), and Neff and Olden, (2010).
7
  Note that Anauati, Galiani, and Gálvez (2016) finds that median papers published in top five journals reach
their peak between three and five years after their publication. This differs from our results because Anauati,
Galiani, & Gálvez (2016) examine articles published in a rather longer time window (from 1970 to 2000) which
allows controlling for citation inflation.

                                                                                                               13
(13.4) is more than five times as high as the peak of articles published in second tier (2.4—
2.1 excluding the JEP and the JEL) or field journals (2.6). On the other hand, for articles
published in second tier and top field journals, peaks are reached before in time (seven years
after publication for second tier journals and eight years after publication for top field
journals). This suggests that articles published in top five journals do not only receive more
citations, but also that citations are received for longer periods of time; i.e. their life cycles
are longer.




                                                                                               14

  Note: Mean and median citations are smoothed using five-year centered moving averages. Light orange lines

                                                                                                              15
In line with previous research, Figure 2 and Figure S2 also show that, no matter the journal
tier, citation patterns—as measured by median yearly citations—are more favorable for
applied and, to a lesser extent, for applied theory papers than for theory and econometric
methods ones. Concretely, they receive more citations per year, have a higher peak level, and
receive more citations during their first years since publication.

Econometric method papers are a special case. Their citation patterns in second tier journals
outperform slightly that of theoretical papers. However, they behave differently in top field
journals depending on whether we observe the mean or median citation. When mean citations
are considered, citation patterns of this field exceeds that of applied and applied theory papers
and resembles the behavior of econometric methods top five papers. Whereas, when the
median is used, the performance of econometric method papers declines in relative terms
compared to applied and applied theory papers. This indicates that there are very successful
(in terms of citation counts) econometric method papers that received an outstandingly large
amount of cites, both in the top five and top fields outlets. Detailed inspection of the data
shows that the three most highly-cited econometric method articles in top field journals
received 4,631, 6,313 and 8,676 citations, and that the three most highly-cited econometric
method articles in top five journals received 2,627, 2,876 and 5,131 citations.

3.4.   Citation patterns across journals tiers and fields of economics research
Now we place our focus on total citation patterns across journals tiers and fields of economics
research. Figure 3 shows empirical quantile functions of articles’ total citations. As expected,
for almost all quantiles, total citations received by papers in top five journals are higher than
the ones received by papers published in non-top five journals. Moreover, the distribution of
cites to top five papers stochastically dominates the distribution of citations for applied,
applied theory and theory non-top five journals papers. However, in the case of econometric
methods, the distribution of citations of field journals crosses the distribution of top five at
nearly the 99.37th percentile; pointing again toward the presence of very successful (in terms
of citation counts) econometric methods articles published in top field journals—that even




                                                                                              16
outperform the most successful econometric methods articles (in terms of citation counts)
published in top five journals.8

                             and Fields of Economics Research




     Note: 1 was added to the total citations of each article to avoid dropping articles with no citations when plotting
     in log10 scale.

Figure 3 also shows that, except for econometric method papers, second tier and top field
journals are quite similar in terms of citations’ distribution. The cumulative distribution curve
of top field journals is in general slightly above the curve of second tier journals until the 87th
and 91th percentile in the cases of applied and theory papers respectively, where both curves


8
  From the inset graphs within each panel of Figure 3 it can be observed that applied, applied theory, theory and
econometric methods papers in the first decile of the distribution of citations of top five journals have the same
number of citations as articles in the 48th, 51th, 40th and 36th (41th, 54th, 36th and 36th) percentiles of the
distribution of citations of second tier (top field) journals. This confirms once again the finding that less highly-
cited articles in the top five journals are easily outperformed by median articles in second tier and top field
journals.

                                                                                                                           17
intersect. In the case of applied theory papers, the curve of second tier journals is slightly
above the curve of top field journals until the 99.5th percentile where they intersect. Finally,
the cumulative distribution curve of econometric method papers in top field journals
stochastically dominates the cumulative distribution curve of this type of articles in second
tier journals. Figure S4 replicates Figure 3 but excludes the JEP and JEL from the analysis.
In this case, the second tier articles’ curve falls slightly, and it crosses the top field journal
curve at the 96th and 95th percentile in the cases of applied and theory papers respectively.
Additionally, now for both applied theory and econometric methods articles the top field
curve dominates the cumulative distribution curve of second tier ones.

     Figure 4. Percentage Difference of Empirical Quantile Functions of Articles Total
             Citations across Journal Tiers and Fields of Economics Research




To avoid being misguided by the logarithmic scale used in Figure 3, Figure 4 plots percentage
differences of total citations’ empirical quantile functions across journal tiers (Table S3
details this data for a selected subset of empirical quantiles). Concretely it plots

                                                                                               18
(𝑄𝑖 (𝜏) − 𝑄𝑗 (𝜏))⁄𝑄𝑗 (𝜏), where 𝑄𝑖 (𝜏) stands for the empirical quantile 𝜏 of distribution 𝑖. In this way,
a value of 2 indicates that the value of 𝑄𝑖 (𝜏) triples 𝑄𝑗 (𝜏). For the sake of exposition, we now
focus only on differences between articles published in top five and top field journals, since
articles published in top field journals behave quite similarly to those published in second
tier journals the interpretation can be generalized to them. Figure 4 shows some interesting
patterns. First, and before focusing in the differences across fields of economics research,
Table S3 shows that during the first two decades after publication, a top five journal article
in the first tenth part of the distribution receives as many citations as those received by
3.83(4.31) second tier(top field) journal articles in the first tenth part of the distribution; while
a top five journal article in the last tenth part of the distribution receives as many citations as
those received by 3.31/3.76 second tier/top field articles in the last tenth part of the
distribution. Second, in relative terms, the overall magnitude of the difference tends to be
larger for applied theory papers and smaller for econometric methods papers. Third, and more
interesting, how these differences vary across articles’ impact differs greatly among fields of
economics research. For applied articles, the gap narrows very mildly as one move toward
more cited articles. This narrowing is sharp for the case of econometric methods papers (even
converging at high values) and applied theory papers (which show a strong narrowing, but
not strong enough as to attain convergence). Surprisingly, theory papers show and opposite
pattern: the gap widens as one moves to highly cited papers. In other words, in all fields of
economics research, except for theory, the more cited a top five article is, the relatively less
successful (in terms of citation impact) it is when compared to an equivalent article published
in non-top five venues; but, for theory papers, the opposite pattern is observed: highly-cited
top five articles are even relatively more successful (in terms of citation counts) when
compared to non-top five ones.

Finally, Figure 4 also confirms the finding that top field journals behave relatively similarly
in term of citations than second tier journals. In this case, the difference moves around zero
regardless the research field, which suggests that both type of journals present similar
cumulative citation distributions. However, there are a few points to highlight. First, the
difference is close to null for applied, applied theory and theory papers, except for the high
percentiles, where it grows to a small extent. These patterns suggest that highly cited articles
are slightly more successful in term of citation counts in second tier journals than in top field

                                                                                                       19
ones. Second, the difference is negative and small for econometric methods articles; but it
widens a bit more for highly cited articles. Figure S5 replicates Figure 4 excluding the JEP
and the JEL. When these outlets are excluded, the curve falls slightly, but still moves around
zero regardless the research field. This highest fall is observed for applied theory articles.

3.5.   Patterns observed for the first five years since publication
Up to now, we presented results based on total citations counts, which we defined as all
citations accumulated during the first twenty years since publication. However, given much
of the concern regarding top five overemphasis is centered in its use as a signal of competence
for young academics seeking tenure, here we report if the citation patterns we presented are
also observed for those citations accumulated during the first years since publication (which
are the ones effectively seen tenure reviewers).

  Figure 5. Relation between Citations Received During the First Years since Publication
                             and Total Citations, by Journal Tier




Figure 5 shows how citations received during the first 5 years since publication (𝑐𝑖𝑡 5𝑌 ) relate
to total citations (𝑐𝑖𝑡 20𝑌 ). In both cases, we added 1 to the citations counts of each article
and expressed them in logarithm base 10 scale. In line with previous literature showing that
citations during the first years since publication correlate strongly with citations received
during longer timeframes (see, for example, Wang, 2013), our data shows that, no matter the
journal tier, citations received during the first years since publication are almost linearly




                                                                                                 20
associated to total citations (in the log10 scale). Notably, the estimated slopes are identical
across tiers.

Table 3 reports articles’ median citation values across journal tiers and fields of economics
research. Medians are calculated for citations received in the first five years since publication
(Median 5Y) and for citations received in the first twenty (Median 20Y). Additionally, it
reports the ratios between medians for citations received in the first five years since
publication and medians for citations received by all top five articles during the first five
years since publication (34.5 for five years since publication and 217 for twenty years since
publication).

Table 3 shows that citations accumulated in the first five years since publication are already
favorable to top five articles: the median second tier article receives 0.35 as much citations
as the median top five one, while the median top field journal receives 0.32. However, it is
interesting to note that these differences are smaller for citation accumulated over the first
five years since publication than they are for citations accumulated over the first twenty (both
the median second tier and the median top field journal article receive 0.24 as much citations
as the median top five article). This goes in line with the fact that top five articles have longer
life cycles. To better capture this phenomenon, Figure 6 plots the percentage variation
between medians calculated for the first five years since publication and for the first twenty.

                                                                                                                    21
 Figure 6. Percentage Variation between Citations Received During the First Twenty and
                Five Years since Publication and Total Citations, by Journal Tier




Figure 6 shows that the way in which citations received by articles in the first five years and
the first twenty varies across journal tiers is also interacted with fields of economics research.
For the case of applied and theory articles, top five papers accumulate even more citations
during longer periods. For applied theory articles this pattern is also observed, however less
pronounced. Once again, econometric methods articles stand as a special case: the ageing of
articles is far more stable across tiers.

Overall, patterns reported when total citations were analyzed remain stable when citations
during the first five years since publication are analyzed. However, differences across journal
tiers are quantitative smaller; this is due to the fact that top five articles tend to age better (in
particular applied and theory articles).

4.   Discussion and conclusions
As stated by Gibson (2014), economics is unusual among academic disciplines in the
emphasis it places on publication in a narrow set of top journals. Given that publication venue
reputation does not necessarily go hand in hand with citation performance, we study how
citation patterns differ between three different journal tiers (top five, prestigious second tier,
and top field journals).

We show that citation patterns vary greatly across journal tiers, and that this variation is
related to fields of economics research. In particular, our analysis suggests a series of clear-
cut patterns:




                                                                                                  22
1. Total citations received by a typical (as measured median citations) article published
   in a top five journal are higher than the ones received by non-top five outlets. In its
   first twenty years since publication, the median top five article accumulates as many
   as 4.25 citations when compared to the second tier and top field median article.
2. As expected, for every year since publication yearly citations received by top five
   journal papers are higher than the ones received by second tier and top field journals
   papers. In addition, compared to second tier and top field journals’ articles, top five
   journals’ articles do not only receive more citations, but also experience a rise in
   yearly citations for longer periods. In other words, their life cycles are longer.
3. There is a strong overlap in the distribution of received citations across tiers. As an
   example, for all journals we analyzed, at least one third of their articles received at
   least as many citations as the 10th percentile of the AER articles’ citations.
4. We find that no matter the articles’ impact, claims such as the statement that an article
   in a top five journal should be valued more than five good publications outside these
   venues may be oversimplifying the problem and overestimating top five journals
   impact. We find that the tenth less(more) cited top five article receives around 4(3.5)
   times as many cites as the tenth less(more) cited second tier or top field article.
5. These median ratios are strongly associated with fields of economic research: they
   are larger for applied theory papers and smaller for econometric methods papers.
6. Additionally, these ratios are also associated to articles’ impact within each field of
   research. For applied articles the gap narrows very mildly as one moves toward high-
   impact articles, whereas this narrowing is sharp for the case of econometric methods
   papers (even converging at high values) and applied theory papers (which shows a
   dramatic narrowing, but not strong enough as to attain convergence). Notably, theory
   papers show and opposite pattern: the gap widens as one moves toward high-impact
   papers.
7. Patterns remain stable when citations counts are restricted to the first five years since
   publication. However, differences across journal tiers are relatively smaller. This is
   due to the fact that top five articles tend to age better (in particular applied and theory
   articles) and this exacerbates differences as time passes by.



                                                                                           23
    8. Top field journals in general behave relatively similar to second tier journals in term
         of citation patterns, being an exception econometric methods articles published in top
         field outlets whose citations exceed those of second tier journals. These patterns
         remain quite stable when the JEP and JEL are excluded from the second tier category
         (although, in this case, a relatively better citation performance is observed for the top
         field journals).

We believe the clear-cut facts reported in this article help in the understanding of incentives
behind the evaluation of research agents in economics (e.g., the direction of research in
economics, the career paths of young researchers, the reputation and pay of economics
scholars, inter alia). Additionally, results suggest that the great emphasis of academic
economics on top five journals may be taken with care.

In line with previous research, our results point out that it may be convenient to assign a
greater weight in the determination of economic and reputational rewards to factors such as
citation counts (as suggested in Hamermesh, 2018) and departmental peer-review of a
candidates’ work (as suggested in Heckman and Moktan, 2018). However, and we believe
importantly, economics is a far from homogenous discipline and these criteria should also be
adjusted by fields of economics research factors.

4.1.    Limitations
A few caveats must be mentioned regarding the scope of our results. First, our results are
purely descriptive and should not be interpolated as suggesting that the same paper will
receive more citations simply because it was published in a top tier journal relative to a
scenario where it was published in a non-top tier prestigious outlet. The dynamics behind
citations are quite more complex than this. Take the following example: as economics
scholars prioritize publishing in top five journals, competition is stronger in those journals,
and selection arises.9 For this reason, one would expect stronger and more innovative papers
to be published in top five journals, and, as one would also expect stronger papers to be cited
more, this should translate into articles published in top five journals having higher citation


9
  According to Card and DellaVigna (2013), QJE had an acceptance rate of around 3% by 2013, while,
according to Cherkashin et al. (2009), the acceptance rate of the Journal of International Economics was around
14% by 2004.

                                                                                                            24
counts. However, for the same reason, one could also expect some top tier papers to be cited
more simply because they were published in these venues. Concretely, if authors search more
extensively previous literature in top tier journals (something expected if articles published
in these journals are believed to be stronger), cites may simply flow toward an article
published in these outlets because of their reputation, something an equivalent-in-quality
article published in a non-top tier venue may not benefit from.

Second, given that right from the beginning we planned to study differences in yearly citation
patterns for long periods, our analysis focuses on articles published more than twenty years
ago (and their present day received citations). This means that patterns for present day articles
may have changed. In fact, the literature suggests that factors that may affect citations
patterns (e.g., acceptance rates) have effectively changed in the last decades (see, for
example, Card and DellaVigna, 2013; Cherkashin et al., 2009). Given that evidence points
toward competition being stronger in top tier journals, assuming the patterns reported in this
article have deepened does not seem to be a longshot.

4.2.     Future research directions
This article reports a series of patterns, which we believe, may motivate future research.
Clearly, one line of research may focus on studying the origin of these differences. Some
work has been carried out in this direction. For example, regarding fields of economics
research, recent research suggests that economics empirical papers are much more likely to
be cited by other disciplines (e.g., psychology, public health, medicine) than economics
theory papers (Angrist and Pischke, 2017).10 We report that differences in citations patterns
across fields economics of research also relates to journals tiers, understanding how other
disciplines search for relevant economics articles across economics journals would be of
interest (are top five journals more visible than other disciplines?). Future research should
focus on analyzing these patterns for using newer articles as input, as patterns may have
changed in as time passed by. Additionally, the use of top five journals publications as a
signaling mechanism for young scholars is an interesting and relevant research question. This


10
  An alternative explanation could be that standard practice is to list citations for every article which deals on
any subject remotely similar to one's own paper and that a much larger number of papers meet this criterion in
applied work than in theoretical work.

                                                                                                              25
line of research is far from trivial and should tackle some interesting methodological aspects.
For example, it is not easy to identify an author as a young one from traditional sources, it is
not clear how to deal with articles with multiple authors, and to obtain some kind of causal
estimate of the effects of publishing in a top-five journal in young scholars careers a good
identification strategy should be proposed. Finally, patterns characterized in this article could
serve as input in the design of future citation metrics.

Note: This table contains values for (𝑄𝑖 (𝜏) − 𝑄𝑗 (𝜏))⁄𝑄𝑗 (𝜏), where 𝑄𝑖 (𝜏) stands for the empirical quantile 𝜏 of distribution 𝑖. In this way,
a value of 2 indicates that 𝑄𝑖 (𝜏) triples 𝑄𝑗 (𝜏).
