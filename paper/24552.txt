Sophisticated Investors and Market Efficiency: Evidence from a Natural Experiment

NBER Working Paper No. 24552
April 2018
JEL No. G12,G14

                                         ABSTRACT

We study how sophisticated investors, when faced with changes in information environment,
adjust their information acquisition and trading behavior, and how these changes in turn affect
market efficiency. We find that, after exogenous reductions of analyst coverage due to closures of
brokerage firms, hedge funds scale up information acquisition. They trade more aggressively and
earn higher abnormal returns on the affected stocks. Moreover, the participation of hedge fund
significantly mitigates the impairment of market efficiency caused by coverage reductions. Our
results show a substitution effect between sophisticated investors and public information
providers in facilitating market efficiency in a causal framework.

Information plays a key role for the efficiency of security markets and the real economy
(e.g., Hayek, 1945; Fama, 1965). The information environment is continuously evolving
at both the market and firm levels. For example, Regulation Fair Disclosure and the
Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S. and the MiFID II in Europe have had wide-ranging impacts
on how information is transmitted in the marketplace. In addition, substantial variation
exists across firms regarding how and what information is disseminated into the market.
Over the past four decades, institutional investors have become the dominant player in
the U.S. financial markets (e.g., French, 2008). Hedge funds, in particular, represent the
(arguably) most sophisticated investors (e.g., Brunnermeier and Nagel, 2004) and they
add value to the financial system in a number of ways (e.g., Brown, Kacperczyk,
Ljungqvist, Lynch, Pedersen, and Richardson, 2009). Motivated by these observations,
we attempt to address the following questions: How do sophisticated investors alter their
behavior in response to changes of information environment? And how do their actions
in turn affect market efficiency?


       Understanding sophisticated investors’ reactions to changes of information
environment is important for at least three reasons. First, it speaks directly to how
sophisticated investors trade and profit from information advantage (e.g., Grossman and
Stiglitz, 1980). Second, it sheds light on the way markets incorporate information that is
not accessible to all participants (e.g., Fama, 1970). Third, it helps us better understand
the interactions between different types of information processors (e.g., sell-side analysts
and hedge funds) in financial markets.


       The impacts of changes of information environment on sophisticated investor
behavior are theoretically ambiguous. On one hand, sophisticated investors will have a
greater comparative advantage when information available to other market participants
becomes noisier. Thus, faced with a more opaque information environment, sophisticated
investors may have greater incentives to acquire information and trade in security
markets. On the other hand, if sophisticated investors are concerned about adverse
selection in trading, they may trade less actively when the information environment
becomes murky. Thus, how changes of information environment affect sophisticated
investors is ultimately an empirical question.
                                             1
        It is, however, a challenging task to empirically investigate the above relation.
There is a reverse causality problem as the activities of sophisticated investors can change
firms’ information environment. For example, institutional investors may demand that
firms change their disclosure policies. Moreover, there is likely to be an omitted variable
problem. For example, when there are important corporate events, such as mergers and
acquisitions, the coverage decisions of sell-side analysts and the trading activities of
sophisticated investors can change simultaneously.


        To overcome these endogeneity challenges, we exploit a natural experiment: the
exogenous reductions of sell-side analysts due to closures and mergers of brokerage firms
(Hong and Kacperczyk, 2010; Kelly and Ljungqvist, 2012). As documented in Kelly and
Ljungqvist (2012), such closures and mergers are driven by adverse regulatory changes
and unfavorable business conditions in the equity research industry, instead of the
prospects of the affected stocks. 1 Thus, closure and merger-related coverage reductions
provide credible exogenous shocks to firms’ information environment. We study how
hedge funds, as a proxy for sophisticated investors, respond to the coverage reductions by
adjusting their information acquisition and trading activities. We also examine the
changes in hedge funds’ profitability on the affected stocks and the impacts of their
activities on market efficiency.


        We assemble our sample by merging several datasets covering brokerage closures,
hedge fund stock holdings, EDGAR Internet search traffic, analyst coverage, earnings
conference call transcripts, as well as stock prices and characteristics. Our hedge fund
holdings data are obtained from quarterly 13F filings in which hedge fund companies are
identified by manually matching 13F institutions’ names with a list of hedge fund




1Similar changes to the equity research industry are taking place in Europe currently. The Markets in
Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) regulation, effective in the European Union (EU) on January 3,
2018, bans the usage of soft dollar commissions and requires institutional investors to pay banks and
brokers directly for research. This policy will affect the equity research industry, leading to changes in
information environment. For details of MiFID II, see the website of the European Securities and Markets
Authority (ESMA) https://www.esma.europa.eu/policy-rules/mifid-ii-and-mifir.

                                                    2
company names compiled from several commercial hedge fund databases (Lipper TASS,
HFR, CISDM, Bloomberg, Barclay Hedge, and Morningstar) and other online sources.


       Our analyses generate four sets of main findings. First, after exogenous reductions
of analyst coverage, stock price efficiency significantly decreases for the affected stocks.
To quantify stock market efficiency, we use the post earnings announcement drift
(PEAD), a phenomenon that prior research has shown to be related to mispricing (e.g.,
Ball and Brown, 1968; Bernard and Thomas, 1989). As robustness checks, we also employ
variance-ratio-based market efficiency measures (Lo and MacKinlay, 1988) and the price
informativeness measure of Bai, Philippon, and Savov (2016). All the three measures
provide consistent results.


       Second, hedge funds trade more aggressively on the affected stocks around
earnings announcements after coverage reductions. Relative to unaffected stocks,
abnormal hedge fund holdings of the affected stocks become significantly more sensitive
to standardized unexpected earnings (SUE). More precisely, the abnormal holdings of
hedge funds are larger (smaller) prior to positive (negative) earnings announcements
after coverage reductions. These changes in hedge funds’ trading activities are more
pronounced when the information environment of the affected stocks is more opaque and
when the exited analysts are of higher quality prior to coverage reductions. In addition,
hedge fund profitability from the affected stocks increases after coverage reductions,
especially for their purchases (i.e., increases in stock holdings).


       Third, we provide evidence that sophisticated investors scale up their information
acquisition after coverage reductions. We show that buy-side analysts from hedge funds
are more likely to participate in earnings conference calls (i.e., asking at least one question
during the call) for firms that experience coverage reductions. Moreover, by exploiting a
novel dataset of EDGAR Internet search traffic, we find that the search volume for the
affected firms increases significantly following the coverage reductions. Importantly, the
increase in search volume is especially pronounced from the IP addresses that are more
likely to come from hedge funds based on geographic information.


                                              3
       Finally, conditional on high levels of hedge fund participation after coverage
reductions, the impairment of market efficiency is mitigated for the affected stocks, and
in fact, the net change in measures of market efficiency is indistinguishable from zero.
This finding is robust to all the three measures of market efficiency (i.e., PEAD, variance
ratios, and price informativeness). Our evidence suggests that, when the information
environment becomes murky, increased hedge fund participation helps to facilitate
market efficiency.


       Overall, our results reveal a substitution effect in information provision between
sophisticated investors and public information providers. Information acquisition is
costly even for sophisticated investors (e.g., Grossman and Stiglitz, 1980). When more
analysts provide information, the gain from costly information acquisition becomes
smaller and thus sophisticated investors may choose to participate less. When fewer
analysts are at work and the information environment becomes more opaque,
sophisticated investors have incentive to increase their market participation due to larger
information advantage. Therefore, sophisticated investors’ decisions on information
acquisition depend on the amount of information supplied by other information
providers (such as sell-side analysts), which implies substitution among information
processors.


       In our analyses, we use hedge funds to proxy for sophisticated investors. In
practice, other types of institutional investors can actively participate in the market as
well. To gain additional insight, we look at trading patterns of non-hedge-fund
institutions (mutual funds, banks, insurance companies, investment advisors, and
others). We find that these institutions exhibit little change in their trading activities in
reaction to analyst reductions. In particular, their holdings of the affected stocks do not
appear to be more informative after the shock to the information environment.


       Our paper makes several contributions to the literature. First, our study adds to
the research on the relation between information environment and sophisticated
investors. Kacperczyk and Seru (2007) show that more skilled fund managers rely less on
public information produced by sell-side analysts. Complementing their findings, we
                                             4
show that hedge funds scale up information acquisition and trade more aggressively after
exogenous exits of analysts. Our findings are also consistent with Griffin and Xu (2009),
who find that hedge funds prefer opaque stocks that are less analyzed, plausibly to enjoy
larger information advantage. In addition, our results are in accordance with theoretical
studies that predict a substitution effect between the acquisition of private information
and the supply of public information (e.g., Verrecchia, 1982; Diamond, 1985; Goldstein
and Yang, 2017, 2018). To our best knowledge, our paper is the first to document such a
substitution effect empirically in a causal framework.


       The substitution effect we document has relevancy for policy decisions. It implies
that policies designed to increase the supply of public information can potentially crowd
out sophisticated investors’ acquisition of private information. Thus, if there is a positive
(negative) externality associated with private information acquisition by sophisticated
investors relative to public information production, our findings point to a subtle side
effect of regulations that raise (lower) requirements for public information provision.
Examples of potential externalities include herding in information acquisition (e.g.,
Froot, Scharftein, and Stein, 1992; Devenow and Welch, 1996) and effects on market
quality (e.g., Stein, 1987; Kacperczyk, Nosal, and Sundaresan, 2018). A detailed analysis
of potential externalities is an interesting question for future research.


       Second, our paper contributes to the literature on the role of sophisticated
investors (in particular, hedge funds) in market efficiency, as raised in a theoretical
context by Stein (2009). Existing research shows that hedge funds exploit security
mispricing and improve market efficiency (e.g., Akbas, Armstrong, Sorescu, and
Subrahmanyam, 2015; Cao, Chen, Goetzmann, and Liang, 2016; Cao, Liang, Lo, and
Petrasek, 2016). Aragon and Strahan (2012) find that negative shocks to funding liquidity
of hedge funds reduces market liquidity of the assets they trade, a topic also studied by
Nagel (2012). In this paper, we present new evidence that in the presence of exogenous
shocks to public information provision, hedge funds substitute sell-side analysts in
facilitating market efficiency by trading on acquired information. In a broad sense, our
study is related to Lo (2017) who describes how adaptation to environment changes
influences economic agents’ behavior and market efficiency.
                                              5
       Finally, our paper contributes to the literature on the role of sell-side analysts in
information production and market efficiency (e.g., Brennan, Jegadeesh, and
Swaminathan, 1993; Womack, 1996; Hong, Lim, and Stein, 2000; Barber, Lehavy,
McNichols, and Trueman, 2002; Jegadeesh, Kim, Krische, and Lee, 2004; Hong and
Kacperczyk, 2010; Loh and Stulz, 2011). We find that market efficiency is impaired after
exogenous reductions of sell-side analysts, suggesting that sell-side analysts contribute to
price discovery. Our study is also related to Wu (2016) who shows that, after closures of
brokerage firms, corporate insiders earn higher abnormal returns on the affected stocks.
Unlike sophisticated investors, however, corporate insiders have access to private
information at no cost, and their decision is simply whether to trade on private
information or not. In addition, insiders whose trading volume is much smaller than that
of institutional investors are less likely to have substantial impacts on market efficiency.


       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section I describes the data. Section
II presents our main results. In Section III, we perform additional analyses and
robustness checks. Finally, Section IV provides some concluding remarks.


                                                I. Data
A. Closures of Brokerage Firms


       The dataset of analyst reductions in this paper is the same as the one in Kelly and
Ljungqvist (2012). The reductions of analyst coverage result from a total of 43 closures
and mergers (21 stand-alone closures and 22 mergers) of research departments of various
brokerage firms between 2000 and 2008, which leads to 4,429 coverage reductions
affecting 2,180 different stocks. 2 The data extend the sample of Hong and Kacperczyk
(2010) which only contains merger-related coverage reductions.




2 The data come from three sources: the coverage table of Reuters Estimates; the I/B/E/S stop file; and
termination notices sent to brokerage clients, which can be retrieved from Investext.

                                                  6
      As documented in Kelly and Ljungqvist (2012), it is unfavorable market changes
that have driven the closures and mergers of research departments. Given the difficulty
in keeping research reports as private information, brokerage firms usually provide them
to clients free of charge. As a result, research departments have been heavily subsidized
by revenue from other businesses including trading activities (“soft dollar commissions”),
market making, and investment banking. Since the early 2000s, however, these revenue
sources experienced severe challenges: soft dollar commissions were criticized by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and institutional clients; market making
revenue shrank due to fierce competition for order flow; and new regulations (e.g., the
2003 Global Settlement) made it difficult to use investment banking revenue to subsidize
research. Facing such adverse economic conditions, many brokerage firms exited the
equity research industry.


      Previous studies show that closure and merger-related coverage reductions are not
driven by private information of firm prospects. Coverage reductions have no predictive
power over future earnings of the affected stocks (Hong and Kacperczyk, 2010; Kelly and
Ljungqvist, 2012). Moreover, these coverage reductions increase information asymmetry
and make firms’ information environment more opaque (Kelly and Ljungqvist, 2012;
Johnson and So, 2017). Consequently, closure and merger-related reductions of analyst
coverage generate credible exogenous variation to firms’ information environment, which
allows us to examine the impacts of the information environment on the behavior of
sophisticated investors in a causal framework.


      Our analysis uses difference-in-differences methods. Following Kelly and
Ljungqvist (2012), we match each treated firm with up to five control firms that do not
experience coverage reductions one year before and after the termination dates of the
treated firm. We require the control firms to be in the same Fama-French 48 industry and
in the same Fama-French size and book-to-market quintiles as the treated firms. If more
than five candidate firms exist, we choose those that are closest to the treated firm in
terms of the average bid-ask spreads that measure the level of information asymmetry
prior to coverage reductions.


                                            7
        We merge I/B/E/S data with the coverage reduction data, and keep the earnings
announcements for the treated and control firms two years before and two years after the
coverage reductions. We focus on treated firms with five or fewer analysts prior to
coverage reductions so that the drop of one analyst will have nontrivial impacts on firms’
information environment. The merged dataset consists of 372 treated firms and 631
control firms, and spans 1997 to 2010. Table 1 presents the summary statistics prior to
coverage reductions. We find that firm characteristics and various outcome variables are
comparable between the treated firms and the control firms prior to coverage reductions,
suggesting that the matching procedure is reasonable. 3 Later in Section III, we examine
the dynamic effects of the coverage reductions using a regression analysis. We find that
the impacts of coverage reductions are only present post treatment, providing further
support for the parallel trend assumption in the difference-in-differences setting.

B. Hedge Fund Stock Holdings


        Our data of hedge fund stock holdings are constructed following Brunnermeier and
Nagel (2004), Griffin and Xu (2009), and Cao, Chen, Goetzmann, and Liang (2016). The
data are assembled by manually matching the Thomson Reuters 13F institutional
holdings data with a comprehensive list of hedge fund company names. 4 The list of hedge
fund company names comes from the union of six hedge fund databases, namely Lipper
TASS, HFR, CISDM, Bloomberg, Barclay Hedge, and Morningstar. Hedge funds were
exempt from registering with the SEC over our sample period. 5 However, hedge fund


3 The only exception is firm size, which has a mean value of $358 ($290) million for the treated (control)
firms. All of our analyses control for firm size.

4The 13F data cover long positions only, since short positions are not required by the SEC to be disclosed.
To study the impacts of hedge fund short positions on market efficiency surrounding analyst coverage
reductions, we use the aggregate short interest at a proxy. According to Goldman Sachs (2010), 85% of all
equity short positions going through their brokerage house come from hedge funds.

5The Dodd-Frank Act, effective since 2012, requires large hedge fund management companies to register
with the SEC.

                                                    8
management companies managing more than $100 million are required to file quarterly
disclosures of their holdings of stock positions greater than 10,000 shares or $200,000
in market value.


       Since the 13F filings data do not indicate which institutions are hedge fund
companies, we identify hedge fund companies through a three-step procedure. As the first
step, 13F institutions are matched with the list of company names from the six hedge fund
databases. Second, among the matched institutions, we assess whether hedge fund
management is their primary business. We check whether they are registered with the
SEC. Since registration with the SEC is only necessary when conducting non-hedge fund
businesses (e.g., mutual fund management), those institutions unregistered with the SEC
are included as hedge funds in our sample, following Brunnermeier and Nagel (2004).
On the other hand, if a matched institutional investor has registered with the SEC and
thus filed Form ADV, we follow Brunnermeier and Nagel (2004) and Griffin and Xu
(2009) to include it only if the following two criteria are both satisfied: over 50% of its
investment is listed as “other pooled investment vehicle” (private investment companies,
private equity, and hedge funds) or over 50% of its clients are high-net-worth individuals,
and the adviser charges performance-based fees. In the third step, to address the concern
that some hedge fund companies may not report to any database voluntarily, we manually
check the company websites and other online sources for the unmatched 13F institutions
to decide whether they are hedge fund companies. The final sample covers 1,279 hedge
fund management companies over the period 1997-2010.


       For each stock in our sample, we compute its quarterly hedge fund holdings as the
number of shares held by all hedge fund companies at the end of the quarter divided by
the total number of shares outstanding. If the stock is not held by any hedge fund
company, its holdings are set to zero. We define abnormal hedge fund holdings as the
current quarter holdings minus the average holdings in the past four quarters. Although
abnormal hedge fund holdings are correlated with changes in hedge fund ownership from
the one quarter to the next, they better capture quarterly variation in hedge fund trading
activities relative to the trend. For comparison purposes, we also compute the holdings
from other types of institutional investors (including mutual funds, banks, insurance
                                            9
companies, and others). We refer to their stock holdings as non-hedge fund holdings in
our paper.




C. Participation of Buy-Side Analysts in Earnings Conference Calls


          The data of conference call transcripts come from the FD (Fair Disclosure) Wire
database provided by LexisNexis. The sample provides broad coverage for companies
listed in the S&P 1500 index and the Russell 2000 index from 2001 onward. The
conference call transcripts list analysts who ask at least one question during the call,
together with their affiliations. Following Jung, Wong and Zhang (2017), we identify buy-
side analysts by matching the analyst affiliations to the names of institutional investors
in the Thomson Reuters 13F filings. We further categorize buy-side analysts into hedge
fund analysts and non-hedge fund analysts based on the hedge fund names in our hedge
fund holdings data.


D. EDGAR Internet Search Volume


          The SEC assembles information on the web search traffic for EDGAR filings
covering the period from February 2003 onward. 6 Each log entry provides: (1) the IP
address of the requesting user, with the final (fourth) octet of the IP address replaced with
a unique set of three letters, (2) the date and time of the request, (3) the CIK of the
company that filed the request form, and (4) a link to the particular filing. Recent work
(e.g., Drake, Roulstone, and Thornock, 2015) has described this dataset in detail.


          We merge the EDGAR Internet search traffic data with the coverage reduction
data. To test whether investors acquire more information from EDGAR after exogenous
reductions of analyst coverage, we compute the monthly search volume for the treated
firms and the matched control firms two years before and after the reductions of analyst



6   The EDGAR log file data are available from https://www.sec.gov/dera/data/edgar-log-file-data-set.html


                                                    10
coverage. 7 We also compute the search volume for individual types of firm filings,
including 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, insider filings (Forms 3, 4, and 5), and other types of filings.


        To further test whether sophisticated investors are more likely to increase their
information acquisition via EDGAR after the reductions of analyst coverage, we merge
the IP addresses in the EDGAR Internet search traffic data with a geolocation IP database
(IP2LocationTM), which provides geographic information (e.g., country, state, city, zip
code, latitude, and longitude) associated with each IP addresses. Based on the first three
octets of the IP addresses in the SEC data, we match 89% IP addresses (78% of the visits)
to unique latitude/longitude pairs (accurate to 0.1 km × 0.1 km). The latitude and
longitude associated pairs with the matched IP addresses are invariant to the values of
the final (fourth) octets of the IP addresses. For each matched IP address located in the
U.S., we further compute its geographical distance to the nearest hedge fund based on its
latitude/longitude pair and the physical addresses of hedge funds collected from the SEC
13F filings. We sort web visits to the EDGAR server into two groups based on the distance.
For each distance group, we compute the monthly search volume two years before and
after the coverage reductions.


E. Short Interest, Analyst Forecasts, Earnings Guidance, and Other Data Sources


        We also employ short interest data in our analysis since hedge funds routinely hold
short positions in stocks. Short interest data are from the Compustat Short Interest file,
which reports monthly short interest for stocks listed on the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ.
Because the Compustat Short Interest file only started coverage on NASDAQ stocks from
2003, we supplement the Compustat data with the short interest data obtained from the
NASDAQ exchange. Short interest data have been widely used in prior research to
examine the impacts of short selling on stock prices (e.g., Asquith, Pathak, and Ritter,
2005; Diether, Lee, and Werner, 2008).

7 Search requests for the EDGAR data can come from automated webcrawlers rather than human beings.
Following Drake, Roulstone, and Thornock (2015), we filter out automated webcrawlers using two criteria:
(1) no more than five requests per minute per IP address, and (2) no more than 1,000 requests per day per
IP address. We exclude the IP addresses that access more than five filings in a minute or more than 1,000
filings during the day.

                                                   11
           Finally, we also use data from several other standard sources. Stock returns data
are from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). Accounting data are from
Compustat. In addition, analyst forecasts data and earnings guidance data are from
I/B/E/S.


                                                      II.        Main Results
A. The Impacts of Exogenous Reductions of Analyst Coverage on Market Efficiency


           We start our analyses by examining the impacts of coverage reductions on market
efficiency. We use three different measures for market efficiency: post earnings
announcement drift (PEAD), variance ratios (Lo and MacKinlay, 1988), and price
informativeness (Bai, Philippon, and Savov, 2016). All three measures provide coherent
results. We describe the findings with the PEAD measure in this section and present the
results using the other two measures in Section III.


           It is well known that sell-side analysts provide information to stock markets.
Analysts routinely forecast key results of corporate earnings, engage in conference calls,
and interpret the information content of earnings releases. These activities often facilitate
price discovery. Brennan, Jegadeesh, and Swaminathan (1993) find that stocks followed
by more analysts tend to experience faster price adjustment to new information. Zhang
(2008) shows that the magnitude of PEAD reduces significantly when analysts promptly
update their forecasts after earnings releases. We hypothesize that the magnitude of
PEAD will increase after exogenous reductions of analysts. To test this hypothesis, we
perform the following difference-in-differences regression:


𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶_𝑑𝑑1_𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑆𝑆𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                    × 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽4 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽5 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽6 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽7 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                    + 𝛾𝛾 ′ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,


where 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶_𝑑𝑑1_𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 denotes the return drift after quarterly earnings announcements. It is
measured as the cumulative abnormal return from the first day to the nth day after

                                                                       12
earnings announcements, benchmarked by the returns of the corresponding Fama-
French 5×5 size and book-to-market portfolios. 8 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 is the firm fixed effects, and 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 is the
year-month fixed effects. SUE is quarterly standardized unexpected earnings, computed
as the quarter’s actual earnings minus the average of the most recent analyst forecasts,
divided by the standard deviation of those forecasts. 9 Treat is a dummy variable that
equals one for firms that experience exogenous reductions of analyst coverage and zero
otherwise. Post is a dummy variable that equals one for quarters after the reductions of
analyst coverage. In addition, the control variables include natural log of market
capitalization (LnSize), natural log of the book-to-market ratio (LnBEME), natural log of
the debt-to-equity ratio (LnLev), and lagged two-month returns prior to the earnings
announcements (Ret2mPrior). We include earnings announcements two years before
and two years after the reductions of analyst coverage. We condition our analysis on
treated firms with five or fewer analysts prior to the reductions of analyst coverage,
because otherwise the decrease of one out of many analysts would be unlikely to have
material impacts on a firm’s information environment. 10


                                     [Insert Table 2 about here]


        Table 2 presents the results of the difference-in-differences regressioins. As the
coefficient of interest, 𝛽𝛽1 captures the changes of PEAD after exogenous reductions of
analyst coverage. Consistent with our hypothesis, 𝛽𝛽1 is significantly positive across
different specifications of fixed effects, suggesting that the magnitude of PEAD increases
significantly after coverage reductions. According to the regressions (columns 3 and 6)
with both firm fixed effects and year-month fixed effects, the sensitivity to SUE increases

8Our stock return data come from CRSP. In CRSP, return at a given date t is computed based on the close
prices of day t and t-1. For earnings releases that take place in after-hours, we compute the nth day return
after earnings using the (n+1)th day return in CRSP.

9 According to Livnat and Mendenhall (2006), institutional trading reacts more to analyst consensus-based
earnings surprises rather than time series-based earnings surprises. Thus, we compute quarterly SUE
relative to the analyst forecast consensus. However, our inference is unchanged when we use time-series
based earnings surprises (i.e., we use the standard deviation from the time series of earnings surprises as
the denominator to compute SUE). In addition, our results hold when we use lagged stock prices as the
denominator to compute SUE.
10 Our results are robust to other cutoff choices (such as 4 and 6) for the number of analysts prior to the

coverage reductions.

                                                    13
by 0.24 for the PEAD in a two-day window, while the sensitivity to SUE increases by 0.34
for the drift in a four-day window. For one standard deviation change in SUE (4.13 in our
sample), the drop of one analyst leads to 1.0 (0.24 × 4.13) percentage-point additional
drift in the two-day window, and 1.4 (0.34 × 4.13) percentage-point additional drift in the
four-day window. In addition, the impacts of coverage reductions on PEAD are robust in
longer time horizons. As reported in Table IA.1 in the Internet Appendix, after coverage
reductions, we observe a more pronounced PEAD in various time horizons ranging from
one month to one year. These results suggest that analyst coverage reductions causally
lead to impairment of market efficiency.


       To examine whether the increase in PEAD is present for both positive and negative
earnings announcements, we categorize earnings announcements into three groups: top
25% SUE, middle 50% SUE, and bottom 25% SUE. Table IA.2 reports the results. PEAD
increases significantly by 1.50 (1.37) percentage points in the four-day window for the top
(bottom) 25% SUE, whereas it changes by only 0.08 percentage point (statistically
insignificantly) for the middle 50% SUE. These results confirm that, after exogenous
reductions of analyst coverage, PEAD increases for both positive and negative earnings
surprises.


B. Changes of Hedge Fund Holdings and Profitability


       After exogenous reductions of analyst coverage, firms’ information environment
becomes murkier (Kelly and Ljungqvist, 2012). While investors who rely on analysts to
obtain information find it harder to access information, sophisticated investors with
resources and skills to acquire information independently may have greater comparative
advantage over other investors. Thus, we hypothesize that hedge funds, as a group of
sophisticated investors, will trade more aggressively on the affected stocks to exploit the
increased information advantage. To test this hypothesis, we examine the changes of
abnormal hedge fund holdings (i.e., hedge fund holdings in a quarter minus the average
hedge fund holdings of the past four quarters) using the following regression:




                                            14
        𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴_𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                                = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                                + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽4 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽5 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽6 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                                + 𝛽𝛽7 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾 ′ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .


𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴_𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is abnormal hedge fund holdings at the most recent quarter end prior to
quarterly earnings announcements. 11 𝛽𝛽1 , as the coefficient of interest, captures the
changes of the sensitivity of hedge fund holdings to SUE. Since SUE on the right-hand-
side is not public information at the time when 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴_𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is measured, 𝛽𝛽1 represents
the changes of hedge fund holdings that are likely driven by private information acquired
by hedge funds. The other variables are defined in the previous subsection.


                                                 [Insert Table 3 about here]


        As shown in columns (1)–(3) of Table 3, 𝛽𝛽1 is significantly positive, suggesting that
hedge fund holdings become more sensitive to unexpected earnings after coverage
reductions. According to the specification with both firm fixed effects and year-quarter
fixed effects, the sensitivity of abnormal hedge fund holdings to SUE increases by 0.091.
For a one standard deviation increase in SUE (4.13 in our sample), the drop of one analyst
leads to 0.38 (0.091 × 4.13) percentage-point increase in abnormal hedge fund holdings,
which is roughly 1/8 of the standard deviation of abnormal hedge fund holdings. These
results are consistent with the hypothesis that hedge funds trade more aggressively due
to increased information advantage.


        We also examine the changes of abnormal hedge fund holdings for positive,
neutral, and negative earnings announcements. Table IA.3 in the Internet Appendix
presents the results. Abnormal hedge fund holdings prior to positive earnings (top 25%
SUE) increase by 0.62 percentage point after the reductions of analyst coverage, while
abnormal hedge fund holdings prior to negative earnings (bottom 25% SUE) decrease by
0.45 percentage point. The increase of abnormal hedge fund holdings is statistically


 Here, hedge fund holdings are at the aggregate level, as we sum up the holdings of individual hedge funds
11

on the same stocks.

                                                                      15
significant, while the decrease of abnormal hedge fund holdings is not. The relatively
weak result for negative earnings is not surprising because the hedge fund holdings data
only cover long positions. While we can observe hedge funds’ divestiture of their existing
long positions, we do not observe their potential increase of short positions in response
to negative earnings.


       As a comparison with hedge funds, we examine the stock holdings of other types
of institutional investors (such as mutual funds, banks, and insurance companies). Unlike
hedge funds, their holdings of the affected stocks do not appear to be more information-
driven after analyst coverage reductions. Columns (4)–(6) of Table 3 present the results
for the aggregate holdings of non-hedge fund institutions. We find no evidence that these
institutions as a whole exhibit an increase in the sensitivity of their holdings to SUE after
coverage reductions. Specifically, abnormal holdings of non-hedge funds do not increase
(decrease) more prior to positive (negative) earnings after coverage reductions. Table IA.4
in the Internet Appendix further breaks non-hedge fund institutions down to each
individual type. None of them shows a significant change in their trading behavior with
respect to the affected stocks after coverage reductions.


                                [Insert Table 4 about here]


       To better understand the changes of hedge fund trading activities following
coverage reductions, we explore the heterogeneity across the affected stocks and across
the exited analysts. Table 4 reports the results. Hedge funds trade more aggressively on
the affected stocks when such stocks have smaller size, higher idiosyncratic volatility, and
higher bid-ask spreads (see Panel A). These findings are consistent with Griffin and Xu
(2009), who find that hedge funds prefer opaque stocks in which they have larger
information advantage. In addition, as Panel B of Table 4 shows, hedge funds trade more
aggressively on the affected stocks when the exited analysts are of higher quality
(measured by their historical forecast accuracy and years of experience on the affected
stocks) and when the exited analysts have less workload (measured by the number of
stocks they cover right before their exits). These results suggest that hedge funds


                                             16
participate more actively in the affected stocks when there is larger information loss
caused by coverage reductions.


           We further test whether the profitability of hedge funds increases on the affected
stocks after coverage reductions. Since we do not observe individual transactions of hedge
funds, we estimate hedge funds’ profitability based on their aggregate holdings. We infer
the trading direction of hedge funds on a given stock in quarter t based on the change of
their aggregate holdings from quarter t-1 to quarter t. An increase (decrease) of the
holdings implies hedge fund purchases (sales) during quarter t. We then use difference-
in-differences regressions to test the changes of hedge fund profitability after coverage
reductions. The outcome variable is stocks’ abnormal returns from quarter end t to
quarter end t+1 (i.e., three-month holding period), benchmarked by the returns of the
corresponding DGTW portfolios (Daniel, Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers, 1997;
Wermers, 2003). 12


                                       [Insert Table 5 about here]


           Panel A of Table 5 presents the regression results. Column (1) shows the three-
month cumulative abnormal return on the affected stocks following hedge fund purchases
increases by 2.53 percentage points. This increase in profitability is more pronounced
among the stocks with larger hedge fund purchases (colume 2). These results suggest that
hedge funds earn high abnormal returns from the affected stocks after coverage
reductions when they increase their holdings. When hedge funds decrease their holdings,
there is no significant changes in profitability after coverage reductions, probably because
we do not observe hedge funds’ short positions. Our findings are consistent with prior
research showing that hedge funds exploit mispricing and earn risk-adjusted returns (e.g.,
Brown, Goetzmann, and Ibbotson, 1999; Kosowski, Naik, and Teo, 2007; Fung, Hsieh,
Naik, and Ramadorai, 2008; Jagannathan, Malakhov, and Novikov, 2010; Titman and
Tiu, 2011; Agarwal, Jiang, Tang, and Yang, 2013).



12   Our results are robust to other holding periods, such as one month and six months.

                                                      17
       We also examine the changes in the profitability for non-hedge funds (Panel B of
Table 5). When non-hedge funds increase their holdings, the three-month cumulative
abnormal return on the affected stocks increases by 1.1 percentage points but this change
is statistically insignificant. This result suggests that non-hedge funds as a whole benefit
little from the affected stocks after coverage reductions.


C. Information Acquisition of Hedge Funds


       We conjecture that sophisticated investors will scale up their information
acquisition after the reductions of analyst coverage, which leads to more aggressive
trading behavior and higher profitability. In this subsection, we provide direct evidence
on the changes of information acquisition of sophisticated investors. In particular, we
show that, after the coverage reductions, hedge funds participate more actively in
earnings conference calls and they appear to increase web search through the SEC’s
EDGAR database.


C.1 Information Acquisition via Earnings Conference Calls


       Recent studies have shown that buy-side analysts actively participate in earnings
conference calls (Call, Sharp, Shohfi, 2017; Jung, Wong and Zhang, 2017). Moreover,
institutional investors trade a company’s stock more heavily when their buy-side analysts
participate in the conference call of this company (Jung, Wong and Zhang, 2017). Thus,
conference call participation is a potential channel of information acquisition for
institutional investors.


       We examine the changes of the participation of buy-side analysts in conference
calls. We find that hedge funds are more likely to participate in the conference calls (i.e.,
asking at least one question) of the affected stocks following coverage reductions. As Panel
A of Table 6 shows, the probability of hedge fund participation increases significantly by
5.2 percentage points (columns 1–2). This magnitude is economically significant as the
average probability of hedge fund participation is 15.4% in our sample. The results are
similar when we examine the number of hedge fund analysts participating in conference
                                             18
calls (columns 3–4). Buy-side analysts from non-hedge funds, however, exhibit no
significant change in their participation in conference calls (Panel B of Table 6).


                                     [Insert Table 6 about here]


C.2 Information Acquisition via EDGAR Internet Search


        Besides participating in earnings conference calls, investors can acquire
information from other channels. In particular, they can access the SEC’s EDGAR
database that contains mandatory filings from all public firms. 13 Although the EDGAR
filings are publicly available to all investors, sophisticated investors can employ their
information processing skills to form profitable trading strategies based on the
information acquired from EDGAR. 14


        We exploit a novel dataset on Internet search traffic for EDGAR filings, assembled
by the SEC and covering the period from February 2003 onward, to examine the
investors’ information acquisition behavior surrounding the coverage reductions. We find
that the search volume for the filings of the treated firms increases significantly following
the coverage reductions. As shown in Panel A of Table 7, the EDGAR Internet search
volume of the treated firms increases by 11.4% after the drops of analyst coverage,
suggesting that investors as a whole scale up their information acquisition when less
public information is available. We further break down our analysis to different types of
EDGAR filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, insider filings, and others). The increase in web traffic
concentrates on insider filings. These results are consistent with previous studies showing
that analysts communicate with company management and provide processed
information to the public (e.g., Soltes, 2014; Brown, Call, Clement, and Sharp, 2015).




13Domestic public companies were phased in to EDGAR filing over a three-year period, ending May 6, 1996.
Foreign companies are required to file their documents via EDGAR starting from November 4, 2002.

14 In concurrent work, Chen, Cohen, Gurun, Lou, and Malloy (2017) and Crane, Crotty, and Umar (2018)

find that the EDGAR Internet search activities of sophisticated investors are associated with their trading
performance.

                                                    19
After the exits of sell-side analysts, investors pay closer attention to insider filings as a
channel to learn private information from company management.


                                      [Insert Table 7 about here].


        Do sophisticated investors scale up their information acquisition more than other
investors? To shed light on this question, we identify the geographic information (e.g.,
country, state, city, zip code, latitude, and longitude) of the requesting users by merging
the EDGAR log file data with a commercial geolocation IP address database. Although the
last (fourth) octets of the IP addresses are masked in the EDGAR log file, we are able to
match more than 78% of user requests to unique pairs of latitude/longitude using the first
three octets of the IP addresses in the EDGAR log file. The latitude and longitude pairs
associated with the matched IP addresses are invariant to the values of the final (fourth)
octets of the IP addresses. If sophisticated investors are more likely to enhance their
information acquisition following a reduction in the supply of public information, we
expect a larger increase in the search volume from the IP addresses that are more likely
to come from sophisticated investors. To test this prediction, we perform three sets of
analyses, the results of which collectively support our hypothesis.


        First, we run the difference-in-differences regressions separately for each state in
the U.S. We find that the states with highest percentage increase in their search volume
of insider filings are the states with largest presence of sophisticated investors (see Figure
IA.1 in the Internet Appendix). 15


        Next, we compute the distance from the geographic location of each U.S.-based IP
address to its nearest hedge fund. Based on this distance, we separate the IP addresses
into two groups (above and below the median value), and then construct monthly web
search volume for these two groups. Consistent with our hypothesis, the increase in the
EDGAR Internet search volume mainly comes from the IP addresses whose distance to



15The states in the top quintile sorted by the difference-in-differences coefficients are: New York, California,
Texas, Illinois, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Arizona.

                                                      20
the nearest hedge funds is below the median value, as shown in Panels B and C in Table
7.


         Finally, we group the IP addresses based on zip codes and compute the distance
from each zip code to its nearest hedge fund. We then examine the relation between this
distance and the changes of web search volume after coverage reductions, using the
following regression:


 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿(𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧 + 1) = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑧𝑧 + 1) + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                      + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑧𝑧 + 1) + 𝛽𝛽4 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑧𝑧 + 1) + 𝛽𝛽5 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                      × 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑧𝑧 + 1)+ 𝛽𝛽6 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽7 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾 ′ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 + 𝜀𝜀𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧 .

Here, 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧 is the EDGAR Internet search volume for insider filings from zip code z to
firm i in month t. 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑧𝑧 is the distance from zip code z to its nearest hedge fund. As
shown by Table IA.5 in the Internet Appendix, the coefficient 𝛽𝛽2 is positive and
statistically significant, suggesting that investors from the zip codes where at least one
hedge fund locates increase their search volume for insider filings after coverage
reductions. The coefficient 𝛽𝛽1 is negative and statistically significant, suggesting that the
increase in search volume becomes smaller when the zip codes are more distant from
hedge funds. Combining the estimates of 𝛽𝛽1 and 𝛽𝛽2 , we find that the net increase in
Internet search volume for insider filings is indistinguishable from zero if a zip code is 20
kilometers away from its nearest hedge fund.


         Taken together, these results provide evidence that sophisticated investors such as
hedge funds scale up their information acquisition when public information providers
such as sell-side analysts exit the financial market.


D. Impacts of Hedge Funds on Market Efficiency


         We have shown that, after exogenous coverage reductions, hedge funds tend to
trade more aggressively on the affected stocks and earn higher abnormal returns. We now
investigate whether hedge fund activities can in turn facilitate market efficiency. We

                                                                    21
present results from the analyses with PEAD as a measure of market efficiency in this
subsection, and later in Section III we verify our results using variance ratios (Lo and
MacKinlay, 1988) and price informativeness (Bai, Philippon, and Savov, 2016) as
alternative market efficiency measures.


        Using abnormal hedge fund holdings at the nearest quarter end prior to earnings
announcements as a proxy for hedge fund participation, we perform the following
regression to examine the impacts of hedge fund participation on PEAD:


  𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶_𝑑𝑑1_𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝐷𝐷(𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 ++ )𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                      × 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝐷𝐷(𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 ++ )𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽4 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽5 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                      × 𝐷𝐷(𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 ++ )𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽6 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑆𝑆𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽7 𝐷𝐷(𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 ++ )𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                      + 𝛽𝛽8 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽9 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝐷𝐷(𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 ++ )𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽10 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                      + 𝛽𝛽11 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝐷𝐷(𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 ++ )𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽12 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽13 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝐷𝐷(𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 ++ )𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                      + 𝛽𝛽14 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽15 𝐷𝐷(𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 ++ )𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾 ′ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .


Here, 𝐷𝐷(𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 ++ )𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a dummy variable that equals one if the abnormal aggregate hedge
fund holdings for stock i at the nearest quarter end prior to earnings announcements t are
in the top quartile of the abnormal hedge fund holdings among all stocks at that particular
quarter end.


        Table 8 presents the results with 𝛽𝛽1 and 𝛽𝛽2 as the coefficients of interest. The
coefficient 𝛽𝛽2 is positive and statistically significant, suggesting that, in the absence of
high levels of hedge fund participation, the sensitivity of PEAD (measured by 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶_𝑑𝑑1_𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑)
to SUE increases significantly after coverage reductions. Conditional on high levels of
hedge fund participation, however, the increase in the sensitivity of PEAD to SUE
becomes smaller, indicated by the negative and significant coefficient 𝛽𝛽1 . In fact, with
high levels of hedge fund participation, the net changes in the magnitude of PEAD after
coverage reductions are not significantly different from zero. That is, the sum of 𝛽𝛽1 and
𝛽𝛽2 is statistically indistinguishable from zero (see the last row of Table 8). Our findings
suggest that hedge fund participation is able to restore the impaired market efficiency
caused by coverage reductions.


                                                                   22
                               [Insert Table 8 about here].


       We further test the impacts of hedge fund participation on PEAD for positive,
neutral, and negative earnings announcements. Table IA.6 in the Internet Appendix
reports the results. We find that PEAD increases significantly following both positive and
negative earnings announcements in the absence of high levels of hedge fund
participation. With high levels of hedge fund participation, however, the increase in PEAD
disappears following both positive and negative earnings announcements.


       Since our hedge fund data come from 13F filings that only contain long positions
of institutional investors, the analysis so far has only captured high levels of hedge fund
participation through their long positions. To examine the impacts of sophisticated
investors on market efficiency to a more complete extent, we also investigate the role of
short sellers, about 80% of whom are hedge funds (e.g., Goldman Sachs, 2010). We
measure short seller participation around earnings releases using the abnormal short
interest at the nearest quarter end prior to earnings announcements. Similar to hedge
funds, we find that short seller participation also helps to restore the impaired market
efficiency caused by coverage reductions (see Table 9). Our findings are consistent with
previous studies showing that short selling contributes to market efficiency (e.g., Asquith,
Pathak, and Ritter, 2005; Nagel, 2005; Diether, Lee, and Werner, 2008; Boehmer and
Wu, 2012).

                  III. Additional Analyses and Robustness Tests
A. Number of Analysts Prior to Coverage Reductions


       Our analyses so far have focused on firms with five or fewer analysts prior to the
coverage reductions. The rationale is that the reduction of one analyst would have
material impacts on such firms relative to those followed by a large number of analysts
prior to coverage reductions. We provide explicit evidence to support this rationale in this
subsection.
                                            23
                                     [Insert Table 10 about here]


        We first repeat our analysis regarding the impacts of coverage reductions on PEAD
for treated firms with six or more analysts. Panel A of Table 10 presents the results.
Consistent with our rationale, the impacts of coverage reductions on PEAD are
insignificant for treated firms followed by six or more analysts. Next, we test the impacts
of hedge fund participation on PEAD. As shown in Panel B of Table 10, there is no change
in hedge funds’ impacts on PEAD after coverage reductions in treated firms with six or
more analysts. Finally, we examine the impacts of coverage reductions on investors’
information acquisition for treated firms with six or more analysts. As reported in Table
IA.8 in the Internet Appendix, the web traffic to the EDGAR server for such firms shows
no sign of increase after coverage reductions.


B. Alternative Measures of Earnings Surprises


        Following the literature, we have used SUE to proxy for earnings surprises. Hong
and Kacperczyk (2010) find that the optimism biases of analysts, arising from conflicts of
interest, increase after coverage reductions due to reduced peer competition. This effect
could bias the coefficient estimates in some of our previous analyses related to SUE (e.g.,
the coefficient on Treat×Post×SUE), because the quality of SUE as a measure of earnings
surprises can be compromised. 16


        To mitigate this concern, we use the abnormal return on earnings announcement
dates (CAR_d0) as an alternative measure of earnings surprises. By examining the stock
market reactions to analyst recommendations, Agarwal and Chen (2008) show that
marginal investors can rationally discount analysts’ optimism stemming from the



16Note that we obtain similar results (see Tables IA.2, IA.3, IA.6, IA.7 in the Internet Appendix) using the
alternative specifications based on the dummy variables capturing positive, neutral, and negative SUEs (i.e.,
D(SUE++), D(SUE0), and D(SUE--)). These variables only depend on the relative ranking of SUEs and thus
are less likely to be affected by the optimism biases of analysts.


                                                     24
conflicts of interest with investment banking and brokerage businesses. 17 Since the
market reaction to earnings announcements reflects the opinion of marginal investors,
CAR_d0 should be less subject to the optimism biases of analysts and better reflect
earnings surprises. We replace SUE with CAR_d0 and repeat our main analyses, and our
inference is unchanged by using this alternative measure.


       Panel A of Table IA.9 in the Internet Appendix shows that the sensitivity of PEAD
to CAR_d0 increases significantly after coverage reductions. 18 For one standard deviation
change in CAR_d0 (8.32% in our sample), the drift in the two-day post earnings window
increases by 0.77 percentage point while the drift in the four-day post earnings window
increases by 0.84 percentage point. Furthermore, we reexamine the impacts of hedge
fund holdings on PEAD using CAR_d0 to proxy for the unexpected information content.
We again find that high levels of hedge fund participation mitigate the increase of PEAD
significantly after coverage reductions, as reported in Panel B of Table IA.9.


C. Alternative Measures of Market Efficiency


       Besides PEAD, we use two alternative measures of market efficiency: the variance
ratios proposed by Lo and MacKinlay (1988), and the price informativeness measure of
Bai, Philippon, and Savov (2016). Consistent with the results with PEAD reported in
Section II, we find that: (1) the reductions of analyst coverage impair market efficiency;
and (2) high levels of hedge fund participation help to restore the impaired market
efficiency.


                                   [Insert Table 11 about here]




17Malmendier and Shanthikumar (2007) find that large investors can discount the recommendations from
biased analysts affiliated with the underwriters.

18The abnormal return is benchmarked by the portfolio returns of the corresponding Fama-French 5×5 size
and book-to-market portfolios. For an after-hours earnings release, CAR_d0 is the return of the next
trading day in the CRSP data.

                                                  25
        Following Boehmer and Kelley (2009), we use the deviation of variance ratios from
one, |1-VR(n,m)|, as a measure of market efficiency, where VR(n,m) is the ratio of the
quote midpoint return variance over m days to the return variance over n days, both
divided by the number of the days. If prices follow a random walk, the deviation should
be zero. Larger magnitude of this deviation reveals weaker market efficiency. 19 Panel A of
Table 11 shows that |1-VR(n,m)| increases significantly after coverage reductions.
Importantly, this increase is mitigated by high levels of hedge fund participation, as
presented in Panel B of Table 11. Our inference is robust to the choice of time horizons for
measuring variance ratios such as VR(1, 5), VR(1, 10), VR(1, 20), VR(2, 5), VR(2, 10), and
VR(2, 20).


                                    [Insert Table 12 about here]


        As another alternative measure of market efficiency, we employ the price
informativeness measure of Bai, Philippon, and Savov (2016). This measure attempts to
capture the extent to which stock prices predict future cash flows, and it has recently been
used in Farboodi, Matray, and Veldkamp (2017) and Kacperczyk, Sundaresan, and Wang
(2018). Following Kacperczyk, Sundaresan, and Wang (2018), we use a difference-in-
differences regression approach to examine the change in price informativeness in our
setting. Table 12 presents the results. We find that price informativeness decreases
significantly following coverage reductions. This result is both statistically and
economically significant (columns 1–2). Moreover, high levels of hedge fund participation
significantly mitigate the reduction of price informativeness (columns 3–4 in Table 12).


D. Dynamic Effects of Coverage Reductions


        Identification in the difference-in-differences approach builds on the parallel trend
assumption. In this subsection, we validate this assumption by examining the dynamic




19Because both positive and negative deviations of variance ratios from one represent stock price movement
departing from a random walk, we use |1-VR(n,m)| to measure market efficiency.

                                                   26
effects of coverage reductions. We find no evidence of pre-trends, and the observed
dynamic pattern reinforces the regression results.


                               [Insert Figure 1 about here]


       Figure 1 plots the dynamic effects of coverage reductions on the main outcome
variables studied in our paper. The point estimates are obtained from modified
difference-in-differences regressions, in which we replace the Post dummy with a series
of dummy variables that represent different time windows relative to coverage reductions
(see the note of Figure 1 for details). The error bars represent 90% confidence intervals.


       Consistent with the previous regression results, we find that after coverage
reductions, the magnitude of PEAD increases (Panel A) and variance ratio deviates more
from one (Panel B). Hedge funds scale up their information acquisition by participating
more in earnings calls (Panel C) and potentially increasing their web search of the EDGAR
database (Panel D). Hedge funds trade more aggressively (Panel E) and earn higher
abnormal returns on the affected stocks (Panel F). These changes of the outcome variables
all appear to occur right after the reductions of analyst coverage. Importantly, there is no
sign of pre-trends prior to coverage reductions.


E. Testing Alternative Explanations for the Impacts of Hedge Funds on Market
Efficiency


       We have shown that hedge fund participation after coverage reductions helps to
restore the impaired market efficiency. In our setting, coverage reductions exogenously
shock the information environment, which allows us to study the relation between
information environment and the activities of sophisticated investors in a causal
framework. Because coverage reductions do not shock hedge fund activities directly, we
cannot claim a causal relation between hedge fund activities and the changes of market
efficiency. However, as discussed below, typical endogeneity concerns such as reverse
causality and omitted variables have a limited role in explaining our findings.


                                            27
        One might argue that a reverse causality may explain the relation between hedge
fund participation and the improvement of market efficiency. That is, improved market
efficiency attracts hedge funds to participate. However, as shown previously in our Table
4 and Griffin and Xu (2009), hedge funds actually prefer more opaque stocks (e.g., those
with small firm size, high idiosyncratic volatility, and large bid-ask spreads), plausibly
because they can enjoy greater information advantage. Thus, this finding is at odds with
the reverse causality argument.


        Next, could omitted variables explain the documented relation? We find that hedge
fund participation is associated with greater improvement of market efficiency of the
treated stocks relative to the control stocks after coverage reductions. Thus, for any
omitted variable to explain this finding, it needs to be affected by the coverage reductions
as well. Otherwise, it would not generate a difference between the treated and control
firms in terms of the relation between hedge fund participation and market efficiency. 20
Below we discuss two possible omitted variables that can be potentially affected by
coverage reductions. We show that they do not appear to explain our results.


        The first omitted variable we consider is the participation of activist hedge funds.
It is possible that after coverage reductions, activist hedge funds deem themselves able to
add greater value to the affected firms whose information environment has become
murkier. 21 It is well known that activist hedge funds can improve the productivity and
operating efficiency of the target firms (e.g., Brav, Jiang, Partnoy, and Thomas, 2008;
Bebchuk, Brav, and Jiang, 2015; Brav, Jiang, and Kim, 2015). Thus, their positive impacts
on firm operation may lead to improvement of market efficiency for the target firms. To



20For example, a stock’s membership status to the S&P 500 index can be an omitted variable that affects
both hedge fund participation and market efficiency simultaneously. Suppose that reductions of analyst
coverage do not affect the index membership status, and then this omitted variable cannot explain the
difference between the treated and control firms in terms of the relation between hedge fund participation
and market efficiency.

21 Chen, Harford, and Lin (2015) find that corporate governance deteriorates after exogenous reductions of

analyst coverage. Since activist hedge funds can add value through improving corporate governance of the
target firms (e.g., Brav, Jiang, Partnoy, and Thomas, 2008), it is possible that activist hedge funds may
target more at the affected stocks after coverage reductions.


                                                   28
test this possibility, we exclude observations from treated firms that are target firms of
activist hedge funds two years before and two years after the coverage reductions, as well
as observations from the matched control firms. 22 As shown in columns (1)–(2) of Table
IA.10 in the Internet Appendix, hedge fund participation still mitigates the increase in
PEAD even when we focus on the subsample in which the treated firms are not target
firms of activist hedge funds. This finding perhaps is not surprising, given that activist
hedge funds contribute to a relatively small fraction of total hedge fund stock holdings. 23


          The second omitted variable is firm’s voluntary disclosure. Balakrishnan, Billings,
Kelly, and Ljungqvist (2014) show that firms provide more timely and informative
earnings guidance after exogenous reductions of analyst coverage. They find that this
effect is mainly driven by firms with a history of providing earnings guidance (“guiders”).
On the other hand, firms with no history of providing earnings guidance (“non-guiders”)
do not change their voluntary disclosure behavior. If hedge funds selectively trade stocks
with earnings guidance, the documented relation between hedge fund participation and
the improvement of market efficiency can possibly be explained by voluntary disclosure.
To test this possibility, we exclude observations from treated firms with a history of
providing earnings guidance, as well as the observations from the matched control firms.
As shown in columns 3–4 of Table IA.10, our inference holds in the subsample of the non-
guiders, suggesting that voluntary disclosure is unlikely to fully explain our results.


                                             IV. Conclusion
          We exploit closures of brokerage firms as an exogenous shock to information
environment, to examine how sophisticated investors change their trading behavior on
the affected stocks and how these changes in turn affect market efficiency. After coverage
reductions, market efficiency is impaired, measured by post earnings announcement drift
(PEAD), variance ratios, and price informativeness. Meanwhile, hedge funds enhance




22   We are grateful to Alon Brav for sharing the data on hedge fund activism.

23According to HFR’s Hedge Fund Industry Report (2016), the total global assets under management of
hedge funds is approximately $3.02 trillion, among which activist hedge funds account for 4.01%.

                                                      29
information acquisition and trade aggressively on the affected stocks. Importantly, high
levels of hedge fund participation help to restore the impaired market efficiency.


       Our findings have important policy implications. We document a substitution
effect between sophisticated investors and public information providers in facilitating
market efficiency. Therefore, when considering new policies shaping information
environment, policy makers should take into account the substitution among information
providers with different incentives and comparative advantage. One example relates to
the recent reform of MiFID II in the EU. Future research could explore potential
externalities associated with private information acquisition to investigate the welfare
implications.

                                   Figure 1. Dynamic Effects of Coverage Reductions
This figure plots the dynamic effects of coverage reductions on the main outcome variables of this paper. We
consider a four-year window, spanning from two years before and two years after the reductions of analyst coverage.
The error bars represent 90% confidence intervals. The plotted point estimates 𝜷𝜷𝟏𝟏,𝒌𝒌 come from modified difference-
in-differences regressions, in which we replace the Post dummy with a series of dummy variables 𝐷𝐷𝑘𝑘 , where 𝐷𝐷1 , 𝐷𝐷2 ,
𝐷𝐷3 , 𝐷𝐷4 , 𝐷𝐷5 , 𝐷𝐷6 , and 𝐷𝐷7 represent observations in [-1.5 years, 1 year), [1 year, 0.5 year), [0.5 years, 0 year), [0 year,
0.5 year), [0.5 year, 1 year), [1 year, 1.5 years) and [1.5 years, 2 years] relative to coverage reductions, respectively.
The omitted time window [-2 years, 1.5 years) serves as the baseline. The regressions used to estimate 𝜷𝜷𝟏𝟏,𝒌𝒌 are listed
below. We control for both firm fixed effects and time fixed effects. Standard errors are double clustered at both the
firm and time levels.

This table presents summary statistics for both the treated group and the matched control group. Summary statistics
are calculated at the firm-quarter level using observations in the two-year period prior to the reductions of analyst
coverage. The treated firms are firms that experience closure and merger-related reductions of analyst coverage. Each
treated firm is matched with up to five control firms in the same Fama-French 48 industry, Fama-French size and
book-to-market quintiles. If more than five candidate firms exist, those with the closest bid-ask spreads before the
reductions of analyst coverage are chosen. SUE is quarterly standardized unexpected earnings, computed as the
quarter’s actual earnings minus the average of the most recent analyst forecasts, divided by the standard deviation of
those forecasts. CAR_d0 is the abnormal return (in percent) on the dates of earnings announcements, benchmarked
by the returns of the corresponding Fama-French 5×5 size and book-to-market portfolios. CAR_d1_dn is the
cumulative abnormal return (in percent) from the first day to the nth day after earnings announcements, benchmarked
by the returns of the corresponding Fama-French 5×5 size and book-to-market portfolios. Ab_HF is the abnormal
aggregate hedge fund holdings (in percent of shares outstanding) at the nearest quarter end prior to earnings
announcements, computed as hedge fund holdings at the current quarter minus the average hedge fund holdings of the
past four quarters. Ab_NonHF is the abnormal aggregate non-hedge fund holdings (in percent of shares outstanding)
at the nearest quarter end prior to earnings announcements, computed as non-hedge fund holdings at the current quarter
minus the average non-hedge fund holdings of the past four quarters. Ab_Short is the abnormal short interest (in
percent of shares outstanding) at the nearest quarter end prior to earnings announcements, computed as short interest
at the current quarter minus the average short interest of the past four quarters. LnSize is the natural log of market
capitalization (in $millions) in year t-1; LnBEME is the natural log of book-to-market ratio in year t-1; LnLev is the
natural log of debt-to-equity ratio in year t-1; Ret2mPrior is the two-month cumulative raw returns (in percent) prior
to earnings announcements. The treated firms are limited to firms that have five or fewer analysts covering the firm
prior to coverage reductions. p-value compares the mean value between the treated group and the control group. The
data span 1997 to 2010.

variable that equals one for earnings announcements that happen after the reductions of analyst coverage. SUE is
quarterly standardized unexpected earnings, computed as the quarter’s actual earnings minus the average of the most
recent analyst forecasts, divided by the standard deviation of those forecasts. Control variables include LnSize,
LnBEME, LnLev, and Ret2mPrior, which are defined in Table 1. Standard errors, included in brackets, are double
clustered at both the firm and quarter levels. The treated firms are limited to firms that have five or fewer analysts
covering the firm before coverage reductions. The data cover earnings announcements two years before and after the

This table evaluates changes in the abnormal stock holdings of hedge funds and non-hedge funds after the reductions
of analyst coverage. The dependent variable 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴_𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the level of abnormal hedge fund holdings (or non-
hedge fund holdings) at the nearest quarter end prior to the quarterly earnings announcements (in percent of shares
outstanding). Abnormal hedge fund holdings (or non-hedge fund holdings) at any given quarter are computed as hedge
fund holdings (or non-hedge fund holdings) at the current quarter minus the average hedge fund holdings (or non-
hedge fund holdings) of the past four quarters. Treat is a dummy variable that equals one for observations from treated
firms. Post is a dummy variable that equals one for observations after the reductions of analyst coverage. SUE is
quarterly standardized unexpected earnings, computed as the quarter’s actual earnings minus the average of the most
recent analyst forecasts, divided by the standard deviation of those forecasts. Control variables include LnSize,

 Table 4 Heterogeneity in the Changes of Hedge Fund Holdings after Coverage Reductions
This table evaluates the heterogeneity in the changes of hedge fund holdings after the reductions of analyst coverage.
In Panel A, we split the sample into two groups based on the affected stocks’ firm size, idiosyncratic volatility, and
bid-ask spread prior to coverage reductions. In Panel B, we split the sample into two groups based on the exited
analysts’ historical forecast errors on the affected stocks, their years of experience covering the affected stocks, and
the amount of workload measured by the number of stocks they cover prior to their exits. The dependent variable
𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴_𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the level of abnormal hedge fund holdings (in percent of shares outstanding) at the nearest quarter
end prior to the quarterly earnings announcements. Abnormal hedge fund holdings at any given quarter are computed
as hedge fund holdings at the current quarter minus the average hedge fund holdings of the past four quarters. Treat
is a dummy variable that equals one for observations from treated firms. Post is a dummy variable that equals one for
observations after the reductions of analyst coverage. SUE is quarterly standardized unexpected earnings, computed
as the quarter’s actual earnings minus the average of the most recent analyst forecasts, divided by the standard
deviation of those forecasts. Control variables include LnSize, LnBEME, and LnLev, which are defined in Table 1, as
well as Ret2mPrior which is the two-month cumulative raw return (in percent) prior to each quarter. Standard errors,
included in brackets, are double clustered at both the firm and quarter levels. The treated firms are limited to firms
that have five or fewer analysts covering the firm before coverage reductions. The data cover earnings announcements
two years before and after the reductions of analyst coverage over the period 1997–2010. *, **, and *** indicate
statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels.

                                   Table 5 Profitability of Hedge Funds
This table evaluates changes in the profitability of hedge funds (also non-hedge funds). The dependent variable is
stocks’ abnormal return (in percent) from quarter end t to quarter end t+1, benchmarked by the corresponding DGTW
portfolios. Treat is a dummy variable that equals one for observations from treated firms. Post is a dummy variable
that equals one for observations after the reductions of analyst coverage. Control variables include LnSize, LnBEME,
and LnLev, which are defined in Table 1, as well as Ret2mPrior which is the two-month cumulative raw return (in
percent) prior to each quarter. Standard errors, included in brackets, are double clustered at both the firm and quarter
levels. The treated firms are limited to firms that have five or fewer analysts covering the firm before coverage
reductions. The data cover earnings announcements two years before and after the reductions of analyst coverage over
the period 1997–2010. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels.

            Table 6 Participation of Buy-Side Analysts in Earnings Conference Calls
This table evaluates changes in the participation of buy-side analysts from hedge funds (also non-hedge funds) in
earnings conference calls. Hedge Fund Participation is a dummy variable that equals one if at least one buy-side
analyst from hedge funds asks at least one question during the conference call. Non-Hedge Fund Participation is a
dummy variable that equals one if at least one buy-side analyst from non-hedge funds asks at least one question during
the conference call. # of Hedge Fund Analysts is the number of buy-side analysts from hedge funds who ask at least
one question during the conference call. # of Non-Hedge Fund Analysts is the number of buy-side analysts from non-
hedge funds who ask at least one question during the conference call. Treat is a dummy variable that equals one for
the conference calls of treated firms. Post is a dummy variable that equals one if the conference call is held after the
reductions of analyst coverage. Control variables include LnSize, LnBEME, and LnLev, which are defined in Table 1,
as well as Ret2mPrior which is the two-month cumulative raw return (in percent) prior to each conference call.
Standard errors, included in brackets, are double clustered at both the firm and quarter levels. The treated firms are

                                        Table 7 Information Acquisition via EDGAR
This table evaluates changes in the EDGAR Internet search volume after the reductions of analyst coverage. The SEC
has maintained a database that tracks web visits to EDGAR since February 2003. In Panel A, the dependent variable
is the natural log of the monthly EDGAR Internet search volume (ESV) for the filings of firm i in month t. Column
(1) includes user requests for all types of EDGAR filings. Columns (2)–(6) include user requests for 10-K, 10-Q, 8-
K, insider filings (Forms 3, 4, and 5), and other types of filings, respectively. The SEC also records the IP addresses
of the requesting users, with the final (fourth) octet of the IP addresses replaced with a unique set of three letters. We
map IP addresses to geolocation information including latitude and longitude. Based on the first three octets of the IP
addresses in the SEC data, we match 89% of IP addresses (78% of the total visits) to unique latitude/longitude pairs.
The latitude and longitude pairs associated with the matched IP addresses are invariant to the values of the final octet
of the IP addresses. For each matched IP address, we then compute its geographical distance to the nearest hedge fund
based on its latitude/longitude and the physical addresses of hedge funds collected from 13F filings. We sort the web
visits to two groups based on the distance. In Panel B, we construct a monthly EDGAR Internet search volume dataset
based on the user requests from U.S. IP addresses whose distance to the nearest hedge fund is shorter than the median
distance. In Panel C, we construct a monthly EDGAR Internet search volume dataset based on the user requests from
U.S. IP addresses whose distance to the nearest hedge fund is longer than the median distance. The panel data used
for the difference-in-differences regressions cover monthly EDGAR Internet search volume for the treated firms and
the matched control firms two years before and after the reductions of analyst coverage. Treat is a dummy variable
that equals one for observations from treated firms. Post is a dummy variable that equals one for observations after
the reductions of analyst coverage. Control variables include LnSize, LnBEME, and LnLev, which are defined in Table
1, as well as Ret2mPrior which is the two-month cumulative raw return (in percent) prior to each month. Standard
errors, included in brackets, are double clustered at both the firm and month levels. The treated firms are limited to
firms that have five or fewer analysts covering the firm before coverage reductions. The sample period is from
February 2003 to December 2010. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels.

                           Table 8 Impacts of Hedge Fund Participation on PEAD
This table evaluates the impacts of hedge fund participation on the magnitude of PEAD after the reductions of analyst
coverage. The dependent variable 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶_𝑑𝑑1_𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the cumulative abnormal return (in percent) from the first day to
the nth day after earnings announcements, benchmarked by the returns of the corresponding Fama-French 5×5 size
and book-to-market portfolios. Treat is a dummy variable that equals one for earnings announcements from treated
firms. Post is a dummy variable that equals one if the earnings announcements happen after the reductions of analyst
coverage. D(HF++) is a dummy variable that equals one if the abnormal aggregate hedge fund holdings at the nearest
quarter end prior to earnings announcements are in the top quartile of the abnormal hedge fund holdings at that quarter.
Abnormal hedge fund holdings at any given quarter are computed as hedge fund holdings at the current quarter minus
the average hedge fund holdings of the past four quarters. SUE is quarterly standardized unexpected earnings,
computed as the quarter’s actual earnings minus the average of the most recent analyst forecasts, divided by the
standard deviation of those forecasts. Control variables include LnSize, LnBEME, LnLev, and Ret2mPrior, which are
defined in Table 1. Standard errors, included in brackets, are double clustered at both the firm and quarter levels. The
treated firms are limited to firms that have five or fewer analysts covering the firm before coverage reductions. The
data cover earnings announcements two years before and after the reductions of analyst coverage over the period
1997–2010. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels.

                         Table 9 Impacts of Short Seller Participation on PEAD
This table evaluates the impacts of short seller participation on the magnitude of PEAD after the reductions of analyst
coverage. The dependent variable 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶_𝑑𝑑1_𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the cumulative abnormal return (in percent) from the first day to the nth
day after earnings announcements, benchmarked by the returns of the corresponding Fama-French 5×5 size and book-to-
market portfolios. Treat is a dummy variable that equals one for earnings announcements from treated firms. Post is a
dummy variable that equals one if the earnings announcements happen after the reductions of analyst coverage. D(SI++) is a
dummy variable that equals one if the abnormal short interest at the nearest quarter end prior to earnings announcements is
in the top quartile of the abnormal short interest at that quarter. Abnormal short interest at any given quarter is computed as
short interest at the current quarter minus the average short interest of the past four quarters. SUE is quarterly standardized
unexpected earnings, computed as the quarter’s actual earnings minus the average of the most recent analyst forecasts,
divided by the standard deviation of those forecasts. Control variables include LnSize, LnBEME, LnLev, and Ret2mPrior,
which are defined in Table 1. Standard errors, included in brackets, are double clustered at both the firm and quarter levels.
The treated firms are limited to firms that have five or fewer analysts covering the firm before coverage reductions. The data
cover earnings announcements two years before and after the reductions of analyst coverage over the period 1997–2010. *,

                     Table 10 Number of Analysts Prior to Coverage Reductions
This table evaluates the role of the number of analysts prior to coverage reductions. Panel A examines changes in the
magnitude of PEAD after the reductions of analyst coverage. Panel B examines the impacts of hedge fund participation
on the magnitude of PEAD after the reductions of analyst coverage. The dependent variable 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶_𝑑𝑑1_𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the
cumulative abnormal return (in percent) from the first day to the nth day after earnings announcements, benchmarked
by the returns of the corresponding Fama-French 5×5 size and book-to-market portfolios. Treat is a dummy variable
that equals one for earnings announcements from treated firms. Post is a dummy variable that equals one if the earnings
announcements happen after the reductions of analyst coverage. D(HF++) is a dummy variable that equals one if the
abnormal aggregate hedge fund holdings at the nearest quarter end prior to earnings announcements are in the top
quartile of the abnormal hedge fund holdings at that quarter. Abnormal hedge fund holdings at any given quarter are
computed as hedge fund holdings at the current quarter minus the average hedge fund holdings of the past four quarters.
SUE is quarterly standardized unexpected earnings, computed as the quarter’s actual earnings minus the average of
the most recent analyst forecasts, divided by the standard deviation of those forecasts. Control variables include LnSize,
LnBEME, LnLev, and Ret2mPrior, which are defined in Table 1. Standard errors, included in brackets, are double
clustered at both the firm and the quarter levels. The data cover earnings announcements two years before and after
the reductions of analyst coverage over the period 1997–2010. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the

                    Table 11 Market Efficiency Measures Based on Variance Ratios
  This table evaluates market efficiency using variance ratios. Panel A evaluates changes in market efficiency after the
  reductions of analyst coverage. Panel B evaluates the impacts of hedge fund participation on market efficiency after
  coverage reductions. VR(n,m) is the ratio of the quote midpoint return variance over m days to the return variance over
  n days, both divided by the number of days. We compute quarterly variance ratios two years before and after the
  reductions of analyst coverage. We sample quote midpoint returns at the appropriate frequencies over a given quarter
  and compute the variance using overlapping observations. For example, to compute the variance of 20-day returns
  over a quarter with 63 trading days, we use the 44 returns that are based entirely on days within this quarter. Treat is
  a dummy variable that equals one for observations from treated firms. Post is a dummy variable that equals one for
  quarters after coverage reductions. D(HF++) is a dummy variable that equals one if the abnormal aggregate hedge fund
  holdings at the prior quarter end are in the top quartile of the abnormal hedge fund holdings at that quarter. Control
  variables include LnSize, LnBEME, and LnLev, which are defined in Table 1, as well as Ret2mPrior which is the two-
  month cumulative raw returns (in percent) prior to each quarter. Standard errors, included in brackets, are double
  clustered at both the firm and quarter levels. The data sample spans 1997 to 2010. *, **, and *** indicate statistical
  significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels.

This table evaluates market efficiency using the price informativeness measure of Bai, Philippon, and Savov (2016).
Columns (1)–(2) examine changes in price informativeness after the reductions of analyst coverage. Columns (3)–(4)
examine the impacts of hedge fund participation on price informativeness. Ei,t+1 /Ai,t is the ratio between EBIT of firm
i at year t+1 and total asset at year t. log(Mi,t /Ai,t) is the natural log of the ratio between market capitalization and total
asset. Treat is a dummy variable that equals one for observations from treated firms. Post is a dummy variable that
equals one for observations after coverage reductions. D(HF++) is a dummy variable that equals one if the abnormal
aggregate hedge fund holdings in a given year are in the top quartile of the abnormal hedge fund holdings of that year.
Control variables include LnSize, LnBEME, and LnLev, which are defined in Table 1, as well as Ret2mPrior which is
the two-month cumulative raw return (in percent) prior to each year. Standard errors, included in brackets, are double
clustered at both the firm and year levels. The sample of this table covers observations two years before and after the
reductions of analyst coverage and spans 1997 to 2010. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%,
and 1% levels.

We use the following difference-in-differences regression to evaluate changes in the EDGAR Internet search volume
for insider filings after the reductions of analyst coverage.

           𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿(𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 1) = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 + 𝜷𝜷𝟏𝟏 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾 ′ 𝐶𝐶𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

The regression is performed separately for each state. This figure plots the quintiles of the state-level difference-in-
differences coefficients. The dependent variable in the difference-in-differences regressions is the natural log of
monthly EDGAR Internet search volume (ESV) for insider filings (Forms 3, 4, and 5) of firm i in month t. The panel
data used for the difference-in-differences regressions cover monthly EDGAR Internet search volume for the treated
firms and the matched control firms two years before and after the reductions of analyst coverage. Control variables
include LnSize, LnBEME, and LnLev, which are defined in Table 1, as well as Ret2mPrior which is the two-month
cumulative raw returns (in percent) prior to each month. The treated firms are limited to firms that have five or fewer
analysts covering the firm before coverage reductions. The sample period is from February 2003 to December 2010.

                                                PEAD with Various Time Horizons
This table evaluates changes in the magnitude of PEAD with various time horizons after the reductions of analyst
coverage. The dependent variable 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶_𝑑𝑑1_𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the cumulative abnormal return (in percent) from the first day to
the end of Nth month after earnings announcements, benchmarked by the returns of the corresponding Fama-French
5×5 size and book-to-market portfolios. Treat is a dummy variable that equals one for earnings announcements from
treated firms. Post is a dummy variable that equals one for earnings announcements that happen after the reductions
of analyst coverage. SUE is quarterly standardized unexpected earnings, computed as the quarter’s actual earnings
minus the average of the most recent analyst forecasts, divided by the standard deviation of those forecasts. Control
variables include LnSize, LnBEME, LnLev, and Ret2mPrior, which are defined in Table 1. Standard errors, included
in brackets, are double clustered at both the firm and quarter levels. The treated firms are limited to firms that have
five or fewer analysts covering the firm before coverage reductions. The data cover earnings announcements two years
before and after the reductions of analyst coverage over the period 1997–2010. *, **, and *** indicate statistical
significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels.

 Hedge Fund Holdings prior to Earnings Announcements: Positive and Negative Earnings
                                   Announcements
This table evaluates changes in the abnormal holdings of hedge funds (also non-hedge funds) after the reductions of
analyst coverage. The dependent variable 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴_𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the level of abnormal hedge fund holdings (or non-hedge
fund holdings) at the nearest quarter end prior to the quarterly earnings announcements (in percent of shares
outstanding). Abnormal hedge fund holdings (or non-hedge fund holdings) at any given quarter are computed as hedge
fund holdings (or non-hedge fund holdings) at the current quarter minus the average hedge fund holdings (or non-
hedge fund holdings) of the past four quarters. Treat is a dummy variable that equals one for earnings announcements
from treated firms. Post is a dummy variable that equals one if the earnings announcements happen after the reductions
of analyst coverage. SUE is quarterly standardized unexpected earnings, computed as the quarter’s actual earnings
minus the average of the most recent analyst forecasts, divided by the standard deviation of those forecasts. D(SUE++),
D(SUE0), and D(SUE--) are three dummy variables that equal one for earnings announcements with top 25% SUE,
middle 50% SUE, and bottom 25% SUE, respectively. Control variables include LnSize, LnBEME, and LnLev, which
are defined in Table 1, as well as Ret2mPrior which is the two-month (day -42 to day -1) cumulative raw return (in
percent) prior to each quarter end. Standard errors, included in brackets, are double clustered at both the firm and
quarter levels. The treated firms are limited to firms that have five or fewer analysts covering the firm before coverage
reductions. The data cover earnings announcements two years before and after the reductions of analyst coverage over
the period 1997–2010. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels.

  Non-Hedge Fund Holdings prior to Earnings Announcements: Breakdown Analyses by
                                  Institution Types
This table evaluates changes in the abnormal holdings of different types of non-hedge funds after the reductions of
analyst coverage. The dependent variables are the levels of abnormal holdings of different types of non-hedge funds
at the nearest quarter end prior to the quarterly earnings announcements (in percent of shares outstanding). Abnormal
holdings of a given type of non-hedge fund institutions at any given quarter are computed as the holdings of this type
of non-hedge fund institutions at the current quarter minus the average holdings of this type of non-hedge fund
institutions in the past four quarters. Treat is a dummy variable that equals one for observations from treated firms.
Post is a dummy variable that equals one for observations after the reductions of analyst coverage. SUE is quarterly
standardized unexpected earnings, computed as the quarter’s actual earnings minus the average of the most recent
analyst forecasts, divided by the standard deviation of those forecasts. Control variables include LnSize, LnBEME,
and LnLev, which are defined in Table 1, as well as Ret2mPrior which is the two-month cumulative raw returns (in
percent) prior to each quarter. Standard errors, included in brackets, are double clustered at both the firm and quarter
levels. The treated firms are limited to firms that have five or fewer analysts covering the firm before coverage
reductions. The data cover earnings announcements two years before and after the reductions of analyst coverage over
the period 1997–2010. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels.

 Information Acquisition via EDGAR: Distance to Hedge Funds Measured at the Zip Code
                                        Level
This table evaluates changes in the EDGAR Internet search volume for insider filings after the reductions of analyst coverage. The
SEC has maintained a database that tracks web visits to EDGAR since February 2003. It also records the IP addresses of the
requesting users, with the final (fourth) octet of the IP addresses replaced with a unique set of three letters. Based on the first three
octets of the IP addresses in the SEC data, we match 90% of IP addresses (80% of the total visits) to unique zip codes. The zip
codes associated with the matched IP addresses are invariant to the values of the final octet of the IP addresses. For each matched
IP address, we compute its geographical distance to the nearest hedge fund based on the latitude/longitude of the zip codes and the
physical addresses of hedge funds collected from 13F SEC filings. The dependent variable is the natural log of the monthly EDGAR
Internet search volume (ESV) for the insider filings of firm i in month t from zip code z. The data used for the difference-in-
differences regressions cover monthly EDGAR Internet search volume for the treated firms and the matched control firms two
years before and after the reductions of analyst coverage. We rank all zip codes in the U.S. based on the web traffic volume of each
zip code to the SEC EDGAR database. Columns (1)–(6) include ESV from top 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, and 500 zip codes, respectively.
The observations are weighted based on the web traffic volume of the corresponding zip codes. If zip code z has zero visit to firm
i throughout the sample period, we exclude the observations from zip code z to firm i from the sample. Treat is a dummy variable
that equals one for observations from treated firms. Post is a dummy variable that equals one for observations after the reductions
of analyst coverage. Control variables include LnSize, LnBEME, and LnLev, which are defined in Table 1, as well as Ret2mPrior
which is the two-month cumulative raw returns (in percent) prior to each month. Standard errors, included in brackets, are double
clustered at both the firm and month levels. The treated firms are limited to firms that have five or fewer analysts covering the firm
before coverage reductions. The sample period is from February 2003 to December 2010. *, **, and *** indicate statistical
significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels.

      Impacts of Hedge Funds on PEAD: Positive and Negative Earnings Announcements
This table evaluates the impacts of hedge fund participation on the magnitude of PEAD after the reductions of analyst
coverage. The dependent variable 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶_𝑑𝑑1_𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the cumulative abnormal return (in percent) from the first day to
the nth day after earnings announcements, benchmarked by the returns of the corresponding Fama-French 5×5 size
and book-to-market portfolios. Treat is a dummy variable that equals one for earnings announcements from treated
firms. Post is a dummy variable that equals one if earnings announcements happen after the reductions of analyst
coverage. D(HF++) is a dummy variable that equals one if the abnormal aggregate hedge fund holdings at the nearest
quarter end prior to earnings announcements are in the top quartile of the abnormal hedge fund holdings at that quarter.
Abnormal hedge fund holdings at any given quarter are computed as hedge fund holdings at the current quarter minus
the average hedge fund holdings of the past four quarters. SUE is quarterly standardized unexpected earnings,
computed as the quarter’s actual earnings minus the average of the most recent analyst forecasts, divided by the
standard deviation of those forecasts. D(SUE++), D(SUE0), and D(SUE--) are three dummy variables that equal one for
earnings announcements with top 25% SUE, middle 50% SUE, and bottom 25% SUE, respectively. Control variables
include LnSize, LnBEME, LnLev, and Ret2mPrior, which are defined in Table 1. Standard errors, included in brackets,
are double clustered at both the firm and quarter levels. The treated firms are limited to firms that have five or fewer
analysts covering the firm before coverage reductions. The data cover earnings announcements two years before and
after the reductions of analyst coverage over the period 1997–2010. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at
the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels.

       Impacts of Short Sellers on PEAD: Positive and Negative Earnings Announcements
This table evaluates the impacts of short seller participation on the magnitude of PEAD after the reductions of analyst
coverage. The dependent variable 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶_𝑑𝑑1_𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the cumulative abnormal return (in percent) from the first day to the nth
day after earnings announcements, benchmarked by the returns of the corresponding Fama-French 5×5 size and book-to-
market portfolios. Treat is a dummy variable that equals one for earnings announcements from treated firms. Post is a
dummy variable that equals one if earnings announcements happen after the reductions of analyst coverage. D(SI++) is a
dummy variable that equals one if the abnormal short interest at the nearest quarter end prior to earnings announcements is
in the top quartile of the abnormal short interest at that quarter. Abnormal short interest at any given quarter is computed as
short interest at the current quarter minus the average short interest of the past four quarters. SUE is quarterly standardized
unexpected earnings, computed as the quarter’s actual earnings minus the average of the most recent analyst forecasts,
divided by the standard deviation of those forecasts. D(SUE++), D(SUE0), and D(SUE--) are three dummy variables that
equal one for earnings announcements with top 25% SUE, middle 50% SUE, and bottom 25% SUE, respectively.
Control variables include LnSize, LnBEME, LnLev, and Ret2mPrior, which are defined in Table 1. Standard errors, included
in brackets, are double clustered at both the firm and quarter levels. The treated firms are limited to firms that have five or
fewer analysts covering the firm before coverage reductions. The data cover earnings announcements two years before and
after the reductions of analyst coverage over the period 1997–2010. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the
10%, 5%, and 1% levels.

  Information Acquisition via EDGAR: Treated Firms with Six or More Analysts prior to
                                 Coverage Reductions
This table evaluates changes in the EDGAR Internet search volume after the reductions of analyst coverage, when
treated firms have six or more analysts covering the firm before coverage reductions. The dependent variable is the
natural log of the monthly EDGAR Internet search volume (ESV) for the filings of firm i in month t. Column (1)
includes user requests for all types of EDGAR filings. Columns (2)–(6) include user requests for 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K,
insider filings (Forms 3, 4, and 5), and other types of filings, respectively. The panel data used for the difference-in-
differences regressions cover monthly EDGAR Internet search volume for the treated firms and the matched control
firms two years before and after the reductions of analyst coverage. Treat is a dummy variable that equals one for
observations from treated firms. Post is a dummy variable that equals one for observations after the reductions of
analyst coverage. Control variables include LnSize, LnBEME, and LnLev, which are defined in Table 1, as well as
Ret2mPrior which is the two-month cumulative raw returns (in percent) prior to each month. Standard errors, included
in brackets, are double clustered at both the firm and month levels. The treated firms are limited to firms that have
five or fewer analysts covering the firm before coverage reductions. The sample period is from February 2003 to
December 2010. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels.

                      Alternative Measures of Earnings Surprises in the PEAD Analyses
Panel A of this table evaluates changes in the magnitude of PEAD after the reductions of analyst coverage. Panel B
evaluates the impacts of hedge funds on the magnitude of PEAD after the reductions of analyst coverage. The
dependent variable 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶_𝑑𝑑1_𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the cumulative abnormal return (in percent) from the first day to the nth day after
earnings announcements, benchmarked by the returns of the corresponding Fama-French 5×5 size and book-to-market
portfolios. Treat is a dummy variable that equals one for earnings announcements from treated firms. Post is a dummy
variable that equals one if earnings announcements happen after the reductions of analyst coverage. CAR_d0 is the
abnormal return on the dates of earnings announcements, benchmarked by the returns of the corresponding Fama-
French 5×5 size and book-to-market portfolios. D(HF++) is a dummy variable that equals one if the abnormal aggregate
hedge fund holdings at the nearest quarter end prior to earnings announcements are in the top quartile of the abnormal
hedge fund holdings at that quarter. Abnormal hedge fund holdings at any given quarter are computed as hedge fund
holdings at the current quarter minus the average hedge fund holdings of the past four quarters. Control variables
include LnSize, LnBEME, LnLev, and Ret2mPrior, which are defined in Table 1. Standard errors, included in brackets,
are double clustered at both the firm and quarter levels. The treated firms are limited to firms that have five or fewer
analysts covering the firm before coverage reductions. The data cover earnings announcements two years before and
after the reductions of analyst coverage over the period 1997–2010. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at
the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels.

Testing the Alternative Explanations for the Impacts of Hedge Funds on Market Efficiency
This table evaluates the impacts of hedge funds on the magnitude of PEAD after the reductions of analyst coverage in
two sub-samples. In columns (1)–(2), we exclude observations from treated firms targeted by activist hedge funds two
years before and two years after the coverage reductions, as well as the observations from the matched control firms.
In columns (3)–(4), we exclude observations from treated firms with a history of providing earnings guidance, as well
as the observations from the matched control firms. The dependent variable 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶_𝑑𝑑1_𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the cumulative abnormal
return (in percent) from the first day to the nth day after earnings announcements, benchmarked by the returns of the
corresponding Fama-French 5×5 size and book-to-market portfolios. Treat is a dummy variable that equals one for
earnings announcements from treated firms. Post is a dummy variable that equals one if earnings announcements
happen after the reductions of analyst coverage. D(HF++) is a dummy variable that equals one if the abnormal aggregate
hedge fund holdings at the nearest quarter end prior to earnings announcements are in the top quartile of the abnormal
hedge fund holdings at that quarter. Abnormal hedge fund holdings at any given quarter are computed as hedge fund
holdings at the current quarter minus the average hedge fund holdings of the past four quarters. SUE is quarterly
standardized unexpected earnings, computed as the quarter’s actual earnings minus the average of the most recent
analyst forecasts, divided by the standard deviation of those forecasts. Control variables include LnSize, LnBEME,
LnLev, and Ret2mPrior, which are defined in Table 1. Standard errors, included in brackets, are double clustered at
both the firm and quarter levels. The treated firms are limited to firms that have five or fewer analysts covering the
firm before coverage reductions. The data cover earnings announcements two years before and after the reductions of
analyst coverage over the period 1997–2010. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%
levels.
