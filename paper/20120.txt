                                              ABSTRACT

This is the introduction and summary to the sixth phase of an ongoing project on Social Security Programs
and Retirement Around the World. The first phase described the retirement incentives inherent in plan
provisions and documented the strong relationship across countries between social security incentives
to retire and the proportion of older persons out of the labor force. The second phase documented
the large effects that changing plan provisions would have on the labor force participation of older
workers. The third phase demonstrated the consequent fiscal implications that extending labor force
participation would have on net program costs—reducing government social security benefit payments
and increasing government tax revenues. The fourth phase presented analyses of the relationship between
the labor force participation of older persons and the labor force participation of younger persons in
twelve countries. We found no evidence that increasing the employment of older persons will reduce
the employment opportunities of youth and no evidence that increasing the employment of older persons
will increase the unemployment of youth. The fifth phase on “Historical Trends in Mortality and Health,
Employment, and Disability Insurance Participation and Reforms” was intended to set the stage for
this current phase.

This sixth phase of the ongoing ISS project is particularly related to the fifth phase (Wise, 2012) and
the second phase (Gruber and Wise, 2004) of the project. This volume continues the focus of the previous
volume on DI programs while extending the methodology to study retirement behavior used in the
second phase to focus in particular on the effects of the DI programs. The key question this volume
seeks to address is: given health status, to what extent are differences in labor force participation across
countries determined by the provisions of disability insurance programs?

        Through the coordination of work of a team of analysts in twelve countries for over fifteen
years, the International Social Security (ISS) project has used the vast differences in social security
programs across countries as a natural laboratory to study the effects of retirement program
provisions on the labor force participation of older persons. A central finding of the project is that in
many countries the provisions of social security and related government programs provide strong
incentives for workers to leave the labor force at relatively young ages and that reducing the
inducement to leave the labor force can lead workers to delay retirement and yield large
improvements in the financial position of government budgets. The work to date has also made clear
that disability insurance (DI) programs can play a large role in the departure of older persons from the
labor force, as many workers pass through DI on their path from employment to retirement.
       This is the sixth phase of the ongoing ISS project. This phase is particularly related to the fifth
phase (Wise, 2012) and the second phase (Gruber and Wise, 2004) of the project. This volume
continues the focus of the previous volume on DI programs while extending the methodology to study
retirement behavior used in the second phase to focus in particular on the effects of the DI programs.
The key question this volume seeks to address is: given health status, to what extent are differences
in labor force participation across countries determined by the provisions of disability insurance
programs?

        The fifth phase presented an analysis of historical trends in our group of countries to set the
stage for the more formal analysis of disability insurance programs in the current volume. In that
phase, the countries summarized DI program reforms and considered how DI reforms were related to
changes in health, in particular as measured by changes in mortality. We also treated DI reforms as
natural experiments—not prompted by changes in the health or employment circumstances of older
persons—and showed that these “exogenous” reforms often had a very large effect on the labor force
participation of older workers.

        The second phase, which was based on microeconomic analysis of the relationship between a
person’s decision to retire and the social security and other program incentives faced by that person,
documented the large effects that changing plan provisions would have on the labor force
participation of older workers. In that phase the country teams considered the employment
implications of increasing retirement program eligibility ages, including the eligibility age for DI, and
showed that these changes would have very large effects on employment at older ages. As
described in more detail below, the current phase of the project differs from the second in
incorporating a more careful modeling of the incentives arising from the DI program and simulating
how changes in access to DI might affect labor force participation.

        To summarize the findings of the remaining phases: The first phase of the project described
the retirement incentives inherent in plan provisions and documented the strong relationship across
countries between social security incentives to retire and the proportion of older persons out of the
labor force (Gruber and Wise 1999). The third phase (Gruber and Wise 2007) demonstrated the
consequent fiscal implications that extending labor force participation would have on net program
costs—reducing government social security benefit payments and increasing government tax
revenues. The analyses in the first two phases, as well as the analysis in the third phase, are
summarized in the introduction to the third phase.
                                                    3
        In the fourth phase (Gruber and Wise 2010) we directed attention to the oft-claimed proposition
that incentives to induce older persons to retire—inherent in the provisions of social security
systems—were prompted by youth unemployment. Many have worried that if the incentives to retire
were removed and older persons stayed longer in the labor force, the job opportunities of youth would
be reduced. We found no evidence to support this “boxed economy” proposition. In short, we
concluded: “the overwhelming weight of the evidence, as well as the evidence from each of the
several different methods of estimation, is contrary to the boxed economy proposition. We find no
evidence that increasing the employment of older persons will reduce the employment opportunities
of youth and no evidence that increasing the employment of older persons will increase the
unemployment of youth.”

       An important goal of the project has been to present results that were as comparable as
possible across countries. Thus the papers for each phase were prepared according to a detailed
template that we developed in consultation with country participants. In this introduction, we
summarize the collective results of the country analyses and borrow freely from the country papers.
In large part, however, the results presented in the introduction could only be conveyed by combined
analysis of the data from each of the countries. The country papers themselves present much more

                                                   4
detail for each country and, in addition to the common analyses performed by all countries, often
present country-specific analysis relevant to a particular country. In addition, the country papers
typically present results separately for both men and women.
        As we have noted in our past work, the share of the population receiving disability benefits at
older ages varies substantially across countries. The figure below shows the share of men ages 60
to 64 collecting DI benefits by country in 2009. This value varies by a factor of eight within the
participant countries, from 17 percent in Belgium to 16 percent in the UK to 14 percent in the US to 6
percent in Italy and France to 2 percent in Japan. (It is important to note that the data for Belgium
and Italy pertain to the number of DI participants divided by the number of active wage earners plus
the number of DI participants, rather than the population 60 to 64. This same caveat applies to
Figures 1-1, 1-5, 1-6. 1-7, and 1-8 below.) It seems unlikely that differences of this magnitude would
be driven exclusively, or even primarily, by differences in the health status of the population across
countries. In the introduction to the prior phase of the project (Milligan and Wise, 2012), we grouped
countries according to the share of men collecting disability benefits at age 45, which was 2 to 3
percent in one set of countries and 5 to 6 percent in another. By age 64, both groups of countries
were exhibiting large differences in the share of men collecting DI (or similar) benefits – among
countries with the lower rates of DI usage at age 45, for example, participation at age 64 ranged from
less than 10 percent to over 35 percent. The emergence of these vast differences in the use of DI at
older ages among countries with similar rates of disability in middle age strongly suggests that DI
usage depends on factors other than health. These statistics also indicate that the DI program serves
as a source of retirement income before the social security eligibility age for a sizeable share of the
population in some countries. It is these observations that lead us to seek a better understanding of
how financial incentives from DI programs affect labor supply.




       This introduction is organized in several sections. Section 1 presents background information
on DI participation, including changes over time, participation gradients by education and health

                                                   5
status, and other relevant statistics. Section 2 explains the Poterba, Venti, and Wise (PVW) index of
health that is used throughout the analysis. Section 3 explains the estimation procedure that is
followed. Section 4 discusses the simulations based on the estimation results. While the simulations
in the second phase of the project emphasized the implications of increasing program eligibility ages,
the simulations here emphasize employment (retirement) effects of incentives inherent in the
provisions of the country retirement plans, particularly of changing the accessibility of the DI program.

1. Background

        Trends in DI participation: We begin by documenting changes in DI participation over time.
Figure 1-1 shows the DI participation rate for men ages 60 to 64 by country for selected years from
1970 through 2012 (years of data available for each country vary; data for France and Germany is for
ages 55 to 59). DI participation is not shown for Japan, where DI participation has been extremely
low. Similar figures in the individual country papers show results for men ages 50 to 54 and 55 to 59
and for women; trends in these other groups are often similar to those shown here, though
participation levels are lower at younger ages.

       Perhaps the most striking feature of these data is the sharp decline in the DI participation rate
for older men in many European countries beginning between the late 1980 and the mid-1990s. In
five countries – most striking in Sweden, Canada, and the UK but also in Italy, and Germany – an
inverted U-shaped pattern is evident, with DI participation rising until the mid-1990s and falling
sharply thereafter. The DI participation rate reached 36 percent in Sweden and 27 percent in the UK
before dropping by 53 and 50 percent respectively over the next fifteen to twenty years. The drop
was 50 percent from the peak in Canada, 41 percent in Germany, and 15 percent in Italy. In the
Netherlands, Denmark, and Belgium there was also a large decline after the late 1980s, ranging from
32 to 45 percent. In these three countries the time series begins too late to see the rise, but the fall in
DI participation is quite evident.

        In the remaining countries, the pattern is different. In the US, the DI participation rate for men
ages 60 to 64 rose from 4.7 to 13.6 percent between 1960 and 1980 and then fell by 3 percentage
points during the 1980s, from 13.6 to 10.4 percent. Since that time, while DI participation in many
European countries has falling dramatically, the DI participation rate in the US increased by 30
percent in a trend that shows no signs of stopping. Spain too has experienced an increase in the DI
participation rate over the past two decades. In France the trend in DI participation between 1990
and 2007 is unclear although there was a decline in DI participation in the last years of available data.

      The changes are summarized in Table 1-1. The countries are ordered by the decline in the
percent on DI with the greatest decline in Sweden and the greatest increase in the US.

        As we discuss subsequently, that the dramatic changes in the DI participation rate over time
experienced by many countries cannot be explained by changes in health. This feature of the data is
documented in substantial detail in the previous phase of the project—the individual country chapters
in that volume (Wise 2012) and the introduction to that volume (Milligan and Wise 2012). The rapid
changes in the level of DI participation that can be seen in Figure 1-1 are often associated with
reforms in the DI program or in other government programs and are also documented in the prior
phase of the project.

        In addition to looking at the DI participation rate in isolation, it is instructive to consider how the
use of different benefit programs as pathways from employment to retirement has changed over time.
Figure 1-2 provides this information for German men. As the figure makes evident, the proportion of
men retiring by way of DI fluctuated widely between 1960 and 2012. For example, the proportion
retiring through the two DI programs (for workers under and over 60, respectively) ranged from a high
                                                                           8
of 68 percent 1981 to a low of 28 percent in 2005—a decline of over 58 percent—and then increased
by over 14 percent by 2012. This figure also shows that the decline in retirement through DI
coincided with an increase in retirement through a special unemployment insurance program for older
workers. The decline in the sum of DI plus UI programs between 1981 and 1999 was a more modest
33 percent. This example suggests that government programs may substitute for one another—a
decline in participation in one program may be offset by an increase in participation in another
program and may not necessarily be associated with an equal increase in labor supply. Therefore it
is important to take a holistic view and model the incentives arising from all programs that are
potential sources of (early) retirement income, as we aim to do in the analysis that follows.




        Trends in DI Participation versus Trends in Health: In the prior phase of the project (Wise,
2012), we emphasized the absence of a relationship between DI participation and health, as
measured by mortality. Figure 1-3, taken from the introduction to this earlier study (Milligan and Wise,
2012), shows the decline in mortality at age 65 between 1970 and the early 2000s for our 12
participating countries. Mortality declined in all of the countries over this period, generally in a similar
way. Yet as shown above in Figure 1-1, DI participation fluctuated widely over the same time period.
The juxtaposition of these trends casts doubt on the possibility that changes in DI participation within
countries over time are driven by changes in health, at least as measured by mortality. This point is
made more directly in Figure 1-4, also from Milligan and Wise (2012), which plots the change in
mortality and the change in DI participation between 1980 and 2005 for the 12 participating countries
and finds little evidence of a relationship between them.

      Trends in DI Participation versus Trends in Employment: While there is little evidence that
changes in health are associated with changes in DI participation, we anticipate that changes in DI

                                                  10
participation are associated with changes in employment at older ages. Here we explore the
relationship over time by plotting the evolution of DI participation and employment rates at older ages
within each country over time. A central goal of this phase of the project is to explore the relationship
between DI programs and labor force participation through microeconomic analysis, as discussed
below. The time series data here helps to provide motivation for the formal analysis to follow.

        The relationship between DI participation and employment in the participating countries is
presented in Figure 1-5. In this figure the left axis measures employment and the right axis measures
DI participation. As discussed above with respect to Figure 1-1, the DI participation rate for older
men follows an inverted U-shaped pattern in a number of countries, rising until the early-to-mid 1990s
and then falling, while several additional countries (for whom earlier data was not available) also have
a decline in DI participation over the past several decades. The new insight from Figure 1-5 is that
there is an inverse relationship between the DI participation and employment rates in virtually all of
these countries. Specifically, in Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK, the
relationship is quite clear; as DI participation increases the employment rate falls and as DI
participation declines employment increases. The relationship is especially striking in Sweden,
Canada, the UK, and Italy where the peak in DI participation (with a sharp increase and a sharp fall
after the peak) is mirrored by a reverse relationship for employment. A similar relationship is also
shown for Germany but with greater fluctuation in the employment and DI trends over time.

        In the US, the story is more complex. For men age 60 to 64, the inverse relationship is evident
in the 1970s, but over the past two decades both employment and DI participation have been rising.
For US men age 50 to 54, however—the ages at which a large number of men first receive DI
benefits--the inverse relationship is clear. A similar relationship (not shown) holds for the 55 to 59
age groups in the US. In three additional countries—Belgium, Germany, and Spain—the data are too
noisy or the time series too brief to draw strong conclusions, although the data suggest a negative
relationship at the beginning and at the end of the time period for which data are available in Belgium,
at the end of the period in Germany, and perhaps at the end of the period in Spain. Nonetheless, the
fact that we observe that employment moves in the opposite direction of DI participation in most
countries, in periods of both rising and falling DI participation and with the peak in DI participation
lining up with the trough in employment in several cases, suggests a noticeable relationship between
the two series.

       Health and DI participation: Having explored how DI participation varies across countries over
time, and with changes in health and employment over time, we next consider how DI participation
varies by health quintile. The description of how the health quintiles are constructed is deferred to
Section 2 of this chapter.

       The results are shown in Figure 1-6 for men age 55 to 64. In all countries, there is a
substantial DI gradient with respect to health, with those in the lowest health quintile dramatically
more likely to be on DI than those in the middle or highest health quintile. This finding is of course
consistent with the intended purpose of DI programs to provide income support to individuals with
reduced work capacity. The figure also shows, however, that for people with similar levels of health
(for example, those in the lowest health quintile in their own country), there are large differences
across countries in the probability of being on DI. In the UK, nearly half of older men in the lowest
health quintile are on DI, versus about one-quarter of Danish men and one-tenth of Japanese men in
the lowest quintile. Among countries with similar rates of DI in the lowest health quintile—such as the
US, Spain, and Sweden—the share of men in the middle health quintile who are on DI ranges from 3
percent in the US to 13 percent in Sweden.




                                                                                    13
       Education and DI participation: One feature of DI that may not be widely understood is the
strong relationship between DI participation and education. Figure 1-7 shows the share of men at
ages 55 to 64 who are on DI by level of education across countries; the values for the highest and
lowest education groups are shown on the graph, although definition of high and low varies across
countries.

        In Denmark, Italy, the U.S., and the U.K., those individuals in the lowest education group are
at least five times as likely to be receiving DI benefits as those in the highest education group. In
other countries, the ratio of probabilities is somewhat lower, but still greater than two in every country.
Differences in rates of DI participation by education group may reflect the fact that less educated
individuals on average are in poorer health than those with more education – a possibility that we
explore in more detail below – but likely also reflect economic circumstances such as weaker job
prospects or higher replacement DI rates for workers with low lifetime earnings in systems with
progressive benefit formulas.




                                                    14
        DI Participation by Education and Health: We return to the question of whether differences in
DI participation by education are primarily due to health differences by calculating DI participation by
health and education for those countries with large enough sample sizes to do so. Figure 1-8 shows
the participation percent by education for each health quintile in ten of the participant countries. In
the lowest health quintile in the U.S., 50 percent of persons with less than a high school degree are
DI participants versus only 34 percent of those with a college degree. For those in the 3rd health
quintile, participation rates among college graduates and high school dropouts are 6 percent and 2
percent, respectively. In the UK, there are even larger differences by education in DI use by men in
the same health quintile. In the lowest quintile, those in the low education group are over twice as
likely to be on DI as those in the high education group (53 versus 22 percent); this is also true in the
second quintile (23 versus 4 percent) and third quintile (6 versus 2.5 percent). A similar pattern is
evident in the other countries, with Denmark and Sweden having particularly steep gradients, like the
UK, and other countries reflecting gradients more similar to those in the US. From these figures, we
conclude that differences in DI use by education group are not due exclusively to differences in
health. Rather, it appears that there are other factors such as differential labor market prospects or
earnings potential that may explain the large differences in DI participation by education, conditional
on health.

        Employment by Health and by Education: Finally, we explore the relationship between
employment and health and employment and education, which are likely to vary across countries
depending on the provisions of each country’s DI program. Employment rates by health quintiles are
plotted for Denmark and Germany only—for other countries the data necessary to compute an
equivalent time series are not available. The figure shows that there are very significant differences
across health quintiles in the probability that older men are employed. Although employment rates
are higher at every level of health in Germany, the difference between the employment rates of those
in the lowest and highest health quintiles is roughly the same in both countries, 20 to 25 percentage
points.

        Figure 1-10 presents employment rates at ages 55-64 by level of education, country, and year.
This figure shows that there are very large differences in employment by education. In most
countries, the difference in employment between the highest and lowest education groups (where the
definition of these groups varies by country) is at least 20 percentage points. Notably, these
differences are of a similar magnitude to those seen across health quintiles in Figure 1-9. Thus
education is strongly related to both DI participation and to employment at older ages, consistent with
a causal link between employment and application for DI.

2. Measuring Health

      Health is a central component of the analysis. Here we explain briefly the measure that is
used and a key property of the measure.

        To maintain as much comparability across countries as possible, we use a health index
developed by Poterba, Venti, and Wise (PVW) that has previously been used in several contexts—
see for example Poterba, Venti, and Wise (2013). The index, as set out by PVW, is the first principal
component of 27 health indicators reported in the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Much of
the analysis reported in this volume makes use of a nexus of comparable studies--the English
Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), the Japan Study of Aging and Retirement (JSTAR), and the
Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE, which includes 8 of our participant
countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK). The
similarity of these studies allows us to apply the PVW methodology across countries.

       To be more specific, in the current project we use a slightly modified version of the PVW index
based on 25 indicators that are common to the HRS and to all of the SHARE countries. Japan and
the UK lack data on several of the indicators, so they use the same methodology with the remaining
indicators. There are four countries that do not employ the PVW method in constructing health
measures for their analysis. One is Canada, which lacks detailed data on health in any survey that
would meet the other requirements of this project and thus uses a simplified health measure (see
country paper for details). The others are Sweden, Denmark, and Germany, who have chosen to use
non-SHARE data to obtain a larger sample size for their analyses. For these four countries,
therefore, the comparable health measure cannot be used. Nonetheless the comparable health
measures for all SHARE countries are included in the discussion below. The health measures in
non-health-index-countries are not comparable to the index health measure. Also, in some countries,
the precise index used in a country may differ slightly from the index used in this discussion of the
properties of the index.


                                                                  19
        The health measures and the weights (“loadings”) given to each measure in the index for each
country (except Canada) are shown in Table 2-1a. Comparison of the weights across countries
reveals striking consistency among the countries. That is, the ranking of the weights is very similar
from one country to the next. This is especially apparent for the US, the eight SHARE countries, and
for the UK (based on ELSA data).

       Table 2-1b shows the correlation of the weights for each pair of countries. All but 2 of the 32
pairwise correlations for the US and the SHARE countries 0.95 or greater; many are 0.97 or greater.
Correlations between the rankings for the UK and each of the other countries and the ranking for
Japan and each of the other countries are shown on the right-hand side of the table. These
correlations are based on the weights for the health indicators that are common to each country. For
example the correlations for Japan are based on the 22 indicators that are common to the US, the
SHARE countries, and Japan. The correlations for the UK are based on the 20 variables that are
common to the UK, the US, and the SHARE countries. The pairwise correlations between the UK
and the other countries for this smaller set of questions are 0.95 or greater for all countries except
Japan, with a correlation of 0.92. In general, the correlations between Japan and the other countries
are between 0.88 and 0.93 with one exception. When the “exact same” questions are used in each of
the countries, the pairwise correlations are close to 1—between .98 and .99—for all of the countries
except the pairwise correlations with Japan. The high correlations between the country “loadings”
indicate that the relationships among the many health indicator responses are very similar across
countries.

        For ease of analysis the index measures for each country are converted to percentile scores,
with 1 and lowest and 100 the highest. For many comparisons the percentile scores are grouped into
five “quintiles.” Many figures based on these quintiles are shown in the background section above.
        An important feature of the index is the strong correspondence to survival. For example,
based on ELSA data in the UK, given the health index quintile in 2002 the survival rate in 2011 for
persons in lowest quintile is 59.7%, it is 72.6% in the second quintile, 81.9% in the third, 88.9% in the
fourth, and 93.9% in the highest quintile. Based on HRS data in the US, given the health index decile
                                                                    21
in 1992 the survival rate in 2008 ranges from 42.8% for those in the bottom decile to 71.4% for those
in the fifth decile to 89.6% for those in the top decile. In the US, the index in 1992 is also strongly
related to future health events such as diabetes, lung cancer, health disease, stroke, hospital stay in
2008, and poor health in 2008 (Poterba, Venti, and Wise, 2013).

       The following example points to the value of a health measure that can be constructed in a
comparable way across countries, and provides some added support to the idea that the resulting
health index values are reasonable. In Figure 2-1, we report the PVW health index by age and
country, as measured relative to the US value. At ages 50 to 54, the health of women in the US is
worse than the health of women in most other countries. This finding continues at least through ages
60 to 64, but by the mid 70s, health in the US is better than in all countries (with the exception of the
UK). This finding is consistent with the conclusion of many analysts that health in the US improves
after Medicare eligibility at age 65 and that expenditure on health care for the oldest old is relatively
higher in the US than in other countries. For men, shown in Figure 2-2, the general trend is similar
but not as dramatic.

3. Estimation

      A central goal of the analysis in this phase of the project is to estimate the relationship
between the provisions of each country’s retirement programs and the labor supply (or retirement)
behavior of older workers in that country. The analysis in this phase of the project is closely related to
the analysis in the second phase.1 Here, however, we give particular attention to the provisions of DI
programs, as well as other pathways to retirement.

       More specifically, we want to understand how changing the provisions of a country’s DI
program (and perhaps other programs) would affect retirement. To explore this, we first need to
construct a retirement incentive measure that reflects how the provisions of a country’s social
security, DI, and other relevant programs provide a greater or lesser return to continued work at a
given age for each worker. Next, we assess whether this incentive measure is empirically related to
retirement behavior. Finally, we use the results of this estimation to simulate how a change to a
country’s DI program (and the resulting change in the retirement incentive measure) would be
expected to affect retirement.

       The key idea that underlies our analysis is the potential gain from postponing retirement from
today’s age until some future age. This is the incentive to delay retirement. We first explain this
incentive measure, assuming that there is only one pathway to retirement. We then explain the
issues that arise when there are multiple pathways to retirement, for example social security and DI.
We then discuss the other covariates included in the country retirement specifications. As the

discussion below and in the country papers makes clear, workers may face very different incentives
for continued work depending on the provisions of retirement programs in their country as well as on
individual characteristics such as potential earnings, earnings history, family structure, and other
attributes.

      Retirement Incentive and the Option Value: To begin, assume that there is only one retirement
program, social security. When a person retires he (or she) will receive a stream of benefits until
death. If the person retires at age t, the present discounted value of benefits, or social security
wealth, is given by SSWt . If the person retires one year later the present discounted value of future
benefits will be
SSWt 1 . The social security accrual from one year to the next is given by

SSWt 1  SSWt

That is, this measure describes the change in promised future social security benefits from working
one additional year. Social security wealth will go up if an extra year of work is translated into a higher
flow of benefits in the future, either because of the relationship between social security and lifetime
earnings or because of actuarial adjustments that reward later retirement. Social security wealth may
go down, though, if the extra benefits that accrue from the extra work are not large enough to
compensate for the loss of any retirement benefits in that extra year of work. The net of the future
extra benefit entitlement and the loss of benefits in that extra year of work is the one year accrual.

       One shortcoming of the accrual as a measure of retirement incentives is that there could be
greater increases in social security wealth from delaying retirement by two years, three years, or
more rather than by a single year; beyond some age, benefits may decline--depending on the benefit
formula in a given country. The gains associated with work beyond the current year will not be
captured by this simple measure. Thus to fully appreciate the incentives inherent in the social security
program, we must consider the path of benefits many years into the future. The benchmark approach
we use for considering the entire future path of accruals is the “option value” model.2 To summarize,
this model evaluates the expected present discounted value of incomes for all possible future
retirement ages, and then measures the “value” of retirement today versus the value of retiring at the
optimal date (which may be today, but more likely is in the future). If looking ahead suggests gains
from work at some time in the future, there is an incentive for the person to remain in the labor force
to take advantage of these gains.

           A simplified version of the option value measure at age t can be described by:

Simplified OVt (r * )
    discounted   discounted    discounted                 
                                                          
  benefits if    benefits if     future wages 
   retire at r *   retire at t    through age r * 

2
    For a more detailed discussion, see Stock and Wise (1990).
                                                                     24
In this formulation, a person considering whether to retire at age t considers the present value of
benefits if he retires now (at age t) with the benefits if he retires at some later age. If the person
retires at some later age he will gain from future wage earnings and from any gain in future pension
benefits. The gain in wage earnings is represented by the last bracket and the gain in pension
benefits by the difference between the terms in the first bracket. The age at which the total of the two
components is the greatest is denoted by r * . The option value prescription is that the person will
continue to work if this option value is positive. More detail on the option value specification is shown
in the appendix on the option value model.

        Multiple Pathways to Retirement: The discussion above assumes that there is only one
pathway to retirement, but in all countries there are multiple pathways. In the United States there are
two pathways—Social Security and Disability Insurance (DI)—but in other countries there are three or
more pathways—the social security “normal” retirement, DI, special unemployment insurance
programs, or a special early retirement program. To estimate the OV incentive on retirement with
multiple programs, we follow an instrumental variables-like approach. For each program, we first
estimate the OV measure for that program, essentially assuming that the worker will retire through
that program and the only decision is at what age to retire. Next, we estimate the probability that the
person assigns to each program as a possible pathway to retirement. Finally, we calculate the
“inclusive OV,” which is the weighted average of the OVs for each of the possible programs. The
probabilities to be assigned to each program are determined by the relationship between individual
attributes and the likelihood that a particular program was chosen by similar workers in the past. For
example, in the US, the probability weight for the DI plan is determined by the probability that a
person in each of four education levels was on DI anytime at ages 60 and 64 in the relevant year
(estimated using HRS data for the years 1992 to 2010). The exact method used for each country is
described in the country papers. This approach is an “instrumental variable” estimate of the expected
OV faced by a given person.

        Figure 3-1 shows the OVs by age for each country. The OV calculations are based on the
detail in the appendix. For illustration, consider the programs in the US and in Belgium. The US has
only two programs, DI and Social Security (SS). Belgium has four programs—Social Security, DI,
unemployment insurance (UI), and early retirement (CER). Notice that in the US, the OV of delaying
retirement is much larger under the SS program than under the DI program. That is, the gain from
delaying retirement is much greater under the SS program. Thus persons who consider the DI
program as a route to retirement have a much greater incentive to retire at a young age than persons
who consider SS as the only pathway to retirement. The inclusive OV is the weighted average of the
SS and DI OVs. In the US, the average DI weight is small so the inclusive OV is close to the SS OV.
The OVs in Belgium are quite different. First note that the program OVs in general are much lower in
Belgium than in the US. Second, note that the Inclusive OV is much lower in Belgium than in the US.
At age 50 for example, the inclusive OV in the US is about 33,200 but is only about 12,500 in
Belgium. Thus it would appear that the average gain to delaying retirement is much less in Belgium
than in the US.

        It is important to understand that the estimated effect of the inclusive OV on retirement—
thought of as an instrumental variable estimate of the OV effect on retirement—is taken as the effect
of the OV on retirement and used in all estimates of the effects of program provisions and changes in
program provisions on retirement. For example this estimate is used to predict (simulate) the effect
on retirement of having access only to the DI versus access only to the social security program.

       Estimation and Additional Covariates: Although the inclusive OV incentive measure is the key
variable in the estimation, other individual attributes are also included. First recall that the OV
depends on estimated individual earnings as described above. In addition the specification for each
country includes health—typically controlling for health quintile based on the PVW index described
above. One might expect health to be particularly important when contemplating retirement under the
DI pathway. The specification also includes education level, gender, whether the person is married,
whether the spouse works, total non-social security assets, and occupation indicator variables. There
is some variation depending on data availability in each country.

       Finally, each specification controls for age. Two versions are included. One includes indicator
variables for each age; the other includes age as a single continuous variable. The inclusion of age is
particularly important when evaluating the effect of the OV on retirement. Quoting from the
introduction to phase 2 of the project—Gruber and Wise (2004):

                       As emphasized above, a crucial issue in the analyses in this volume is identification–
               that is, determination of the separate effect of each variable on retirement, as distinct from
               each of the other variables. A key goal is to determine the effect of plan incentives on
               retirement. But other individual attributes also influence the decision to retire. For example,

                                                                                                  27
       persons are more likely to prefer retirement to work as they age. A linear age variable will
       potentially capture this effect, but only if preferences for leisure evolve linearly with age. …

We return to this issue when discussing simulations below.

       Parameter Estimates: For each country estimates are reported for several alternative
specifications. For example in some specifications separate indicator variables are included for each
age; in others a single linear age effect is included. In some specifications health quintile indicators
are included; in other specifications a single variable for health percentile is included. For some
countries the sample sizes are large enough to obtain separate estimates by health quintile and by
education level; in others, including most of the SHARE countries (if the SHARE data are used) the
sample sizes are not large enough to estimate separate parameters by health quintile or by
education.

         The most important coefficient is the estimated effect of the inclusive OV on the probability of
retirement. The country estimates of this retirement incentive effect are sensitive to the differential
variance in the OVs across countries. To account for this, the estimated effect of a one standard
deviation change in the OV is reported in square brackets as well as the effect of a unit (10,000
“utility” units) change in the OV. In addition, in some specifications the percent gain in the OV from
delaying retirement is estimated instead of the OV itself--the percent gain from delaying retirement at
age a is measured by the OV of delaying retirement at age a divided by the utility associated with
retirement at age a. Like the standard deviation of the OVs, this measure may be more comparable
across countries than OV units and thus help to make the results more comparable across countries.

        Estimates for each of the countries are reported in the Table 3-1. Estimates are reported for
two specifications. The first is the fourth specification in the first table of estimates presented in each
of the country papers. The second is the effect of the percent gain in the OV from delaying
retirement. Several features of the estimates stand out. First, the estimated option value incentive
measure is highly statistically significant in each of the countries with the exception of Spain and
Germany (using SHARE data). In these countries the sample sizes are apparently too small to obtain
statistically significant results. The German estimates based on the SOEP much larger data file are
highly significant. Second, there is considerable variation across countries in the estimated effects.
Even excluding the statistically insignificant estimates for two countries and the smallest estimates for
the UK and Sweden, the estimated effects for the remaining countries vary by a factor of seven. In
two countries the estimated effect of a unit (10,000) increase in the OV is to reduce the retirement
rate by about 11 percent or more. In five countries the effect on retirement is between 3 and 5
percent. In the UK and Sweden the estimated effect is less than one percent. The estimated effect
of a standard deviation change in the incentive measure also varies across countries, but less than
the unit increase estimate. In eight countries these estimates are between 4 and 9 percent. In the
remaining three countries with statistically significant estimates the values are between 1 and 3
percent. Third, in most countries there is very little difference in the estimated effect of the incentive
measure in the specification with age indicators compared to the otherwise identical specification but
with a single linear age measure—these estimates can be seen in the country papers. Finally, the
estimated effects of other covariates vary substantially from one country to the other and many of the

                                                    28
estimated effects are not statistically different from zero. The many estimates based on several
additional specifications are shown in the Country papers.

         Although if is clear that persons in poor health are more likely to retire early through the DI
pathway, whether the effect of the incentive measure on retirement should vary in one direction or
another with health is not clear a priori. Some evidence, however, is provided in the country data.
Table 3-2 shows the estimated incentive measure effect by health quintile for several countries with
sample sizes large enough to distinguish estimates by health. In four of the five countries, the
estimated effect of the incentive measure declines with health. In the United States the effect
declines continuously from -0.0594 for those in the worst health to -0.0197 for those in the best
health, in the in Germany from -0.0902 to -0.0219, in Denmark from -0.639 to -0.0373, and in Sweden
from-0.0022 to -0.0009. In each these countries the result is also shown clearly by comparing the
effect of a standard deviation change in the OV for those in the best versus those in the worst health,
shown by the estimates in the square brackets. The UK is an exception, showing essentially no
relationship between the incentive measure and health. Recall that the health measures used in
Germany, Denmark, and Sweden are based on the few selected health measures in the data files
used in those countries and are not comparable to the PVW index measure used the US and the UK.
Nonetheless, the health measures used in the other three countries can be used to rank persons by
health quintile. Note that the relationship between the incentive measure and health should not
necessarily be expected to be the same in all countries. For example, health is the central criteria for
eligibility for DI in the US while the relationship may be less strict in other countries which may give
more weight to labor market conditions, for example, to determine DI eligibility. The descriptive data
above show a strong correspondence between health quintile and DI participation in each country,
although the strength of the relationship varies from country to country, as shown in Figure 1-8.

Germany (SOEP), Denmank, and Sweden do not use the PVW health index so
that health comparability across all of the countries is not assurred, although in
each country the available measures can be used to rank persons by health.

4. Simulations

       Each of the country papers includes a series of simulations. Some simulations show the fit of
the estimated specifications. For all countries these simulations show that the models predict well the
proportion of persons that has retired by age. Other simulations are descriptive—for example,
showing employment by education or health by age. The most important simulations are used to
predict the effect of the retirement program incentive effects on retirement. It is helpful to recall first
the simulations that were done in the second phase of the project.

       The most important simulations in the second phase were used to predict the effect of
increasing retirement program eligibility ages. We describe here two simulations—S1 and S3--that
were reported in the introduction to the second phase: Social Security Programs and Retirement
Around the World: Micro Estimation (Gruber and Wise 2004). Both simulations show the effect of
increasing the eligibility ages. But the estimation specification and the simulation methods differ.
Simulation S1 is based on estimation that controlled for a linear measure of age in the specification
and only the OV incentive measure (and the associated variables that determine the OV incentive) is


                                                     30
used in the simulation.3 Simulation S3 uses age indicator variables in the estimation, and, in addition
uses adjusted age indicators to simulate retirement under the program changes.4 The percent
reduction in the proportion of men out of the labor (OLF) is shown in Figure 4-1. This figure
reproduces the data in Figure 16 on page 29 of Gruber and Wise (2004) and the details of the
construction of the figure are discussed there.




        For the S1 simulation, the incentive measure for a country (the OV) is recalculated based on
the OV that incorporates the implications of the delayed eligibility age. The blue bars show the effect
of only the change in the incentive implications of the three-year delay. The average reduction in the
proportion of men out-of-the-labor-force (OLF) is large--28 percent. Underlying the average,
however, are large differences across countries. For four countries the reduction was greater than 32
percent, for two countries the reduction was less than 4 percent, and was between 16 and 28 percent
for the remaining countries. The simulated reduction in the proportion of men OLF is much larger if
age indicators are used in estimation and the age effects for each age are moved up three years to
correspond with the three-year increase in all program eligibility ages.
3
  The estimation in this earlier volume was also based on OV, though as noted above, the current analysis features a
more careful modeling of DI and other pathways to retirement (thus, the OV measure used in phase 2 is not exactly the
same as the OV inclusive measure used in the new simulations described below).
4
  The estimated age indicator effects, as well as the program incentive effects, are used to predict the effect of the
program changes. For example, for the three-year eligibility delay, the age indicator for a given age is taken to be the
estimated age indicator three years prior to the given age. The age 60 indicator, for example, is taken to be the estimated
age 57 indicator. The result is that under the three-year eligibility delay, the projected retirement rate at age 60 is
approximately the same as the current program age 57 retirement rate. The spike at the early retirement age under the
current program, for example, shows up three years later under the reform. This approach assumes that all of the
estimated age effects can be attributed to the eligibility age program provisions. (The ages include the age at which
persons are eligible for one or more programs, as well as the “normal” retirement age.)
                                                            31
         It is not surprising that the effects of increases in the eligibility ages are large. For example,
this simulation implies that the early retirement age in the US increased from 62 to 65 and under S3
this reduced the OLF proportion by 36 percent. In most countries (although not in the US because DI
was not included in the analysis) increasing the eligibility age for retirement would also change the
eligibility age for DI by three years as well.

        Now, in this phase with emphasis on DI, increasing the eligibility age for DI seems implausible
in many if not most countries. Here we don’t change the eligibility age, but instead ask how
employment is affected differentially by the provisions of the DI pathway compared to the provisions
of the regular social security pathway, and we consider the effect of changes in the provisions of DI
programs, especially changes in eligibility stringency. The simulations are all based on the country
estimates in Table 1a, specification 4. For each simulation the first stage is to calculate OVs
corresponding the programs or program changes that are being compared. Then the estimated effect
of the OV incentive effect from Table 1a, specification 4 (together with the estimates for other
variables in the specification) are used to simulate retirement at each age under each program or
program change for each person in the sample. Then the implications for years of employment
between ages 50 and 69 are calculated.

       Each country has reported the results of three simulations. The first simulation is intended to
evaluate the effect of the differential incentive effects inherent in the provisions of each pathway on
retirement—if all persons faced only one of the pathway options. For the US there are only two
pathways—Social Security or DI. For other countries there are three or more pathways. Each
country has used the Table 3-1 specification 4 coefficients to predict each individual's probability of
retirement for each pathway—for the US using the DI OVs and then using the SS OVs. These
estimates can also be found in the individual country chapters. For the Netherlands, for example,
there are three pathways—disability, unemployment, and retirement. The retirement probabilities
(hazard rates) by age and the cumulative proportion of persons still working (survival rates) by age
are shown in Figure 4-2. Separate lines are shown for each pathway in each country. The distance
between the lines for the different pathways varies across countries, depending on the differences in
the strength of the retirement incentives across the pathways.

       For illustration, consider the retirement rates and the survival rates for the Netherlands
compared to the US. The retirement rates are much greater in the Netherlands than in the US—at
age 60 the retirement rates are 0.1 or lower for each pathway; in the Netherlands the retirement rates
are close to three times as great, all greater than 0.27. Corresponding to the higher retirement rates
at each age the survival rate at each age is much higher in the US than in the Netherlands. For
example, at age 60 in the US employment is much higher than in the Netherlands—between 0.47 and
0.59 in the US and between 0.21 and 0.38 in the Netherlands, depending on the pathway to
retirement. The survival rates are only comparable across countries if the process begins at age 50
and are only shown for these countries. The hazard rates are provided for all countries for which the
data are available.

       For each program the countries have calculated the mean predicted retirement by99999 age
and have used these data to calculate the expected years of work between 50 and 59. For the US,
for example, the average years of work over the 50-69 age interval is simulated to be 10.18 years if
everyone faced the DI OVs and 11.93 years if everyone faced the SS OVs. That is, on average,
people work 17.3 percent more years when faced with the incentives inherent in the SS option rather
than the incentives inherent in the DI option. In the Netherlands the simulated years of work in the
50-65 age interval is 7.40 under the DI pathway, 9.02 under the unemployment pathway, and 7.47
                                                                                              34
under the retirement pathway. These simulated years worked between 50 and 69 for other countries
are shown by pathway in Table 4-1 below.

       It is important to understand that these differences indicate the marginal effect of the DI
incentive compared to the regular retirement incentive, holding constant all other individual attributes
included in the specification. In particular, it holds constant the estimated age dummies. For
countries with multiple pathways the process would be repeated for each of the pathways. To be
specific: We estimate the incentive effect of a retirement program—the effect of OVinclsive —with an
equation like this

R  k  aOVinclsive  bAge  cHealth  dEducation 

We estimate aˆ , bˆ, cˆ, dˆ and so forth. The estimate â (the estimates reported in Table 3-1) is an IV
estimate of the effect of the OV on retirement. For simulation we take â as the estimate of the effect
of OV on retirement and use it for all of the simulations. With a one year increase in age the effect
                             dR       dOV ˆ
on retirement is given by         aˆ        bAge , where the first term in negative ( â is negative) and the
                           dAge       dAge
second term positive—that is the first term reduces the incentive to delay retirement and the second
term increases the preference for retirement with advancing age. The likelihood of retiring advances
with age because of a reduction in the OV of continuing work is reinforced by the concomitant
increase in age. If age is excluded from the specification, then to fit the retirement data the coefficient
on OV will have to increase. And if the OVinclsive is eliminated from the specification the coefficient on
age will have to increase to fit the retirement data. This is the identification issue mentioned above.
In order to identify the correct effect of the incentive measure we must have an age specification that
captures the true increase in preference to retire with age. One feature of the estimates that
increases our confidence in the incentive estimates is that that are virtually the same whether the
single linear age or indicators for each age are used to estimate the effect of age on the preference to
retire.

       Instead of making calculations for all persons in the sample, the second and third simulations
consider only persons who were observed to have chosen the DI option. The second simulation asks
how much years of work would have changed for this group had the group faced the OVs of the
regular retirement option instead of the OVs of the DI program. For the US, among all those who
applied for DI, years worked under the SS option is 15.7 percent greater than under the DI option
(9.64 years versus 8.33 years; these values are lower than those for the full sample likely because DI
applicants are less healthy than the population at large). For all those who received DI, work under
the SS option would have been 16.2 percent greater under the SS option then under the DI option
(9.87 years versus 8.49 years).

         Recall again that in Phase 2 of the project we simulated the effect of delaying all program
eligibility ages by three years, including the eligibility ages for DI and unemployment programs. In
one of these simulations we used estimates with age dummies and in another we used estimates
based on continuous age. These simulations suggested very large reductions in retirement,
especially the simulations using age dummies in the estimation. The simulations proposed here do
                                                      35
not consider raising the DI eligibility age but rather direct attention to the incentive effects—the OVs—
of the program provisions, and stringency provisions, conditional on the estimated age “preference”
effects. It should not be surprising that the employment effect of changing the OV incentive effects is
typically much smaller than changing the program eligibility ages. Increasing the eligibility age for DI
for three years, for example means that no one can claim DI benefits for these three years and thus
cannot be on the DI program. This would cause great hardship to those who are truly disabled and
undermine the insurance role of DI. That is why we do not consider changing age of eligibility for the
DI programs as we did in Phase 2.

        The aim of the third simulation is to get an idea of the effect on retirement of greater stringency
in DI acceptance. As in the second simulation, we focus on DI recipients (or applicants, if available).
From that simulation, we have an estimate of expected working life if everyone follows the DI path
and if everyone follows the SS path. We now make similar calculations to show the effect of making
it harder for this group of people who are interested in using DI to access the program—in effect
changing the eligibility stringency. To do this, we first randomly assign 2/3 of the group to the DI path
and 1/3 to the SS path, calculate everyone’s expected probability of retirement, sum by age, and use
that to generate an expected work life from ages 50-69, as described above. We then repeat the
process but randomly assign 1/3 to the DI path and 2/3 to the SS path. (If there are more than 2
paths the simulations are done for different combinations of programs, making different assumptions
about which program persons use, if not to DI.) In the US, the expected work life is 8.328 years if
everyone takes the DI path (from the second simulation described above), 8.749 years with 2/3 on DI
path, 9.166 years with 1/3 on the DI path, and 9.635 years with all on the SS path (again from the
second simulation). Not surprisingly, shutting down the DI path for 1/3 of this sample has about 1/3
the effect of shutting it down for the full sample of DI applicants/recipients. Again, the idea of this
simulation is to simulate the work effect of making DI harder to access for a share of the population.

       The results of the simulations for most of the countries are reported in the Table 4-1 below.
The retirement programs that are compared for each country are shown in the first column of the
table. The countries in the table are ordered by the average number of years worked—between the
ages shown—for persons who retire under the “standard” retirement program—ranging from 11.93
years in the US and 11.3 years in the UK to 4.8 years in Denmark.

        The second column shows the years of work if all persons faced the same pathway option,
using all the pathways available in a given country. For the US, the years of work after age 50 would
be 10.18 if everyone faced the DI incentives and 11.93 if everyone faced the social security
incentives, a difference of 17.3%. The results differ across countries—for example the change in
years of work for Canada is only 6.7%, which is one-third the magnitude of the change in the US. This
in part reflects the size of the DI plan in Canada relative to the US.

The next column repeats the exercise, but uses the sample of disabled individuals only. The base
number of years worked for this sample is smaller in all countries, and the percent impact of varying
the incentives of this sample is smaller than for the entire sample in column 2.



                                                    36
The last two columns show the results of the simulation that randomly assigns the incentives, to
simulate the effect of making it more difficult for some DI applicants to access the program. The
patterns in the results are expected from the calculations—when two thirds of the sample is assigned
to the DI incentives, the results look closer to the column 2 results than when only one third of the
sample is assigned DI incentives . Overall, the simulations suggest that DI programs have a
noticeable impact on retirement across countries.

Notes:
Germany: The SOEF does not report DI application. Thus estimates for persons in the worst heatlh quitile are used in the
right three columns of the table. Japan: There are too few DI applicants to simulate reliable estimates. Spain: None of the
incentive estimates is significant; thus the simulations are not reported.

5. Conclusions

       This volume is the sixth phase of the ongoing project on Retirement Programs Around the
World. The focus is on the importance of disability programs (DI) and in particular the retirement
incentive effects of DI programs compared to other retirement programs. This is the second of two
phases on DI programs. The first DI phase (the fifth phase of the continuing project) presented
analysis of historical trends in our group of countries intended to set the stage for the more formal
analysis in the current volume. In the first DI phase, the countries summarized DI program reforms
and considered how DI reforms were related to changes in health, in particular measured by change
in mortality. We also considered DI reforms as natural experiments that showed that “exogenous”
reforms can have a very large effect on the labor force participation of older workers. The current
phase is also closely related to the second phase of the project, also based on microeconomic
analysis of the relationship between a person’s decision to retire and the program incentives faced by
that person. In particular, in the second phase the countries considered the employment implications
of increasing retirement program eligibility ages, including the eligibility ages for DI programs. The
analysis showed that increasing eligibility ages would have very large effects on employment at older
ages.

       In contrast, the current phase focuses on the retirement incentive effects of program provisions
without considering changes in program eligibility ages. We give attention to the provisions of DI
programs as well as the provisions of other pathways to retirement. The goal is to understand how
changing the provisions of country DI programs in particular would change retirement. Each country
estimated the relationship between program provisions and retirement incentives in their country
using an extension of the “option value model” used in the second phase of the program.

      Several noticeable findings of the paper are based on background summary data. First, the
proportion of men 60 to 64 collecting disability benefits ranges widely across countries, ranging from
17 percent in Belgium to 16 percent in the UK to 14 percent in the US to 6 percent in Italy and France to 2
percent in Japan—including Belgium and Italy that use a DI proportion different from the other countries.
Second, the data show that in all countries, with the exception of the United States, there was large
variation over time in DI participation rates with substantial decline in participation beginning in the
early to mid-1990s in many countries. For example, in Canada participation in the 60-64 age group
declined 49.6 percent between 1995 and 2009. In the UK, DI participation declined 49.6 percent
between 1996 and 2012. In the US on the other hand DI participation between 1990 and 2012
increased by over 30 percent. Third, variation in DI participation over time was unrelated to trends in
health, which improved consistently over time based on declines in mortality. Fourth, and perhaps
most striking, DI participation in all countries is very strongly related to education level, even
controlling for health. Fifth, descriptive data show a noticeable inverse relationship between DI
participation and employment over time.

     The measurement of health is a central component of the analysis. To maintain as much
comparability across countries as possible we use the health index developed by Poterba, Venti, and
                                                       39
Wise (PVW). The index as set out by PVW is the 1st principal component of 27 health indicators
reported in the United States Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The index can be duplicated
approximately through the nexus of comparable studies—the English Longitudinal Study of Aging
(ELSA), the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), and the Japan Study of
Aging and Retirement (JSTAR). These surveys include each of the 12 participating countries except
Canada. For reasons of sample size however alternative data sources have been used in Sweden,
Denmark, and Germany and these data do not provide sufficient health data to construct the PVW
index.

        Estimation is based on the regression counterpart to the Stock-Wise option value analysis in
which retirement is based on the gain (the option value) of delaying retirement. A unique feature of
the estimation in this phase is the “inclusive option value” that allows estimation based on the
provisions of all pathways to retirement in each country. Two features of the estimates stand out.
First the estimated option value incentive measure is highly statistically significant in each of the
countries with the exception of two countries—Spain and Germany-SHARE—where the SHARE
country data files were not large enough to support precise estimation. Second, the estimated effect
of the OV incentive measure is substantial in most countries. For example, a one standard deviation
increase in the option value (used as a standard measure across countries) reduces the estimated
retirement rate by between 4 and 6 percent in six countries by, between 8 and 9 percent in two
countries, and between 1 and 3 percent in three countries.

        The most important results are in the form of simulations. First simulations show that the
model estimates fit the data very well—which is to be expected in specifications in which age
indicators are estimated. Second, simulations of retirement rates by age and survival in the labor
force show very large variation across countries. Third, perhaps the most important simulations show
the importance on retirement of differences in the provisions of each pathway to retirement in each
country. These differences are estimated first by simulating the number of years worked between 50
and 69 if all persons faced only one of the pathways to retirement. For example, in the US, years
worked would be 10.18 if all persons faced the DI pathway provisions. If all persons faced the Social
Security pathway the average would be 11.93 years, an increase of 17.3 percent. In Belgium there
are four pathways with estimated hours of work between ages 50 and 69 of 5.36, 5.65, 5.71, and 7.54
for the CER, DI, UI, and OAP pathways respectively. Hours of work on the OAP pathway exceed
hours on the CER, DI, and UI pathways by 40.67 percent, 33.45 percent, and 32.05 percent
respectively.

       Fourth, simulations show the effect on retirement of increasing the stringency of admission to
the DI program. This simulation is especially relevant given the large reduction in DI participation in
many countries since the late 1980s and the mid-1990s. For example, if one third of the persons now
on DI in the US instead were eligible only for the Social Security program the hours of work of current
DI participants would be increased by 5.1 percent; if two thirds were eligible for the Social Security
program only hours of work of current DI recipients would be increased by 10.1%. A comparable
increase in the stringency of access to the DI program in the Netherlands would increase the years of
work of current DI recipients by 7.69 percent and 21.37 percent respectively.

       With large increases in life expectancy in all participating countries there is considerable
interest in prolonging working lives. Indeed, there has been a large increase in the employment of
men in most of the participating countries since the late 1980s and the mid-1990s—the same period
over which DI participation has been declining in most countries. Future increases in working lives
will depend on the capacity to work, which may depend on individual attributes such as education.
The capacity to work will be the topic of the next phase of the International Social Security Project.

using the Stock-Wise specification. Here Y is future wage income and B is social security benefit
income, which depends on the retirement age r. For simplicity, the probabilities of being alive to
collect the income or the benefits have been suppressed. The gain from postponing retirement to r,
versus retiring at age t, is given by

Considering this equation, we can see that there are two ways to calculate the option value used in
the analyses in this volume: One way is to use prior estimated values for the utility parameters γ, β,
and k. Instead, we assume these values:   0.75,   0.03, and k  1.5 , which are somewhat different
from estimates obtained by Stock and Wise (1990), especially the assumed value of β which is much
smaller than their estimated.
