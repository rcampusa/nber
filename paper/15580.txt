                                               ABSTRACT

The national terms of trade, defined as the ratio of an export price index to an import price index has
been extensively studied empirically. In this paper we construct an alternative measure, which we
call the consumption terms of trade. This measure recognizes the fact that consumers and firms face
different prices for the same items and consume different items. Using micro-data from the Economist
Intelligence Unit at the retail level, we conduct a forensic analysis of the variation of the terms of trade
of 38 countries. Using a novel variance decomposition method, we find that the bulk of terms of trade
variation is accounted for by oil, automobiles and medicine. The other goods in our construct tend
to exhibit balanced trade, providing a natural hedge against world price fluctuations. We find the consumption
terms of trade at local prices is more volatile than at world prices, but the two are strongly positively
correlated. The same commodities dominate the variance decomposition in both constructs, but variance
shifts from oil to medicine, when local prices are used, presumably due to larger LOP deviations in
the latter than the former. The significant differences in time paths of producer (conventional) and
consumer terms of trade suggests the need to adapt the elasticities approach to trade balance adjustment
to recognize different prices and baskets at the consumer and producer level.

1     Introduction

Movements in a nation’s terms of trade are widely viewed as important for

understanding the sources of business cycle ‡uctuations, the dynamics of the

trade balance and economic welfare. Backus, Kehoe and Kydland (1994)

emphasize the role of productivity movements across the United States and

Europe, with each assumed to specialize in a manufactured product. In
their model an increase in domestic productivity expands output at home
relative to output abroad and the terms of trade deteriorates. Simply put: a

large country expanding the supply of the traded good it produces must (in
equilibrium) drive down the relative price of its products on world markets.

The importing country’s terms of trade improves, a positive spillover. Backus

and Crucini (2000) add a third region to this model; a region that specializes

in oil production. When the oil region cuts back production, the relative

price of oil rises, improving the terms of trade of oil producers. Output falls

in the United States and Europe because oil is an intermediate input in the

production of manufactured goods. The business cycle implications of this

model are consistent with empirical work by Hamilton (1983) showing oil

price increases are leading indicators of U.S. recessions.    Mendoza (1995)

studies the terms of trade and business cycles in an extensive cross-country

panel using a partial equilibrium business cycle model where terms of trade

movements are exogenous. In his theoretical setting, terms of trade shocks are
analogous to lotteries with the sign and magnitude of the payout dependent

upon a country’s pattern of specialization across an array of internationally

traded goods.
   Three features handicap the practical value of most theoretical models of

the terms of trade, including those mentioned above. First, the models have

too few countries. In the two country model, it must be true that at least


                                      2
one of the two trading partners is large enough to alter its terms of trade.

In practice, countries with this amount of market power are in the minority.
Even more problematic is the fact that the terms of trade of the two countries
are perfectly negatively correlated with one another since one is the inverse

of the other. In contrast, the terms of trade of net oil importers tend to cor-
relate positively with each other and negatively with those of oil exporters,

particularly during periods of volatile oil prices. Second, the models have

too few goods. Adding countries that specialize in production means adding

goods as well. This makes the aggregate terms of trade a blunt instrument

for identifying the underlying sources of terms of trade movements. This is

why the empirical literature tends to focus on less-aggregated measures of the

terms of trade, at a minimum: energy and non-energy components. Third,

most international trade is …rm-to-…rm or intra-…rm (e.g. a multinational

purchasing parts from a foreign subsidiary) involving intermediate inputs.

In contrast, consumers purchase most of the items they consume from re-

tailers in local markets. It may be more appropriate to think of producers

and consumers interacting in segmented markets that are part of a larger
equilibrium process.

   This paper conducts a forensic analysis of the sources of terms of trade

variation of 38 countries, over the period 1990 to 2005. What makes our
analysis forensic is the use of micro-price data from the Economist Intelli-

gence Unit to parse the variance of the aggregate terms of trade into the

contributions of individual goods. The micro-price data in conjunction with


                                      3
trade shares helps us isolate the source of a nation’s terms of trade varia-

tion in the space of goods. Knowledge of trade shares and economic clout
of countries or regions in export markets provides indirect evidence on the
national origins of terms of trade shocks (OPEC’s role in the oil market, for

example).
   The use of retail prices in our terms of trade construct is non-standard. It

is intended to distinguish between relative prices of traded goods faced by a

nation’s consumers from the more conventional de…nition using trade prices

at the border. We refer to these constructs as the consumption terms of trade

and the production terms of trade, respectively. Conceptually, the consump-

tion terms of trade is the relative price that motivates shifts in consumption

demand between the home export and imports while the production terms

of trade is the relative price that in‡uences resource allocation across the

export and import-competing sectors.

   If producers and consumers face the same prices for imported and ex-

ported goods, the consumption and production terms of trade are equal and

a common terms of trade prevails. Improvements in the terms of trade mo-
tivate domestic producers to shift resources toward the production of exports

and away from imports, with consumption shifting in the opposite direction.

When the terms of trade in consumption di¤ers from the terms of trade in
production, the consumption, production and trade balance implications are

altered in fundamental ways. Yet before these implications can be under-

stood, we need to know how much the consumption and production terms of


                                      4
trade di¤er and understand the underlying sources of those di¤erences.

   The analysis begins with the study of commodity-level retail price in‡a-
tion and price level in‡ation for the world as a whole. This is accomplished
by averaging U.S. dollar prices of individual goods and services across as

many cities as available in the Economist Intelligence Unit retail price sur-
vey, the source of our consumer price data. The standard deviations of these

commodity-level in‡ation rates range from a low of 3.7% to a high of 11%;

the median is about 5%. Averaging these global price in‡ation rates across

goods and services provides our world in‡ation estimate, which turns out to

have a correlation of 0.88 with the o¢ cial OECD, U.S. dollar world in‡a-

tion rate. This high correlation is surprising given the EIU sample typically

comprises only one city per country and uses a di¤erent consumption basket

than o¢ cial estimates. It is also reassuring in the sense that the estimate

appears not to be systematically biased by these di¤erences. Next, a vari-

ance decomposition of world in‡ation is performed where the contribution of

each good’s in‡ation to aggregate world in‡ation is estimated. Prices with

relatively high variation and positive comovement with other prices in the
basket will contribute more to aggregate in‡ation variability for the same

reasons that high beta stocks contribute more than their portfolio weight to

the variance of a stock price index. Individual items are found to contribute
vastly di¤erent amounts to price level variability. Some of the usual suspects

show up at the upper end of the distribution, such as fuels, but individual

food items often display annual changes not unlike that of fuel.     Qualita-


                                      5
tively, what we see is analogous to what is already known at the national

level: food and energy prices are more volatile than the typical item found
in the consumption basket.
   The world price series at the microeconomic level form the basis of our

benchmark computations of the consumption terms of trade at world prices.
Using micro-data on trade ‡ows we construct import and export price indices

by weighting world prices (constructed from the EIU micro-data) by national

import and export trade shares. The ratio of the export price index to the

import price index is the terms of trade estimate. The consumption terms of

trade is somewhat less volatile than the production terms of trade in levels.

However, this di¤erence is nil in growth rates, when averages across the panel

of 38 countries are taken. As is true of the production terms of trade, the

variability of the consumption terms of trade di¤ers vastly across countries,

from a low of about 1% in Australia to a high of about 10% in Korea (in

levels).   Countries with high production terms of trade variability tend to

have high consumption terms of trade variability in log-levels, but this is not

true of growth rates. The correlation of the two measures within a country
averages 0.3 for log-levels and 0.4 for growth rates. The two measures, then,

are conceptually and empirically distinct.

   Decompositions of the aggregate consumption terms of trade into micro-
economic sources of variation at the good level is telling. The bulk of the

variability for most countries in the sample is accounted for by oil, automo-

biles and medicine. The role of oil in the production terms of trade has been


                                      6
extensively studied in the existing literature, the evidence here suggests that

this feature extends to the consumption level. The fact that one need not
go beyond a few key items to account for virtually all of the terms of trade
variance is a more novel …nding. Focusing on oil, automobiles and medicine

accounts for much of the secular swing in the consumption terms of trade
over the 1990 to 2005 period in our panel. Interesting, oil moves in an idio-

syncratic fashion relative to other world prices, helping to further distinguish

its role beyond its very skewed trade shares internationally.

   Movements in key world prices allow a classi…cation of 30 of the 38 coun-

tries into two groups, 10 countries with U-shaped terms of trade pro…les (7 of

these are oil exporters) and 20 countries with inverted U-shaped patterns (all

are oil importers). With few exceptions, patterns outside these two groups

and subtle di¤erences within the groups are elucidated by looking at di¤er-

ences in the relative importance of oil, automobiles and medicine. Ireland,

for example, experiences virtual continuous improvements in the consump-

tion terms of trade due to the pull of medicine prices on the export side

serving as an e¤ective counterweight to the drag of oil prices on the import
side.

   The analysis highlights the fact that what determines the marginal con-

tribution of a good to terms of trade variability is a country’s net trade
share in that good or sector. Due to the extensive volume of intra-industry

trade among most industrialized countries, the bulk of terms of trade risk

associated with world price movements is mostly hedged via balanced trade.


                                       7
Isolating the sources of variation then, requires the variance decomposition

method developed here which hinges on the use of micro-price data.
   The …nal section of the paper constructs the consumption terms of trade
at local prices using local retail prices to measure the import and export

prices rather than world prices. The trade weights remain the same as in
the benchmark case. This allows LOP deviations to in‡uence the terms of

trade. As one would expect, the terms of trade using local prices is typi-

cally more volatile than when world prices are used. However, the di¤erence

is surprisingly modest because the LOP deviations which distinguish world

prices from local prices tend to average out across goods. The redistribution

of the attribution of terms of trade variance across goods while notable, is

also modest. Mostly the contribution of oil falls while that of medicine rises.

This shift makes intuitive sense since international LOP deviations are plau-

sibly larger for medicine than oil. This is not to say that LOP deviations

are unimportant in a more general sense. Our focus on the terms of trade

means we ignore most of the service sector entirely. The prices of services

are known to exhibit larger and more persistent deviations from LOP than
are the prices of traded goods. It may also be true that LOP deviations for

services fail to average out across items to the extent found among traded

goods, contributing to greater volatility in the aggregate real exchange rate
than the consumption terms of trade.

2     The Terms of Trade

Consider the production terms of trade constructed as a constant-share-
weighted average of the logarithms of export and import prices.

where pxij;t is the free-on-board price of good i exported from country j, at

date t and pm
            ij;t is the price inclusive of insurance and freight imported into

country j.   These prices are denominated in U.S. dollars throughout the

paper. The export and import shares are, ij and ! ij , respectively and are
                    PM        PM
assumed to satisfy:  i=1 ij =  i=1 ! ij = 1 . The i index is used on both

the import and export side to account for the fact that countries may import

and export the same good, or at least goods that are di¢ cult to distinguish

given the published data. The summation should be thought of as being

taken over the union of all goods appearing on the export and import side

of the nation’s income and product accounts with many goods entering with

a zero trade weight on one side of the trade balance or the other.

    Our primary interest is a more novel concept, the consumption terms
of trade. The trade weights remain the same, but prices at the border are

replaced with retail prices. The benchmark is the case in which the LOP

holds across retail markets in all countries, for each good, in which case the
consumption terms of trade is given by:

                                 XM
                         c
                        qj;t =            (   ij   ! ij )pi;t .            (2)
                                    i=1


                                              9
where pi;t will be computed as the average U.S. dollar price of good i, across

all locations. For obvious reasons, this is de…ned as the consumption terms
of trade at world prices. Note the strong implication of the assumption of
common prices in all locations. The consumption terms of trade of each

country is simply a di¤erent geometric weighted average of a common vector
of world prices. Put di¤erently: the world price vector forms a common basis

for determining all price indices and relative prices of interest. The key insight

of this level of detail is that goods in which a country has balanced trade will

not contribute to the variance of the terms of trade. For example, if a country

imports oil and exports coal, commodities that produce energy demanded by

consumers, energy is not going to be a large part of what determines variation

in that nation’s terms of trade if the country has balanced trade in energy.

   In the penultimate section of the paper this measure is compared to the

consumption terms of trade at local prices.

                             c
                           qej;t =       (   ij   ! ij )pij;t .               (3)
                                     i

Note: the trade shares are the same as before, but the prices are now retail
prices paid by …nal consumers in country j, not world average prices. Note

that while the exports and imports of good i have the same price in the

home retail market, the retail prices of these same goods may di¤er across
countries for various reasons.

   The two measures of the terms of trade may be easily contrasted, as




                                             10
follows:
                                           X
                            c      c
                          qej;t = qj;t +       (   ij   ! ij )qij;t             (4)
                                           i

where qij;t = (pij;t pi;t ). In words: the consumption terms of trade of country
j at local prices equals the consumption terms of trade of country j at world
prices plus the net-trade-share-weighted average of the LOP deviations of

country j where those deviations are computed relative to the world average

price of each good, i.


3       The data

The source of the retail price data is the Economist Intelligence Unit World-

wide Survey of Retail Prices. The sample period runs from 1990 until 2005

and spans 123 cities and 301 goods and services. As these data have now

been quite extensively used elsewhere, our description is brief.1 The value of

these data in this application is that the basket contains the same items in all

cities, which contrasts signi…cantly with the practice of National Statistical

Agencies where the focus is on the goods typically consumed in a particular

city.   While one implication of this is that we may not match the o¢ cial
CPI in‡ation of a city, an advantage is that we are not averaging prices

of di¤erent goods across locations, which would not provide a meaningful
estimate of world-wide commodity level in‡ation at the microeconomic level.
The supplemental data we use includes very disaggregated import and export
    1
   See for example, Crucini and Shintani (2008), Frankel, Parsley and Wei (2008) and
Rogers (2008).



                                           11
shares and o¢ cial terms of trade data.

   To ensure reasonably broad coverage of the consumption basket only lo-
cations with at least 200 retail prices is included in the analysis. This re-
striction limits our sample to 82 of the 123 available cities, including 55 cities

in 28 OECD countries and 27 non-OECD locations. These include 13 cities
in the USA, 5 in Australia and Germany, 4 in Canada, 2 in each Japan,

Spain, France, Italy, Switzerland and New Zealand. The non-OECD loca-

tions include 5 cities in 3 oil-exporting countries, 9 Asian and Latin-American

countries each, and 3 African countries.

   Products whose prices are used in the construction of our terms of trade

measure account for 21.1% of the expenditure found in the US CPI basket.

Given that the consumption share of tradables in the U.S. CPI is only about

31.8%, these products account for 66% of the tradables in the U.S. consump-

tion basket. In terms of CPI sub-indices, coverage rates are: 93% for clothing,

72% for alcoholic beverages, 70% for food at home, 61% for transportation

goods, 40% for personal care products, 24% for household furnishings and

19% for recreation goods.
   Our trade shares are drawn from the UN Comtrade database. Speci…cally,

the 6-digit 2002 Harmonized System of import and export volumes in U.S.

dollars for the year 2007. Each good in the EIU retail price survey is matched
to one of these 6-digit trade volumes. The sample includes members of the

OECD, China, Brazil, Russia, India, several major oil exporting countries

and Asian exporters. Among these countries, our retail price data cover


                                       12
and average of 19% of imports and 18% of exports (we do not include re-

exports or re-imports). The primary reason these numbers are not higher
is that much of international trade is in intermediate goods, whereas retail
purchases are mostly …nal goods. The import coverage ratios reach up to

30% for Greece, but are as low as 6% for Singapore, which seems due to the
paucity of electronic goods in the EIU survey in the latter case. The export

coverage ratios range between 77% for Saudi Arabia and 3.5% for Singapore.


4     World in‡ation

Recall, our estimate of the consumption terms of trade at world prices re-

quires estimates of world price series by good. The commodity-level in‡ation

estimates are in‡ation rates, in U.S. dollars, of a particular good, i,   pi;t ,

averaged across all available cities in the EIU sample, indexed by j,
                                            X
                                            N
                                        1
                             pi;t = N              pij;t .                (5)
                                             j=1

The number of locations varies somewhat across goods. We restrict the

sample of locations to those with at least 200 price observations.
    Aggregate world in‡ation (again, in the units of the numeraire currency,

the U.S. dollar) is the average across commodities of these in‡ation rates,
                                   1 X
                                            84
                              pt =        pi;t .                          (6)
                                   84 i=1
The use of equal weights may be justi…ed theoretically by the zero degree

homogeneity of demand functions in which case the interpretation is that our

aggregate price level is a numeraire, not a price index.

                                        13
   Figure 1 presents the in‡ation series for each of the 84 goods used to

estimate world in‡ation while Figure 2 presents the aggregate in‡ation rate,
the left-hand-side of the expression. The common in‡ation factor across
goods is obvious from visual inspection of Figure 1, further con…rmed by the

fact that the median correlation of in‡ation at the good and aggregate level
is a remarkable 0.92.

   World in‡ation averaged 1.7% over the sample period (1991 to 2005).

Two years exhibited signi…cant de‡ation, 1997 (-6.0%) and 2000 (-7.6%),

while in‡ation was very high in 1994 (6.9%), 2003 (8.6%) and 2005 (6.8%).

The correlation of this in‡ation measure with the o¢ cial estimate of OECD

in‡ation in U.S. dollars is 0.88.

   To more fully understand the role of individual prices in the evolution of

the aggregate in‡ation rate we use the portfolio-inspired variance decomposi-

tion used by Crucini and Landry (2009) to study the microeconomic sources

of aggregate real exchange rate variation. The variance of aggregate in‡a-

tion may be expressed in terms of the covariance of aggregate in‡ation and

good-level in‡ation:

                                   1 X
                                        84
                       var( pt ) =        cov( pi;t ; pt ) .              (7)
                                   84 i=1

Dividing through by the variance of aggregate in‡ation gives the variance

decomposition:
                                      1 X
                                             84
                                 1=               i   .                   (8)
                                      84 i=1
The decomposition centers the distribution of the contributions of good-level

                                        14
in‡ation to aggregate in‡ation variability, the average beta, at unity. Thus,

the average good contributes its weight to the total variance, 1=84. Goods
with betas exceeding unity contribute more than the average good while
goods with betas less than unity contribute less. Since beta can be negative,

a commodity may reduce aggregate in‡ation variability. The interpretation
is that adding such a price to the commodity basket will reduce the variance

of the aggregate in‡ation rate. As it turns out, no commodity-level in‡ation

in the micro-sample has a negative covariance with the world in‡ation level,

the lowest beta is 0.56.

   The betas may alternatively be expressed in terms of the standard devi-

ation of commodity-level in‡ation relative to aggregate in‡ation multiplied

by the sample correlation of the two:

                                     i
                             i   =       corr( pi;t ; pt )                (9)


Figure 3, plots kernel density estimates relating to this decomposition. The

upper-left chart is the kernel estimate of the standard deviation of in‡ation
across goods, it ranges from about 3.75% to about 8.68% (see also Table 1).

There is considerable central tendency of commodity-level in‡ation near the

level of aggregate in‡ation variability, 4.75%. The upper-right panel is the
relative standard deviation, one component that in‡uences how individual

goods contribute to aggregate in‡ation variability. The values range from a

low of 0.79 to a high of 1.83.
   The lower-left panel is the estimated distribution of the betas, the dis-


                                            15
tribution of the contributions of commodity level in‡ation to the variance of

aggregate in‡ation. These average to 1 by construction, but vary consider-
ably across goods, from a low of 0.56 for oil to a high of 1.45 for lettuce. It
may seem surprising that oil contributes the least to world in‡ation variabil-

ity, given the attention oil prices draw in discussions of monetary policy. The
conventional wisdom that oil is among the most variable prices is valid, even

at the retail level: it ranks fourth among the 84 commodities in our in‡ation

construct. What sets oil apart is that it has the lowest correlation with the

aggregate in‡ation level of any commodity in our sample, at 0.35. The me-

dian correlation of good-level in‡ation with aggregate in‡ation is 0.92. The

…nal chart is a kernel estimate of the correlation of commodity-level in‡ation

with the aggregate in‡ation rate.


5    The consumption terms of trade

Recall, the consumption terms of trade at world prices is de…ned as:

                                  X84
                         qj;t =           (   ij   ! ij )pi;t .           (10)
                                    i=1


Figures 4 and 5 present a comparison of our estimate of the U.S. consumption
terms of trade and the conventional production terms of trade as well as the
import and export price indices used in the construction of each. Because

the o¢ cial data is available quarterly but our retail price data is annual, we
present a …gure with the original o¢ cial data as well as a version where we
take quarterly averages to make them more comparable to our estimates.

                                          16
Each …gure contains four charts, the left-most charts are the terms of trade,

the di¤erences between the two lines in the right-hand-charts, which contain
the import and export price indices.
   The U.S. consumption terms of trade displays a distinctive secular swing

over from 1990 to 2005. This is true of 10 of the 12 cases for which we have
both measures of the terms of trade (not shown). The most frequent pattern,

found in 6 of 12 cases, Finland, France, Italy, Korea, Netherlands and the

U.S. is an inverted U-shape, with terms of trade improvements followed by

deterioration.   Four are reversed, U-shaped patterns (Australia, Canada,

Denmark and New Zealand), with the terms of trade deteriorating during

the …rst half of the sample and then improving in the second half. Two terms

of trade measures exhibit virtual continuous improvement (Switzerland and

United Kingdom).     We will explore these striking similarities in the next

section.

   Turning to the production terms of trade, the relative price of exports

to imports using prices at the border, the patterns share similarities and

di¤erences to the consumption terms of trade. The distinctive U-shapes
and inverted U-shapes are largely gone. Denmark, the Netherlands, New

Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom show general terms of trade

improvements.    Canada and Australia maintain some of their original U-
shaped paths. Finland, Korea and Italy have deteriorating terms of trade

over much of the sample. The picture for France is ambiguous, due to low

variability. The United States has a somewhat inverted U-shape (see Figure


                                       17
4 or 5), but the timing is di¤erent from what the consumption terms of trade

shows.
   Table 2 reports standard deviations of log-level and growth rates for both
terms of trade measures, as well as their contemporaneous correlation. The

production terms of trade tend to be more volatile than the consumption
terms of trade, though this di¤erence largely disappears in the move to

growth rates, where the average standard deviation in the production terms

of trade is 2.3, compared to 2.4 for the consumption terms of trade. Thus,

the di¤erences between the two is not merely less volatile prices at the retail

level than at the border. The two measures move weakly together in log-

levels, where the correlation is about 0.3, on average, and somewhat more

strongly in growth rates, where the correlation is 0.4, on average.

   Since the production and consumption terms of trade are di¤erent concep-

tually, it is not clear that a high correlation between them is to be expected.

Moreover, the construction of the consumption terms of trade uses average

international retail prices, while the terms of trade uses prices at the customs

point of entry or exit of each country. Given that deviations from the LOP
have been widely documented in the literature, this is another source of dif-

ference between the two measures. The role of LOP deviations is evaluated

in the penultimate section of the paper. The question we turn to next is:
what is generating the trends and ‡uctuations in the consumption terms of

trade? As was noted earlier, there appear to be a few common secular trends

shared by certain groups of countries. It will be interesting to see if those


                                      18
common features are driven by trade patterns and particular properties of a

few key international prices, such as the price of oil.

5.1    Variance decomposition

The variance of a nation’s terms of trade satis…es the following equation:
                               1 X
                                   84
                  var(qj;t ) =        (   ij    ! ij )cov(qj;t ; pi;t ) .                  (11)
                               84 i=1
Dividing both sides by the variance of the terms of trade, gives the variance

decomposition:
                             1 X
                                    84
                          1=        (      ij    ! ij )   i;j   ,                          (12)
                             84 i=1
The betas are e¤ectively the coe¢ cients from a regression of the commodity-

level price on the consumption terms of trade             i;j   = cov(qj;t ; pi;t )=var(qj;t ).

   The analysis starts by pulling back to the broadest picture, pooling all

good and locations. Figure 6 plots two kernel density estimates, one for the

net trade share and the other for the betas. These two distributions contain

all of the elements needed to decompose the variance of the terms of trade.

   The net trade shares lie almost exclusively between plus and minus 5%.

Recall, these are normalized so that for each country the import shares (and
export shares) sum to unity. The net trade shares for oil are extreme out-

liers, averaging 40% across countries, while various categories of cars have an

absolute net trade share that averages about 30%. Not surprisingly, these
items will exert a disproportionately large in‡uence on the terms of trade.

   The beta distribution lies mostly between plus and minus 3, with a strong

central tendency toward the mean of about 0.25. Since the contribution to

                                          19
variance is the product of the net trade share and beta, values in the tail of

the distribution are what dominate the variance decomposition of the terms
of trade. To see this more clearly, it is productive to look to the details of
the distribution of products of the net import share and beta: (   ij   ! ij )   i;j .

   Figure 7 plots the contributions to variance, the product of the net trade
share and beta, for each commodity and country in our sample. Since there

are 84 commodities and 38 countries, there are 3,192 values plotted in this

…gure. The upper panel orders the contributions by commodity and the lower

panel orders the contributions by country. In the upper panel, the vertical

red lines mark the variance contributions by good with points between the

lines denoting a country-speci…c variance contribution for that good. In the

lower panel, the vertical red lines mark variance contribution by country

with points between the lines denoting good-speci…c variance contributions

for that country. The variance contributions organized by country will sum

to unity within each interval by construction.

   The clusters of extreme values in the upper chart identify commodities

that contribute considerably more to terms of trade variation than the typical
item. To see this more clearly, Figure 8 focuses on the seven most important
contributors to consumption terms of trade variability. In order of ascending

importance, they are: pullovers; boneless beef; luxury, compact and large
cars; medicine and oil. The contribution from oil averages 0.6. In other

words, oil alone accounts for about 60% of the variation in the terms of trade

when we average across our 38 nations. Medicine accounts for about 12%


                                     20
of terms of trade variation, the three automobile categories combined are

comparable at 11%, while pullovers and boneless beef each account for about
2%. To place these numbers in perspective, the next 20 items in the ranking
combine to account for the same percentage as medicine. The reader should

keep in mind that the composition of in‡uences di¤ers across countries, which
is masked by the cross-country averaging discussed here. The cross-country

di¤erences in the contribution of each commodity is visible in the variation

within the commodity partitions of Figure 8.

5.2    Goods prices and the terms of trade

Based on the variance analysis (displayed in Figure 8), it seems su¢ cient

to focus on the time paths of the U.S. dollar prices of the items found to

be most in‡uential in the evolution of the aggregate consumption terms of

trade: oil, automobiles and medicine. Figure 9 plots the U.S. dollar prices of

these …ve goods.

   Two features of these price histories are worth emphasizing. The …rst is
that oil prices have a large idiosyncratic component: the other four series

track each other very closely. This is consistent with the earlier decomposi-

tion of the variance of world in‡ation: the median correlation of good-level
and aggregate in‡ation is 0.92, while the correlation of oil in‡ation with world

in‡ation is a mere 0.35.

   The second striking feature of Figure 9 is that oil prices are not much
more variable than the typical commodity price in these data. This is a


                                      21
re‡ection of two facets of our analysis. First, the fact that we use prices paid

by …nal consumers rather than prices determined in commodity exchanges
such as the Chicago Board of Trade. Thus our ‘oil’price is a retail fuel price,
not the price of a barrel of crude petroleum. The former is much less volatile

than the latter at annual frequencies, in most time periods. Second, we use
micro-data which highlights the fact the retail prices do move around a great

deal and the aggregate CPI index tends to obscure this by averaging away

much of the idiosyncratic variation. Thus retail prices are much more volatile

than the price level, which is more familiar to macroeconomists.

   The distinctive paths of these prices along with their dominate contri-

bution to the terms of trade variance for the median country, already docu-

mented, suggests a convenient link between the aggregate consumption terms

of trade and a few key prices. In a nutshell, countries with net positive expo-

sure to oil (net exporters) should have an inverted U-shaped terms of trade

path, following the path of oil’s price while those with a net negative expo-

sure in oil and positive exposure in medicine or automobiles should have a

U-shaped pattern, following the evolution of these other prices.
   To document this as clearly as possible the terms of trade is built up in

stages, beginning with the oil terms of trade, then adding medicine, then

automobiles and …nally, everything else, to arrive at the aggregate consump-
tion terms of trade. Figures 10 through 13 do precisely this for each of the

38 countries in our sample. Figure 10 focuses on the eight oil exporters in

our panel: Canada, Denmark, Mexico, Norway, Russia, Saudi Arabia, United


                                      22
Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. Figures 11 to 13 focus on the thirty

oil net-importers.
      The terms of trade for oil is, by de…nition, just the path of oil prices
at the retail level (with 1990 = 0, the base year), scaled by the net trade

share in fuel.2 Thus, the dashed red lines in all …gures are either perfectly
positively correlated with the world price of oil (for net exporters) or perfectly

negatively correlated with the world price of oil (for net importers). If this

was the complete picture, net exporters would experience a secular decline in

their terms of trade followed by a secular rise, due to oil’s price movements –

a U-shaped pattern. For net importers, we would see an inverted U-shaped

terms of trade pro…le. Moreover, the red dashed lines (oil terms of trade)

and the solid black lines (overall terms of trade), would be the same.

      While, this is, of course an over-simpli…cation, it is the case that oil dom-

inates the secular movements in almost every case, with net exporters of oil

having U-shaped terms of trade (Figure 10) and net importers of oil tending

toward an inverted U-shaped terms of trade (Figures 11 to 13). The pattern

among net importers of oil is more complex than this stylized description,
partly because their trade patterns are more complex on both the export and

import side. Oil exporters, in contrast tend to be concentrated on the export

side and less concentrated on the import side. For them, complexity lies on
the import side of the ledger, for the most part.
  2
    The net fuel share is zero for Hong Kong, Iceland and Luxembourg. Thus, for these
three the oil terms of trade is constant, re‡ecting a perfect hedge.




                                         23
   In most of the oil importing countries, the terms of trade in oil is the

lower envelope of the other terms of trade constructs. What prevents the
overall terms of trade from behaving similarly is that other items are fueling
improvements at the same time oil is sapping the fuel. Perhaps the clearest

examples of this is Ireland (Figure 12) where oil prices contribute to terms of
trade deterioration over the last third of the sample, but this is completely

swamped by the improvements in the terms of trade in medicine. Moreover,

during the …rst third of the sample medicine and oil prices are moving in

the same direction, reinforcing the improving trend in Ireland’s terms of

trade.   Automobiles, a net import, are a drag on Ireland’s terms of trade

more signi…cant even than oil (comparing the green and blue dashed lines of

Figure 12). However, medicine is su¢ cient to keep the Irish terms of trade

rising on trend for almost the entire sample period.

   Korea is an even clearer case in point as a major oil importer and auto-

mobile exporter, only two lines are visible, medicine and other goods play

no role (this is not to say other goods are individually unimportant, as they

may average out across goods). Automobile price increases buoyed Korea’s
terms of trade until the last third of the sample when oil prices rose relative

to automobile prices. Israel is a case were oil is a signi…cant terms of trade

drag, but automobiles and medicine are not helpful in accounting for the
terms of trade, here exploration of the sources of variation would need to go

beyond these three items.




                                      24
5.3    The consumption terms of trade at local prices

Up to this point we have maintained that the LOP price holds for retail
prices. However, a large literature emphasizes that LOP deviations are large

and persistent, particularly so when consumer prices are the focus. The
consumption terms of trade at local prices allows for these deviations:

                                     X
                             c
                           qej;t =       (   ij   ! ij )pij;t .              (13)
                                     i

                                      c            c
Figure 14 presents a scatterplot of qej;t against qj;t pooling all cities and time

periods. The blue dots are levels while the red dots are changes. The corre-

lation of the two is 0.59 in levels and 0.45 in changes, when all locations and

time periods are pooled together. As expected, the variability of the terms

of trade is generally higher when local prices are used as is evident in the

increase in time series variance from 3.28 to 5.62 for the median country in

levels and from 2.69 to 4.68 for growth rates.

   Allowing for LOP deviations matters for some countries more than others.

To see the heterogeneity across countries, Table 3 reports the correlation of
the two terms of trade measures for each country. The median correlation

is 0.60, which turns out to be Finland; the range of correlations is very

wide, from -0.62 for Hong Kong to 0.91 for the USA. When we examine the
decomposition of the variance across goods, the reasons for the di¤erences at

the aggregate level will become clear.

   Toward this end, consider how the variance of the terms of trade gets
distributed across goods based on our methodology. Taking the variance

                                             25
decomposition for the consumption terms of trade at local prices less the

variance decomposition for the consumption terms of trade at world prices,
gives:
                                    X
                                    M
                       0=M      1
                                          (     ij    ! ij )(ei;j   i;j )
                                    i=1

where ei;j = cov(ec
                 qj;t ; pij;t ) and       i;j
                                                        c
                                                 = cov(qj;t ; pi;t ), the   ’s from the vari-
ance decompositions of the two measures of the terms of trade. Since both

measures use the same weights, the shift in the allocation of variance across

goods boils down to a comparison of ’s across goods. Goods with ei;j >                     i;j

will have their role in the variance decomposition elevated in the move to

local prices, while those with the opposite sign will be demoted in relative

importance.

   The fact that relatively few goods account for the bulk of the variation

of the consumption terms of trade at world prices is also true for the con-

sumption terms of trade at local prices. Table 4 reports the contribution

to variance of the 12 most important goods for both measures of the terms

of trade. The two lists have 11 common goods. Moving from world prices

to local prices causes the variance contribution of oil to fall by about 10%
from 0.61 to 0.51 while the contribution of medicine rises by 11%, from 0.13

to 0.24. This is consistent with LOP deviations tending to be larger for
medicine than oil.
   The last part of the analysis revisits the question of the correlation be-

tween the production terms of trade and the consumption terms of trade, now
allowing for LOP deviations. Table 5 shows that the consumption terms of

                                                 26
trade is now consistently more variable than the production terms of trade

(8 of 13 countries). The two are less correlated than what was found using
world prices, possibly due to larger deviations from the LOP at the retail
stage than at the border.


6     Discussion

Our …ndings regarding the importance of oil are reminiscent of the analysis

of Backus and Crucini (2000), who documented the extraordinary extent to

which oil dominated the variation in the terms of trade of major industri-

alized countries from the 1970’s to the middle of the 1980’s. The thrust of

their analysis was to show how business cycle comovement evolved as the

importance of oil shocks relative to total factor productivity shocks changed

across historical periods and a¤ected importers di¤erently than exporters.

    Figure 15 displays the quarterly data used in their paper along with the

relative price of oil in U.S. terms. By the latter, we mean the U.S. dollar

spot price of crude petroleum divided by the U.S. consumer price index. In

the …gure, the oil price is normalized so that it’s standard deviation matches

the standard deviation of the average of the terms of trade across all the

countries in the sample (the lower-right chart displays this average terms of
trade variable).

    The standard deviation of the average terms of trade for the group is

about 5.5%, while the standard deviation of the relative price of oil is an
astounding 74%. Japan has the highest terms of trade variation at 21%,

                                     27
while Switzerland’s is the most stable at 3.6%. Di¤erencing both the terms

of trade and the relative price of oil leave the basic implication unchanged,
oil plays a large role, mostly because it has enormous variation relative to
the terms of trade. The ratio of standard deviation of oil to that of the terms

of trade, in levels or growth rates, is about 10.
   We view our preliminary …ndings as pointing to a broader role for a

small set of goods to dominate a nation’s terms of trade variation than was

previously thought. Uncovering this feature of the data would have been

daunting without the novel variance decomposition employed here. The fact

that oil dominates in a broad cross-section is consistent with prior work on oil

and the terms of trade. The notion that individual items other than oil may

dominate within the cross-section of countries is novel. Moreover, it also

suggests the value of organizing countries on the basis of their net export

shares and a larger set of commodities than focused upon here. In focusing

on the average country or group of countries, we have likely missed some

important micro-drivers of national terms of trade histories. It would also

be interesting to consider how the in‡uential set has evolved over time and
across countries, analogous to how oil’s role as been historically punctuated.

Unlike oil and other commodities where comparative advantage is largely

endowed, manufacturers and increasingly services play a large role in trade
and are likely to be more geographically footloose.

   The empirical di¤erences between the consumption and production terms

of trade are compelling, though it is too early in the research program to say


                                      28
how they relate to the broader literature on markups and distribution costs.

If the consumption terms of trade is fundamentally di¤erent than the pro-
duction terms of trade, the trade balance adjustment process on the demand
and supply side needs to be elaborated. The common use of one elasticity

to relate prices to the trade balance condition is likely muddling consump-
tion and production elasticities and two relative prices (the consumption and

production terms of trade) rather than one.

   Our results are subject to a number of important caveats. First, the

Economist Intelligence Unit sample, while comprehensive, certainly does not

cover the universe of consumption items and misses intermediate goods that

are used by …rms and not used by consumers. This combined with the need

to reconcile …nal goods with trade shares, leads inevitably to some errors

and omissions in prices and trade weights. Second, the short sample also

prevents us from back-casting our analysis before 1990, when the EIU survey

was …rst developed. We hope to deal with some of these issues in future

work, such as using the Penn World Table data to push the sample back

in time. Finally, the comparisons with the o¢ cial, or production terms of
trade as we call it, is a crude starting point. We lack micro-prices at the

border to conduct an analogous variance decomposition of the o¢ cial terms

of trade into its microeconomic determinants. Such an exercise will likely
assign an important role for price variation of di¤erent brands in the terms

of trade. That is, the hedging argument implicit in our use of the net trade

share interacted with a single price (either the world price or the local price)


                                      29
becomes an imperfect hedge in the realistic cases in which the U.S. dollar

in‡ation rates of say, imported Mercedes and exported In…nity sedans are
less than perfectly correlated. Much remains to be done.
