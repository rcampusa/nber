               Strikes and Wazes: A Test of a Signalling Model




                                  Abstract




     This paper, describes a simple model of labor disputes based on the

hypothesis that unions use strikes to infer the level of profitability

of the firm.    The implications of the model are then tested using data

on wage outcomes, strike probabilities, and strike durations for      a

large sample of collective bargaining agreements. Negotiated wages are

found to depend negatively on regional unemployment rates and

positively on industry-specific selling prices.     Contrary to the basic

premis of the model, however, there is no evidence of    a   systematic

relation between wages and strike outcomes.     Increases in unemployment

are found to decrease the probability of strikes, while increases in

industry selling prices increase the probability of disputes.       Strike

durations are only weakly related to unemployment and industry prices,

but are negatively correlated with industry output.

         Strikes and Wages:   An Empirical Test of a Signallina Model



     It has long been recognized that any consistent theoretical model of

strikes must appeal to some form of imperfect    information)   Recently,    a

great deal of progress in the theoretical analysis of strikes has been made

by focusing on the simple case of one-sided asysunetric information,2 In

this setup,   the underlying profitability of the firm is unknown to union

members, and a strike is used by workers to price discriminate against more

profitable employers.   This class of models is appealing not only for its

ability to explain the occurrence of costly disputes, but also for the

richness of its empirical implications.     Simple signalling-typemodels

specify the determinants of the probability and duration of disputes,       as

well as the relation between observed wage settlements and their associated

strike outcomes.3

     This paper is an attempt to test both sets of implications using wage

end strike information for a large sample of collective bargaining

agreements from the Canadian manufacturing sector.     In the first section of

the paper, a simple theoretical model     is presented that describes wage

rates and strike outcomes in terms of a small set of underlying parameters:

the mean and dispersion in profitability of the firm, the level of wages

available to workers elsewhere in the economy, and the risk preferences of


     1The role of imperfect information in generating disputes was
emphasized by Hicks (1963) and many subsequent authors, including in
particular Ashenfelter and Johnson (1969). Kennan (1986) provides a brief
summary of the historical development of theoretical models of strikes.

     2See in particular Hayes (1984), Morton (1983), Sobel and Takahashi
(1983), Fudenberg and Tirole (1983), Crampton (1984), and Hart (1986).

     3The empirical implications of simple one-sided asymmetric information
models of strikes are explored by Fudenberg, Levine, and Ruud (1985), Tracy
(1986, 1987), and McConnell (1987a, l987b).

union members.4 The model predicts the existence of a simple concession

schedule relating lower wage settlements to longer strikes.    In addition,

the model describes the effects of the predetermined variables on wage

settlements and strike probability and duration.

     In the second section of the paper these predictions are tested

against the contract data.   Industry-specific output and selling prices and

regional unemployment rates are used as indicators for the expected

profitability of the firm and the alternative opportunities of workers.

Models are fit for the negotiated wage rate, the probability of disputes,

and the conditional duration of work stoppages.    In all cases these models

include firm-and-union-specificbargaining pair effects,    to abstract from

any systematic differences across pairs.

     The results of the empirical analysis do not yield much support for

the model,   On one hand, there is no evidence of a systematic negative (or

positive) tradeoff between wages and strike duration.    On the other hand,

while the reduced form relation between wage and strike outcomes and

regional unemployment is consistent with the predictions of the model, the

relation with industry-specific selling prices is not.    Other findings also

cast doubt on the model, including a strong correlation between wildcat

strikes and subsequent contract strikes, and the finding that unexpected

real wage changes during the previous contract lead to higher wages and

reduced strike activity in the next one.   A simple model of strikes and

wages with one-sided asymmetric information does not capture all the

features of the wage and strike outcomes in this data set.



     4The model is similar to ones developed by Hayes (1984) and Morton
(1983).

I.   A SimDle Sianalling Model of Strikes

     This section outlines a simple model of disputes based on the

hypothesis that unions use strikes to price discriminate against more

profitable employers.5 Bargaining power in the model rests with the union,
                                                      6
who make take-it or leave-it offers to the firm.          With complete

information on the state of demand, the union sets higher wages in high-

demand states, and lower wages in low-demand states.         If demand is not

directly observable, however, the union cannot rely on the firm to reveal

its private information.    Nonetheless, the union can improve upon the

strategy of a fixed wage demand by offering the firm a downward sloping

wage-strike schedule.    Faced with such a schedule, the firm chooses a

shorter strike and a higher wage in high-demand states, and a longer strike

and a lower wage in low-demand states.        Strikes therefore serve as a signal

for the state of demand, enabling the union to price discriminate against

more profitable employers.

     The focus of the presentation is   ott   the empirical implications of the

model: specifically,    the reduced-form determinants of wage and strike

outcomes,   and the nature of the wage-strike concession schedule.         To keep

the model as simple as possible,   I have adopted specific functional form


assumptions that allow explicit solutions for wage and strike outcomes.

      The driving variable in the model is the value of output,      G,   which is

assumed to be a random variable whose realization is known to the firm, but


     5The basic idea of this class of models was developed independently by
Hayes (1984) and Morton (1983). The model presented here is more similar
to Morton's.

     6Kennan (1986, pp. 1104-1110) develops a simple cooperative bargaining
model that has many of the same features.
                                               4

unknown to workers.         I assume that 8 is uniformly distributed on the

 interval [81,82], and that output per worker per unit           of   time is fixed.8

Bargaining involves the determination of a wage payment w and a strike

length   s.   It   is convenient to think of s as the fraction of some exogenous

contract period lost to a work stoppage.            During the remaining period each
worker produces (1      -
                            s)   units of output.   The firm's profits per worker,

given 8, w, and s, are

      (1)      (1-a) (8-w).

     During a work stoppage, union members earn an opportunity wage a.

Total receipts per worker are therefore

      (2)     r      (1-a) w      +   s a.

I assume that the opportunity wage is always less than                the lower bound
                                                                8l
of 8, so that full production (i.e. sâ€”O) is optimal in the absence of

asymmetric information.          Workers are assumed to evaluate a particular

distribution of receipts according to the expected value of u(r)            ,   where u

is a constant absolute risk aversion utility function with risk parameter

R.

     The bargaining problem can be thought of as one of choosing a wage-

strike schedule w(s) that maximizes E(u(r)) subject to the constraint that

for any given schedule w(s), and any realization of productivity,               the firm

will choose a profit-maximizing strike length.9            The union is assumed to


     7For much of the theoretical analysis it is sufficient to have 8
distributed on a closed interval with strictly positive density and a
strictly increasing hazard function.

     8Alternatively,        9 can be interpreted as the realization of a
productivity shock.

     9For a given wage-strike schedule, the model is therefore formally
equivalent to Ashenfelter and Johnson's (1969) model of strikes.
                                                                                    5

have information on the value of a and on the parameters of the

distribution of                8.     Variation over time in wage and strike outcomes

therefore reflects predictable variation due to changes in these

parameters, and unpredictable variation due to the specific realization

of   8.


        Analytically, it is more convenient to express the bargaining problem

as one of choosing a pair of functions w(9) and s(8) to maximize the

expected utility of union receipts,                                         subject to the incentive compatibility

constraint that the firm is willing to declare                                                    8    truthfully,          and subject to

the individual rationality constraint that profits are large enough in

every state to induce the firm to participate in the agreement.                                                                  Let

11(0,8)         denote the profits of the firm when productivity is 8 and it

declares a level of productivity                                      8,    and let         11(8)          11(9,0).    Then

        11(8,8)   â€”       (1   -
                                    s(0))        (8       -


                  â€”
                          11(9)      +       (1       -
                                                              s(8))    (9       -
                                                                                     8).
The incentive compatibility constraint is

        11(0)     >       11(0,9)        â€”    11(0) +                 (1    -       s(9))   (0 -      8).
Reversing the roles of 8 and 8 leads to a conformable expression which may

be combined with this one to yield

        (3)      (1   -
                           s(8))      (8     -
                                                 0)           >    11(9)        -
                                                                                    11(8)    >        (1   -
                                                                                                               s(8))   (8   -
                                                                                                                                9).
Since strike length is bounded between 0 and                                                 1,     equation (3) implies that

11(9)    is non-decreasing in                     8.           A   comparison of the right- and left-hand

expressions of (3) also shows that s(8) is non-increasing in 8.

Furthermore, (3) implies that                                  11(0)       is convex, and therefore differentiable

almost everywhere,                  with derivative

        II'(0)    â€” (1         -
                                   s(8)).
                                                               6


      Assuming that the firm can earn zero profits by simply closing down,

the individual rationality constraint is 11(G) > 0 for all 6.                                        Since   11   is


non-decreasing, this condition is satisfied if and only if                                               >   0.

Thus necessary conditions for incentive compatibility and individual

rationality are             11(G1)
                                     >   0,   s(9) non-increasing (and between 0 and                     1)       and

It is straightforward to show that these three conditions are also

sufficient for incentive compatibility and individual rationality.

          If   11(9),   w(G),    and s(G) are differentiable at a point 6, with a < 1 and

s'(9)            0, then the condition 1I'(9)                  1    -
                                                                        s(9)   implies

                             w'(9)/s'(9)            â€”   - (6    -
                                                                    w(9))/(l     -
                                                                                     s(9))   â€”   -    11/fl.
          dw(s)/ds
This is the tangency condition between the isoprofit contours of the firm

and the wage concession schedule illustrated by Farber (1978) in his

exposition of the Ashenfelter-Johnsonmodel.

          Using equations (1) and (2) worker receipts in state 9 can be written

as

          r(9)     â€” 9 (1    -
                                 s(9)) -       11(9)    +      s(O)     a.


Thus the problem of maximizing E(u(r)) subject to incentive compatibility

and individual rationality is equivalent to

      Provided that the monotonicity constraint on s is never binding, this

s as the control variable and                           11   as the state variable.                           I shall proceed

under this assumption and then show that constraint is not in fact binding.

occurrence of strikes can then be written as d > 1/3                                             g,   which is more

likely,       the greater the dispersion in potential profitability,                                              and the

smaller the average "rents" to employment at the firm.                                                Assuming that this

condition is met, strikes occur in those states with 8 < 8+.                                                     The

probability of a work stoppage is just the probability that                                                 9    < 6+, and can

be written as 3/4 -                g/4d.     For example,                  if gâ€”. 3 and dâ€”. 125 (implying a

coefficient of variation of latent profitability of 7.2 pertent) then the

probability of strikes is                   .15.




     10The coefficient of variation of                                 9     is equal to d /           sqrt(3).         The

       In contrast to the risk neutral case, in the risk averse case the

first-order condition for s(9) is a function of s.                                            Nonetheless, the

critical value of productivity that distinguishes the strike and no-strike

states is the same as in the risk-neutral case.                                         In particular,         if 8+

satisfies equation (6) for the risk-neutral case, then s(9+) â€” 0 in the

risk-averse case. To see that this is true, observe that if                                               s(G4-)    â€”    0,   then

s(O)    â€” 0   for all         0    >   94-; thus union receipts are fixed and u'(r)                                 is

constant for all              9    >   9t         It follows that              (9+) â€”    0 at         â€”        4-   a)/2      is a

solution to (6) for any value of the risk aversion parameter R.

       In the risk averse case, however, there is an interval of realizations

of productivity (9*                    94-)   in which strike length is strictly positive and

less than unity.                  For any 9 in this interval, the derivative of strike

length with respect to 9 may be obtained by differentiating the first-order

condition (6) with respect to 9.                                    The result can be written as:


                                              -2

    As an empirical matter, strike durations rarely exceed one year in

negotiations for contracts over a two                                  or       three year term (see Section II

below).        In the context of the model, this suggests that workers are

significantly risk averse.                      Maximum strike length is s(1), which can be

written as:

proportional difference between the alternative wage and productivity in

the firm.11           The term R               in this expression has the interpretation of the

index of relative risk aversion at the lowest wage the firm will ever pay.

If the probability of disputes is                            .15       and g1 â€”            .2,   then the index of

relative risk aversion must be at least 3.5 to ensure strike durations of

less than one-half.

    Mean strike duration conditional on a dispute may be obtained from

equation (8) by

decreasing in the index of risk aversion R.                                Since the probability of

disputes is also increasing in d and decreasing in g, this model implies

that changes in the distribution of profitability and changes in the

alternative wage shift the probability and conditional duration of disputes

in the same direction,

This difference is increasing in d, decreasing in                                    g,   and decreasing in R.

To get some idea of the magnitude of the maximum wage concessions implied

by the model, if d              .125 and g =         .3   (implying a strike probability of

.15), and if the index of relative risk aversion at                                       w   m is 4 implying a

maximum strike duration of .5 and a mean duration of .24), then the gap

between the no-strike wage and the wage after the longest possible strike

is oniy 1.01 percent.             By comparison,           if workers were risk neutral they

would demand a wage 20.4 percent above the minimum realization of

productivity and strike for the full period otherwise.

       In summary, the signalling model of strikes identifies two important

determinants of strike incidence and duration:                                the dispersion in


profitability, and the gap between alternative wages and average

productivity at the firm.                  Increases      in dispersion of the unobservable

component of profitability increase the probability and duration of

strikes.       Increases in the mean level of productivity at the firm reduce
                                         13

the probability and duration of strikes,      while increases in the alternative

wage decrease both.      Expected strike duration is also a function of the

willingness of workers to sacrifice wages during low-demand periods in

return for higher wsges in high-demand periods.       In the model presented

here, this willingness is captured by the index of risk aversion.

    The signalling model implies that negotiated wage rates depend on the

same set of exogenous variables. Wages are predicted to increase with the

mean and dispersion of profitability, and increase with the alternative

wage.      Furthermore, holding constant these variables, wages are a

decreasing function of strike duration.       Given the range of empirical

estimates of mean and maximum strike duration, however, the model suggests

that the gap between wage settlements reached with and without a work

stoppage may be relatively modest.

    In the following sections, these predictions are tested using a sample

of labor contracts from the Canadian manufacturing sector.      I aaauxne that

variation over time in wage rates, strike probabilities and expected strike

durations arises from variation in the alternative wage opportunitiea of

workers (measured by regional unemployment rates and aggregate wages

elsewhere in the economy) and variation in the expected profitability of

the firm (measured by industry specific indexes of output and selling

prices).     I first investigate whether or not there is any evidence of a

negatively sloped concession schedule between wage settlements and strike

duration,    holding constant the observable determinants of wages.     The

existence of such a schedule is the most direct implication of the

hypothesis that strikes serve as a mechanism for price discrimination among
                                               1".
                                          12
more and less      profitabe employers.          I   then investrgate wnether the model

is    capable of   reconciling the effects of the predetermined variables on the

level of wages       the probability   c strikes,      and the conditional duration of

disputes.    The results of both investigations          are relatively negative.

There is no evidence of a systematic trade-off between wages and strike

duration in the data.      Neither are the effects of industry output and

prices on wage and strike outcomes easily explained within the confines of

the model.




II.    Data Description and Measurement Issues

      This section provides an overview of the contract data used to teit the

model of strikes developed in the previous Section.                In addition,   the

measure of contractual wage rates used in the empirical analysis is

introduced and analyzed.

lIa. Sample Description

      The empirical analysis in this paper is based on a sample of collective

bargaining agreements negotiated in the Canadian manufacturing sector from

1964 to 1985.       The original source of these data is the December 1985

release of Labour Canada's Wage Tape, which contains information on wage

rates and other provisions for 2868 contracts             covering 500 or more

employees.13 Starting from this sample, I have merged together agreements



        12This point is emphasized by McConnell          (1987b)

     l3 am grateful to Labour Canada for supplying these data.
Information on the methodology used to collect and code the data are
recorded in the Labour Canada publication Major Wage Settlements (Appendix
I). At present, Labour Canada collects data on virtually all collective
bargaining agreements covering more than 500 workers.

between the same firm and union pair covering different establishments)'4

and eliminated bargaining pairs with fewer than four consecutive contracts.

The final sample contains 2258 contracts r.egotiated by 299 distinct pairs.

   Although the Wage Tape contains relatively complete information on

contractual wage rates, the only strike information is an indicator for the

stage at which the agreement was reached.15 Fortunately, beginning and

ending dates for disputes involving more than 100 workers are reported

annually in the Labour Canada publication Strikes and Lockouts in Canada

(jQ).   I therefore merged strike duration information from   .    into   the

contract data set.   A   more complete description of the merging process is

provided in the Data Appendix,

     Table I presents a cross-sectional overview of the merged data.      This

table gives the number of bargaining pairs and the number of contracts      from
each of 19 two-digit industries,   as well as the average contract length,

base wage rate, strike probability, and strike duration for each industry.

The wage rate measure in Table I is a simple average of real wage rates

prevailing during the term of the contract)'6 To account for differences

across industries in the yearly composition of contract negotiations, I


     1'4The sample includes 10 separate contract
                                                 chronologies for General
Motors and the United Automobile Workers, for example.    Each of these
records the same wage rate and strike information, but pertains to a
different plant or group of plants. The Data Appendix describes the rules
used for merging contracts.

     15Canadian labor law, which varies somewhat by province, requires the
bargaining parties to pass through one or more stages of mediation (or
"conciliation") before a strike or lockout is declared, See Canadian
Department of Labour (1970) pp. 135-136.

     16The average wage rate is formed from monthly intracontract
                                                                  wage
rates sampled at six month intervals,
                                      starting with the effective month of
the contract.

have used a linear regression model to adjust the average wage rate in each

contract      for   the   effective year of   the agreement,

        In   the sample as a    whole the average strike probability is 22 percent

and   the average strike duration is          54 days.   These averages   are   somewhat

higher       than corresponding ones reported by McConnell (1987) for collective

bargaining agreements negotiated between 1970 and 1981 in U.S.

manufacturing (15 percent and 41 days, respectively).              The average strike


probability is also higher than the 15.7 percent average reported by

Gunderson, Mervin, and Reid (1986) for a sample of agreements from all

private sector industries in Canada (including manufacturing and non-

manufacturing industries). The 22 percent strike probability is virtually

identical to the rate of disputes among all manufacturing contracts

recorded on the Wage Tape between 1964 and 1985, however.

   Average strike probabilities vary substantially by industry within

manufacturing, ranging from less than 10 percent in tobacco, clothing, and

printing industries,          to over 30 percent in wood products and transportation

industries.         Mean and median strike duration also vary by industry,          with

the shortest strikes in clothing industries and the longest ones in paper

and petroleum refining.18 Strike probability and duration are virtually

uncorrelated across two-digit industries (the rank-order correlation is

.08).        There is a very weak rank-order correlation between          the average

     17The industry averages represent estimated industry coefficients from
a linear regression of the average contract real wage (in 1981 dolLars) on
industry dummy variables and dummy variables representing the effective
year of the contract. The year effects are normalized to sum to zero.

     18Data for the petroleum refining industry must be interpreted
carefully, since there is only one bargaining pair (with one strike) from
this industry in the sample.
                                                17

strike probability and the average base wage rate in the industry (10).

The average real wage rate in the industry is more strongly correlated with

average strike duration (the rank-order correlation is .29).

        Table 2 summarizes the time-series characteristics of the sample.

This table reports average contract lengths, wage rates, strike

probabilities, and strike durations by the effective year of the bargaining

agreement.         As in Table 1, the real wage rate for each contract is measured

as an average of prevailing wage rates during the term of the contract.

For ease of comparison across years, the average wage rate for each year is

adjusted for the two-digit industry composition of settlements in that
        19
year.

        Average real wage rates show a secular growth rate of approximately

three percent per year from 1964 to 1977.            Thereafter,   the growth rate is

erratic and much slower.             Strike probabilities and durations show no

particular trend, although strike incidence was relatively high in the

early 1970's.          The rank-order correlation across years between real wage

rates (adjusted for industry composition)            and strike incidence is   -   .07.
The correlation over time between average strike duration and average

strike probability is essentially zero.

    More information on the distribution on strike durations is provided in

Figure       1,   which displays the estimated daily settlement rate (or hazard

rate) among ongoing strises.        The figure is cased on the set of 477

strikes for which complete duration information is available.        After 140

days, some 39 strikes (8 percent of the sample) were still in progress.

Only two strikes in the sample lasted longer than one year: one for 379

days, and one for 598 days. The average settlement rate in the first 140

days is    1.8 percent per day, or 12 percent per week.     The settlement rate

is slightly higher for the first 2 weeks of strike duration (2.4 percent

per day),    and also shows a relative peak between 45 and 50 days.

Otherwise,    the settlement rate is relatively constant.     This finding of a

roughly constant hazard rate is similar to the finding in Card (1988) for a

sample of strikes among U.S. manufacturing contracts.        Other recent studies

based on broader samples of strikes have suggested that the settlement rate

declines (Kennan (1980) or rises (Harrison and Stewart (1986)) with the

duration of the dispute.



lib.    Measurement of Contract Wage Rates

       Any analysis of wage outcomes among collective bargaining agreements

requires some measure of the wage rate associated with each settlement.

Multi-year labor contracts,    however,   typically specify a schedule of wage

rates over the life of the contract.       For example,   most three-year

contracts contain deferred wage-change provisions that increase nominal

wage rates on the first and second anniversary dates of the contract.           In

addition,    indexed contracts contain cost-of-living allowance    (C01.A)   clauses



     20The estimated settlement rate is constructed from daily settlements
for strikes of 1-60 days duration, and from settlements over 2 day
intervals (expressed at a daily rate) for strikes of 60-140 days duration.
                                        19

that link quarterly, semi-annual, or annual increases to changes in the

consumer price index.

    Figure 2 illustrates the intra-contractevolution of real wage rates in

three major subsamples of contracts: two-year non-indexed contracts;     three-


year non-indexed contracts; and three-year indexed contracts.21 The

underlying data are recorded in Appendix Table 1.    As the figure shows,

real wage rates typically move in a narrow corridor over the life of the

contract.   Among three-year contracts (both indexed and non-indexed),   the


average change in real wage rates from the beginning to the end of the

contract was about -l percent. Among two-year non-indexed contracts,     by

comparison, the average change was about -4 percent. The more rapid erosion

of real wage rates among two-year as compared to three-year non-indexed

contracts reflects the higher average annual rate of inflation among the

former group (6.5 percent versus 5.1 percent). The average inflation rate

was even higher among the sample of three-year indexed contracts (7.2

percent per year), but the effect on real wage rates was offset by the

escalation provisions in these contracts.

    One natural summary measure of the wage provisions in a multi-year

labor contract is the average real wage rate during the term of the

contract.   The real wage rates reported in Tables 1 and 2 are of this form,

with the averages taken over wage rates measured at six-month intervals.

Except in very rare instances,   however, real wage rates during the term of




     21The sample contains 728 non-indexed contracts with durations between
23 and 25 months, 355 non-indexed contracts with durations between 35 and
37 months, and 381 indexed contracts with durations between 35 and 37
months. Together, these three groups make up 65 percent of the contract
sample.

the contract are not set directly by the bargaining parties22                          Rather   the


parties specify a schedule of nominal wage increases and, in the case of an

escalated contract, a partial indexation formula.                  This suggests that an

average of expected real wage rates is a more appropriate ex ante summary

of the wage provisions in a long-term collective bargaining agreement.23

    Unfortunately, expected real wage rates are not directly observable

and must be inferred from the nominal wage provisions of the collective

bargaining agreement and some measure of expected prices.                       To see the

nature of the measurement problem, let w(m) represent the logarithm of the
                                                                           *
real   wage rate during month m of the contract,               and let w       (m)   represent the

parties' expectation of w(m) as of the negotiation date of the contract.

In a non-indexed contract, the actual real wage rate is related to the

expected rate by
                    â€”    *                       *
       (9)   w(m)       w (m)   -
                                    (p(m)   -
                                                p (m)),

where p(m) is the logarithm of the price level in month m and p*(m) is the

parties' expectation of p(m).                   In an escalated contract with an indexation

formula that increases nominal wages by e percent for each percent increase
                      *
in prices, w(m) and w (m) are related by:
                  *                                       *
    (10) w(m) â€” w (m) - (l-e)(p(m) - p (m)).

Most escalated labor contracts, however, do not specify a fixed elasticity

of indexation.          Instead,     they specify a fixed absolute increase in wages


     22The only case in which intra-contract real wage rates are set
directly is that of an indexed contract in which nominal wage rates
increase at the same proportional rate as the aggregate price index.
Indexation formulas of this type are extremely rare: see Card (1983).

     23Th1s measure of wage rates was first proposed by McConnell (1987b).
Figure 2 also suggests that the real wage at the start of the contract may
be a useful summary of contractual wages. The empirical results in this
paper are unchanged when this simple summary measure is used.
                                                       21

for each point increase in the consumer price index.                       In addition,          some

escalated contracts restrict the range of price increases covered by

indexation,    either by limiting the maximum escalated wage increase, or by

specifying a trigger price level that must be reached before indexation

begins.24 In such contracts,            the elasticity of indexation varies over the

contract,    and may in fact be zero for a range of price increases.

Nonetheless, equation (10> is approximately correct for an interval of
                        *
realized prices around p (a), where e                      i
                                        defined as the elasticity of
                 *
indexation at pâ€”p (m).
    Given an estimate of the parties' expected price level in month m,

(m), and an estimate of           e, say   ,       an estimate      of the expected real wage

rate in month m is

                  â€” w(m) +
    (11)    (m)                  (l-)(p(m)     -
                    *                                  *                             *
                   w  (m)    -
                                  (e-e)(p(m)       -
                                                       p   (m)) +   (l-e)(p(m)   -
                                                                                     p   (a)).

This equation makes clear that there are two sources of error in the

measurement of expected real wage rates: errors in the measurement of e

(which arise only in the case of an indexed contract);                      and errors in the

measurement of expected future prices.

        In this paper I estimate the elasticity of indexation by the ratio of

total escalated wage increases over the life of the contract (in
                                                                 percentage

terms) to the total increase in prices over the life of the contract.                               This

estimator has the advantage that it does not require detailed information

on the cost-of-living escalation formula in the contract.25 On the other


     24See Card (1983) for a description of escalation provisions among
indexed contracts written in Canada from 1968-75.

        25Detailed information on COLA formulas is not available on the Wage
Tape.

hand,   it introduces some inaccuracy into the calculation of expected real

wage rates, particularly for contracts with restricted escalation

clauses.26 I also use simple autoregressive models of the consumer price

index to form estimates of the expected price level during the contract

period.

   Table 3 compares alternative measures of the contractual wage provisions

for the overall contract sample and for the subsamples of indexed and non-

indexed agreements.   The upper panel of the table reports means and standard

deviations of three wage measures:    the average real wage rate during the

term of the contract (formed from monthly intra-contractwage rates sampled

at 6-month intervals) and two averages of expected intra-contract real

wage rates (again, based on monthly wage rates sampled at 6-month

intervals).   The averages of expected wage rates differ by the model used

to forecast future price increases.   In the first case (referred to in the

table as forecast method I) future prices are estimated from a model that

predicts the one-month ahead inflation rate using a constant and the

average inflation rate over the previous 12 months. The coefficients of

this forecasting model are obtained from a regression equation estimated

over the 1954-85 period.27 In the second case (referred to in the table as


     26For example, an escalation clause with a trigger formula may have
generated no increase in wages in a contract for which actual price
increases were smaller than expected. Thus the estimate of e is zero, even
though the elasticity of indexation may have been non-zero for prices close
to the expected price level.

     27The fitted equation is DP â€” .00958 + .8576 DPl2, where DPt is the
change in the logarithm of the consumer price index during the current
month (at an annual rate), and DPl2t is the change in the logarithm of the
consumer price index over the previous 12 months. This equation generates
a forecast for the rate of change in prices over the next 36 months, for
example, of .026 + .6135  DPl2.
                                      23

forecast method 2) future price increases are estimated from a model that

predicts the one-month ahead inflation rate using the lagged monthly

inflation rate, the monthly inflation rate 12 months ago, and an estimated

constant and trend.28 The coefficients of this forecasting equation are

estimated from monthly data for the 10 years prior to the year in which the

forecast is made.29 Forecasts from the second method are therefore based on

data that were available to the bargaining parties at the time of their

negotiations.

     The lower panel of Table 3 gives means and standard deviations of the

forecast errors in average wage rates associated with the two forecasting

methods. The mean forecast errors for both methods are essentially zero.

In all three samples, however, the standard deviations of the forecast

errors for the first forecasting method are lower.    This is apparently due

to the fact that the forecasts from the second method, which are based on a

series of sliding regressions with linear trend terms, tend to "over-shoot'

major turning points in the inflationary process.30


     28Thjs model seems to perform best among the class of models that
forecast monthly inflation rates using the monthly rates in the previous 12
months.

          comparison of the estimated autoregressive coefficients from
various subsamples of the 1954-85 period revealed that these coefficients
are remarkably stable over time. On the other hand, the estimated constant
and trend terms in the equation vary significantly over time. In view of
this fact, I restricted the autoregressive coefficients to be the same in
the forecasting equations for the various subsarnples. The fitted
forecasting equations therefore have the form:
        DI'  â€” constant Ã· trend + .2154 DP     + .3437 DP

              the change in the logarithm 1 the consumer rLce   index in

     30For example, the two-year ahead inflationary forecast for January
1976 is 8.38 by the first method, and 10.56 by the second method. The
actual rate of change of prices over the period was 7.28 percent per year.

lila. Models of Contractual Wage       Ra
     As a first step toward an empirical teat of the signalling model of

strikes, this section specifies a number of alternative statistical models

for the wage measures introduced above.            I first estimate a components-of-

variance model of wages that includes bargaining-pair effects as well as

market-level determinants of wages, including unemployment rates and

measures of industry demand.       I next investigate      the effects of real wage

movements during the preceding contract on subsequent wage rates.              These

models are then used in the following section to test the existence of a

negatively sloped concession schedule between wages and strike duration.

   To begin the analysis of negotiated wage rates, consider the following

components-of-variancemodel of the expected average wage rate associated

with the      contract negotiated by the              bargaining pair:

    (12)     w.   â€”   a.   +   X. .b   +   u..,
where   w.   represents the parties' expected average wage rate, a.

represents a pair-specific effect, X.. represents a vector of variables

influencing the desired wage rate, and u.. represents a pair- and contract-

specific idiosyncratic component.           The pair effect   a   absorbs any permanent

pair-specific variation in wage rates, such as that associated with

industry or region effects, or the skill-level of workers.               In addition, a.

absorbs any variation across pairs associated with the choice of base wage

rates to represent the contract.31


     31Most manufacturing contracts cover a wide range of skill levels,
from janitors and unskilled production workers to skilled maintenance
mechanics. The use of a base wage rate to measure the level of wages in a
contract presumes that relative wage differentials within the contract are
held constant. In comparing base wage rates across different contracts,
                                                             25

    The measured expected average wage rate differs from the parties'

expected wage rate by an error

Following equation (11),                          Consists of an average of terms involving

differences between actual and measured indexation elasticities,                                        and actual

and measured price expectations.                       Equations (12) and (13) imply that

measured expected average wage rates foLlow

The error component in this equation represents a combination of

measurement error and the contract-specific idiosyncratic                                     effect.

   A convenient method of handling the pair effect a. in equation (14) is

to difference over consecutive contracts,

Provided that      X       does not contain any lagged dependent variables this

equation can be estimated by ordinary least squares over the subsample of

second and later contracts for each bargaining pair.                                     Unfortunately,

differencing introduces a first-order moving average error component into

the observations from a given bargaining pair,                                   rendering conventional OLS
standard errors inconsistent.                      Consistent standard errors can be estimated

by a two-step procedure that accounts for the residual correlation between

consecutive contracts for each bargaining pair.32




however, wage variation may arise if the base wage in one contract refers
to a very low-skilled group, while the base wage in another refers to a
more highly-skilled group.

      Some preliminary estimates of equation (15) are presented in Table 4

for the two alternative measures of the expected average wage rate

introduced above. Included in the Vector X are variables representing the

state of the labor market at the effective date of the contract (the
                                                             rate33 the

                                                     variables measuring
average monthly real wage rate in all manufacturing)
                                                                of the
the state of demand faced by the employer in the effective year

contract (the 3-digit industry selling price index, deflated by the

consumer price index, and 3-digit industry output), and trend terms or year

effects. Sources for these variables are described in the Data Appendix.

In order to assure that data is available for at least two preceding

contract negotiations, the equations are estimated over the subsample of

third and later contracts for each bargaining pair.    Furthermore,   since

data on industry selling prices and output are unavailable after 1983, and
                                                           the sample is
provincial unemployment rates are unavailable before 1966,

restricted to agreements with effective dates between 1966 and 1983.      The


resulting subsample contains 1467 contracts negotiated by 298 bargaining
  -      34
pairs.

      Columns (1) and (5) of Table 4 present estimates of equation (15) with

linear and quadratic trend terms.     These equations also contain a dummy

variable for contracts with effective dates between 1976 and 1978.      During

this period, wage and price increases were regulated by a federal agency

        33
       Provincial unemployment rates are only available for the three
                  -- British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec.  For the
largest provinces
remaining provinces I use the national rate.

     34The average strike probability among this subsample is 21.98
percent.   The mean and median strike duration are 57.1 and 40 days,
respectively.

known as the Anti-Inflation Board (AIB).     The estimation results are not

particularly strong: the estimated coefficients vary between the two

alternative specifications of expected wage rates, and are mostly

statistically insignificant. The only robust finding is a negative effect

of wage controls on real wage rates.35

    In columns (2) and (6), the trend terms and AIB dummy variable are

replaced by an unrestricted set of year-effects for the effective year of

the contract.   This change in specification significantly improves the fit

of the equations, and also reduces the discrepancies between the

alternative wage measures.     In particular, the coefficients of the

provincial unemployment rate and the industry selling price index are

reasonably well-determined and of similar magnitude in the two equations.

Neither the manufacturing wage rate nor industry output have large effects

in either equation.

    These simple specifications exclude any information on the evolution of

real wage rates during the previous contract.    The evidence in the micro-

wage determination literature, however, suggests that real wage changes

during the preceding contract exert a major influence on subsequent wage

determination. Both Riddell (1979) and Christofides et. al. (l9BOa, 1980b).

for example,    find that unexpected price increases over the term of the

previous contract lead to incomplete catch-up" increases in the following

contract.   In terms of real wage rates, their results imply that unexpected

real wage reductions during the preceding contract lead to lower real wage

rates in the subsequent one.    A simple way of incorporating this



     35For a review of the evidence on the effects of the AIB on Canadian
wage settlements, see Riddell (1986).

If   the parameter c is positive then unexpectedly high or low real wage

rates at the end of the previous contract carry over into the next

contract.     If c is zero then there is complete "catch-up"                              for unexpected

inflation over the previous contract.36

where s(T)..1       represents the measurement error in the expected real wage

rate at the end of the i_let contract for the                          th   pair. Since this error is

positively correlated with the measured expected wage at the end of the

contract,    an instrumental variables scheme is required to obtain consistent

estimates of equation (17).                  An obvious instrument for the first-difference

of the forecast error in ending real wage rates is the first difference of

the change in consumer prices over the term of the previous contract.

     Columns (3) and (7) of Table 4 contain estimates of (17) obtained in

this manner.       The point estimates of the coefficient c are very similar for



     36By "complete catch-up", I mean that real wage rates are restored to
their expected level at the end of the previous contract.  This is
equivalent to a coefficient of unity on the nominal wage catch-up term
specified by Riddell (1979).
                                                               29

the two specification of expected real wage rates, and are highly

significant in each case.                     These estimates suggest that an unexpected real

wage reduction of one percent during the last contract leads to a .4

percent reduction in real wages in the next contract.                                   The addition of the

forecast error in the ending wage rate of the previous contract also leads

to larger point estimates of the effect of unemployment on expected real

wage rates.        As in columns (2) and (6), industry output and average wages

in manufacturing continue to have small and statistically insignificant

effects on negotiated wage rates.

      While equation (16) permits unexpected real wage changes during the

last contract to affect subsequent real wage rates, it is also possible

that expected wages in the last contract affect future rates.                                   To pursue

this idea further, suppose

first-differenceof the forecast error of ending real wage rates.

Potential instruments        include the components of           and the first-

difference of the change in consumer prices over the last contract.

        Estimates of equation (11) are presented in columns (4) and (8) of

Table 4.      The   results suggest that both lagged expected wages and the

forecast error in the ending wage rate of the previous contract affect

current wages, although the precise effects of these two variables differ

somewhat depending on the specification of expectations,            The coefficients

of the other exogenous variables are not much different across the two

specifications.      An over-identification test for the validity of the

exclusion restrictions implicit in the instrumental variables estimation

scheme (reported in row 10 of the table) suggests that these restrictions

are roughly consistent with the data when price expectations are formed by

the first forecasting method, but are less consistent when prices are

forecast by the second method.37



Ilib.       The Effects of Strike Outcomes on Contract Wages

     Starting from the model of contractual wages represented by equation

(19), this section presents estimates of the effects of strike incidence

and duration on negotiated wage rates. The objective is to identify the



     37The over-identification test is a test for the orthogonality of the
residuals of the estimated equation with the instrumental variables: see
Newey (1985) for a fuller discussion.  The statistic is asymptotically
distributed as chi-square with degrees of freedom equal to the degree of
over-identification: 18 in the case of the models in columns (4) and (8) of
table 4.

partial correlation between wages and strike outcomes,           holding constant the

observable determinants of wages.          The existence of a negatively sloped

concession schedule is a major prediction of the signalling model outlined

in Section I.    More generally,    however, the existence of a trade-off

between wages and contemporaneous strike outcomes is an important

ingredient of many alternative models of strike activity.38

    Table S reports a variety of alternative specifications of the effects

of strikes on wages, using the two alternative measures of expected real

wage rates introduced in Tables 3 and 4.          All regressions in the table

include an unrestricted set of year effects for the effective year of the

contract,    as well as the provincial unemployment rate, the real industry

selling price index, the forecast error in the real wage rate at the end of

the preceding contract,   and   a   lagged dependent variable.      The equations are

estimated by two-stage least squares, using lagged year effects, the lagged

national unemployment rate, and the lagged change in consumer prices during

the term of the contract as instrumental variables for the lagged dependent

variable and the forecast error in the ending wage rate of the last
         39
contract.

    Columns (1) and (5) of Table       5   present wage determination equations

that include a variable measuring the duration of any work stoppage.40

Columns (2) and (6) present equations with a simple indicator variable for


     38For example, the sequential bargaining models of Tracy (1986) and
Fudenburg, Levine, and Ruud (1985) give many of the same predictions as the
signalling model. The Ashenfelter Johnson (1969) model also assumes a
negative relation between wages and strike duration.

     39As in table 4, these variables are         all used   in first-difference form.

     40For contracts settled without a work stoppage, strike duration is
equal to zero.

whether the settlement was reached following a strike.      The results are

unsupportive of any systematic relation between wages and strike outcomes.

Neither strike duration nor incidence is significantly related to the

expected average real wage, holding constant the other determinants of

wages.41 The sign of the estimated coefficient of strike duration varies

by the forecasting method for expected future prices, while the estimated

coefficients of the strike incidence variable are both small and positive.

I have also experimented with alternative normalizations of strike

duration, including strike duration as a fraction of average industry

contract    length, and as   a fraction of the duration of the previous

contract,     Neither of these normalizations has any effect on the results.

    These estimated correlations must be interpreted very carefully since

they may be biased by unobserved variation in factors that affect both the

negotiated wage rate and the probability and duration of work stoppages.

In particular, in the framework of a signalling model the estimated

correlation of strikes and wages may be positively biased by failure to

control for variation in the alternative wage opportunities of workers.

Unmeasured variation in the expected profitability of the firm, by

comparison,    introduces a negative bias into the estimated correlation of

strikes and wages.     If a signalling model based on unobserved profitability

is correct, however, and the true correlation of wages and strike duration

is negative, then the results in columns (l)-(2) and (5)-(6) suggest that




     4'The raw correlations between the first-differenceof the expected
average real wage rate and the first-differenceof strike incidence and
duration are also approximately zero.
                                        33

unobserved variation in alternative wages is the more likely source of
        42
bias.

    Columns (3)-(4) and (7)-(8) introduce two additional variables to help

control for unobserved variation in alternative wage opportunities.    The

first of these is the actual strike frequency among settlements in the rwo

months prior to the effective month of the current negotiation.43 This

variable controls for any unobservable sources of variation in aggregate

strike probabilities, including changes in aggregate-level alternative wage

opportunities or employment probabilities.    The second variable is an

indicator    for wildcat strikes during the term of the previous agreement.44

There is some evidence that intra-contract dispute rates are influenced by

labor market conditions,45 Thus the introduction of an indicator for

wildcat disputes during the last contract helps to control for any

contract-specific variation in local labor market conditions that might

otherwise bias the estimated correlation of wage rates and strike outcomes.

    The results in columns (3)-(4) and (7)-(8) suggest that there is indeed


         positive correlation between wages and strike duration could also
be generated by changes in the union's assessment of the dispersion of
unobserved profitability. Tracy's (1986, 1987) idea of using the
variability of security price returns could in principle be used to try and
measure changes in the latter, for the subset of publicly traded firms in
the sample.

     43This probability is estimated from monthly strike probabilities
among the entire sample of 2258 contracts.

         use the term "wildcat" to refer to strikes during the term of an
existing agreement.  Information on wildcat disputes was collected from
Strikes and Lockouts in Canada, and is only available for disputes
involving 100 or more workers. The fraction of agreements with at least
one wildcat walkout during the previous contract is 7.7 percent. The
typical duration of these disputes is 1-3 days.

       Flaherty (1983) finds that the annual number of wildcat strikes in
U.S. manufacturing is highly correlated with the unemployment rate.

a positive correlation between wage settlements and uuobserved factors that

contribute toward higher strike probabilities, The estimated coefficients

of the aggregate strike probability in row        7.   are positive and marginally

significant in every case.     The estimated coefficients of the indicator for

wildcat disputes during the previous contract are much closer to zero. The

introduction of these two control variables, however, does not have much

effect on the estimated relation between wage settlements and strike

outcomes.   There is still no evidence of any systematic effect of strike

incidence or duration on negotiated wage rates.

    Some further evidence of the effects of strike duration on wages is

summarized in Table 6.   This table reports the estimated wage effects of

strikes   in four broad duration classes for the two different specifications

of expected real wages.46      The duration classes correspond roughly to the

quartiles of the distribution of strike lengths in the sample.            Overall,

the results in Table 6 support the conclusion from Table 5 that there is no

strong or systematic relation between wage rates and strikes.            The largest

estimated wage effect is associated with strikes of 45-89 days: strikes in

this category are estimated to increase expected average real wage rates by

.7 percent (with a standard error of .4 percent).

    In an effort to check the robustness of these findings,           I have also fit

the specifications in Table 6 to subsamples of the 1966-83 period, and to

subsets of contracts from specific two-digit industries.            Some of the

results are   summarized in   Appendix Table 2.        The estimated strike incidence

and duration effects are stable across different sample periods and


     46Although they are not reported in the table, the estimated
coefficients of the other variables in the regressions are very similar to
the estimates in columns (4) and (8) of Table 5.
                                        35

different industries.     In none of the subsamples are the estimated strike

effects large or statistically significant.    The estimates of the other

coefficients in the wage determination model are also very similar across

the various subsamples.     The only exception is the estimated effect of the

                                                          the 1966-75
provincial unemployment rate, which is weakly positive in

sample period, but strongly negative in the 1976-83 period.47

estimated effects of the industry selling price index, by comparison, are

very similar in the two sample periods.

     The results of this analysis are not particularly supportive of the

signalling interpretation of strikes, or indeed of any model that predicts

a systematic relation between wages and strikes,     Controlling for the year

of the contract negotiation, wage rates in the previous contract,     and

measures of unemployment and industry selling prices, there is no

significant correlation between wages and strikes. This conclusion seems

robust to the choice of sample definition.     Although the theoretically-

predicted negative correlation may be obscured by variation in alternative

wages that raises the negotiated wage rate and increases the probability

and duration of disputes,    the attempt to control for this variation using

dispute rates in other recent contracts and a measure of wildcat strikes

during the previous contract was unsuccessful,

     The finding that wages are uncorrelated with strike durations differs

sharply from the recent results of McConnell (l987b), who finds that wages

are significantly negatively related to strike durations in a broad sample

of collective bargaining agreements from the U.S.     In contrast,   Lacroix


         This accords with the findings of Christofides et. al. (1980a,
1980b), who estimate nominal wage change equations on contracts from the
1964-75 period, and generally fail to find any systematic effect of unemployment
                                           36

(1986) has also reported a negligible correlation between strike oUtcOmes

and wages, using a sample of Canadian contracts derived from the same

source as the sample in this paper.        Lacroix's   results are particularly

interesting because he is also able to reproduce the earlier finding of a

positive correlation between wages and strikes reported by Riddell (1980)

Lacroix shows that this positive correlation is an artifact of the

treatment of time effects in the wage determination model.         Since

McConnell's estimating equations include unrestricted year effects,

however, this cannot explain the discepancy between her results and those

presented here and by Lacroix.

       Nevertheless,    in interpreting these results it is important to keep in

mind that the size of the wage strike tradeoff predicted by the theoretical

model is small.        Strike durations are short relative to the period of time

covered by typical labor contracts.       Given this fact, the signalling model

implies a relatively small gap between wages reached with and without a

work stoppage:    on the order of 1 percent.      The estimates in Tables 5 and 6

generally do not rule out such a gap.

IV.    Determinants of Strike Incidence and Duration

      This section turns to an investigation     of the determinants of strike

incidence and duration in the contract sample.         According to the model

presented in Section I, the same predetermined variables affect wage rates

and the probability and intensity of strike activity.         Furthermore,

variables that have a positive effect on wages via their effect on the

profitability of the firm should decrease the probability and conditional

duration of work stoppages,      while variables that have a positive effect on

wages via their effect on the alternative wage opportunities of workers
                                                 37

should increase the probability and duration of disputes.                 Thus a

comparison of the effects of the pre-determined variables in the wage

equations with their effects in the strike incidence and duration equations

provides further evidence on the empirical relevance of the signalling

model of strikes.

IVa,    Models of Strike Incidence

       Table 7 reports estimates of two alternative statistical models of

strike incidence.          The first of these is a first-differencedversion of the

linear probability model.             According to this model, the probability of a

work stoppage in the            th   negotiation of the id" bargaining pair (p..) is

given by;

       (20)                      +
                          ai.

where   .     represents    a pair-specific fixed effect and X.. represents a

vector of pre-determined variables. This model suffers from the criticism

that
        p     may fall outside the unit interval.        Nonetheless, (20) is a

convenient model for panel data because it implies a simple linear

regression for the first-difference of measured strike incidence:

                                                                      .

residual.48 Estimates of this equation are presented in the first 4
columns of Table 7, for the same sample of observations used to generate

tables 4-6.       The elements of X include the seasonally adjusted monthly

estimated standard errors in Table 7 account for both these features.

provincial unemployment rate (measured in the effective month of the

contract), the real industry selling price of the appropriste 3-digit

industry (measured in the effettive year of the contract),      the forecast

error in the ending real wage rate of the preceding contract,      the expected

average real wage rate during the preceding contract, and an indicator for

any wildcat strikes during the previous contract.      Expected real wages are
formed using the first price forecaating method described in the last

section.    Results using the second method are very similar, and ara not

reported here.

    The first two columns of the table report estimates of equation (21)

that restrict the mean strike probabilities     by year.   Columns (3)-(5)

introduce a set of unrestricted year effects. The only one of these

effects that is individually significant is the one for contracts

negotiated in 1966: the sample contains 2 contracts from this year, both of

which resulted in a strike.    A   Wald teat that the year effects can be

adequately summarized by an indicator for the 1976-78 period and an

indicator   for 1966 has a marginal significance level of .05.     Estimatea

under this restricted specification of the year effects are presented in

column (2).

    The estimates without year effects suggest that wage and price controls

during the 1976-78 period reduced strike probabilities by about 10

percentage points.    The effect of unemployment is negative,   but not

significantly different from zero.     The effect of the real industry aelling

price index is positive and marginally significant. Unexpectedly high real

wage rates at the end of the preceding contract are eatimated to reduce the

probability of disputes, while higher or lower expected real wage rates in
                                            39

the last contract have a neglib].e effect on strike incidence.      Finally,   the

occurrence of one or more wildcat strikes during the term of the last

contract increases the probability of a strike in subsequent contract

negotiations by about 16 percentage points.

    The estimates with unrestricted year effects are generally simiiar

although the effects of unemployment are larger and the effects of forecast

errors in the ending wage of the previous contract are smaller. The fourth

column of Table 7 introduces the percentage change in consumer prices over

the previous contract as an additional explanatory variable.       The estimates

suggest that strike probabilities are unaffected by recent price changes,

controlling for unexpected changes in the real wage rate at the end of the

previous contract.    Finally, 3-digit industry output is introduced in the

model in column (5)     As is true for negotiated wages, there is no evidence

that the level of industry output affects the probability of disputes,

controlling for the other variables in the model.

    An alternative statistical model of strike incidence is a logistic

model with individual effects:

    (22)     log(p../(l-p..)) â€”         +

This model can be estimated by the conditional maximum likelihood scheme

described in Chamberlain (1980).       The basis of this approach is the fact

that the number of strikes in     a   fixed number of negotiations is a

sufficient statistic for the pair effect a. in the logistic probability

model.     The   coefficients can therefore be estimated by maximizing the

conditional probability of an observed sequence of strike outcomes,       which

is just the unconditional probability of the sequence, divided by the sum
                                                  40

of the probabilities of the alternative sequences with the same number of

strikes.

    This scheme is unwieldy for a panel in which the number of negotiations

for each bargaining pair ranges from 4 to 16.                1 therefore    selected a

balanced panel of 5 negotiations for the subset of pairs with at least 6

negotiations in the data set. (One pre-sample observation is needed to

calculate wage outcomes in the preceding contract).                 This panel contains

222 bargaining pairs and a total of 1110 contract observations.                  The average

strike probability and duration in the balanced panel are 26.1 percent and

58.1 days, respectively.            Since the conditional likelihood of either 0 or 5

strikes in 5 negotiations is            I, the   model is actually estimated over the

subset of 152 pairs with 1 to 4 strikes in 5 consecutive negotiations.                    A
total of 69 pairs in the subsample had             ito strikes,   while 1 pair had 5.

    Estimation results for the conditional logit procedure applied to the

balanced subsample of contract negotiations are presented in columns (6)-

(9) of Table 7.       For ease of comparison with the estimates from the linear

probability specification, I have multiplied the estimated coefficients and

their standard errors by            .261(1-261).       A model without year effects is

presented in column (6), while unrestricted year effects are introduced in

column (7).      A comparison of the maximized log-likelihoods (in row              10.   of

the table) suggests that the year effects are jointly insignificant in this

subsample.49 They are therefore excluded from the models in columns (8)

and (9).

    Overall, the estimation results are fairly similar to those in columns

(l)-(5), although the estimated effect of unemployment is slightly larger

using the conditional logit procedure on the balanced sample, and the

estimated effect of wildcat disputes is smaller.      These differences are

apparently due to the change in estimation technique:        estimates   of the

first-differenced linear probability specification on the balanced

subsample are very similar to those in columns (1)     -
                                                           (4).
    In summary, the results in Table 7 suggest that strike probabilities

are reduced by higher unemployment and increased by higher industry-

specific selling prices.   In addition,    strike probabilities are lower     in

situations where real wages were unexpectedly high at the end of the

preceding contract.   By comparison,   the level of expected real wages in the

previous contract and changes in prices during that contract have

statistically insignificant effects on the probability of a dispute.

    Taken together with the results in Section III, these results present

something of a puzzle for the signalling model of strikes.        The estimated

negative effects of unemployment on wage rates and strike probabilities are

Consistent with the signalling model and the hypothesis that higher

unemployment reduces the alternative wage.     The estimated positive effect

of industry selling prices on wages is also consistent with the idea that

unions earn higher wages in periods of higher profitability.        The positive

effect of selling prices on strike probabilities, however,        is inconsistent

with the model.   In fact, increases in profitability are predicted to

decrease strike probabilities by virtually any modeL of strikes that

incorporates the notion of the joint cost of a dispute50

    It is also difficult to explain the effects of forecast errors in the

ending wage rate of the previous contract within the framework of the

     50This was first noted
                            by Kennan (1980).

signalling model.    If forecast errors in contract wages reflect aiailar

changes in alternative wage opportunities,    as their effect on wages

suggest,   then positive forecast errors should increase the probability of

strikes,   The estiaates suggest that the opposite is true.     Finally,    the


positive correlation between wildcat strikes and the probability of

subsequent contract strikes, with no corresponding effect on negotiated

wage rates, presents a further puzzle for the signalling model.



P/b. Models of Strike Duration

    Table 8 presents some alternative models for the determinants of

completed strike duration.     In each case, in order to control for pair-

specific heterogeneity and to help normalize strike duration for the length

of the prospective contract,   the estimated models include bargaining pair

effects.   The strikes are drawn from the sample of negotiations used in the

estimation of the wage equations in Tables 4-6, and in the linear

probability strike incidence models in Table    7.   The sample includes 402

strikes from 1765 negotiations of 298 bargaining pairs.51 Among theae

pairs,   2D3 had at least 1 strike,   and therefore contribute to the anaiyeie

of covariance.

    The estimated regression functions    in Table 8 can be interpreted

directly as estimates of the expected log strike duration function.         On the

assumption that strike durations are exponentially     distributed, these

estimates can also be interpreted as estimates of the logarithm of the



     51'The sample in Tables 4-6 and in the first 4 columns of Table 7
includes 1467 negotiations for 298 pairs. Since the estimation is carried
out in first differences, a total of 1765 contract negotiations is acrua].ly

inverse hazard function.52 In particular,               if the duration   S      of the

strike for the      th   bargaining pair is exponentially distributed with hazard

     then

(see Jones (1987, p. 7)).          In this case, the linear specifications for the

                                            are equivalent to a linear
log of completed strike duration in Table 8

specification of the log hazard.

    The first column of table 8 presents estimates based on a model of

                                                                       of
expected duration with a constant intercept across the different years

the sample,       apart from the 1976-78 period.         Unrestricted year effects are

introduced in columns (2)-(4).           These variables significantly improve the

fit of the model: the test statistic for the comparison of the models Ic

columns   (1)     and (2) has a marginal significance level of            004.

    The estimated effect of the provincial unemployment rate on the log of

strike duration is very poorly determined in all four columns of the table.

Real industry selling prices appear to exert a positive effect on strike

duration, although the estimated coefficients are not significantly
                          53
different from zero.           The forecast error in the endrng wage of the

previous contract has a large and statistically significant effect in

column (1) of the table.           When year effects are included,        the estimated

coefficient is still large, but the precision of the estimate falls,


     52The exponential distribution implies that the hazard rate of strike
settlements is constant (given the covariatea).  Judging by the plot of the
empirical hazard in Figure 1, this is perhaps a reasonable hypothesis.

Neither the level of expected wages in the previous contract nor the

occurrence of a wildcat strike has a statistically significant effect on

expected duration.

     The model in column       (3)   introduces the change in consumer prices over

the previous contract as an additional explanatory variable,           while   3-digit

industry output is included in column (4).          changes in consumer prices do

not significantly affect expected duration.          The level of industry output,

however, appears to have a negative effect on expected duration.tO This

finding confirms the results of Harrison and Stewart (1986)        ,   who report   a

positive   correlation      between the strike settlement rate and the index of

industrial production for d large sample of strikes from the Canadian

manufacturing sector.

     Given the imprecision of the estimates        in Table 8, it is difficult to

draw firm conclusions about the relevance of the signalling model for

observed strike durations, On one hand, there is weak evidence that

expected strike durations are positively correlated with industry selling

prices.    Assuming that higher prices imply higher profitability, this is

inconsistent with the signalling model or any other model of strikes tdat

accounts for the joint cost of work stoppages.          On the other hand, there is

some evidence of a negative correlation between strike duration and

industry output.         While this may be interpreted as evidence in favor of the

model, it is important to keep in mind that industry output has no

corresponding effect on strike probabilities or negotiated wages.              By
              the provincial unemployment rate, which has
comparison,                                               negative effects on


     54There is of course a potential simultaneity problem between strike
duration and output. A long strike may reduce measured industry output if
the affected firm is large enough.
                                        45

negotiated wages and strike probabilities, has no strong effect on expected

strike duration.   Finally,   forecast errors in the ending real wage rate of

the previous contract appear to have positive effects on the duration of

strikes. Again, this finding is difficult to reconcile with their positive

effect on negotiated wages.



V. Conclusions

    This paper has presented and tested a simple model of strikes based on

the hypothesis that unions use costly disputes to price discriminate

against more profitable employers. In the absence of direct information on

the demand conditions facing the firm, the union presents the employer with

a downward sloping wage-concession schedule.     Faced with such a schedule,

the firm select higher wages and shorter strikes in more profitable states,

and lower wages and longer strikes in less profitable states.      The model

predicts that wage rates, strike probabilities, and average strike

durations all depend on the same set of variables. These include the mean

and dispersion of unobservable profitability, the expected gap between

productivity inside and outside the firm, and workers' risk preferences.

   In common with many other theories of strikes,    the model predicts that

strike incidence and duration will decrease when the joint costs of strikes

increase.   Thus, increases   in expected profitability are predicted to

reduce the probability and duration of work stoppages,    while increases in

the alternative wage are predicted to increase both.     The model also

predicts that wages will rise with increases in the alternative wage, and

rise with increases   in the expected profitability of the firm.
                                            46

    The implications of the theory are tested on a sample of collective

bargaining agreements from the Canadian manufacturing sector.           A simple

model of contractual wage rates is developed, based on the expected average

real wage rate during the term of the agreement.           Negotiated wage rates are

found to depend on the regional unemployment rate, the industry-specific

selling price, and the level and unexpected change in real wage rates in

the previous agreement.     Contrary to the basic premise of the model,

however,    there is no evidence that wage rates vary systematically with the

duration or incidence of strikes.

    Simple statistical models are also developed for the probability and

conditional duration of strikes.     As predicted by the theory, increases         in

unemployment, which are interpreted as reductions in the alternative wage,

decrease the negotiated wage and decrease the probability of strikes.             In

contrast, the estimated effects of industry selling prices are inconsistent

with the theoretical model.     Increases    in selling prices are found to

increase the negotiated wage, and also increase the probability of

disputes.     The latter finding seems to contradict the prediction that

strike losses will be lower when the opportunity costs of strike activity

are higher.    There is some evidence that expected strike duration         is


negatively related to industry output.           Again, however, this effect is
difficult to reconcile with the predictions of the model, since neither

wages nor strike probabilities are correlated with industry output.

    On balance,    the evidence in favor of the signalling interpretation cC

strike activity is weak. Neither the predicted structural relation between

wages and strikes, nor the predicted reduced form relation for wages,

strike probabilities, and strike durations          is found in the data.   Further

theoretical and empirical research will obviously be required to fully

describe the determinants of wages and strike outcomes in these data.

                                Data Appendix


1.   Mersing Strike Durations to Contract Settlements

      The merging process involved two steps.       First, firm and union names,

locations,   and settlement dates were listed for all contracts on the Wage

Tape that were recorded as settling after a work stoppage.            The appropriat,

issue of Strikes and Lockouts in Canada (SLC) was then checked for

information on the duration of the dispute.        Second,      in order to identify

strikes that were reported in      but not recorded on the Wage Tape, every

strike listing in      from 1964 to 1984 was checked against the list of

firm and union names generated from the contract data set

     The results from the first step of the merging process revealed a

probable coding error on the Wage Tape for settlements in 1980-81.           Ir.   these

two years 51 agreements were coded as settling at the stage of "bargaining

after a work stoppage".   Except in these two years, this is a relatively

rare settlement code on the Wage Tape.        Furthermore, in none of the cases

was there either a matching strike listing in          ,   or   a record of the

strike in the contract extract published in Labour Canada's Collective

Bargaining Review.   I have therefore assumed that these agreements were all

settled without a work stoppage.

      The results from the second step of the merging process revealed thot

in approximately five percent of cases where no strike was recorded on              tn
Wage Tape, a strike actually occurred during the contract negotiations

These strikes were distinguished from intra-contract wildcat strikes by

their dates and by SLC information on the cause of the dispute.

      The following table shows the distribution of final strike outcomes by
                                          52

their original recording status on the Wage Tape fot the entire sample of

2,868 manufacturing contracts:




                               orisinal Status

                              No Strike

Status
              Strike             100           572


      There were a total of 21 strikes for which strike duration information

was not found in SLC.     These include 16 strikes in contracts with effective

dates in late 1984 and 1985, for which           information is not yet

available, and five strikes in contracts       from previous years.    These are

also 28 instances of strikes that occurred in two or more apella.            in moat

of these cases, the initial apell(a) lasted less than one week.         For those

strikes I recorded strike duration as the duration of che longest spoiL



2.   Merpin Contracts Between    the Same Firm and Union

      The Wage Tape contains many instancea of duplicate contracts between

the same firm and union covering different establishments or groupa of

establishments.    Two contract chronologies were merged together if they had

the aame date, wage,    and work stoppage information.     There are   abc   oases

where several firms bargain together, and where the Wage Tape liars those

bargaining units separately for some contract negotiations, and jointly for

ocher negoriationa. In these cases I merged together the related oonroscrs

in all years to form a single chronology for the multiple-employer

bargaining unit.   Finally,   there are some cases where the Wage Tape

identification number for a given bargaining unit changes between
                                            53


negotiations, as a result of firm ownership changes or for other unknown

reasons.      In these cases I concatenated the contract chronologies to form e

single     continuous chronology.



 3.    Continuity of Base Wage Rates

       In some cases the base wage rate definition changes between

consecutive contracts on the Wage Tape (for example, between           janitors and

sweepers"     in one contract and "assemblers" in the next)        The cooing wage

rate for each contract was checked against the wage reported in the next

contract as the "old rate".         In cases where a change of definition

occurred, the base wage series were index-linked to form a consistent wage

series.




4.    Agaresate Data

       The following aggregate monthly data was merged to each contract

listing,     by the effective date of the contract.

       (a)    Average hourly earnings in all manufacturing.     January 1961 to

              March 1983:    Cansim Dl518, from the 1983 University Base Tapo

              (December   1983 Release).   April 1983 to June 1986:    Cansim LcG.'

              from the    Bank of Canada Review, various issues.      Observations

              from April 1983 and later are multiplied by 1.04035,       to reflect

              the revision in the establishment survey.

      b.      Consumer price index, all items, 1961      100.   January 1961 to

              November 1985:    Cansim D484000,   from the 1985 University   Bse

              Tape.   December 1985 to June 1986:     Cansim D484000, from the

              Bank of Canada Review, November 1986.
                                    54

c.   Unemployment rates, seasonally adjusted.        Rates for January 1966-

     November 1983 were obtained from the 1983 Cansim University Base

     Tape.    Rates for December 1983-December   1985 were obtained from

     the Bank of Canada Review,    November 1986.     The following serIes

     were used:     Quebec-Cansim D768478; Ontarto-Cansim D7138648;

     British Columbia-Cansim D769233; all other provinces-Cansim

     D767611 (national rate).

d.   Industry selling prices and indexes of output.        Three digit

     industry data for 1961-1971 were taken from Statistic Canada,

     Real Domestic Product by Industry 1961-71 (Ottawa:        Statistics

     Canada).     These data are classified by industry on the basis of

     the 1960 standard industrial    codes.   Data on a 1971 industry code

     basis for 1971-83 were taken from the 1978 and 1984 issues of

     Gross Domestic Product by Industry (Ottawa:        Statistics Canada)

     The 1960 and 1971 industry codes were then matched and the price

     and output series were spliced at 1971.        There were 31 (of 65) 5-

     digit industries for which data was not available       ona   consistent

     basis.     For these industries, appropriate two-digit industry data

     were used.
