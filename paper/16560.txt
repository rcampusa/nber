Occupational licensing is among the fastest-growing labor market institutions in the U.S. economy.
One of the key features of occupational licensing is that the law determines who gets to do the work.
In those cases where universally licensed occupations are both complements to and substitutes for
one another in providing a service, the government determines who can do the tasks that are required
for the consumer. In this study, we examine dentists and dental hygienists, who are both universally
licensed and provide complementary services to patients, but may also be substitutes as service providers.
We focus on the labor market implications of governmental requirements on permissible tasks and
the supervision of hygienists’ activities by dentists. Since there are elements of monopsony in the market
we examine, we use the model as a guide for our analysis. We find that states that allow hygienists
to be self-employed have about 10 percent higher earnings, and that dentists in those states have lower
earnings and slower employment growth. Several sensitivity and falsification tests using other regulated
and partially regulated occupations show that our licensing measures are generally robust to alternative
specifications. Our estimates are consistent with the view that winning the policy and legal battle in
the legislature and courts on the independence of work rules matters in the labor market for these occupations.

Introduction

       In this paper we examine two occupations—dentists and dental hygienists—that are both

universally licensed and provide complementary services to patients, but which are also

substitutes for certain tasks as service providers. However, for key services the states determine

who can do the work, the market structure, and what is required for the patient. We examine the

labor market implications of these governmental requirements. With the growth in the number of

individuals who are regulated or seeking regulation by the states, our case study can illuminate

the potential economic issues of the increased regulation of occupations in the U.S. labor market,

especially where the work of the regulated occupations overlaps. It also gives an illustration of

the kinds of issues that arise as more occupations become regulated and turf battles arise over

who is legally allowed to do work for pay.

       In order to examine these relationships between dentists and hygienists, we initially

explore the evolution of state regulation for both occupations over time, and what battle lines

have evolved for both occupations. We then show the anatomy of state regulations for dental

hygienists over time. We next further develop a model that includes the basic production

function in dentistry, with dentists as a scale factor and hygienists as key elements. We show

how a monopsony relationship, where there are frictions in the market and employers have the

ability to collude to set wages, between dentists and hygienists influences the earnings and

employment of hygienists and dentists. The empirical section shows the influence of state

regulations on hygienists’ earnings, and how the ability of hygienists to be self-employed is

associated with an earnings increase of approximately 10 percent. Further, when hygienists are

able to work without the supervision of a dentist, there is an associated increase in the state-level

employment growth of hygienists, but lower employment growth and earnings for dentists.

These results are robust to sensitivity tests for similar partially licensed occupations and other
                                                  1
health-related occupations that are regulated. To the extent that these estimates suggest

inefficiencies due to licensing and monopsonistic deadweight loss, we provide results of these

estimated losses. The rest of the analysis presents how we developed these findings.

Evolution and Anatomy of the Regulation of Dentists and Dental Hygienists

          In this part of our study, we present the evolution and anatomy of state licensing of

dentists and hygienists, and show how state policies have changed to favor greater autonomy for

hygienists (Adams, 2004).

          State licensing of dentists first began in South Carolina in 1876; Pennsylvania followed

suit the next year. The last state to fully license dentists was North Carolina in 1935. Currently,

most members of licensing boards are appointed by the governor through a list provided by the

state dental association. Generally, dentists dominate the state licensing boards; other licensed

professionals such as hygienists have a minority role in the process. Typically, state licensing

boards either have no hygienists or, more likely, have dentists that dominate the boards;

however, 17 states have separate hygienists’ committees that provide recommendations to the

board and, in some cases, to the legislature (Wanchek, 2010). As recently as 1994, 9 states forbid

the employment of more than two hygienists in a dental office fixing the scale effect for these

two occupations (ADHA, 1994). The licensing board deals with disciplinary issues involving

dentists. However, the portion that deals with the allocation of work among various service

providers and that gives services to clients is of direct interest for our analysis. For example, the

board makes recommendations to the legislature on regulations governing which occupation

provides dental services, and provides legal services to defend regulatory practices in state

courts.




                                                   2
         The state licensing of dental hygienists began with the regulation of hygienists by New

York in 1868. Over 50 years passed before other state governments followed suit: 5 additional

states licensed this occupation between 1919 and 1921 (Council of State Governments, 1952).

By 1952, 29 states had full licensing of dental hygienists, and in recent years, all the other states

have come to license dental hygienists (Council of State Governments, 1952). Dental hygiene is

unique among licensed professions in that it is regulated by dentists, rather than self-regulated, in

most states (Wanchek, 2010).1

         Initially, dental hygiene programs were one year long but have since been expanded;

programs now take between two and four years to complete. A particularly illustrative example

of regulatory oversight by the occupation occurred when military dental hygienists who returned

to the civilian workforce requested to sit for the hygienist’s exam. The civilian hygienists

protested, saying that the military hygienists needed the same years of dental hygiene training as

the civilian hygienists in order to take the licensing exam. One of the key issues for the licensing

boards of dental services was the work that dentists could do relative to hygienists and the

supervision of dental hygienists by dentists (Helm, 1993). Traditionally, dentists are required to

be physically present when hygienists are doing their work. As early as 1932, the issue of

determining the proper tasks of hygienists relative to dentists was raised at national meetings of

hygienists, with a view that hygienists should have greater autonomy. A key part of the history of

the profession focused on the importance of hygienists playing a more important role in the

policy process, particularly with respect to legislative issues. Until 1988, when Colorado first

allowed hygienists to practice without the direct supervision of a dentist, hygienists have been

1
  Exceptions are in Washington, where dental hygienists are regulated by the director of the state health department
in consultation with a committee of three dental hygienists and a consumer. In Connecticut, dental hygienists are
regulated directly by the health department. In New Mexico, hygienists are regulated by a committee of five dental
hygienists, one dentist, and a consumer. In all the other states, dentists dominate the decision process of who gets to
do the work.

                                                           3
required to work for or be under the direction of a dentist. Since that time, seven states have

allowed hygienists to be self-employed without the direct oversight of a dentist.2 As of 2007, no

state permitted reciprocity of the movement of dental hygienists from other states.

          In the late 1970s, the American Dental Hygienists’ Association (ADHA) supported

alternative practice methods that would allow the dental hygienist to become the primary

provider of initial services in accordance with state dental and dental hygiene practice acts

(Motley, 1988). In response to these policy changes, the American Dental Association (ADA)

passed a resolution stating that dental hygienists are auxiliaries who must work under the

supervision of a dentist, who also retained ownership and managerial authority (Beach, Shulman,

Johns, and Paas, 2007). Over time, hygienists have been able to gain greater authority in state

legislatures as their numbers have increased in overall dental practice, and consequently their

influence in crafting licensing laws has grown. These policy provisions by both dental service

organizations set the battlegrounds for conflicts in state legislatures, licensing boards, and the

courts.

State-Level Anatomy of Dental Hygienists’ Legally Permitted Job Characteristics

          In order to show the growth in hygienists’ autonomy over time, in Figure 1 we develop

and show a box-and-whisker graphic analysis of state regulation, which gives the mean and

spread of the regulation of hygienists over the period 2001–2007. Panel A shows the overall

ranking of dental hygienists’ professional practice environment that is allowed by statute or legal

rulings. Panel B shows the number of dental tasks that hygienists are permitted to do,


2
  As of 2007, seven states (California, Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon, and Washington) allow
hygienists to be self-employed other than as independent contractors, and only three states (California, Colorado,
and New Mexico) permit a dental hygienist to own a dental hygiene practice (Beach et. al., 2007). Montana and
Nebraska adopted the provision to allow hygienists to be self-employed other than as independent contractors in
2003 and 2007, respectively. The work by dental hygienists who are self-employed is restricted to specific kinds of
dental practices that vary across these states. For example, in Colorado hygienists are allowed to clean teeth and do
simple restorative work, independently of a dentist.

                                                          4
independently of dentists, by state law or administrative or court rulings in the state. We provide

a full listing of the provisions in the table in Appendix A, but some of the key components of the

tasks include prophylaxis (cleaning), fluoride treatment, sealant application, X-rays, amalgam

restorations, local anesthesia, nitrous oxide, initial screening, and patient referral (Center for

Health Workforce Studies, 2004).3 The results in panels A and B of Figure 1 show a movement

toward greater autonomy for hygienists in dental practice from 2001 to 2007. The mean value of

the summated rating scale for all states was 43.67 (S.D.=19.84) in 2001 and increased to 49.10

(S.D.= 20.54) by 2007 (out of 100 possible points). Most of the changes in state regulations

occurred between 2002 and 2007, a period during which more states allowed hygienists to

perform additional procedures. Panel A shows the overall results, which suggests that in spite of

generally greater control of the regulatory process by dentists, hygienists have been able to gain

more autonomy over the delivery of dental services to include the ability to control their own

offices without the supervision of a dentist. Moreover, even within states that have full control

over the delivery of dental services, there has been growth in the independence of hygienists

from monitoring by dentists with respect to specific dental procedures, and likely an increase in

the skills and education provided to clients of dental services.

         In the next section, we model the role for dentists and hygienists in the production

function of dental services and how the market for hygienists’ services may resemble a

monopsony in certain elements of the market for dentists and hygienists.

A Model of Dental Services Production

         This section initially develops the basic production function for dental services and then

expands it to include government regulation of work practices, where dentists are required to

3
 A report funded by the Kellogg Foundation Rasmuson Foundation and Bethel Community Services Foundation
showed that dental hygienists performed as well as dentists in performing routine tasks such as the ones listed here
(Wetterhall, Bader, Burrus, Lee, and Shugars, 2010).

                                                          5
supervise hygienists. The model serves as a basis to inform the empirical work, rather than as a

fully specified general equilibrium model of dental production under regulation. The unit of

analysis for the model is the office-based dental practice. Following Reinhardt (1972), this entity

can be treated as a firm of which the dentist is the owner/manager who faces a profit

maximization decision. The dentist makes decisions regarding her own effort to maximize

income, subject to constraints including the technical production relationship between her labor

and other inputs:

Qd = HH = f[D(z),K]                                                      (1)

Qh = HL = f[D(z), H(z),K]                                                (2)

         Qd is the output produced by the dentists, which we will refer to as “high-skilled dental

services (HH).” Qh is the output produced by the hygienists, which we will refer to as “low-

skilled dental services (HL).” D(z) represents the dentist’s labor, recognizing that output relies on

his decision of personal input, and H(z) represents the hygienist’s labor, recognizing that output

relies on her decision of personal input. K represents the quantities of capital inputs used in a

dental practice. For simplicity we consider capital (office space and equipment) and dental

employees, who are of two types of labor: dentists and hygienists.4

         When analyzing occupations that are licensed, we follow Shapiro (1986), who models a

labor market where service output has two types of workers: high-skilled and lower-skilled. In

order to adapt the model to our production function and the market for dentists and hygienists,

we have created a stylized version of production and output. The specifics of the model are

presented next.

         An explanation of the theory with licensing can be written as follows for dentists:

4
  We, of course, realize that other workers are in dental offices who contribute to production, such as dental
technicians, aides, and clerical and administrative assistants. In our empirical work, we expand upon the theoretical
production function to include these additional worker inputs.

                                                          6
                ,                                                   (3)

where HH is the high-skilled dental services provided, and A is the technology provided to

produce HH, L is the labor input, and K is capital.

Similarly, the output for hygienists can be given by the following expression:

               ,                                                    (4)

where HL is the low-skilled dental services provided, and B is the technology provided to

produce HL.

       However, by law the technology needed to produce HL for the hygienists is tied to

supervision by the dentist. This expression can be written as follows:

          .                                                         (5)

Therefore, the production function for hygienists can be written as follows:

                      ,                                             (6)

where in the case of Ld = 0 with regulation, there is no production of dental hygienists’ services.

       We also assume that Ld + Lh = 1. Therefore,                1 and        1.

       The profit function for dental services can be written as

ρB Lγh Kδh – whLh – rh Kh                                           (7)

PdA Lαd Kβd + (1-ρ)       Ld) Lγh Kδh – wdLd – rd Kd,,              (8)

where ρ = 1 is the case of no regulation and 0               1, and P is the price of the service.

       Equation (7) is a profit function for the hygienist if the price of the service is normalized

as 1. Equation (8) is a profit function for the dentist, where whLh is the cost of labor and rh Kh is

the cost of capital. Within this profit function, the hygienist’s wage is determined by the

decisions of the dentist to use of the hygienist’s labor input and technology mix by the high-

skilled provider, HH, and is exogenous. As the hygienist’s wage goes down, the dentist’s wage


                                                         7
will go up. Also implied is that the hygienist’s employment will go up and the dentist’s

employment will go down. These conditions, which are a modified production function, can

therefore lead to conditions that are consistent with a monopsony market for hygienists.5

Can Regulation Result in Conditions Consistent with Monopsony in the Labor Market?

         Under occupational licensing, both dentists and hygienists are often assumed to attempt

to capture the rents of licensing and reallocate resources from the consumer to the regulated

practitioners (Friedman, 1962). The application to our case study assumes that the relatively low-

skilled (hygienist) workers, HL, can by law do only low-skilled work and are allowed to work

only under the supervision of relatively high-skilled workers, HH. With favorable regulation for

dentists, the high-skilled workers that control low-skilled workers’ tasks and their ability to do

work only for certain types of employers have monopsonistic characteristics to employ lower-

skilled workers and capture rents. When regulation of employment by high-skilled workers of

low-skilled workers ceases, low-skilled workers can open their own establishments and capture

the licensing rents for themselves (Groshen, 1991). For monopsony to exist, there are generally

two key assumptions in the labor market (Manning, 2003). First, important frictions are assumed

to be present. In the case of two universally licensed occupations, with one dominant, this

requires the supervision of the other, and the assumption of frictions in the labor market is

established. Second, employers have some ability to set wages. Since dental hygienists have no

other major options for employment other than working for or under the supervision of a dentist,

they can have significant market power to collude to set wages in a local market. This is

consistent with one of the elements of monopsony (Lipscomb and Douglas, 1982).



5
 The first-order condition shows that ρBγ Lγ-1h Kδh – wh = 0, ρB δLγh Kδ-1h – rh = 0, PdA αLα-1d Kβd + (1-ρ) Lγh Kδh –
wd = 0 and PdAβ Lαd Kβ-1d – rd = 0. It implies that the hygienist’s wage will go down and the dentist’s wage will go up.
Also, it implies that the employment of hygienists will go down and dentists’ employment will go up (Varian, 1992).

                                                          8
       A simple static partial equilibrium model of monopsony in the context of occupational

licensing is shown in Figure 2, where a monopsonist employer maximizes profits with

employment L, which equates demand, given by the marginal revenue product (MRP) curve, to

marginal cost MC at point A. With licensing, both occupations are able to restrict the supply of

labor and raise wages within each occupation. Although we do not estimate a structural model of

an equilibrium model of monopsony, the model informs our empirical work in the next section of

our study.

       We further assume that the occupation (i.e., dentists who employ hygienists) is a simple

monopsonist who has to pay a single wage to all its workers. The occupation also has a revenue

function. In the model, the occupation is assumed to face a labor supply curve that relates the

wage paid w to the level of employment, L. Denote the supply of labor to the occupation if it

pays w by L(w), and w(L) will be referred to as the labor supply curve to the individual

occupation. Both L(w) and w(L) will be referred to as the labor supply curve to the occupation.

Total labor costs are given by w(L)L. Assume that the occupation, dentistry, is a simple

monopsonist who has to pay a single wage to all the workers under its control. Assume the

occupation has a revenue function Y(L). It wants to choose L to maximize profits, which are

given by

                    .                                                  (9)

       The first-order condition is

 ′                      ′
                             .                                         (10)

       The value            is the marginal revenue product of labor, and                  is the

marginal cost of labor. The latter increases total labor costs when an additional worker is hired

(Manning, 2003). Although in our case dentists are making positive profits on the marginal


                                                   9
hygienists, there is no incentive to increase employment because doing so would require

increasing the wage to attract the extra worker, and this higher wage must be paid to all existing

workers. The gap between the wage and the marginal revenue product in Figure 2 is referred to

as the rate of exploitation (Manning, 2003). In our case, the model predicts that laws that require

hygienists to work for or be supervised by dentists would result in lower wages and employment

for hygienists. In addition, if the laws were relaxed, there would likely be lower earnings and

employment for dentists, since the level of exploitation would be reduced. Further, the lower

employment and wage caused by monopsony power has two distinct effects on the economic

welfare of the occupations. First, the law, when it favors dentists’ control over the market

structure, redistributes welfare away from workers (hygienists) and to their employer (dentists).

Second, the market structure established by these two occupations reduces the aggregate (or

social) welfare enjoyed by both groups taken together, since the employers' net gain is smaller

than the loss inflicted on workers. It is a net social loss or deadweight loss. It is a measure of the

market failure caused by monopsony power, through a misallocation of resources.

       Figure 2 shows that a monopsonist employer in the face of licensing maximizes profits

with employment LM that equates demand, given by the marginal revenue product (MRP) curve,

to marginal cost MC at point A. The supply curve SL is the result of licensing. The wage is then

determined on the supply curve of licensed workers SL, at point M, and is equal to wM. By

contrast, a competitive labor market would reach equilibrium at point C, where supply S* equals

demand. This would lead to employment L* and wage w*. Triangle AML is deadweight loss, the

part that has been lost by society as a result of the monopsonistic restriction of employment; and

rectangle wLwMMM’ is the part that the monopsonist licensed employer has exploited from the




                                                  10
other licensed workers. Triangle LL”C is deadweight loss, the part of the competitive social

surplus that has been lost by society due to the licensing of workers.

       The estimates of the empirical influence of monopsony without licensing have been

mixed. For example, the results for specific industries range from major league baseball, where

the impact has been large (100 to 600 percent), to teachers, nurses, and nurses assistants where

the influence has been 5 percent or less (Scully, 1974; Zimbalist, 1992, Kahn; 2000; Matsudaira,

2010). For the overall labor market, the impact of monopsony has been estimated at less than 3

percent (Brown and Medoff, 1989). Our analysis is the first attempt to estimate monopsony for

both workers and their primary occupational employer as a result of variations in occupational

licensing statutes, specifically related to the ability of hygienists to open their own dental

practice offices or do work independently of dentists (Boal and Ransom, 1997).

Measurement of Dental Hygiene Professional Practice Index (DHPPI)

       To assess state government regulations on the professional practice environment of dental

hygienists, we extend the Dental Hygiene Professional Practice Index (DHPPI). The Center for

Health Workforce Studies (2004) originally compiled this index, which consists of state

government regulations in the 50 states and the District of Columbia for 2001. For the period

2002–2007, we update all the changes in sub-items of four major professional components that

were used to create the DHPPI for the year 2001. For each state and the District of Columbia for

each year from 2002 through 2007, we track whether each item under the four main regulatory

components has changed since 2001, and if any change occurred, we then assign the same value

for each item as the Center for Health Workforce Studies (2004) listed. The four major

professional components include the following (Center for Health Workforce Studies, 2004: for

detailed DHPPI computations, see Appendix C of this government report):



                                                  11
    1. Legal and regulatory environment. Governance of the profession through the state

        regulatory board of dental hygiene or a dental hygiene committee empowered by a dental

        board with a mandate to regulate the profession, licensure by credential/endorsement with

        no new clinical exam required, scope of practice defined in law or regulations, and

        restriction to patient of record of primary employing dentist.

    2. Supervision in different practice settings. Dental supervision requirements across a

        variety of health settings including private dental offices, long-term care facilities,

        schools, public health agencies, correctional facilities, and similar institutional facilities.

        The supervision requirements vary from direct supervision to general and collaborator

        supervision, and to complete autonomy.

    3. Tasks permitted under varying levels of supervision. Tasks allowed for dental hygienists

        to provide basic services such as prophylaxis, sealants, fluorides, X-rays, hygiene

        screening and assessment, as well as expanded functions such as placing amalgam

        restorations, administration of local anesthesia, and administration of nitrous oxide.6

    4. Reimbursement. Direct Medicaid reimbursement and direct payment to hygienists by

        other third-party insurers or patients.

        The raw score of the DHPPI is a 100-point scale with different weights to sub-items

under the four major components, indicating that a higher score means a less restrictive practice

environment for dental hygienists.

        For empirical analysis, we use the DHPPI as an overall index to capture the spread in

each state’s regulatory system for the professional practice environment, as coded by the Center

for Health Workforce Studies (2004). Because certain regulatory components are more important

6
 We note that this component also includes other provisions, such as whether a hygienist may be self-employed
other than as an independent contractor. We separated this provision from the other components and treat it as a
qualitatively different variable in our empirical analysis.

                                                        12
to wage determination and employment outcomes than other components, we also examine each

individual component in two ways. In particular, we focus on two major components: tasks

permitted and supervision requirements. Because the weights to the sub-items of these

components of the DHPPI are assigned in somewhat arbitrary fashion, we develop both the

summated rating scale (the summated rating scale) and the statistically weighted index (Rasch

index) for each component. Therefore, we examine how each state’s regulatory system on the

professional practice environments affects the market outcomes of the professions by using both

linear (summated rating scale) and nonlinear (Rasch index) measures of the regulatory system.

Finally, we analyze whether the provision that permits hygienists to be self-employed other than

as independent contractors affects the market outcomes. The table in Appendix A presents the

operational definition of our regulatory variables.7

         Table 1 shows the top and bottom five states ranked by their summated DHPPI. Although

the rankings of the top five states have remained the same with a minor change in the DHPPI for

the years 2001–2007, the rankings of the bottom five states have changed with a relatively larger

growth in the DHPPI. In particular, Kentucky, the second-lowest state in the DHPPI, went

through a substantial change during the period. The state with the largest growth was Montana

with an increase of 43 points. Not only has the DHPPI been increasing, but there has also been

considerable variation across states and over time.

Labor Market Analysis for Dentists and Hygienists with Occupational Licensing

Regulations




7
  The correlations among the major components of the original DHPPI range from 0.56 to 0.96, and their
intercorrelation (i.e., Cronbach’s alpha) is 0.77. Although the correlations among the two summated ratings of the
task permitted and self-employment range from 0.50 to 0.75 and their intercorrelation is 0.67, the correlations
among the two Rasch indices and self-employment range from 0.41 to 0.73, and their intercorrelation is 0.51.

                                                         13
        Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for key labor market variables as well as other

market and regulatory variables used in our analysis from the American Community Survey

(ACS). 8 Appendix B describes how we constructed the data used to analyze dentists and

hygienists from the ACS. The values show that the average age of dentists is about six years

higher than that for hygienists, and that dentists have six more years of schooling. Further, the

dentistry profession tends to be male dominated, whereas 97 percent of hygienists are female.

The average hourly earnings of dentists are more than three times as high as for hygienists. One

important distinction from the data is that although 71 percent of dentists are self-employed, only

2 percent of hygienists work for themselves. Part of this difference may be due to state laws that

require dentists to directly supervise the work of hygienists.

        Our estimates in Tables 3 and 4 demonstrate the association between DHPPI and hourly

earnings for dental hygienists and dentists, using individual-level data in the ACS. The basic

general earnings equation can be stated as follows:

                 /
ln                        α             γ                                   ,            (11)

where Earningsit is the hourly earnings of dentist (D) or dental hygienist (H) i at state s in time

period t; Rst is the DHPPI and its components in person i’s state s in time period t; the vector Xist

includes covariates measuring the characteristics of each person; the vector Zst includes time-

varying state-level controls such as the state median household income and the percentage of




8
  We choose to analyze the ACS as our main dataset over alternative datasets such as the CPS, because the use of the
ACS over time allows us to have enough observations by state to fully implement the empirical model that requires
state and year controls. For a detailed sampling framework of the ACS, see U.S. Census Bureau, American
Community Survey, Data and Documentation, http://www.census.gov/acs/www/data_documentation/data_main/.

                                                        14
uninsured in the state; δs and ηt are state and year fixed effects, respectively; and uist is the error

term.9

         In Table 3 we show the impact of the overall DHPPI index on the logarithm of hourly

earnings of hygienists with all the controls for individual characteristics shown in Table 2 that

were extracted from the ACS. Our results show that the DHPPI level is not a significant factor in

determining hourly earnings. However, the legal ability either to be self-employed or to have

tasks unsupervised is a key factor influencing wage determination. For example, having the

ability to be self-employed raises hygienists’ hourly earnings by approximately a statistically

significant 10 percent, and working unsupervised measured by the summated score (the Rasch

score) is associated with an 1.2 or 0.7 percent increase in earnings for hygienists.10

         In contrast for dentists in Table 4, the estimates from the model using the same set of

controls from the ACS as in Table 3 indicate that having state provisions that allow for

hygienists to be self-employed is associated with approximately 16 percent lower hourly

earnings for the dentists than for those members of the occupation who are generally required by

law to supervise dental hygienists.11 It appears that dentists lose more perhaps because they are

no longer able to require hygienists to only work for them in order to provide dental services.

The consequence of the legal provision may result in higher costs due to higher wages for

hygienists. In addition, there may be lost income because hygienists may be taking patients away

9
  Although an alternative specification might be a difference-in-difference approach, we do not have the same
individuals over time by state. However, our ability to control for time and state fixed effects suggests that our
policy variables influence wages for each occupation beyond state or time varying characteristics.
10
   We also examined whether hygienists are directly reimbursed under the state government regulations with the
same specifications. Although not shown in this paper, the direct reimbursement is associated with approximately
5.1 percent higher earnings for hygienists and 8.4 percent lower earnings for dentists, but is statistically significant
at the 0.01 level only for hygienists. However, the direct reimbursement is not statistically significant in the
employment growth models in Tables 5 and 6.
11
   We further examined the impact of state government regulations on the hourly earnings gap between dentists and
hygienists. To do this, we computed the state median hourly earnings of each profession. Consistent with the results
in Tables 3 and 4, Appendix C shows that state regulations reduced the hourly earnings gap between these
professions.

                                                          15
from full-service dentists and recommending fewer costly dental procedures.12 To illustrate,

there are powerful incentive effects for dentists to recommend more costly procedures. On

average, sealants cost $37, but most fillings cost more than $100 and also need to be replaced

periodically (Simonsen, 1991). Once fillings are installed, there is a greater likelihood of both

crowns and root canals, both of which cost more than $1,000 each. Since hygienists can only

work on sealants, having independent hygienists can have a major impact on dental incomes by

changing the service and product mix. Sealants provide protection from further tooth decay that

is as good as or better than the protection from fillings (Gooch, 2009). Further, the signs of the

coefficients for the ability of hygienists to engage in broader work assignments are negative in

the remainder of the specifications for dentists’ wage determination.

        We also examined whether state provisions that allow for hygienists to be self-employed

are associated with earnings dispersions for the two occupations.13 The results in Table 5 show

that the dispersion of the log of hourly earnings for hygienists in the states with the self-

employment provisions was 15 percent higher than in the states without the provisions, and was

statistically significant at the 0.05 level. But no statistically significant difference was found for

dentists.

        The employment effects of variations in state statutes for dental hygienists and dentists

are given in Tables 6 and 7, respectively.14 The general employment equation can be stated as

follows:


12
   For example, independent dental hygienists are likely to recommend lower-cost dental sealants, but a hygienist
who works in a full-service office may have incentives to recommend a higher-cost dental filling due to bonuses or
promotion opportunities.
13
   We computed the dispersions using a similar estimation procedure as in Kleiner and Krueger, 2010}Our first-
stage estimates of the residual values for dental hygienists and dentists were from column 6 in Tables 3 and 4,
respectively. We then computed the mean squared residual s for each occupation by whether self-employment was
allowed. We compared the significance of the values generated in each category using the t-value.
14
   As a further test of the reliability of our employment data, we correlated the data from Occupational Employment
Statistics (OES) with membership data from the ADHA by state for 2002–2006 and the number of active dentists in

                                                        16
                  /
                         α             γ                         ,              (12)

where Employmentst is the employment growth of dentists (D) and hygienists (H) at state s in

time period t; Rst is the DHPPI and its components at state s in time period t; the vector Xst

includes covariates measuring economic and dental characteristics within each state; δs and ηt are

state and year fixed effects, respectively; and ust is the error term.

        The estimates from our reduced form model in Table 6 show that the overall index is not

significantly associated with employment growth of hygienists in equations that include state-

level controls such as the growth in the number of dentists in the state, the state median

household income, the percentage of uninsured in the state, and the state median prices of

amalgam restoration and prophylaxis in each specification in the table. However, whether

hygienists can be self-employed is positively and statistically significant at the 0.10 level in its

association with employment growth of hygienists by about 6 percent. Further, enhancing the

ability of hygienists to do various tasks without the supervision of dentists also is associated with

positive employment growth for their occupation. This outcome is consistent with our production

model of dental services, and with the monopsony model of dentists and hygienists in the

determination of wages and employment.

        Table 7 shows the relationship between the statutes and the growth of employment for

dentists in the state. We find that giving greater autonomy to hygienists is associated with a

significantly negative 26 percent employment growth of dentists. Since the average growth rate

of dentists’ employment is 2 percent, having a law that allows hygienists to have an independent

business would reduce their growth rate to about 1.5 percent. Since hygienists and dentists are




2006 from the ADA. Their correlation was .92 and .96, respectively. This suggests that the OES is an appropriate
measure of dentists’ and hygienists’ employment by state and year.

                                                        17
often substitutes for each other’s services in the production of dental services, the state

provisions favoring hygienists may reduce the need for dentists in the state.

        In order to test for the robustness and sensitivity of our results, we show two cases in

Table 8( Leamer, 2010).15 In panel A we estimated the role of the DHPPI on the earnings of

dental assistants who are not universally licensed and have different requirements than dental

hygienists, and found no influence of the index to include market structure on their earnings in

the ACS. In panel B, we performed another robustness check using data from the ACS for

registered nurses, who have another set of statutes influencing the market structure for their

occupation. We found that the DHPPI had no influence on the earnings of registered nurses.

These results suggest that our results did not result from other factors that were not captured by

the state fixed effects.

        Since our results show elements of monopsony as shown in our theory and evidence,

there are also potential redistribution effects and economic losses within the context of both

occupations being licensed. If there is no reduction in the quality of services provided to patients

with fewer regulations in dentistry, then an application of a deadweight loss analysis can give the

parameters to estimate potential losses to society from monopsony in the market (Kleiner and

Kudrle, 2000). Using the parameters developed from the results from theory and our estimates,

we show in Table 9 that the reallocation from hygienists to dentists is approximately $1.34

billion per year. The output loss due to the monopsonistic restriction of employment is

approximately $0.08 billion per year. The output loss due to licensing is between $0.54 and

$0.68 billion per year. Therefore, the total losses associated with overall occupational licensing


15
  Further, Appendix D shows estimates using the lag of the self-employment policy variable for hourly earnings and
employment growth. These results are consistent with those in Tables 3 through 6. We also performed additional
robustness tests excluding self-employed dentists. The qualitative influence was robust. Specific sample selection
procedures for dental assistants and registered nurses and full results are shown in Table 7 and Appendix D

                                                       18
and within-occupation regulation are between $0.62 and $0.75 billion annually. This results in

approximately a 1 percent annual reduction in the output of dental services for those states that

required dentists’ supervision of dental hygienists using a basic deadweight loss analysis

(Carneiro, Heckman, and Vytlacil, 2009).

Conclusions

       The licensing of occupations is most pervasive among health care occupations. Our study

examines two occupations—dentists and dental hygienists—that are universally licensed in all

fifty states in the United States. We initially explore the evolution of licensing for these two

occupations, and the legal conditions governing permissible tasks for hygienists that impact both

occupations. We show the conflict that has arisen over the allocation of work and supervision of

tasks. Next we show the anatomy and timing of the implementation of regulations by state that

guides the work that each of the occupations can legally do by state statutes and administrative

decisions. Given this institutional background, we extend a model of dental production that has

elements of occupational licensing that favors dentists in the production of services to patients.

The model shows that regulations requiring dentists to supervise hygienists result in higher

earnings for dentists and lower earnings and employment for dental hygienists. We then extend

the model to show that it has elements of monopsony, which can result in potential deadweight

losses to society if licensing and these monopsony rents are pervasive.

        The estimates from the empirical models show the impact of regulations that favor tasks

that hygienists can perform on the wages and employment of dentists and hygienists for the

period 2001–2007. During this time period, hygienists were allowed to do more tasks and in

seven states were allowed to work without the supervision of a dentist. The time and state fixed

effects models for both dentists and hygienists showed that greater autonomy by legally



                                                 19
allowing hygienists to work independently of dentists is associated with an approximately 10

percent higher wage and a 6 percent increase in the employment growth of dental hygienists. In

contrast, these state provisions are associated with approximately a 16 percent reduction in

dental hourly earnings and a 26 percent reduction in dental employment growth in the states. In

part, this larger loss by dentists is as a result of a change in the service and product mix that is

delivered by hygienists in comparison to full-service dental offices. Using a simple deadweight

loss analysis consistent with a monopsony model, we find that the typical state would lose

approximately 1 percent of dental expenditures due to licensing, and by not allowing hygienists

to practice on their own.

       Overall, the results suggest that state laws on permissible tasks matter in wage and

employment determination for both dentists and hygienists. With occupational licensing, the

final arbiter of who gets to do work is the responsibility of the state legislature and the courts.

The decisions by these policy makers appear to influence wage and employment outcomes for

practitioners in the occupations. Additional potential conflicts for licensed occupations such as

architects and interior designers arising from the issue of who can legally do certain tasks also

can be examined in this manner. Further, more data and analysis on the impact of who gets to

do the work on patient outcomes would further assist policy makers on whether allowing

hygienists greater autonomy in dental services would have a net benefit to the public. Along

with the analysis in this study, such data would add more to the evaluation of licensing laws in

health care and the battles between licensed occupations for enhanced work and pay.

                            within a Partial Equilibrium Framework




Note: A monopsonist employer maximizes profits with employment LM, that equates demand,
given by the marginal revenue product (MRP) curve, to marginal cost MC at point A. Supply
curve SL is the result of licensing. The wage is then determined on the supply curve of licensed
workers SL, at point M, and is equal to wM. By contrast, a competitive labor market would reach
equilibrium at point C, where supply S* equals demand. This would lead to employment L* and
wage w*. Triangle AML is deadweight loss, the part that has been lost by society as a result of the
monopsonistic restriction of employment; and rectangle wLwMMM’ is the part that the
monopsonist licensed employer has exploited from the other licensed workers. Triangle LL”C is
deadweight loss, the part of the competitive social surplus that has been lost by society due to the
licensing of workers.

 Table 9: A Static Simulation of the Effects of State Regulations on U.S. Dental Service Costs


Estimates of U.S. Dental Service Expenditures
      U.S. dental service expenditures are approximately $96.36 billion (U.S. Department of
       Health and Human Services, 2008).
      Labor costs account for 60 percent of health care spending (Schwieters and Harper,
       2007).
      Dental hygienists account for approximately 23.2 percent of the total labor costs (from
       the ratio of the average hourly earnings of dentists and hygienists in Table 3).
      Therefore, labor costs for hygienists are approximately $13.40 billion (=$96.36 billion ×
       0.60 × 0.232), which is rectangle wMOLMM (=wM×LM) in Figure 2.

Analysis of Monopsonistic Exploitation and Deadweight Loss Using Basic Demand Analysis
      Monopsonistic exploitation (rectangle wLwMMM’ in Figure 2)
   -   We substitute the estimates of 0.100 for (WL‐WM)/WM and 0.061 for (LL‐LM)/LM (from
       Tables 4 and 6).
   -   Then, we are able to compute the reallocation from hygienists to dentists (rectangle
       wMwLM’M) as follows:
       (wL ‐ wM) × LM = 0.100 wM × LM = 0.100 × $13.40 billion = $1.34 billion
   -   Although we cannot compute a deadweight loss due to the restrictions (i.e., triangle AML
       as a whole), we can approximate it with triangle M’ML by multiplying two. Then, the
       deadweight loss due to the monopsonistic employment restriction is
       (wL ‐ wM) × (LL ‐ LM) = 0.100 wM× 0.061 LM = 0.100 × 0.061 × $13.40 billion = $0.08 billion.

      Licensing Effect
   -   To compute the licensing effect, we compute hygienists’ total revenue, rectangle wLOLLL
       in Figure 2. For this, we only need to compute rectangle MLMLLL’ as follows:
       (LL ‐ LM) × wM = 0.061 LM × wM = 0.061 × $13.40 billion = $0.82 billion.
   -   Then, hygienists’ total revenue is $15.64 billion (=$13.40 billion + $1.34 billion +$0.08
       billion +$0.82 billion).
   -   Given that the licensing premium is 15 percent economy-wide (Kleiner and Krueger,
       forthcoming), then the reallocation from consumers to hygienists’ services is $2.35
       billion (=0.15*$15.64 billion).
   -   Also, given that the mean value of demand elasticity of labor is 0.3 (Hamermesh, 1993),
       the deadweight loss due to licensing (i.e., triangle LL”C in Figure 2) should be about $0.70
       billion. If only 80 percent is deadweight (Carneiro, Heckman, and Vytlacil, 2009), then
       $0.56 billion.

      The total output losses would be $0.56 billion to $0.70 billion due to licensing plus the
       monopsony effect of $0.08 billion, which equals $0.64 billion to $0.78 billion.

          Appendix B: Data Developed from the American Community Survey (ACS)

       To generate our sample of dentists and dental hygienists, we started by dropping

individuals who belong to the categories “Working without pay in family business or farm” and

“Unemployed.” Thus, our sample includes individuals who belong to the classes of (1) Private

wage and salary workers, (2) Government workers (who work in any local, state, or federal

governmental unit), and (3) Self-employed both in own not incorporated business and in own

incorporated business.

       Next, we dropped individuals whose education is “Below Associate” for dentists and

individuals whose education is “Below 12th Grade without Diploma” for dental hygienists. We

also dropped individuals whose age is greater than 65 and whose years of experience (=Age

−years of schooling – 6) is below zero and individuals whose usual working hours in the past 12

months are less than 20 hours or more than 60 hours.

       To compute the hourly earnings, we first computed annual hours worked (i.e., the usual

working hours times the number of weeks for the past 12 months). Then we compute annual

earnings by adding the wage and salary income (i.e., wagp) and the income from self-

employment (i.e., semp), and then divide the annual earnings by annual hours worked.

       In computing the hourly earnings, however, the ACS has two potential measurement

problems: the presence of outliers and the topcoding (or censoring) of both incomes (i.e., wagp

and semp), particularly for dentists. First, a few individuals report implausibly high earnings

relative to their hours of work, which would affect the estimated mean and variance of hourly

earnings. We deleted observations whose hourly earnings were in the top 0.5 percent for each

occupation. As a result, the highest hourly earnings were in the range of two times of the top

coded hourly earnings. We computed the top coded hourly earnings (also top coded hourly wagp



                                                37
and semp) assuming that the top coded individuals worked for 40 hours and 52 weeks in a given

year. For individuals who had wagp (semp) only, we assigned the top coded hourly wagp (semp)

as their hourly earnings. For individuals who had both wagp and semp and the sum of hourly

wagp and hourly semp was greater than the higher of the top coded hourly wagp and the top

coded hourly semp, we assigned the higher of the top coded hourly wagp and the topcoded

hourly semp as their hourly earnings.

       To deal with the topcodings, as much of the literature does, we adjusted the topcoded

incomes by a factor (typically, 1.33 or 1.4) that approximates the mean for those above the

censoring point (Card and DiNardo, 2002). In this paper, we present empirical results using

hourly earnings adjusted by a factor of 1.4.

       For individuals who reported implausibly low earnings, we deleted these observations

with measured hourly wages below the federal minimum wage of $5.15 during 2001–2007.
