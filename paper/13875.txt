To explore how well the safety net performs at eliminating differences in diagnosis and treatment of
insured and uninsured women with breast cancer, we compared insured and uninsured women treated
in a safety net setting. Controlling for socioeconomic characteristics, uninsured women are more likely
to be diagnosed with advanced disease, requiring more extensive treatment relative to insured women,
and also experience delays in initiating and completing treatment. The findings suggest that, despite
the safety net system, uninsured women with breast cancer are likely to require more costly treatment
and to have worse outcomes, relative to insured women with breast cancer.

       The Institute of Medicine’s report, Insuring America’s Health: Principles and

Recommendations, highlighted the sub-par health care of uninsured persons

(approximately 43 million people) and called for universal health insurance (Institute of

Medicine 2004). Instead of universal coverage, the United States (U.S.) relies on a safety

net system to treat uninsured patients, including patients with chronic, life threatening,

and costly diseases such as breast cancer. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of

cancer death for women and the third leading cause of death in women overall (American

Cancer Society 2006).

       In this study, we compare diagnosis and treatment between insured and uninsured

women with breast cancer treated in a safety net setting, to explore how well the safety

net system performs in eliminating differences in diagnosis and health care between

insured and uninsured women. Treatment patterns observed at a large safety net provider

may offer the best evidence to study differences between insured and uninsured patients.

Because the population of interest is the uninsured, there is not a single repository of

claims data (e.g., Medicaid, Medicare, Anthem) that documents treatment history.

Although our study is specific to a single health care facility, we are able to provide a

detailed characterization, using administrative billing data, of the treatment of the

uninsured. While larger scale studies (for example, Ayanian et al., 1993) have confirmed

that uninsured patients have worse survival than insured patients, because of the absence

of detailed information on treatment the reasons for this disparity are unknown.

       Safety net providers are often associated with urban academic institutions that

diagnose and treat a significant proportion of a community’s indigent population by

offering diagnostic and treatment services at no or low cost, based on the patient’s assets

and income. In addition to safety net providers, there are also other options for

                                                                                              1
subsidized health care for low-income uninsured women. For example, the Centers for

Disease Control National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program

(NBCCEDP) provides access to breast and cervical cancer screening services for

underserved women in the U.S. (Centers for Disease Control 2006).1

       Nonetheless, on average uninsured women with breast cancer are diagnosed at a

later stage, and have poorer survival than insured women (Ayanian 1993). Our research

explores how effective the safety net system is at eliminating differences between insured

and uninsured patients in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Breast cancer

represents a “best case scenario” for studying whether the safety net system can eliminate

differences in diagnosis and treatment between insured and uninsured patients, given

multiple options for free or low cost diagnosis and care, and given that patients are likely

to be motivated to follow and complete recommended therapy.

Conceptual Framework

       Differences in diagnosis, treatment, and survival between insured and uninsured

women could be explained by a failure of safety net or other institutions to close the gap

between these two groups, or by a lack of access to these institutions on the part of some

women. Alternatively, these differences could be attributable to variation in behavior

related to health and health care — perhaps associated with factors such as

socioeconomic status — which are correlated with but not caused by health insurance

status. Because these differences may have as much or more influence on health and

health care behavior than does health insurance, failure to account for such differences

likely results in overestimation of the deleterious effects of being uninsured (Currie and

Thomas 1995; Doyle 2005).




                                                                                             2
       We therefore structure our conceptual model to include individual and contextual

differences that influence health care utilization. A considerable body of research has

demonstrated a relationship between breast cancer screening and/or stage at diagnosis

and individual characteristics such as age, race, income, marital status, and education

(Bradley et al. 2002; Anderson et al. 2007; Schootman et al. 2007; Taplin et al. 2004).

These factors are also correlated with having health insurance. A sparser but growing

body of literature suggests that contextual factors (i.e., characteristics of the geographic

location in which an individual resides) also are associated with and may influence health

care utilization (Coughlin et al. 2007). These factors include racial/ethnic composition

(Benjamins et al. 2004) and education and income level (Engelman et al 2002) of the

surrounding population as well as supply of health care providers within a geographic

location (Davidson et al. 2005).

       We incorporate contextual factors in our model by using patients’ address

information to identify their census tract of residence. Census tracts are small

subdivisions of counties established by the U.S. Census Bureau, usually with 2,500 to

8,000 residents, and are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population

characteristics, economic status, and living conditions (U.S. Census Bureau 2007). The

Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project demonstrated that poverty at the level of the

census tract captured socioeconomic differences in health across a wide range of health

outcomes, including outcomes related to cancer (Krieger et al. 2002). We include in our

models census tract characteristics that emerge from the literature as predictors of health

care utilization, along with additional characteristics (e.g., proportion of families headed

by single females, housing units without a motor vehicle) that may be correlated with

socioeconomic vulnerability and poor access to health care. In addition, we estimate

                                                                                               3
models with fixed effects for each census tract, which capture all of these measurable

factors defined at the census tract level, as well as any other unmeasured factors common

to residents of the same tract.

Study Data and Methods

Context

       We evaluate the effect of health insurance on breast cancer diagnosis and

treatment at a large urban safety net hospital system — Virginia Commonwealth

University Health Care System’s (VCUHS) Massey Cancer Center (MCC). MCC is an

integral component of a healthcare system serving the cancer care needs of patients in the

Greater Richmond Virginia Metropolitan Area and surrounding counties (a population of

approximately 1.7 million people). As a safety net provider, many uninsured patients are

drawn to MCC. When uninsured (or underinsured) patients make an appointment at

VCUHS, their level of financial need is assessed. Based on their income, VCUHS will

offer care at low or no cost. MCC is also a National Cancer Institute designated clinical

cancer center, which attracts and treats patients regardless of health insurance status.

VCUHS inpatient facilities are located in downtown Richmond, but it has two outpatient

facilities that offer mammography services for screening and diagnosis and deliver

chemotherapy; one is located downtown, and the other, in a suburban setting, caters to an

insured population. Uninsured patients are screened and treated in the downtown facility

and are seen in the oncology fellows’ clinic for chemotherapy administration.

       Among women treated at VCUHS, we compare tumor size and stage of breast

cancers at diagnosis — which are strong predictors of breast cancer survival (Smigal et

al. 2006; Carter et al. 1989; Rosenberg et al. 2005; Elkin et al. 2005) — for women with

and without insurance. We also compare the time from diagnosis to surgery and from

                                                                                            4
surgery to the start of adjuvant chemotherapy, the likelihood of starting and completing

chemotherapy, and the time to complete chemotherapy regimens.

Data and Study Sample

       Data were obtained from the hospital cancer registry, the VCUHS administrative

billing system, and medical records. The registry contains information on incident cancer

cases, including: the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Tumor Node

Metastases (TNM) staging; date of diagnosis; and information about treatment including

surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. The billing system contains information on:

patient age, race, and marital status; address; inpatient, outpatient, and physician services;

drugs administered (type, dose); dates of service; insurance source (at the time of first

treatment for cancer at VCUHS); charges; International Classification of Diseases version

9 codes; and Current Procedural Terminology codes.

       Records for all breast cancer patients identified through the cancer registry

diagnosed between January 1, 1999 and March 31, 2006 were merged with the VCUHS

administrative billing system. Medical record numbers and dates of diagnosis were used

to extract all billing claims from 3 months prior to 12 months following the diagnosis

date. For patients with more than one primary breast cancer, only the first cancer

diagnosis was included. A medical oncologist randomly selected and manually audited

the medical records from 15% of the patients that received chemotherapy. Insights from

this audit guided our coding and interpretation of the billing records and ensured that all

services and their dates were accurately recorded.

       VCUHS treats approximately 300 new breast cancer cases annually. Patients

treated at VCUHS are comparable, in terms of cancer stage at diagnosis, to patients

treated at other Virginia teaching hospitals, Virginia community comprehensive cancer

                                                                                              5
centers, and all Virginia hospitals combined.2 However, VCUHS is the main safety

provider in the region and, as such, it likely treats a disproportionate share of uninsured

patients relative to other providers. Although uninsured women are more likely to be

diagnosed with advanced stage disease, their proportion of the total VCUHS cancer

patient population is still somewhat small and alters only slightly the distribution of

cancer stages diagnosed at VCUHS relative to other providers (for example, 59% of

VCUHS breast cancer cases are diagnosed with in situ or local disease whereas other

Virginia providers report that 60% of their cases are in situ or local stage). All cancer

patients seen at VCUHS are entered on its cancer registry. Patients may receive a portion

of their care elsewhere. For example, VCUHS provides 53% and 75% of surgery and

chemotherapy, respectively, to insured patients; the corresponding numbers for uninsured

patients are 87% and 90%, respectively. The registry includes all treatment information,

regardless of location, up to and including the initiation of chemotherapy.3

       We identified all women aged 21 to 64 diagnosed with a first primary breast

tumor with an AJCC stage of 0, I, II, or III. Patients with distant metastases, who were

likely receiving palliative care without intent to cure, were excluded. We chose 64 as the

upper age limit because almost all women qualify for Medicare coverage at age 65.

Because we were interested in the timing of surgery and outpatient chemotherapy, we

excluded patients that died within 1 year of diagnosis (n=17), had no evidence of surgery

(n=31), or had a bone marrow transplant (n=12).4 We also excluded 60 women insured

by Medicaid because we could not determine whether they were enrolled in Medicaid at

the time of diagnosis or were uninsured at diagnosis with Medicaid enrollment made

retroactive to the time of diagnosis. Lastly, we excluded 50 women because we could not




                                                                                              6
match their address to a census tract. The remaining sample size was 1,334 women —

1,121 with private or military insurance and 213 uninsured.

Analytical Approach

       We first compared the stage of disease and tumor size (≥2 cm) in insured and

uninsured patients using logistic regression. AJCC disease stage was dichotomized into

in situ (0) and local (I) versus regional (II, III). Chemotherapy is recommended less often

for women with in situ or local stage cancer whereas chemotherapy is routinely

recommended to women with regional stage breast cancer. In addition, because regional

stage cancers are more advanced, the probability of cancer recurrence is higher for

women with regional stage disease. Tumors ≥2 cm indicate higher stage and — because

women with a tumor this large likely presented with a palpable mass — the absence of

mammography screening. Cases missing tumor size (n=302) were excluded from this

analysis.

       Second, we compared the number of days between diagnosis and surgery and

between surgery and chemotherapy initiation and the likelihood of a delay of more than

90 days from diagnosis to surgery between insured and uninsured patients. These

outcomes reflect the timeliness of care, which can influence its quality. A meta-analysis

of a variety of studies of this question finds that a delay of 12 or more weeks from

symptom detection to treatment initiation is associated with a 15 percentage point lower

survival rate at 20 years following diagnosis relative to women that had treatment within

12 weeks of experiencing breast cancer symptoms (Richards et al. 1999). The time from

a suspicious mammogram to surgery would better reflect the time period between

diagnosis and surgery, but these data are not available. Therefore, our estimates are

conservative relative to the actual time between diagnosis and surgery.

                                                                                            7
        From these analyses, we excluded patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy

(n=73), which introduces delays between diagnosis and surgery. We conducted the

analysis with and without patients that had identical surgery and diagnosis dates (n=351),

because they likely received their initial biopsy and lumpectomy at the same time. The

distribution of the time between diagnosis and surgery was right skewed. Therefore, we

repeated the analysis using the natural log transformation of the dependent variable; the

findings were qualitatively similar (results not shown).5

        Third, we compared the likelihood of initiating and completing a chemotherapy

regimen of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC) or doxorubicin plus

cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (ACT), the two most common adjuvant

regimens used to treat breast cancer patients (Levine and Whelan 2006). For the patients

that completed AC or ACT, we also compared the number of days from the start of

chemotherapy to the completion of chemotherapy (AC, n=247; ACT, n=133). A

complete course of therapy was defined as 4 courses of AC or 8 courses of ACT. In our

analysis of chemotherapy completion, we limited the sample to patients that received all

of their chemotherapy at VCUHS (n=526) to ensure that we had complete data.6 Other

protocols were prescribed during the study period, but their dosing schedules were

irregular or they were administered as part of a clinical trial. In a population-based study,

Harlan et al. found that uninsured women were equally likely to receive guideline care as

insured women (Harlan et al. 2005). We would expect to find the same result for the

safety net setting.

        For each outcome, we report estimates of three models. Model 1 includes health

insurance status, along with patient characteristics (e.g., race, age, marital status) to

provide a baseline estimate of the differences between insured and uninsured women.

                                                                                            8
Race is a prime socioeconomic variable that is associated with health insurance status

(Monheit and Vistnes 2000) and also with differences in diagnosis and treatment of

breast cancer (Lantz et al. 2006). In the models for days between diagnosis and surgery,

surgery and chemotherapy initiation, and chemotherapy initiation and completion, Model

1 also includes variables for cancer stage and tumor size and shortest distance to the

VCUHS facility where chemotherapy could be administered. Distance was included to

reflect the possibility that uninsured patients may have to travel farther than insured

patients to the safety net facility that will treat them. In contrast, insured patients have

the option of going to the closest facility. For uninsured patients, the shortest distance

was the number of miles between their residence and the downtown facility (Dalton

clinic) where they have to be treated. The shortest distance for insured patients was

lesser of the distance between their residence and the Dalton clinic and between their

residence and the suburban facility. In the models for days between surgery and

chemotherapy initiation and chemotherapy completion, a dichotomous variable for

mastectomy is also added as a control, to account for longer recovery times associated

with mastectomy.

       Model 2 estimates the insurance-related differential controlling for census tract

characteristics including census tract median income, percent of women with some

college and percent of women with a college degree or higher (relative to the percent of

women with a high school or less education), median value of owner occupied housing,

percent of families headed by unmarried women, percent of owner occupied housing,

percent of blacks residing in the census tract, and percent of housing without a motor

vehicle.




                                                                                               9
        Finally, Model 3 adds dichotomous variables for each census tract in which

patients resided. This approach controls for all tract-related differences in the

environment and social context (e.g., transportation, housing) in which patients live,

including differences in physical access to VCUHS. Because the census tract controls

should account for many socioeconomic differences between the insured and the

uninsured, the differences that remain are much more likely due to differences in how

well the safety net system reaches the uninsured and how it treats the uninsured once they

have been diagnosed. In Model 3, the effects of insurance status are identified from

differences between insured and uninsured women within the same census tract. Hence

we drop observations in census tracts with only one patient, and, for the logistic models,

additional observations for which census tracts perfectly predicted the outcome of

interest.

        The differences we observe in chemotherapy-related outcomes may be

attributable to differences in the two facilities at which patients receive care. To address

this potential source of bias, we repeat all chemotherapy related analyses on a sample

restricted to those treated at the downtown facility. As noted earlier, the insured patients

can choose their facility, whereas all uninsured patients are treated at the downtown

facility. Thus, the only comparison we can do that controls for the facility at which

treatment is received is the comparison for this subsample.

Results

        Descriptive statistics by insurance status are reported in Table 1. The insured and

uninsured were of similar ages. Uninsured women were more likely to be black and

unmarried, and more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer stage and larger

tumors. As would be expected given cancer stage and tumor size, uninsured women were

                                                                                          10
more likely to have a mastectomy and more likely to initiate chemotherapy. Uninsured

women had considerably longer times from diagnosis to surgery (24 or 19 days

depending on whether we exclude or include patients diagnosed on the same day as

surgery) and from surgery to chemotherapy initiation (21 days longer). A higher

percentage of uninsured women experienced a delay of 90 or more days from diagnosis

to surgery (23 versus 3 percent). Once chemotherapy was initiated, insured women were

more likely to complete chemotherapy.

       Among women that completed chemotherapy, uninsured women took longer to

complete chemotherapy (approximately 4 and 32 days longer for AC and ACT,

respectively). AC is expected to be complete within 64 days and ACT should be

completed within 148 days (Hershman et al. 2004). Sixty-eight percent of insured

women completed AC within 64 days and 69% of them completed ACT within 148 days.

In contrast, less than half of uninsured women completed AC within 64 days and only

35% completed ACT within 148 days.

       The lower panel of Table 1 reports census tract characteristics. Along every

dimension, census tracts where insured women resided were different from census tracts

where uninsured women resided. Insured women resided in census tracts with higher

median income, high gross value of housing, and with greater shares of owner occupied

housing and women with a college degree, but with fewer families headed by unmarried

women, fewer homes without a motor vehicle, and shares of blacks relative to census

tracts where uninsured women reside. However, despite these differences, insured and

uninsured women faced quite similar distances to the closest clinic where chemotherapy

could be delivered. The mean distance was 22 miles for insured women and 25 for




                                                                                       11
uninsured women; the medians were 11 for insured women and 10 miles for uninsured

women.

       Table 2 reports results from logistic regressions for regional AJCC stage and

tumor size ≥2 cm. In the Model 1 estimates, insured women were less likely to be

diagnosed with regional stage disease (OR=0.72, p=0.06). Adding the census tract

characteristics in Model 2 does not alter the estimated differential, whereas the addition

of individual census tract controls in Model 3 makes the estimated differential somewhat

larger, with insured women two-thirds as likely to be diagnosed with late stage disease

(OR=0.65, p=.05). In column 2, the estimates for Models 1-3 all indicate that insured

women were only about half as likely to be diagnosed with a tumor ≥2 cm than were

uninsured women; the estimates are similar across all models (e.g., OR=0.53, p=0.02 in

Model 3). Consistent with the literature, the estimates indicate that African American

women are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage and larger tumors relative to

white women (Henson et al. 2003). However, Table 2 shows that a large insurance-

related differential exists conditional on race, as well as other controls.

       Table 3 reports OLS estimates of models for days from diagnosis to surgery for

all women and women that received their diagnosis on the same day as surgery. The

estimates in column 1 indicate that uninsured women receive their surgery 16 days later

than insured women (p<0.01), regardless of model specification. When we exclude

women who were diagnosed and had surgery on the same day, in column 2, the estimated

differences between insured and uninsured women widen slightly. Finally, in estimations

for the likelihood of having a delay of 90 days or more between diagnosis and surgery,

insured women are much less likely to experience such a delay relative to uninsured

women (OR=0.34, 95% CI= 0.17 to 0.69). This estimate was robust across the 3 models,

                                                                                          12
including Model 3 where the sample size dramatically decreased from 1261 to 360 due to

the inclusion of census tract dummy variables.7

       Table 4 reports results from logistic regressions for initiating chemotherapy,

completing a regimen of AC or ACT, and experiencing a delay in the completion of

either AC or ACT. The estimates in column 1 indicate no significant differences between

insured and uninsured women in the likelihood of initiating chemotherapy. Likewise, the

estimates in column 2 suggest no differences in the likelihood of chemotherapy

completion. However, in column 3, the estimates clearly indicate the insured women are

less likely to have a delay in chemotherapy completion (OR=0.36, p<0.01, for Models 1

and 2). The estimated difference in the likelihood of delay is even larger when individual

census tract controls are added in Model 3 (OR=0.14, p=0.01).

       Table 5 addresses the timeliness with which treatments are delivered and

completed. The Model 1 estimates indicate that insured women start chemotherapy

approximately 18 days sooner than uninsured women (p<0.01). Insured women also

complete AC and ACT regimens 4 (p=0.01) and 24 (p<0.01) days faster, respectively,

than uninsured women. When individual census tracts are added, in Model 3, the

coefficients for chemotherapy completion became statistically insignificant (and very

small for ACT). In general, though, the samples available for estimating the models for

chemotherapy completion – especially for ACT – are very small, especially for uninsured

women.

       Table 6 addresses the possibility of bias introduced by treatment at different

facilities (the downtown Dalton clinic versus the suburban clinic). For each outcome and

model, however, the estimates are very similar to their full sample counterparts in Tables

4 and 5, which suggests that differences we find between insured and uninsured women

                                                                                        13
are not due to differences between the treatment sites at which the two groups of women

tend to get treated.

Possible Explanations for Differences

        To summarize, the combined results in Tables 2 through 6 establish that, in the

safety net setting we study, insured women with breast cancer are diagnosed with smaller

tumors and at earlier disease stages, and they receive surgery and initiate chemotherapy

considerably faster than otherwise similar uninsured women; the evidence regarding

whether insured women complete chemotherapy faster is more mixed, with some

specifications pointing to significant differences. On the other hand, race differences in

treatment-related outcomes are quite small and generally insignificant, although African

American women are more commonly diagnosed at a later stage and with larger tumors.

Moreover, neither race differences nor other socioeconomic characteristics associated

with census tract of residence account for the diagnosis and treatment time differences

between insured and uninsured women. A number of other factors may help to explain

some of these differences, in some cases highlighting possible shortcomings of the safety

net system.

        Stage and tumor size were much more advanced in uninsured women relative to

insured women. Larger tumors at diagnosis in uninsured patients may reflect poor access

to care and cancer screening. The number of tumors ≥2 cm has been steadily declining

since 1980 — a decade that marked the beginning of the use of mammograms for breast

cancer screening — but uninsured women are less likely to use mammography services

relative to insured women (Coughlin et al. 2004). It is possible that there are too few

mammography providers available to uninsured women, making access to screening

difficult or burdensome. Alternatively, uninsured women may be unaware that low cost

                                                                                          14
options for cancer screening exist and seek care only when they become aware of a

palpable mass. At least one study found that less than half of the uninsured who live near

safety net providers are aware of their presence (Cunningham et al. 2007).

       It is unclear why the differences in timeliness of treatment persist in a safety net

setting where treatment was provided without regard to insurance status. Scheduling and

keeping clinical appointments may be difficult for uninsured patients. An analysis of the

frequency of cancellations in the oncology fellows’ clinic, where uninsured patients are

treated, found that uninsured patients were twice as likely to miss their appointments for

treatment as were insured patients. The reasons cited by patients for missing

appointments included being unaware of the appointment, patient or family illnesses, or

other emergencies and transportation problems (Youssef et al. 2006). However, the

interpretation of the results from this study is unclear because the analysis did not include

other controls for patient characteristics that may be correlated with missed

appointments; we conjecture that such behavior is likely to be related to factors such as

socioeconomic status, access to transportation, etc., for which have been able to control

in our analysis.

       The oncology clinic may also be overburdened with patients, making it difficult

for physicians to see patients in a timely manner. A report from the Kaiser Commission

on Medicaid and the Uninsured (2005) argued that safety net spending has not kept pace

with growth in the number of uninsured and the cost of treating them, and as a result

predicted an increasing strain on the ability of safety net providers to meet the health care

demands placed on them.

       Perhaps supportive care medications such as those that reduce nausea, which may

improve tolerance to therapy, are too expensive for uninsured patients to purchase out-of-

                                                                                              15
pocket, and these patients therefore experience the toxic effects of chemotherapy at

greater rates or severity than insured patients. Uninsured women may also have more

non-cancer related medical conditions that interfere with recovery from surgery and

chemotherapy initiation and completion. As suggestive evidence consistent with this

hypothesis, we found that 22% of uninsured women were admitted to the hospital

compared with 16% of insured women (p=0.09), and 26% had at least one emergency

department (ED) visit compared with 10% of insured women (p<.01); these differences

were largely associated medical conditions unrelated to cancer. (However, we only

detect admissions and ED visits at VCUHS, and insured women may be more likely to go

elsewhere.) A greater prevalence of other medical conditions among the uninsured

interfering with cancer treatment would still point to shortcomings of the safety net

system, although it would suggest that the differences based on insurance status are not

solely attributable to differences in treatment after women are diagnosed with breast

cancer.

Implications of Inequality in Access and Care

          Safety net providers are supposed to act as substitutes for universal coverage in

the United States. In spite of proximity to a safety net provider that is a National Cancer

Institute designated clinical cancer center, we find that uninsured women had more

advanced cancer and larger tumors than otherwise similar women with health insurance.

From a health outcomes perspective, the method of breast cancer detection

(mammography versus clinical breast exam) alone has been shown to be an important

prognostic factor, and larger tumor size at diagnosis has grave implications for patients’

long-term survival (Shen et al. 2005; Duffy et al. 2003; Michaelson et al. 2003; Berry et

al. 2005; Cronin et al. 2006; Berry et al. 2006). From the safety net system perspective,

                                                                                              16
because uninsured women present with more advanced disease, they require more

extensive and costly treatment. In our sample, a higher proportion of uninsured women

required mastectomy (37% versus 26%) and chemotherapy (62% versus 52%) relative to

insured women. They were also more likely to require the longer, more extensive

regimen of ACT instead of AC (50% versus 41%, p=0.09). Once they initiated therapy,

there is evidence suggesting that these women had a more difficult time completing it in a

timely fashion, although this evidence is not always statistically significant. Together,

these findings suggest considerable morbidity for the affected women at increased cost to

the health care system.

       Uninsured women also experienced lengthy delays from diagnosis to surgery and

from surgery to chemotherapy initiation and, once chemotherapy was initiated, delays in

treatment completion relative to otherwise similar insured women. However, in this

safety net setting, insured and uninsured women were equally likely to initiate and

complete chemotherapy. Although short delays in treatment completion have not been

shown to adversely affect survival or cancer recurrence, a delay of 3 or more months

from symptom detection to treatment initiation is associated with compromised survival

(Richards et al. 1999). In our sample, uninsured women were more likely to experience a

90-day delay between diagnosis and surgery relative to insured women. This estimate is

conservative because it excludes time from symptom recognition or an abnormal

mammogram to surgery. Our findings may partially explain why other studies have found

survival disparities between insured and uninsured women, despite the safety net system.

       Our approach has some limitations. First, it is confined to a single institution.

This reduces generalizability, but also avoids heterogeneity across institutions. Second,

we do not have information on patient income, education, family, health behaviors, prior

                                                                                            17
contact with the health care system, and work situations. However, we did control for

census tract of residence, which captures the social and geographic context in which

patients live and is strongly related to income, employment, etc. Third, patients that

relied upon VCUHS for all of their treatment may differ (in comorbidity, severity, or

recommended protocol) from patients that chose to get their chemotherapy elsewhere,

especially for insured women who are likely to have more options.

Implications for Policy

       An expansion of the safety net has been sought as a way to provide access to

health care for uninsured persons (Hadley and Cunningham 2004; Office of Management

and Budget 2002); in 2004, total federal safety net spending was $22.8 billion, which

reflected a 15% increase over 2001 spending (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the

Uninsured 2005). Our study indicates that within a safety net provider — one that was

equally likely to provide surgery and chemotherapy without regard to health insurance —

uninsured breast cancer patients are more likely to be diagnosed with severe disease and

to experience treatment delays that could ultimately affect their chances for survival and

increase costs to the healthcare system.

       In other settings, uninsured patients have been shown to receive about half as

much medical care as insured patients (Institute of Medicine 2004). Safety net providers,

in all likelihood, reduce differences between the diagnosis and treatment of the insured

and the uninsured. Nonetheless, in our study of one safety net provider, important

differences remain. These differences are large and are robust to controlling for census

tract of residence, race, and other demographic characteristics. As a result, the diagnosis

and treatment differences associated with health insurance status, within this safety net

system, seem unlikely to be attributable to unmeasured socioeconomic differences

                                                                                            18
between women with and without insurance. Our evidence suggests, therefore, that

safety net institutions — at least as they currently operate — are only a partial substitute

for health insurance, and that a more comprehensive alternative for uninsured patients is

needed.

      or under-insured. This program is administered by state health departments. If
      cancer is detected under the auspices of this program, patients in 48 states are
      enrolled in Medicaid to cover their care.

      VCUHS.
 4.    Patients that received a bone marrow transplant are generally hospitalized for
       extended periods of time. Therefore, they would not be expected to start and
       complete chemotherapy in the same time period as patients receiving outpatient
       chemotherapy.
5.     For the analysis including women with simultaneous diagnosis and surgery, for
      those whose diagnosis and surgery were on the same day we first reset day until
      surgery from 0 to 1 before taking logs.
6.     The VCUHS cancer registry does not indicate the type of chemotherapy
      administered to patients or if patients completed a prescribed regimen. The only
      source of this information is administrative billing data.
7.     Since the frequency of delays of 90 days or more is so low for insured women
      (2.8%, as reported in Table 1), in the logistic model with census tract dummy
      variables, the number of tracts with perfect predictions for the dependent variable is
      very high.

  The specification with census tract dummy variables (Model 3 in Tables 2-5) is not estimated for the subsample treated at the downtown facility only due to limitations on the
sample sizes.
b
  Model 2 also controls for race (black or non-black), age at diagnosis (continuous), marital status (married or unmarried), AJCC cancer stage (0, I, II, or III), tumor size (<2 cm, 2
to 5 cm, or ≥5 cm), and miles to Dalton, as well as the census tract characteristics reported for Model 2 in Table 2. Coefficients for these variables are not reported.
