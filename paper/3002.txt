                THE IMPACT OF A BAN ON LEGALIZED ABORTION ON
                  ADOLESCENT CHILDBEARING IN NEW YORK CITY


                                    ABSTRACT



     This paper attempts to forecast the change in adolescent childbearing
among New York City residents following a ban on legalized abortion.   With
monthly data on the number of births to white and black adolescents from
January, 1963 to December, 1987 we used an interrupted time-series analysis
to estimate the change in adolescent childbearing that followed the
liberalization of the New York State abortion law in 1970. We found the
level of births to black adolescents living in New York City fell 18.7
percent between 1970 and 1971, or approximately 142 fewer births per month
(p<.O0l).  The level of white births fell 14.1 percent or approximately 111
fewer births per month (p<.OO1).  The absolute value of the percentage
changes in births between 1970 and 1971 were applied to the forecasted number
of monthly births in 1988 and 1989.   If legal abortion had been inaccessible
to New York City adolescents beginning January 1, 1988, there would have been
2143 black and 1067 white unintended births to teenagers in the first two
years of a ban. The results suggest that a prohibition on legalized abortion
would have a substantial increase in adolescent childbearing across the U.S.
although the magnitude of the change will vary according to local conditions.

     There is great speculation in the popular press that the U.S.
Supreme Court will overturn the 1973 decision in Roe versus Wade,

the case which legalized abortion across the United States.                     A

possible outcome of such a reversal               is    that the authority to
regulate abortion will be given to individual states.                 Under this

scenario,    even states where the sentiment towards abortion                  is

favorable may experience a period in which legalized abortion is
unavailable while new legislation is written and debated. A ban on

legalized abortion, or even an interruption, could have a profound

effect on the incidence of unwanted childbearing.

     The objective of our analysis is                  to examine the probable
changes     in teenage childbearing among New York City residents
following a ban on legalized abortion.             To this end, we first fit

a model     that estimates the change in the number of births to
adolescents following the 1970 New York State law which liberalized

abortion.     We   argue   that   the       percentage     decline   in   teenage

childbearing between 1970 and 1971 is a good approximation, but in

reverse, to what would occur today if legalized abortion were no




                                        1
longer available.
      A number of studies have noted the decline in births after the

New York State Law which liberalized abortion became effective

(Pakter   et   al.    1973,   Tietze   1973,    Kramer   1975).    However,   the

results in each of the studies were based on annual changes over

a very short time span.          Such unrefined estimates provide only a

crude understanding of what might occur if the legalization of

abortion were        reversed.      Pooled     time—series,    cross—sectional

studies have examined the effect of liberalized abortion laws on

annual,   age—specific fertility rates within and across states

(Sklar and Berkov 1974,           Bauman et    al.   1977,    Quick 1978).    The

findings suggest that the legalization of abortion had an important

impact on fertility. Again, the variation over time was limited to

at most seven years.
      Our study differs sub8tantially in that it is a time—series
analysis with monthly data that spans 25 years. The large number

of observations allows for a more sophisticated means of fitting

the   data.     For    example,    we use      the   Box—Jenkins    time—series

methodology to pxedict the monthly number of births to New York
City adolescents that would have been observed had abortion not
been liberalized in 1970 (Box and Jenkins 1976). Comparing these
estimates to the actual number of births between 1970 and 1971
yields a first approximation of the number of births that were
averted by the change In the law.              The estimates are refined by

means of intervention analysis: a technique for determining                   the

magnitude, form, and statistical significance of the change in a

                                        2
time—series following a major external event (Mc Cleary and Hay
1980, Vandaele 1983). Finally, we use the model obtained by the
intervention analysis to forecast the time—path of teenage births

following a ban on legalized abortion.

      We have limited our analysis to adolescents for several
reasons. First, the medical, social and economic consequences of

teenage   pregnancy   are   staggering   (National   Research   Council

1987a,b). Second, the proportion of teenagers who become pregnant
has changed relatively little over the past 15 years. Approximately

one out of ten adolescents aged 15—19 becomes pregnant every year

and in 1988 about 86 percent of the pregnancies were unintended
(Jones et al. 1988). Third, adolescents are disproportionate users

of abortion and thus, would be more affected by an overturn of Roe

versus Wade.   Nationally, 30 percent of all abortions performed in

the United States are to teenagers and 40 percent of all adolescent

pregnancies are terminated by induced abortion (National Research

Council 1987a).

     The analysis was restricted to New York City because we needed

an area in which the availability of legalized abortion would be
as radically altered by a ban as it had been by the    liberalization

of abortion laws. The 1970 New York State abortion statute had the

fewest restrictions of any state law in the country.      Before July,

1970 there had been few legal abortions performed in New York City

(Erhart et al. 1972).More importantly, prior to the change in 1970,

pregnant adolescents had essentially no access to legal abortion.

Although Hawaii, Alaska and Washington state had laws similar to

                                   3
New York's by the end of 1970, each of the states had residency

requirements.         consequently,     the     magnitude   of   the   change   in

adolescent childbearing among New York city residents after the
1970 law became effective was not diminished by migration to other

states. This was not true for residents of other states after the

passage of the New York State law.               Between July 1970, and June

1971, 75.4 percent of the 33,964 abortions performed on adolescents

in New York City        were to out-of—state residents (Pakter et al.

1973). The upshot is that New York city offers a unique setting
from which to understand the changes In adolescent childbearing
that followed the liberalization of abortion, and what is likely

to occur if legal abortion is banned.


                                      METHODS

    DATA

         Monthly figures on the number of black and white live births
to New York city residents less than 20 years of age are from vital

statistics maintained by the New York City Department of Health.

Each year of individual birth records has been aggregated by month

f   or   blacks and whites separately.        The number of birth records with

unknown age in any one year was less than .03 percent.                     These

records were deleted from the aggregation.                   The   final series

consisted of 300 monthly observations for whites and blacks from

January, 1963 to December, 1987.             Plots of the race—specific series

are shown in Figures 1 and 2.



                                         4
        The     analysis           was     limited         to    whites     and    blacks        because

ethnicity was not identified on New York City birth certificates

until 1978. However, a substantial proportion of the adolescents

who are white are of Hispanic origin or descent.                                   In 1984, the

first     year           in     which     data    on       births    to    Hispanic       women were
published, 75 percent of the white adolescents who gave birth were

of     Hispanic origin              (NYC     Department            of Health      1985).    How this
proportion has varied over time is unknown.                                  Data from the 1970
Census indicates that 13.4 percent of all women 15 to 19 years of

age were of Puerto Rican descent                             (Bureau of Census 1973) .                  The

number of           Hispanic adolescents that                       were not Puerto Rican                is

unknown.        By 1980, the percent of Puerto Rican adolescents 15 to
19     years        of    age     had     risen    to       17.0     percent      while    the        total

proportion of Hispanic adoJescents of the same age stood at 25.9

percent        (Bureau of           Census       1984).         The potential       impact on the
results        of        the apparent        shifting ethnic              composition of          white

adolescents who gave birth is discussed below.
        The number of births as opposed to birth rates were analyzed
because monthly population figures for New York City over the
period under study were unavailable.                               Census data could have been

used to estimate monthly population figures between the census
years,     but           such     crude     estimates           would     only    have     introduced

measurement              error.    Furthermore,             month-to—month changes               in    the

population are minor compared to the 10 to 20 percent drop in the

number of adolescent births that were observed between 1970 and

1971

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

     The    data     were    analyzed   by    means     of    an   Autoregressive

Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model.              The methodology is often

referred to as the Box—Jenkins approach to time—series modeling
(Box and Jenkins 1976). The objective is to use the observed data

to describe the underlying time—series process in as concise a

manner as possible.         The first step is to decompose the stationary

portion of the series into its autoregressive and moving average

parts.     Once a tentative representation has been established, the

parameters of the model are estimated and then diagnosed to insure

that the unexplained portion of the model, the residuals, are a

random or white noise process.          If the checks prove satisfactory,

then forecasts can be generated.
     A time series may undergo a dramatic change due to an external

event that alters the underlying behavioral process generating the

series.       Such    interventions     can    be      incorporated     into   the

Box—Jenkins methodology in order to evaluate the form and the
magnitude of the change.         In particular, a binary variable is used

to capture the impact of the intervention. The variable equals zero

prior to the change and one thereafter.                The binary variable is

appended to the specification and a t—test is used to determine

whether    the     estimated coefficient       on     the    binary variable    is

statistically significant.         The methodology has become known as
intervention analysis and has been widely applied in the social

sciences (McCleary and Hay 1980, Vandaele 1983).



                                        6
       To    successfully   apply      the   intervention      analysis,   it    is

necessary to know the starting point of the event as well as the

general shape of      the response of the series to the event.                  The

hypothesis maintained in this study is that the 1970 New York State

Law which liberalized abortion had an important                   impact on the
number of adolescent pregnancies that resulted in live births. The

law became effective on July, 1 1970.           However, because the law did

not apply to pregnancies greater than 24 weeks, the effect of the
law on the number of live births would not be observed for at least

16 to 20 weeks later. Thus, November,              1970 became the starting
point of the intervention. Furthermore, the full impact of the law

on adolescents births would not be possible until April of 1971
when   the    pregnancies   of   the    first    cohort   of   adolescents who
conceived on or after July 1, 1970 reached term. Consequently, the

intervention variable was specified in such a manner that the law's

impact on the number of adolescent births increased gradually from

November, 1970 through April, 1971.

       The rate at which the law's impact grew between November arid

April was based on the distribution abortions to New York City
residents the first year the law was in effect.                For example, 6.1

percent of all abortions to New York City residents were to women

whose pregnancies were beyond the twentieth week (Tietze 1973).
Assuming the distribution of abortion by gestational age was the
same for every month in the first year, the proportion of the law's

full   impact    that would be felt          in November was     .061.     Thirty

percent of all abortions performed in the first year were to women
whose pregnancies were between 13 and 20 weeks gestation.                      We

assumed that       15 percent were performed between 13 and 16 weeks
gestation, and the other 15 percent were performed between 17 and

20 weeks gestation.      Thus, in December, the proportion of the law's

full impact would be .216.         This accounts for the 6.1 percent of

the women who aborted in August,            1970     whose pregnancies were

greater than 20 weeks gestation and for the 15 percent of the
abortions in July, 1970 to women whose pregnancies were between 17

and 20 weeks gestation.      Following this algorithm and noting that

64 percent of all abortion were performed in the first trimester,

the figures for the remaining months were as follows:                  .361    in

January, .574 in February, .785 in March, and 1.0 in April and all

months thereafter.

      To estimate the changes in adolescent childbearing following

a ban on legalized abortion effective January 1,              1988, we first

forecasted     the number     of   births    in    1988 and 1989 under the

assumption that       abortion remained legal.        The complete series,

including    the    intervention   component       was used   to   obtain     the

forecasts. Since the future error terms are unknown, they were set

to   their expected values of        zero    (Vandaele   1983,     Granger and

Newbold 1986). We then multiplied the forecasted births by the
absolute value of the parameters from the intervention model. The

assumption was that the absolute value of the percentage change in

adolescent births after abortion was legalized provided a good
estimate of the expected increase in adolescent childbearing if

abortion were to be outlawed.

                                      8
        Finally,       although we assumed that           the relative change           in

births resulting from a ban on abortion in 1988 would be the same

(except for a sign change) as was observed in 1970 and 1971, the

rate of change from             the pre— to the post—intervention level of

births had to be altered. The modification was necessary because

the distribution          of   abortions      by gestational       age had changed

substantially from what              was observed       in    1970 and      1971.       In

particular, national data from 1981 indicates that 91 percent of

all abortions were obtained in the first trimester, approximately
8 percent were obtained between 13 and 20 weeks, and fewer than one

percent were at more than 20 weeks (Henshaw et al.                     1985).       Using

the     same   algorithm       as   above,    a    ban on    abortion that          became

effective January 1,           1988, would realize one percent of its full

potential impact in May of 1988,                  5 percent in June, 9 percent in

July,    40 percent        in August,        70 percent      in September,      and    100

percent by October.



                                        RESULTS

        Figures 1 and 2 present the monthiy number of births to black

and white New York City adolescents from January,                          1963 through

December, 1987.          For blacks, the          reversal of a seven—year upward

trend which occurs between 1970 and 1971 is dramatic.                       In the case

of    whites,      a    relatively    stationary       series    up   to    1970     falls

substantially between 1970 and 1971 and then continues to trend
downwards until approximately 1986.                  Both figures suggest a major

alteration in adolescent childbearing that is coincident with New


                                              9
York State's liberalized abortion law which became effective July,

1   1970.

       To understand the impact the legislation had on adolescent
childbearing,       we   estimated        the       ARIMA   structure   for      the   pre—

intervention series (January,                  1963 — June,    1970).     The data are

expressed as natural            logarithms          in order   to    control     for non—
stationarity        in    the        variance.         A    first—order         difference

transformation was applied to the logarithms of births in order to

remove any trend; a twelfth—order difference was used to eliminate

seasonality.        Based       on       the        autocorrelation       and      partial

autocorrelation functions of               the transformed series,              black and
white births can be characterized as a first—order moving average
with a first—order seasonal moving average.2 The coefficients of

the models are displayed in Table 1.

       If the models adequately depict the ARIMA processes governing

the series, then the errors of the models should be white noise.
The Q—statistics in Table            1   indicate that the residuals from the
estimated models are white noise processes. Another approach for
determining    if    the errors are white noise                 is   to evaluate the
autocorrelations of the first—differenced residuals. If the errors

are a white noise process,                then their first difference should
follow an MA(1) process with the moving average parameter equal to

1, and the first autocorrelation equal to -.5. For the estimated



       he complete set of estimated autocorrelation and partial
autocorrelation   functions is available from the authors upon
request.

                                               10
models in Table 1,         the first differenced residuals indicated an
MA(1) process. For blacks the MA(1) coefficient was .91 with a t—

ratio of 18.78, and the first autocorrelation was -. 53. For whites,

the MA(1) coefficient was                .95 with a t—ratio of 25.81, and the

first autocorrelation was —.50. Thus, the analysis of the errors

supports the appropriateness of the specifications.

        Based on the ARIMA specifications in Table 1, we forecasted

the number          of race—specific adolescent births 24 months beyond

June,    1970.      Comparison of the forecasted births with the actual

number    of     births   over     this        24   month    period yields        a   first

approximation of the number of unintended births to New York City

adolescents that were averted by the legalization of abortion.                          The

actual and forecasted births for the two races are presented in

Figures 3 and 4.        SubtractIng the actual births from the forecasted

births and summing over the 24 months indicates that 4091 black
births and 3128 white births were averted by                     the availability of

abortion.

        To more      formally test           whether   the    1970   law    liberalizing

abortion may have caused the precipitous drop in adolescent births,

we used all the data to estimate the ARIMA structure of each
series.        As    outlined     in     the    previous     section,      an   additional

variable was added to the specification to control for the impact

of the law.          The results are shown in Table 2.                    Except for the

intervention         component,        the   ARIMA structure         is    unchanged    for

blacks.        In the case of whites,               a second—order seasonal moving
average component improved the models fit.                     The coefficient on the


                                               11
intervention variable, a, is statistically significant for blacks

and whites.     Thus, the data reveal that the decline in the level

of births after October,           1970 was     a change that could not be
explained by the normal variation in the series. The Q—statistics
indicate the adequacy of the models. Similarly, for both models the

autocorrelation and the partial autocorrelation functions of the
first differenced residuals demonstrated that they were governed
by a MA(1) process. For blacks, the first autocorrelation of the
differenced residuaas was -.50, and the MA(1) coefficient was .95

with a t—ratio of 51.28. For whites, the first autocorrelatjon was

—.53 and the MA(1) coefficient was .97 with a t—ratio of 70.45.

        The magnitude of the change from the pre— to post intervention

level    of   the   series   can    be   obtained    by   exponentiating   the

coefficient of the intervention variable a and subtracting it from

one.    Expressed as a percentage,            the level of black adolescent
births fell 18.7 percent after the liberalization of abortion in

July 1970.     White births fell 14.0 percent. By using the estimated

percentage changes and taking into account the gradual transition
between November 1970 and April 1971, one can calculate the total
number of adolescent births that were averted in the 24 month
period after July 1970.       If we assume the average number of births

over twelve months prior to July, 1970 is an estimate of the pre—

intervention level of births, then 2588 black adolescent births
and 1998 white adolescent births were averted in the 24 months

after July, 1970.     These figures are smaller than the ones obtained

from the difference of the forecasted and the actual births over

                                         12
the two year period after July 1970 since they                              do not take into

account the seasonality and trend movements inherent in the data

prior to 1970.

        To estimate how a ban on abortion effective January 1, 1988

would     affect       adolescent       childbearing            in    New      York     City,     we

forecasted       the     monthly number            of     births      to    black     and white
teenagers based on the ARIMA specifications in Table 2.                                 Beginning

in May, 1988 we multiplied the predicted number of monthly births

by .187 in the case of blacks and .140 in the case of whites. The

products       for     May,    1988   through           September      1988,     were     further

adjusted to account for the distribution of abortion by gestational

age.          Summing the adjusted monthly forecasts from May,                                  1988

through December,             1989, we estimate that if                legal abortion were
banned January 1, 1988 there would have been 2143 additional black

births and 1067 white births to adolescents in 1988 and 1989 above

what would have been expected had the                           laws regarding abortion

remained unchanged.



                                        DISCUSSION

        Using monthly data on the number of white and black births to

New York City adolescents, we found that the liberalization of the

New    York    State      abortion      law   in         1970   had    a    substantial          and

statistically significant impact on adolescent childbearing. In
particular, we estimate that at least 2500 unintended births to
black teenagers and at                least   1900 unintended births                    to white
teenagers were averted in the first two years after the legislation


                                              13
became     effective.     We   then    estimated     the     probable     impact     on

adolescent childbearing among New York City residents if                          legal

abortion were unavailable nation—wide beginning January 1, 1988.

Our model predicts that there would be over 2000 black and 1000
white unintended births to New York City teenagers in the first two

years following the ban.

         The forecasts are based on modeling the change in teenage
childbearing that followed the liberalization of abortion laws in

New York State in 1970.            The plausibility of our forecasts depend

on   a    number of   assumptions      that must     be defended explicitly.

First,     we assume that      if    Roe versus Wade were overturned and
abortion were banned in New York State, then legalized abortion
would not be available to New York State residents in any other
state.     Although such       a    restrictive    outcome       is   unlikely,     the

forecasts remain instructive for several reasons. For one, they
provide     upper—bound    estimates      based     on     the   most   restrictive

scenario possible, a nation—wide ban on legalized abortion.                       This

scenario cannot be dismissed lightly given that the President of
the United States, the U. S. Attorney General, and the Head of the

Department of Health and Human Services have all publicly stated
their opposition to Roe versus Wade.                A more likely scenario is
that U.S. Supreme Court will return the regulation of abortion to

individual states.        If so, then New York would probably be one of

the first states to respond in a              pro—choice' manner.        New York is

one of only 13 states plus the District of Columbia that funds
abortions to Medicaid eligible women and only 1 of 8 states that


                                         14
does so voluntarily (Gold and Guardado 1988). Nevertheless,                          New

York's 1970 law passed the State Senate by five votes and the State

Assembly by only one.               The debate in both houses was tumultuous

(Lader 1973). Without dissecting the present political situation
in the state, f Roe versus Wade is overturned, there could be a
substantial delay and serious confusion regarding the availability

of legal abortion while new legislation is written and debated.
Border states such as Connecticut and New Jersey have been less
supportive of abortion than has New York, and may be less likely

to respond as quickly and as liberally as New York. Moreover,                       many

teenagers, especially blacks and Hispanics, lack the resources to

travel beyond the tn-state area to obtain an abortion.                             Thus,

legal      abortion     in     states       like    Massachusetts,    Michigan,      and

California may represent               inaccessible alternatives          to pregnant

adolescents in New York City.                 At the very least, therefore, the

overturn     of   Roe    versus       Wade     could   seriously     limit,   if    only

temporarily, the options available to pregnant adolescents in New

York City.
        A second assumption upon which our estimates are based is that

the     proportion of        teenagers       in New York City        at   risk of     an

unintended pregnancy today is similar to the proportion at risk in

1970.      National data indicates that the pregnancy rate among women

15    to   19 years of age has risen from 94 pregnancies per 1000

adolescents       in    1972    to    109    pregnancies per       thousand   in    1984

(National Research Council 1987a). In addition, the percentage of

teenagers      residing        in    metropolitan      areas   who   describe      their


                                               15
pregnancies as unwanted rose between 1971 and 1979 (Zelnik and
Kantner 1980). Consequently, the proporUon of teens at risk of an
unintended pregnancy has probably risen since 1970 despite the
increased use of contraception among adolescents. In this respect,

our projections may underestimate the impact of a ban on legalized

abortion.

        One explanation for the rising pregnancy rate is that the
availability      of       abortion     has      engendered    less       effective

contraceptive behavior; the more extreme version is that abortion
serves as an alternative method of fertility control.                     Thus,   if

abortion    is   banned,    the pregnancy rate may fall.            There    is   no

evidence to support either explanation. A recent survey of abortion

patients reports that less than one percent of the women who used
no contraception admitted doing so because they relied on abortion

(Henshaw and Silverman 1988). And although little is known about
the relationship between aborUon availability and the effective
use of contraceptives, a teenager who aborted a pregnancy was iess

likely to become pregnant again over the next 24 months than was
a comparable adolescent who carried her first pregnancy to term
(Koenig and Zelnik 1982).

       As mentioned above, there has been an apparent rise in the
proportion of births to whites of Hispanic origin in New York City.

Based on the little data that exists, Hispanic adolescents are more

sexually active than their white, non—Hispanic counterparts. At the

same time, Hispanic adolescents are more likely to be married and
less   likely    to    abort   (Hayes    1987,     Joyce   1988).   The    upshot,


                                        16
therefore,   is that the suspected increase in the proportion of
births to white adolescents of Hispanic descent is unlikely to have

altered our predictions n any meaningful manner from what they
would have been had the proportion of white births of Hispanic
descent remained unchanged since 1970.

      with respect to the statistical analysis we imposed a number

of restrictions that should also be made explicit.           For example,

instead of fixing the rate at which the law's impact grew between

November 1970 and April 1971, an alternative specification would

have been to model the intervention component as a first—order
transfer function (McCleary and Hay 1g80).          This allows the data

to   determine   the   rate   of   change between   the   pre—   and   post—

intervention series. The distribution of pregnancies by gestational

age explains in large part why initially, the impact of the law was

gradual. But the availability of abortion services in the early
months under the new law may also have delayed the full impact of

the Jaw from being realized. There was considerable confusion in
New York City with respect to the legality of performing abortions

in doctorTs offices and free—standing clinics (Lader 1973).              For

instance,    the proportion of      all abortions performed in         free-

standing clinics or physicians' offices rose from 45 percent in the

first twelve months of the law to 62 percent in the ensuing year

(Tietze 1973)     Moreover, abortions performed in hospitals were at

least twice as expensive as the ones performed in free—standing
clinics or physicians' offices. Teenagers, especially minorities,
were probably more affected by the price and non—price barriers

                                      17
since they were less likely to have access to private gynecological

care. In sum, the step function we imposed assumes the law became
fully effective in April, 1971, yet other factors may have further

delayed the new law from realizing its full impact.

       To examine this proposition, we re—estimated the effect of the

1970 abortion law by using a first—order transfer function model.

The    results   for    blacks    were     essentially         unchanged      from   the

estimates    reported       above.      However,    the    first—order          transfer

function for whites indicated that the change in the level of the

series between the pre— and post—intervention data declined without

end.    However, there is little evidence to support the hypothesis

that the reform of New York's abortion laws initiated a continuous

decline in the number of white adolescent births.                      The more likely

explanation is that the white adolescent population in New York
city   declined,       census    data    indicates      that     the    white     female

population 15 to 19 years of age (including Hispanics) in New York

city fell from 219,834 in 1970 to 138,023 in 1980, an annual rate

of decline of 4.8 percent.              As a point of comparison, the black
adolescent population of the same age grew from 77,174 to 95,262,

an annual growth rate of 2.1 percent (Bureau of census 1973, 1984).

These figures are clearly insufficient to explain the 14 and 18
percent   drop   in    the monthly        level    of white and black births
respectively     following       the    new     abortion   law.         However,     the

decreasing size        of   the white         teenage   cohort    is     a   reasonable

explanation for the smooth decline in the number of white births
after 1971 (see Figure 1).


                                          18
        In    sum,     the      step     function based          on    the     distribution          of

abortions by gestational age is an appropriate alternative to the

first—order transfer function.                    An additional advantage of the step

function       is    that       the    conditions        in    1970 with respect              to    the

gestational age distribution of abortions and the availability of

abortion services are notably different today.                               The step function

allows us to adjust the rate at which a ban on abortion would
impact on childbearing based on present distribution of abortions

by gestational age.                   The parameters from the intervention modei

based        on      the        first-order        transfer        function           would        have

underestimated this rate of change.

        There is           voluminous literature on the social and economic

consequences of adolescent childbearing. As                             the most recent and

comprehensive             review       makes     clear        (National      Research      Council

1987a,b) ,        adolescents          who     become     parents       will        complete       less

schooling,           have        lower        wages,     experience          greater       marital

instability, and be more dependent on welfare programs than their

adoJescent peers who delay childbearing.                              Moreover, the children

of teenage mothers will experience greater health, cognitive, and

socioemotional difficulties.

        Nor       would     a    ban     on     legalized       abortion       be     costless       to

taxpayers.           In 1986, 64.6 percent of aLl adoJescent births in New

York City were funded by Medicaid.                        Assuming Medicaid eligibility

is a good proxy for AFDC eligibility, then applying this proportion

to the number of unintended births reported above indicates that

689 white and 1384 black teenage mothers and their children will

                                                   19
receive    AFDC   in    the   two    years     after        the   ban.     Based   on    the

methodology described in Burt (1986), the present discounted cost

in terms of Medicaid, AFDC, and food stamps of supporting a family

headed by a teenager over a twenty—year period is 5.560 in 1985
dollars above what it would have cost to support the same teenager

and her family had she delayed childbearing until after she was
twenty years of age. Thus, the total marginal cost5 of supporting

the 689 white and 1384 black births described above would be 11.5

million dollars.

     The relative changes in adolescent childbearing among whites

and blacks following a prohibition on legal abortion reported in
this paper cannot be generalized to other parts of the country
because the forecasts are ba5ed on a set of circumstances specific

to New York City in 1970.                However,      the number of unintended
pregnancies among U.S. adolescents               strongly suggests that areas

in which legal abortion is prohibited will experience substantial

increases in the number of births to teenagers. The magnitude of
the change    will vary by area because of differences in the use of

abortion prior to a ban,            the proximity to areas where abortion
remains legal, and the availability of illegal abortions.

     For     those     opposed      to   legal     abortion,        the     Increase      in

unintended childbearing is irrelevant to the debate.                          Abstinence

from premarital        sex,   it    is   argued,       is    a    simple    solution      to

unintended chIldbearing among adolescents.                        Even supporters         of

abortion would agree that preventing an unintended pregnancy is the

most preferable strategy for averting an unintended birth.                              Yet,


                                          20
the political situation in the U.S.     is such that   a concerted
commitment to lowering the rate of teerage pregnancy is not part

of the national agenda.   In this void, legalized abortion remains

one of the safest and most effective means of preventing adolescent

childbearing   and its attendant consequences.

   B.. and W., are the natural  logarithms of the Black and White
births respectively. 91 and 01 are the coefficients and e_1 is
the error term. The numbers in the parenthesis are the t—ratios.

         The Ljung—Box Q    statistic determines the randomness in
autocorrrelations   of  residual  errors,    and has   a  Chi—square
distribution   (Ljung  and  Box  1978).   The   numbers below the Q—
statistics are the marginal significance levels; i.e. the
probabilities of the null hypothesis that the autocorrelations of
the errors are not different from zero.
