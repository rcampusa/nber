                                            ABSTRACT

This paper explores price differences in the European Union (EU) pharmaceutical market, the EU’s
fifth largest industry. With the aim of enhancing quality of life along with industry competitiveness
and R&D capability, many EU directives have been adopted to achieve a single EU-wide pharmaceutical
market. Using annual 1994–2003 data on prices of molecules that treat cardiovascular disease, we
examine whether drug price dispersion has indeed decreased across five EU countries. Hedonic regressions
show that over time, cross-country price differences between Germany and three of the four other
EU sample countries, France, Italy and Spain, have declined, with relative prices in all three as well
as the fourth country, UK, rising during the period. We interpret this as evidence that the EU has come
closer to achieving a single pharmaceutical market in response to increasing European Commission
coordination efforts.

1. Introduction: The EU Pharmaceutical Market

       Since 1985, one goal of the European Commission has been to achieve a single market

for the pharmaceutical industry. The purpose of harmonizing the European Union (EU)

pharmaceutical market is not only to provide an environment favorable for pharmaceutical

innovation and development, but also to improve consumer choices in pharmaceuticals at

affordable prices without compromising quality, safety or efficacy (European Commission

1998). However, efforts have been hampered by differences across countries in health system

characteristics such as government market power and regulation, reimbursement policies and

patent processes. Without a centralized approach to pharmaceuticals, EU members continue to

apply their own individual solutions. Such segmentation could increase costs for the industry

and for patients if there are efficiency gains to having a more coordinated market.

       Variation in health system regimes across EU member states creates cross-country

differences in prices for the same pharmaceutical product (Drummond 2003). National

governments often determine prices independently of market mechanisms. Appendix table A-1

lists differences in characteristics of the five major EU pharmaceutical markets. While

attempting to slow rapidly rising health care costs, national governments have implemented

policies ranging from direct price controls and supply side cost containment regulations to

demand side financial incentives, quantity controls and physician educational initiatives

(Kanavos 2001;Mossialos, et al. 2004). Strategies employed by the European Commission to

narrow the divergence among the different national markets have included the organization of

several round table discussions and the creation of the European Agency for the Evaluation of

Medicinal Products (EMEA), European Patent Systems, the G10 Medicines Group and, most

recently, the Pharmaceutical Forum.




                                                                                                1
       A particularly important issue has been parallel importing. This occurs when a drug is

purchased in another country and then sold in the home country, at a price higher than the

purchase price but lower than the prevailing home country price (Darba and Rovira 1998). EU

parallel imports of pharmaceuticals were estimated at €4.265 billion in 2003, representing a

dramatic increase from a decade earlier and 5% of overall market value (EFPIA 2005). In 2005,

one of every 17 prescriptions in the United Kingdom was filled with a parallel import,

accounting for about one-seventh of total sales (The Association of the British Pharmaceutical

Industry 2007). This implies that arbitrage opportunities have persisted despite efforts to

coordinate the market, perhaps aided by lower repackaging costs in conjunction with EMEA

harmonization of dosage and labeling requirements. At the same time, parallel imports should

encourage pharmaceutical price convergence by dragging down prices in countries where

pharmaceuticals are more expensive (OECD 2000;Towse 1998). For instance, Ganslandt and

Maskus (2004) found that the prices of drugs subject to competition from parallel imports fell

relative to those of other drugs by 12–19%.

       The purpose of this paper is to investigate recent trends in EU pharmaceutical price

differences. Our analysis employs molecule-level IMS Health data on drugs that treat selected

cardiovascular diseases, covering the five countries with the largest pharmaceutical markets in

the EU over the 1994–2003 period. We proceed in three steps. First, we estimate trends in

bilateral price differences using quasi-hedonic regressions that control for variation in drug

characteristics. Second, we examine the contribution of various product and market

characteristics to price dispersion using a quasi-hedonic regression that permits intercepts and

parameters to differ across both countries and time. Third, we decompose price differences into

portions attributable to quality and market competition, along with an unexplained residual,




                                                                                                   2
using parameter estimates from the fully-interacted hedonic model.



2. Data

2.1. Characteristics

       International pharmaceutical price comparisons, which have been the subject of several

empirical studies, are confronted with various practical difficulties regarding the utilization of

price data. One problem is that the packaging unit in the country that serves as the basis for

comparison might be uncommon or even unavailable in other countries (Berndt 2000;Berndt, et

al. 2002). Another problem, which is mitigated in recent data on EU countries that use the euro

(€) as the local currency, is how to standardize different units of exchange. Conversions are

typically made using Purchasing Power Parities (PPP), but the applicability of the general PPP to

the health care sector is variable and uncertain. A third problem is the decision regarding which

set of medications to examine (Barry, et al. 2004). Yet another question is whether to further

normalize the price according to the WHO-defined daily dose (DDD), which assumes that

standard treatment duration is uniform across countries (Danzon and Chao 2000).

       Danzon (1999) recognized that samples consisting solely of packs sold in different

countries with the same ingredient, manufacturer, brand name, dosage form, size and strength

would exclude generic and over-the-counter (OTC) products. Because generics and OTCs likely

serve as substitutes for originator and prescription drugs, respectively, their omission could yield

unrepresentative samples (Hellerstein 1998), a problem potentially exacerbated by not including

all forms and strengths (Ellison, et al. 1997;Scherer 1993;Scherer 2000). The solution developed

by Danzon (1999) is to identify a drug by its active ingredient, i.e. molecule, and anatomic

therapeutic category (ATC) without regard to manufacturer or brand name.




                                                                                                     3
       Likewise, we combine all forms of a given molecule, including generics and licensed

products, to form a weighted average price per molecule-ATC. Ignoring differences between

identical molecules within the same ATC is seemingly less problematic than prospectively

introducing selection bias by systematically excluding various substitutes, forms, pack sizes and

strengths. We use the three-digit, i.e. third level, ATC, although results change little if we

disregard ATC and identify each drug simply by its molecule.

       This paper employs data from IMS Health, an international pharmaceutical consulting

company that collects sales data on more than one million products from over 3,000 companies

in more than 100 countries. The IMS Health measure that meets the criterion of being available

for all dosage forms and strengths is the IMS Standard Unit (SU). The SU defines a single dose

as one tablet or capsule, five liquid milliliters (i.e. one teaspoon), or one ampoule or vial of an

injected product (IMS 2005). Prices are converted to euros by IMS Health using constant

exchange rates, which minimizes effects of exchange rate fluctuations. A country’s SU price for

a molecule-ATC is its volume-weighted average price per dose over all presentations, including

generic, licensed, OTC, and parallel imported products (Danzon and Furukawa 2003).



2.2. Samples

       We analyze retail prices of drugs that treat cardiovascular disease (CVD), the third-

leading cause of death in OECD countries. Importantly, the effectiveness of CVD drug therapies

is short-term, so patients must continually receive a treatment to maintain its health benefits.

Our sample consists of the eight CVD drugs studied by Dickson and Jacobzone (2003), which

cover both newer and older innovations that form the core of pharmacotherapy for CVD.

       The five countries in the sample are Germany, the United Kingdom (UK), Italy, Spain,




                                                                                                      4
and France. Besides having the largest pharmaceutical production and sales in the EU-15

(OECD 2003), these five countries are the largest pharmaceutical markets in the world apart

from the US and Japan (Pammolli, et al. 2004). Imposing the previously described restrictions,

our sample would contain 259 distinct single molecules, representing 658 molecule-by-country

cells during the 1994–2003 period: 119 for France, 177 for Germany, 135 for Italy, 119 for Spain

and 108 for UK. An additional constraint, which unfortunately is substantial, accompanies the

necessity of choosing a baseline country with which to compare the others. We choose Germany

for this role because, as listed above, it contains the most molecules by a wide margin. Our

sample is thus limited to the 124 single molecules – 86 each for France and UK, 102 for Italy and

91 for Spain – that bilaterally match with Germany.



2.3. Preliminary Price Comparisons

       As shown in Table 1, the average SU price over all molecules and years ranges from

€0.24 in Spain and €0.25 in Italy and France to €0.60 in Germany and €1.36 in UK. Table 2 and

the accompanying figure depict average yearly SU prices for each country relative to that of

Germany, reiterating that prices are substantially higher in UK than Germany while prices in the

other three countries are substantially lower. After decreasing slightly in the latter 1990s, the

France-Germany price differential increases from –55% in 2000 to –72% in 2003. Similarly, the

Italy-Germany price gap rises from –63% to –71% over the period, while the Spain-Germany

price difference rises from –68% to –78%. In comparison, the UK-Germany price wedge

expands considerably during the period, to almost 200% by 2003.

       These trends seemingly indicate that pharmaceutical prices across countries are

diverging, rather than converging as if spurred by the achievement of a single market. However,




                                                                                                    5
the table 2 prices have not yet been adjusted for variation in the set of molecules sold in each

country. Some of these price differentials might be attributable to systematic differences in the

characteristics of drugs available in some countries but not others.



3. Differences in Prices Adjusted by Quality and Market Competition

3.1. Quasi-Hedonic Price Regressions

       When making international price comparisons, cross-country differences in product

specifications pose an obstacle (Kravis and Lipsey 1969). Products serving the same purpose

might have different attributes in different countries. For example, a Honda Accord might have

varying horsepower across countries, or come with automatic transmission in some countries and

manual transmission in others (Goldberg and Verboven 2004). In our case, the forms, pack sizes

and strength levels in which drugs are sold vary across countries, depending on demand and

cultural characteristics. To address this issue, we use hedonic regressions.

       As Danzon and Chao (2000) note, our price models are more appropriately termed quasi-

hedonic regressions for three reasons. First, while the standard hedonic model assumes that price

determinants differ randomly across products, pharmaceutical prices are expected to differ

systematically across countries, reflecting differences in health care regimes. Because some

price variation across countries is explained by factors other than observed product

characteristics and that change very little over time, the models include country-specific

intercepts. Second, hedonic regression estimates the marginal contribution of each characteristic

to the value of a product (Sirmans et al. 2005). However, pharmaceutical market imperfections

drive a wedge between price and marginal value. These include deviations between patient and

physician preferences, moral hazard from insurance coverage, and monopsony power of national




                                                                                                    6
health systems on the demand side, along with patent restrictions providing monopoly power to

producers and marketing restrictions through drug approval and testing requirements on the

supply side (Capri and Levaggi 2005). Third, drug prices also vary across countries because of

time-varying differences in regulatory and reimbursement environments. To address this, our

models specify market competition measures, which would not appear in a standard hedonic

regression, as additional explanatory variables.



3. 2. Specification of the Quasi-Hedonic Price Regression

        Adapted from Danzon and Chao (2000), our model uses log transformations of product

prices and characteristics,

                              8                        9              4              9   4                     K
     (1) ln Pk , j ,t     c         ln X c ,k , j ,t         t   dt         j   dj             j ,t   d j dt         k   dk   u k , j ,t .
                              c 1                      t 1            j 1            t 1 j 1                   k 1

In equation 1, for molecule k in country j and year t, P is the price per SU and Xc is a quality or

market characteristic. The d are indicators for country, year or molecule, while u is the

regression error. The parameter of primary interest, λj,t, estimates the average bilateral price

difference in time t between country j and Germany, which is omitted from the country indicator

vector, across molecules. This price gap is net of variation induced by differences across quality

and market characteristics, molecules, time or countries.

        Our preferred specification treats the molecule-specific intercepts as fixed effects by

including molecule indicators on the right-hand side. Besides the molecule quality and market

characteristics that appear in equation (1), drug prices also reflect therapeutic value and

convenience, attributes that have intrinsic value but are not observable. If these are time-

invariant and molecule-specific, the fixed effects model is appropriate. An alternative approach

is to hold constant ATC indicators as proxies for market and regulatory factors that vary by ATC



                                                                                                                                             7
category. Because these are time-invariant, however, they are not identified in the fixed effects

model. We therefore also estimate a random effects model. This strategy accounts for the

molecule-specific intercepts in the error term, and thus the regression standard errors, but does so

by invoking the questionable assumption that these intercepts are uncorrelated with the molecule

characteristics as well as the indicators for molecule, country and year.



3.2.1. Description of Variables

       Table 1 lists the variables along with their descriptive statistics. We categorize the first

five variables in the table as quality characteristics. Molecule age is the number of years since

the first product launch of molecule k in country j. The sample mean is 20 years, ranging from

18 in Spain to 22 in UK. We expect molecule age to be inversely related with price, since newer

treatments are typically introduced precisely because they are more effective, and thus have

higher value, than older treatments. Most molecules in our CVD ATCs were on the market prior

to the sample period.

       Strength is the average grams of active ingredient per SU and ranges from 0.14 in France

and UK to 0.23 in Spain, with an overall mean of 0.17. Stronger molecules are presumably more

effective, holding constant technological developments for which molecule age proxy, implying

a positive association between strength and price.

       Form code is the number of different product formulations for each molecule, and is

intended to reflect choice and convenience available to patients, suggesting a positive

relationship with price. Forms include different types of tablets (e.g. film, chewable, gel),

capsules, ampoules, powders, drops, syrups, syringes, and liquids, along with different strengths

and pack sizes. In 2003, for example, the molecule metoprolol (in ATC C7A) was available in




                                                                                                      8
118 different formulations in Germany. The mean is 6, ranging from 3 in France, Italy and Spain

to 12 in Germany.

       Pack size is the number of SUs averaged over all packs in a molecule, converted to

standard units according to IMS (2006) guidelines. If manufacturers achieve economies of scale

in packaging, price and pack size will be inversely related. The average SU pack size ranges

from 28 in Italy to 85 in Germany, with an overall mean of 56.

       The final quality characteristic, diffused molecules, is simply the number of sample

countries in which the molecule is available, and thus varies only between 2 and 5. If drug

manufacturers market a product wherever its marginal revenue exceeds its marginal cost,

diffusion will increase as marginal revenue rises or marginal cost declines. Net of institutional

differences captured by country fixed effects, therefore, diffusion could reflect either higher

therapeutic values or lower costs, making the theoretical relationship with price unclear.

However, if the other characteristics held constant in the model are correlated mostly with

therapeutic value rather than cost, a negative coefficient on diffusion will emerge.

       The last two rows list the time-varying market characteristics included in the fixed effects

model. Both reflect increased availability of substitutes and should thereby be negatively related

with price. Generic competitors are manufacturers of products containing the molecule,

including originators, licensees, parallel imports and generics. The average is eight in Germany,

but only three in the other four countries. Therapeutic substitute molecules are competitors that

are chemically distinct but used to treat the same indication, i.e. the number of molecules within

the same ATC3. On average, Germany again has the most, 22, while UK has the least, 13.



3. 3. Empirical Results of the Quasi-Hedonic Price Model




                                                                                                     9
3.3.1. Quality and Market Characteristics

       Table 3 contains the results of fixed and random effects estimation of equation (1).

Because all variables are specified in log form, each coefficient is interpreted as the elasticity of

price with respect to the corresponding quality or market characteristic. Most regressors have

the expected sign and are statistically significant. Except for molecule age, which in the fixed

effects model is identified only through the nonlinearity introduced by the log transformation, the

fixed and random effects models yield similar conclusions.

       The average SU price rises with product strength. This is not surprising, because

reference pricing based on product attributes, which is widely employed in the sample countries,

incorporates a positive relationship between strength and therapeutic effectiveness that

presumably must exist to justify selling different drug strengths. The coefficients imply that a

10% increase in molecule strength raises price by 2–3%, with the more conservative estimate

coming from the random effects model.

       The molecule age coefficient in the fixed effect model, which is near zero and highly

insignificant, conveys little information because within-molecule age varies separately from the

fixed year and molecule effects only via the non-linearity of the log transformation. An

advantage of the random effects model, therefore, is its utilization of cross-molecule variation to

estimate the relationship between price and molecule age. The significantly negative coefficient

is consistent with the notion that relative therapeutic value declines with age as more effective

new products enter the market. A 10% increase in age reduces price by about 2%.

       The number of formulations is insignificantly related to price in both models. Price

decreases significantly with pack size, though, as implied by economies of scale in packaging,

EMEA packaging and labeling regulations, and use in reference pricing calculations. Both




                                                                                                    10
models imply that the price of a 10% larger pack size will be lower by about 4%.

        Consistent with earlier studies, price also declines significantly with the number of

diffused molecules. The implied elasticity is nearly –0.4 with fixed effects, but only around –0.2

with random effects.

        Among the market characteristics, only generic competition is significantly related with

price, and only in the random effects model. Generic competition reduces price, as expected, but

by well less than 1% for each 10% increase. The impact of generic competition might have been

mitigated by the addition of generic substitution to the regulatory systems of many EU countries

by the late 1990s. In 1993, the EU introduced legislation allowing supplementary patent

certificates (SPCs) that, analogous to the Roche-Bolar provision of the Waxman-Hatch Act in the

US, allows generic manufacturers to develop versions of products that are still under patent

protection. SPC applications must go through a specific national patent office, giving member

countries the opportunity to separately address the issue. In Germany and UK, generic suppliers

can formulate and test products and complete product review in another country while the patent

is active, which can substantially reduce the time between patent expiration and generic launch.

For example, German generics have been launched the day following patent expiration. In

France, meanwhile, required documentation cannot be submitted for review until after patent

expiration, delaying the launch of generic competition for up to five years.

        The number of therapeutic substitute molecules is not significantly related to price, as

opposed to the inverse relationship that is expected and that Danzon and Chao (2000) obtain in

their data. Our result is not attributable to the inclusion of fixed effects, since the coefficient is

very similar in the random effects model. Substitute molecules with a higher price might not

receive reimbursement, and substitution is not always possible in regulated countries because of




                                                                                                         11
prescribing or consumption preferences.

       The therapeutic substitute entry lag, in years, is a time-invariant market characteristic

identified only in the random effects model. Its coefficient is positive but insignificant.



3.3.2. Quality Adjusted Standard Unit Price Differentials

       An important purpose of the equation (1) regression is estimating the country-by-year

interaction coefficients. These represent country-specific price trends that are unrelated to

quality and market characteristics, molecule identity, time-invariant country-specific factors and

temporal factors common to the sample countries. Table 4 shows the percentage differences in

price, relative to Germany, implied by these interaction coefficients.

       Over time, price differences persist, but decline in magnitude. This likely reflects

increasing market integration for several reasons, including parallel importing and greater

monitoring of cross-country price differences by the EU Commission in an effort to achieve a

single pharmaceutical market.

       Prices in France, Italy, and Spain move similarly, consistent with growing comparability

of their pharmaceutical industries and regulatory environments. For each drug, the French

government negotiates a single price targeted to the EU average. Changes implemented in the

late 1990s and early 2000s include increased promotion of generic substitution by pharmacists,

financial incentives for patients to visit general practitioners rather than more expensive

specialists, and price cuts on expensive drugs such as Zocor. Spain likewise has fixed drug

prices and uses international comparisons for reference pricing of generics, with prices set 10–

50% below those of the original brand in order to induce branded drug price reductions. Drugs

on a negative list are not reimbursed, and in 2001 price cuts of 15% were imposed for a variety




                                                                                                   12
of molecules. Italy’s regulatory approach is similar, with fixed pricing and cost-effectiveness

analysis of in-patent drugs. Prices of both branded and generic drugs are based on those in other

EU countries, and drugs with identical or therapeutically comparable pharmaceutical forms must

have the same price per unit. In 1999, price cuts of 15% were implemented for many products,

and the following year prices on unprotected branded drugs were reduced another 5%.

       Once quality and market characteristics are held constant, prices are higher in Germany

than in the other countries, including UK. Health care systems in Germany and UK, though

distinct, are alike in several respects. Although Germany is the only sample country with

unrestricted in-patent drug prices, a reference pricing system governs older products, and

pharmaceutical budgets and spending caps have been implemented since the 1980s. Health

insurance reimburses all pharmaceutical products not on the negative list, and both parallel

imports and generics are well-established. UK regulates in-patent drugs using cost-effectiveness

analysis and profit control. Government negotiates prices of licensed and branded drugs with the

pharmaceutical industry, and prices of generics are now also regulated because of recent

increases. Parallel imports from elsewhere in Europe are also encouraged.



4. Further Analysis of Price Differentials: Explained vs. Unexplained

       This section expands on the equation (1) model to estimate how the price effects of

molecule characteristics vary across countries and over time. For each country, these parameters

are used to partition the trends in bilateral price differences with Germany into a portion

attributable to differences in mean values of the quality and market characteristics, with the

remainder attributable to differences in parameter values or fixed country effects.




                                                                                                  13
4.1 Fully-Interacted Model

4.1.1. Specification

          The new model generalizes equation (1) by allowing molecule characteristics to have

different effects in different countries and years. This is done by adding interactions between

characteristics and country fixed effects, year fixed effects and country-by-year fixed effects.

The updated model is thus

Variables and parameters are denoted as in equation (1), and ρ, γ, and θ are the coefficients on

the new interactions between the molecule characteristics and the country/year indicators. Net

implicit prices for molecule characteristics are β for Germany in 1994, (β + γt) for Germany in

year t = 1995–2003, (β + ρ j) for other countries j in 1994, and (β + γt + ρ j + θj,t) for other

countries j in year t = 1995–2003.



4.1.2 Empirical Results

          The estimated elasticities of price with respect to quality and market characteristics are

summarized in table 5 for 1994 and 2003. Coefficient directions are largely consistent with our

earlier results, although magnitudes sometimes differ substantially across countries.

          Price is increasing in strength per SU, as expected, in all countries and years. Strength

elasticities are largest in Germany, possibly because strength is directly used to determine

relative prices, and larger in UK than remaining countries. Molecule age is significantly

negatively related to price in France, Italy and Spain, in each of which fixed prices prospectively


                                                                                                                                                                                    14
encourage renegotiation of lower prices as molecules age (Mossialos et al. 2004, Seget 2003),

with the magnitude rising over time in Spain but falling over time in France and Italy. The

number of formulations significantly increases price in France during the first half of the period

and in Italy and Spain throughout. Again, with fixed prices, introduction of a new formation

might provide an opportunity for manufacturers to renegotiate prices upward. The number of

diffused molecules significantly reduces price in Italy, perhaps reflecting the use of average EU

price comparisons, and UK, which evaluates treatments in terms of both clinical and cost

effectiveness. Price significantly decreases with pack size in all countries and years, which is not

surprising since, for instance, patient co-payment is based on pack size in Germany and

maximum price is based on maximum pack size in UK.

       Among the market variables, therapeutic substitute molecule availability affects price

negatively in Italy and Spain, in which prices are negotiated between suppliers, physicians and

pharmacists. Competition, under therapeutic reference pricing, decreases drug prices (Brekke, et

al. 2007). Like pack size, the number of generic competitors significantly reduces prices in all

countries and years. The impact is smallest in France and Spain, possibly reflecting regulations

on generics and limitations on price negotiations, and largest in UK and Germany, which had

unrestricted pricing and significant price reductions in the late 1990s.



4.2. Decomposition of characteristics

       This part of the analysis uses the Oaxaca (1973) decomposition method to explain the

price differences using the vector of determinants in equation (2). Specifically, we seek to

establish how much of the price difference between each country and Germany in a given year is

specific to observed quality and market characteristics. We decompose each price differential




                                                                                                   15
into three parts: one attributable to differences in the magnitudes of quality characteristics, a

second attributable to differences in the magnitudes of market characteristics, and a third residual

component which represents the difference between the overall price differential and the first

two parts, including differences in the quality and market characteristic parameter values across

countries and years as well as differences in the country fixed effects.



4.2.1 Specification

          The ratio of mean price of a molecule in country j relative to that in Germany, i.e. the

approximate percentage price differential, can be written as

                                  ln( Pj / PGR )       ln Pj    ln PGR    j   ln X j          GR   ln X GR

Inserting the term (      GR   ln X j      GR   ln X j ) into the right-hand side and distributing accordingly

yields the expression

(3)                       ln( Pj / PGR )         GR   (ln X j   ln X GR ) (    J        GR   ) ln X j ,

adopted from Danzon and Chao (2000). The first term                      GR   (ln X j        ln X GR ) , called the explained

component, represents the difference in mean characteristics of the sample of molecules in

country j compared with Germany, evaluated using the regression parameters for Germany. In

other words, this component is the portion of the price gap attributable to differences in average

characteristics between the comparison country and Germany. The second term

(     j   GR   ) ln X j , called the unexplained component, represents the difference in regression

parameters compared to Germany, evaluated using the characteristics in country j. This

unexplained component measures country-specific price differences arising from differences

across markets in how molecule characteristics are “treated.” If the coefficients of these

characteristics are the same for comparison country j and Germany, the unexplained component


                                                                                                                          16
equals zero, implying that price differences related to molecule characteristics are attributable

entirely to differences in the characteristics themselves. Country intercepts then estimate the

residual effects not explained by values or effects of the molecule characteristics.



4.2.2 Empirical Results: Quality vs. Competition Characteristics

       Table 6 summarizes the results of the decompositions, using the parameter estimates

from the fully-interacted model (2) in section 4.1. For each country relative to Germany, the

overall log price difference in each year is disaggregated into the components explained by

quality and market characteristics and a total of the three unexplained components, i.e. related to

differences in quality and market regression parameters as well as country-specific intercepts.

       During 1994–2003, prices in each of the other four countries have risen relative to

Germany. For countries other than UK, prices are still lower than in Germany, meaning that the

relative price increase represents a convergence in prices. The price difference with Germany

has decreased by about 40% for France, 50% for Spain and 65% for Italy. Meanwhile, the UK

price has risen from 16% less than Germany to 33% greater. The timing of relative price

movements also differed somewhat across countries. In Italy, price convergence was steady

starting in 1995. In France, convergence was concentrated during 1994–1997, as the price gap

with Germany actually increased over the next five years before falling again in 2003. Spain is

similar, with convergence occurring primarily during 1994–1997 and 2001–2003. In UK, prices

increased substantially in 1997, 1999 and 2003, making up for a temporary decline in 2002.

       Much of this price convergence is predicted by a relative decrease in German drug

“quality,” i.e. changes in values of quality characteristics that led to prices in Germany falling

compared with other countries. For example, of the 18 percentage point convergence in price




                                                                                                     17
between France and Germany, 16 percentage points are attributable to improved quality relative

to Germany. Analogous totals for the other countries are 34 of 44 percentage points in Italy, 19

of 33 points in Spain and 22 of 49 points in UK. Thus, it appears that pharmaceutical companies

have been largely responsible for EU drug price convergence through lowering the quality of

their products in Germany relative to other countries. This is ironic, as prices in the other

countries at the start of the period were lower than in Germany in spite of Germany having the

lowest predicted price based on quality characteristics.

       For all countries, competition has been increasing relative to Germany, in the sense that

market factors predict comparatively falling rather than rising prices in the other countries.

However, these effects are small, i.e. 10 percentage points in France and Spain and only 5–6

points in UK and Italy.

       Unexplained factors, therefore, account for (more than) the rest of the convergence in

prices, varying in importance from 13 percentage points in France and 17 points in Italy to 23

points in Spain and 33 points in UK. The unexplained component, which is assumed to capture

the net effect of country specific industry dynamics such as insurance coverage, medical norms

and reimbursement incentives, was already the reason prices were higher in Germany than

elsewhere.

       From the detailed decomposition estimates, not presented here but available from the

authors, we can further disaggregate the sources of the price changes predicted by each set of

factors. Note that based on equation 3 above, “explained” price changes include not only

changes in mean characteristic values but also changes in the Germany regression parameters,

because we separately estimate equation 3 each sample year. Other than a 15% increase in

molecule age, characteristic means changed very little over the period.




                                                                                                 18
       The “explained” changes are thus attributable primarily to changes in the Germany

regression coefficients. These are driven almost entirely by increases, in absolute value, of the

negative coefficient of a specific quality factor, pack size. Multiplied by the essentially

unchanged cross-country differences in mean pack size, this predicts relative price increases of

18 percentage points in France, 25 points in Italy, 19 points in Spain and 43 points in UK. These

predict changes represent nearly three-quarters of predicted price convergence from quality

changes in Italy, 100% in Spain and effectively all of the predicted overall price convergence in

France and UK. In particular, 30–60% of these impacts, depending on the country, reflect the

change in the Germany pack size regression coefficient just from 1999 to 2000. This suggests a

change in the reference pricing formula in Germany, starting in 2000, in which price discounts

for larger pack sizes were increased.

       Accounting for changes in relative prices attributable to specific “unexplained” factors is

more difficult. Increasingly positive pack size coefficients in every country besides Germany are

partly responsible, but this is much more important in France than the other countries. Also,

changes in each other factor, with the exception of form code, play a central role in at least one

country. In France and Italy, relative price increases predicted from changes in unexplained

quality factors are mostly offset by large decreases predicted from changes in the residual term,

with relatively little change from unexplained competition factors. But in Spain and UK,

residual changes predict further relative price increases, whereas unexplained competition factors

predict declining prices.

       By the end of the period, prices continued to be lower in France, Italy and Spain than in

Germany because the negative effect of unexplained factors swamped the positive impact of

higher quality. However, price gaps had shrunk both because observed quality differentials had




                                                                                                     19
increased and unexplained differentials had fallen. Meanwhile, prices were higher in UK by

2003 partly because unexplained factors now predicted higher, rather than lower, prices. Higher

quality relative to Germany was an even more important factor, although quality was lower in

UK than in the other three countries.



5. Conclusion

        The purpose of this paper is to analyze price differences across molecules that treat

cardiovascular disease across selected European Union countries during 1994–2003. Although

pharmaceutical prices are regulated in all five countries that we study, specific regulations vary.

For instance, in Italy, France and Spain, prices are regulated at launch and subsequently are

revised downwards over the life cycle of the drug. In contrast, pharmaceutical companies in the

UK and Germany are free to set prices at launch, although prices cannot move freely throughout

the life of the drug.

        Our data include only cardiovascular disease drugs in certain therapeutic categories that

were sold in the five countries we study and are matched to one country in particular, Germany.

Similarly, our data set extends for only a ten year period. Caution must be exercised, therefore,

in generalizing our findings to molecules designed to treat other diseases in other countries and

more recent years.

        Notwithstanding these limitations, three main conclusions can be drawn from our study.

First, drug prices in Germany fall relative to prices in other countries over 1994–2003. For

countries besides UK, these relative price changes are interpreted as evidence of price

convergence. Second, several observed drug characteristics affect prices in the expected way.

Third, drug quality in Germany has fallen relative to the other countries, contributing to price




                                                                                                   20
convergence. These results suggest that although price differences still exist because of

diverging health system regulations, market integration and continued coordination efforts of the

European Commission are moving the EU towards a single pharmaceutical market.
