Using Vignettes to Improve Understanding of Social Security and Annuities

NBER Working Paper No. 26176
August 2019
JEL No. H3,J26

                                           ABSTRACT

Evidence shows that people have difficulty understanding complex aspects of retirement
planning, which leads them to under-utilize annuities and claim Social Security benefits earlier
than is optimal. To target this problem, we developed vignettes about the consequences of
different annuitization and claiming decisions. We evaluated our vignettes using an experiment
with a representative online panel of nearly 2,000 Americans. In our experiment, respondents
were either assigned to a control group with no vignette, to a written vignette, or to a video
vignette. They were then asked to give advice to hypothetical persons on annuitization or Social
Security claiming, and were asked factual questions about these concepts. We found evidence
that being exposed to vignettes led respondents to give better advice. For example, the gap
between advised claim age for a relatively healthy person versus a relatively sick person was
larger by nearly a year in the vignette treatments versus the control group. Further, the vignettes
increased financial literacy related to these concepts by 10-15 percentage points. Interestingly, the
mode of communication did not have a significant impact – the video and written vignettes were
equally effective.

   1. Introduction
       Individuals in the United States are increasingly responsible for their own financial security
after retirement. Yet, evidence shows that they have difficulty understanding complex aspects of
retirement planning and that financial literacy rates are low worldwide (Klapper et al., 2015). The
result is that individuals may claim Social Security earlier, or utilize annuities less than is optimal,
leading to poor financial security in later life (Benartzi et al., 2011; Poterba et al., 2011; Lusardi
and Mitchell, 2007; 2011).
       One solution is to provide financial education or more information about retirement
planning. In one study, individuals who felt they had enough information about Social Security
claiming were also more satisfied in retirement (Rabinovich and Samek, 2018). In other studies,
visual tools and narratives helped individuals improve their financial literacy in basic concepts
related to financial planning (Heinberg et al., 2014; Lusardi et al., 2017). Heinberg et al. (2014)
found evidence that video and written narratives were equally effective at improving financial
literacy, but that videos were more effective at improving self-efficacy surrounding decisions
about retirement. However, the most effective content and mode of communication are still open
questions.
       Our paper is most related to two recent studies that investigated understanding of annuities
and Social Security by using experiments in an online panel representative of the U.S. population.
Brown et al. (2017) asked respondents to provide a lump sum amount they would be willing to
pay for a permanent increase in Social Security monthly benefits, or to provide a lump sum amount
they would have to be paid to accept a permanent decrease in monthly payments. Respondents
provided divergent and inconsistent valuations. The implication is that consumers do not
understand annuities and are not able to value them. In a follow-up study, Brown et al. (2019)
found that inducing respondents to think jointly about the annuitization decision as well as how
quickly or slowly to spend down assets in retirement led to improved respondents’ valuation of
annuities. We build on Brown et al. (2017) and Brown et al. (2019) using an online experiment to
investigate the impact of a similar consequence message on decision-making and financial literacy.
Different from Brown et al. (2017; 2018), this paper also evaluates the effect of modes of
communicating the consequence message, including using video or a written narrative.
       We propose that consequence messaging is a promising educational tool that can improve
decision-making under uncertainty. The premise of consequence messaging is that while expected



                                                   2
utility theory assumes that people make decisions by evaluating all possible consequences and
their probability of occurrence, in complex situations that involve uncertainty, decisions are
actually made without fully processing this information. A benefit of consequence messaging is
that it describes the outcomes of multiple decisions under different states of the world. Hence, if
individuals are asked to consider the consequences of an action, this should improve their
understanding. In this sense, this paper is also related to Samek and Sydnor (2019), who use
consequence graphs to help people understand the outcomes associated with different health
insurance plan choices.
       In this study, our first contribution is to evaluate how consequence messaging affects
decision-making in the context of annuities and Social Security claiming. We chose these two
concepts because both annuities and Social Security protect against longevity uncertainty and
therefore could be affected by consequence messaging. Our second contribution is to assess
different modes of communicating consequences by comparing video and written vignettes. We
chose to compare videos and written modes of communication because these were also used in
Heinberg et al. (2014) and because these are common ways of communicating through the internet.
       In our vignettes, a 62-year old man is talking to his financial advisor about his plans for
budgeting for his retirement. The financial advisor encourages the man to consider the
consequences of different decisions. The financial advisor explains that outcomes depend partly
on his decisions – i.e., how much money to spend down, and partly on uncertainty – i.e., the
uncertainty surrounding how long the man can expect to live. The vignettes do not constitute a
pure consequence message since the financial advisor also describes the basic features of the
decision, for example by explaining the link between claiming age and level of Social Security
benefits in the Social Security vignette.
       To evaluate our vignettes, we conducted an experiment in the Understanding America
Study (UAS). The UAS is a nationally representative probability-based internet panel (N=6,000 at
the time of the study) housed at the University of Southern California. We recruited nearly 2,000
participants ages 30-70 to participate in the study and randomized them between-subjects in a 2x3
experimental design to either the Social Security or annuities condition, and to either receive no
vignette, a written vignette, or a video vignette. The written and video vignette contained the same
content but were presented either through video or as text on a webpage. In the valuing annuities
vignette, the man is making a decision about whether to purchase an annuity. In the Social Security



                                                 3
claiming vignette, the man is making a decision about when to claim his Social Security benefits.
       We evaluate the impact of our vignettes on decision-making and understanding by using
two main outcome variables. The first outcome is advice that the respondent would give a
hypothetical person who is facing the decision of whether to annuitize or when to claim Social
Security. Within-subjects, we experimentally vary whether the hypothetical person is in relatively
good health or relatively poor health and evaluate this “spread” in advice by treatment. We
consider this variable as most representative of decision-making, since we could not actually
observe respondents’ own decisions in these contexts. Further, asking respondents to give advice
to a hypothetical person limits concerns about respondents’ own wealth and health and allows us
to manipulate health. The second outcome is the performance of respondents in a short quiz
measuring financial literacy related to annuities or Social Security.
       We find that, relative to the control group, respondents randomized to the vignettes advise
significantly larger spreads of annuitization amounts and Social Security claim ages between the
hypothetical person in relatively poor health and the hypothetical person in relatively good health.
We take this as evidence that the vignettes affect decision-making, and provide suggestive data to
indicate that this change leads to improved decisions. We also find that the vignettes significantly
improve accuracy of responses to the financial literacy quiz. We take this as evidence that
consequence messages improve understanding of annuities and Social Security, at least in the
short-term. We do not find any evidence that one mode of communication is better than another;
however, most respondents indicate that they prefer to receive the information in written form.
       In what follows, Section 2 describes our experimental design. Section 3 summarizes our
results. Section 4 provides a discussion and concludes.


2. Experimental Design

2.1 Vignette Development
       We created two vignettes about the same 62-year old man and his financial advisor. Each
vignette (in video format) was about 3 minutes long. The first vignette focused on annuities, and
the second vignette focused on Social Security claiming age decisions. The written scripts for the
vignettes and links to the video version, as well as screenshots of the video, are provided in
Appendix B. In both vignettes, the 62-year old man is meeting with his financial advisor to discuss
his plans for budgeting his retirement.


                                                 4
         The goal of both vignettes was to provide information about the consequences of living
longer or shorter, stress the uncertainty in one’s lifespan, and explain how this impacts the money
that one can spend during retirement. In the annuities vignette, the financial advisor explained that
an annuity acts as insurance against uncertain life expectancy: “Annuities are like insurance
against outliving your money. You pay a premium up front, but then you’re guaranteed a monthly
payment until you die.” However, the financial advisor does not actually advise purchasing an
annuity. In the Social Security vignette, the financial advisor explains how monthly Social Security
benefits change as a function of claiming age and clarifies that one does not need to claim in the
same year as one retires from work: “Your retirement benefits depend on the age when you begin
claiming. It’s a tradeoff -- you can decide to claim earlier. In that case, you would have lower
monthly benefits, but you’d also get to enjoy these benefits for a longer period.” However, as
before, the financial advisor does not actually advise delaying claiming.


2.2 Participant Recruitment
         We conducted our experiment on the Understanding America Study (UAS), an online panel
that is representative of the U.S. population.1 An advantage of using this panel is that we are able
to understand the impact of our vignettes on the population they are meant to affect: i.e., older
adults who are facing or will face the decision to annuitize or claim Social Security. Another major
advantage of using the panel is that the UAS contains rich data on socio-economic status (SES)
and cognitive abilities of respondents, which can be linked to the data that we collect.
         We recruited a random sample of 2,150 Americans ages 30-70 from the UAS pool to
participate in the study, and 1,808 respondents ultimately completed the study (84% response
rate).2 Table 1 provides summary statistics of the sample. The average age of our respondents was
52 (S.D.=10.32). About 43% were male and 57% were female. 87% were white, 10% were black
and 7% were Hispanic. Respondents came from a range of backgrounds. About 24% of the sample
had an income of less than $30,00 per year, and 26% had an income greater than $100,000. About
25% of the sample had a high school education or less, while 14% had an education higher than a

  An additional 43 respondents started but did not complete the survey. As discussed in a later footnote, this rate
does not differ by treatment assignment.

bachelor’s degree. Our data on SES and demographics comes from prior UAS surveys. As such,
we are missing data on race for 6 respondents, and missing age for 1 respondent. We include
missing dummies in the regressions for these respondents.


2.3 Experiment Procedures
        The study was conducted in two waves – a smaller group was recruited July-November
2018 and follow-up data collection occurred April-July 2019. Our experimental design is presented
in Table 2. Our 2x3 experimental design includes experimental variation in 1) whether respondents
were asked about annuities or Social Security claiming and 2) whether respondents received no
vignette (control group), a written vignette or a video vignette. Randomization was done at the
respondent level, with the aim of randomizing an equal number of respondents to each of the six
treatment cells. This resulted in about 300 observations in each treatment cell.
        In the vignette treatments, following the vignette we also asked respondents to indicate
whether they were able to fully view the vignette. Approximately 95% of respondents in the video
vignette treatments and 99% of respondents in the written vignette treatments indicated that they
could view the vignette fully, suggesting that most people were exposed to the intervention as
expected. Despite the fact that a small minority could not view the vignettes, we include everyone
randomized to each treatment in our analysis (i.e., we perform an intent-to-treat analysis).
        At the end of the survey, all respondents received a short questionnaire that assessed the
impact of the vignettes on decision-making and financial literacy. The questions also asked
respondents to rate their concerns and expectations about retirement planning and indicate their
preferences for receiving information. The questions are available in Appendix C. First, to assess
decision-making, respondents were given two scenarios about the man from the video (in random
order) and asked to give advice to the man about how much annuity to purchase or when to claim
Social Security.3 The “long-life” scenario described the man as being in relatively good health and
expecting to live a longer life: “based on his family history and his relative good health, Bill
expects to live at least until he is 85”. The “short-life” scenario described the man as being in
relatively poor health and expecting to live a shorter life: “based on his family history and his


3
  We additionally randomized the name of the man in the scenario – which was either John or Bill. Further, a sub-set
of respondents were exposed to an unrelated preference elicitation task before participating in our study. We add a
control to our regressions to indicate this.


                                                         6
relatively poor health, Bill expects to live until he is around 70”. Relative to respondents in the
control treatment, we expected respondents in the vignette treatments to give advice that was more
responsive to the differences in the man’s circumstances -- i.e., to have a larger “spread” between
the advice in the “short-life” and “long-life” scenarios.
           Second, to assess financial literacy related to annuities and Social Security claiming, we
asked True/False questions about each concept. Respondents assigned to the annuity condition
received four questions about annuities and respondents assigned to the Social Security condition
received four questions about Social Security (in random order).4 The True/False statements dealt
with basic features of annuities or Social Security benefits, such as, “An annuity is a financial
product that pays a lump sum when you die” and, “You have to start claiming Social Security as
soon as you stop working completely”. We expected that if the consequence message were
effective at improving understanding, then respondents randomized to the vignettes would get
more of these questions correct than respondents randomized to the control group.
           Third, we asked respondents how much importance they place on several concerns that
people may have about retirement (in random order). The concerns were related to annuities or
Social Security, depending on treatment to which the respondents were assigned. We developed
these concerns with the aim of including some concerns that were related to considering
consequences and some concerns that were not. Respondents were asked to value each concern on
a five-point scale from “Not at all important” to “Very Important”. For annuities, the consequence-
related concerns included (1) “The risk of not getting to spend most of your money in your
lifetime”, (2) “The risk of running out of money in your lifetime”, and (3) “Uncertainty about how
long you will live”. For social security the items were (1) “The risk of claiming Social Security
too late and not getting to enjoy the full benefits in your lifetime”, (2) “The risk of claiming Social
Security too early and getting a lower monthly payment during your lifetime” and (3) “Uncertainty
about how long you will live”. For both annuities and social security, the non-consequence-related
concerns were (1) “Whether you have enough money saved up for retirement”; (2) “Leaving
money for your children or other dependents” (see Appendix C for a full script).
           Our hypothesis was that if the consequence message helps people consider the
consequences of different outcomes, then respondents randomized to the consequence treatments
would place a higher importance on the consequence-related concerns versus respondents

4
    Some of these questions were modeled after existing questions in the UAS.


                                                          7
randomized to the control group. The remaining questions asked about preferences for mode of
receiving communication about annuities or Social Security, and expectations about one’s own
claim or annuitization decisions.
         Respondents received $5 just for completing the survey and earned additional money by
providing correct answers to the quiz.5 In line with what is typically done in the UAS, respondents’
earnings were deposited on their re-usable credit cards the first week of the following month.


3. Results
         Our analysis includes all 1,808 respondents who completed the survey. Table 3 shows that
we are balanced on all observable characteristics by treatment, suggesting that our randomization
worked as intended.6 Because respondents randomized to a video vignette were more likely to
have trouble viewing their treatment as compared to respondents randomized to a written vignette,
we are unbalanced on ability to view the treatment. This biases downward our chance of observing
an effect of the video vignette, as those unable to see the video effectively did not receive their
treatment. Given this imbalance, we include regressions in Appendix Table A.1 that exclude
respondents who were unable to view the vignettes. The results are qualitatively unchanged.


3.1 Impact on Decision-Making
         To determine whether consequence messaging might affect decision-making, we
investigated the advice respondents gave in the long and short-life scenarios. To evaluate decision-
making on the extensive margin, we create a variable that takes the value of 1 if the advised amount
to annuitize or the advised Social Security claim age is higher in the long-life scenario, and 0
otherwise. To evaluate decision-making on the intensive margin, we create a spread variable,
which takes the difference between advice given in the long and short-life scenarios. We expect
the spread to be positive, meaning that respondents should recommend annuitizing more money
and claiming Social Security later in the long-life scenario relative to the short-life scenario. We
further expect the spread to be larger in the vignette treatments, suggesting that the vignettes

5
  As noted earlier, a sub-set of respondents also completed unrelated tasks during the survey. These respondents took
15 minutes on average to complete the survey, and they earned an $8 survey completion payment.
6
  An additional 43 (2.3%) respondents started but did not complete the survey. This includes 5 in Annuities Control
(1.7%), 4 in Annuities Written (1.3%), 6 in Annuities Video (2.0%), 11 in Social Security Control (3.3%), 7 in
Social Security Written (2.2%), and 6 in Social Security Video (3.2%). There are no statistically significant
completion rate differences between treatments (F-test p-value=0.46).


                                                         8
increase the responsiveness of respondents to information that changes longevity beliefs. This
would amount to a change in the elasticity of a respondent’s advised annuity purchase amount or
claim age with respect to life expectancy.
       In the annuities condition, 622 of 882 (71%) respondents gave a directionally correct
response, and in the Social Security condition 778 of 926 (84%) of respondents gave a directionally
correct response. Figure 1, Panel A summarizes the proportion of directionally correct responses
by treatment. Although the number of directionally correct responses is larger for the treatment
groups, the differences are not statistically significant (p-values from chi-squared tests comparing
vignettes to control are between 0.06 and 0.19).
       Given the high percentage of directionally correct recommendations that already exist in
the control treatments, we suspect that we may face a ceiling in terms of finding treatment effects
on this variable. Hence, Figure 1, Panel B summarizes the spread variable. In the annuities
condition, the spread is measured as a percent of the total possible allotment of $250,000. The
average spread in the annuities condition is 15 percentage points (SD=23.9) and the average spread
in the Social Security condition is 45 months (SD=35.2). We observe statistically significant
differences in the spread by treatment for most comparisons. In the annuities condition, the spread
is 7 percentage points larger in the written vignette treatment relative to the control group (p=0.002
from a two-sided t-test) and 2 percentage points larger in the video vignette treatment relative to
the control group, but this latter result is not statistically significant (p=0.233). The difference in
spread when comparing the written and video vignettes is statistically significant (p=0.04 in a post-
estimation Wald test). In the Social Security condition, the spread is 11 months larger in the written
vignette treatment relative to the control group (p<0.001), and 12 months larger in the video
vignette (p<0.001). There is no statistically significant difference in the spread when comparing
the written and video vignette (p=0.715).
       Figure 2 presents kernel density plots of the distribution of the spread variable. We find
that the distributions of spread are also statistically significantly different in most comparisons. In
the annuities condition, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test comparing the distributions is statistically
significant at the 1% level when comparing the written vignette to control (p=0.003), but not when
comparing the video vignette to control (p=0.065). In the Social Security condition, a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test comparing treatments to control is statistically significant in both the
written vignette and the video vignette (p=0.003 and p<0.001 respectively).             There are no



                                                   9
statistically significant differences in the distribution of the spread when comparing the written
and video vignette in either the annuity (p=0.302) or Social Security (p=0.785) treatments.
         Table 4 provides regressions that confirm the results of our t-tests and show that our results
are robust to the demographic, SES, numeracy and scenario order controls that we include.
Column 1 uses the binary 1/0 variable of directionally correct recommendations as an outcome
variable, while columns 2 and 3 use the spread as the outcome variable. In column 3, we
additionally control for the advice given in the short-life scenario in order to compare scenario
differences with similar baseline advised annuitization amounts or claim ages. The treatment
effects when comparing each vignette treatment to the control group remain large and statistically
significant in all specifications. Post-estimation tests comparing the written and video vignettes do
not yield statistically significant results (p-values between 0.06 and 0.94). In Appendix Table A.1,
we run the same analysis but excluding who said they had problems viewing the vignette.
Appendix tables A.2 and A.3 display coefficients for the full list of demographic and SES controls
found in Table 4.
         The advised spread treatment effects that we observe in column 2 are economically
relevant. For example, for a 62 year-old man, delaying Social Security claiming by 11 months
results in 6.1% higher benefits each month.7 Similarly, an investment of 5.5% of $250,000 in an
annuity amounts to $13,750, which at a payout rate of 6% per year (an average market rate for a
62-year old male)8 amounts to an additional $70 per month.


3.2 Impact on Financial Literacy Surrounding Retirement Planning
         We next investigate the impact of our vignettes on understanding of annuities and Social
Security. The average percentage of correct True/False responses in the annuities condition was
87.4% (S.D.=19.5) and the average percentage of correct True/False responses in the Social
Security scenario was 89.8% (S.D.=19.5). Figure 3 shows the percent correct by treatment.
Relative to the control group, the vignettes showed a higher percent correct by about 10 percentage
points for the annuities condition and 14 percentage points for the Social Security condition. We
find that in the annuities condition, both written and video vignettes showed statistically

significantly higher percentages of correct answers versus control (p<0.001 for either vignette in
t-tests comparisons with control). In the Social Security condition, the written and video vignettes
also showed statistically significantly higher percentages of correct answers versus control
(p<0.001 for both vignettes). The vignettes were not statistically different from each other
in either condition. Table 4 presents these results as a regression in specification 4,
controlling for demographics, SES, scenario order and numeracy.


3.3 Impact on Concerns and Expectations
       We next evaluate whether the vignette treatments increased the importance that
respondents placed on consequence-related concerns about retirement and on the respondents’
reported own plans about annuitization and claiming. While these are the variables we might
ultimately wish to affect, we should note that it is generally difficult to move these variables. For
example, Perez-Arce et al. (2019) found that an intervention with information about spousal
benefits associated with Social Security claiming age affected the advice that respondents gave in
hypothetical situations but did not affect respondents’ own expected claiming ages. In addition,
with regards to the Social Security claiming age, we did not have an a priori expectation of which
direction it should move by treatment, since this would depend on self-assessed longevity. Finally,
with respect to annuitization, an individuals’ expected wealth at retirement and access to private
pensions are unobserved variables that affect the reports.
       We did not find an impact on either consequence-related concerns or on expected
annuitization or Social Security claim age. The average importance placed on the 3 consequence-
related concerns was 3.51 (S.D.=0.90) on a 5-point Likert scale, while the average importance
placed on the 2 concerns unrelated to consequences was 3.75 (S.D.=0.94) on the same scale. The
difference is small and does not seem to differ by treatment. Figure 4 displays the difference in
importance placed on consequence-related concerns over non-consequence-related concerns, by
treatment. When looking at annuities and Social Security separately, we find positive but not
statistically significant treatment effects on consequence-related concerns over non-consequence-
related concerns in the video vignette (t-test comparisons to control yield p=0.07, p=0.14
respectively). Column 5 in Table 4 confirms the result that there are no statistically significant
differences by treatment on this measure.




                                                 11
        The treatments generally did not have an impact on the respondents’ claiming age or level
of annuitization. Restricting our analysis to respondents who are not yet old enough to claim Social
Security (age less than 62), on average respondents in the annuities condition reported a likelihood
of annuitizing in the future of 2.8 (S.D.=0.95) out of 5. While the video vignette increased the
likelihood over control by 0.22 (t-test comparison to control yields p=0.02), the written vignette
had no statistically significant effect (p=0.08). In the Social Security condition, respondents on
average answered that they would begin collecting Social Security benefits at age 65.6
(S.D.=2.75). Neither the written nor the video vignette had an effect on expected claiming age
(p=0.42 and p=0.56 respectively).


3.4 Further Analysis
3.4.1 Welfare
        While we observed large impacts on the spread in advice by treatment, we next attempt to
evaluate whether this effect reflects a welfare improvement, given the limited information we
provided to the respondents about the annuity instrument and Social Security claim benefit. This
analysis is exploratory, since we did not identify this as an issue a priori and since respondents
were given limited information, making complex calculations challenging. Hence, we may think
of this exercise as merely suggestive.
        To study welfare effects, we transform respondents’ advice in both scenarios into the
present value of a stream of monthly payments. We take advantage of the fact that the only
difference between the two scenarios is life expectancy, which increases by 15 years in the long-
life scenario relative to the short-life scenario. For simplicity, we ignore the fact that there is some
uncertainty in longevity in each scenario. In the annuities condition, we calculate a monthly payout
assuming a fixed rate annuity with an annual payout rate of 6%.
        In the Social Security condition, we follow the claim age tables on the Social Security
website to convert the respondents’ recommended claim ages into a percentage of their full
monthly retirement benefit, starting at 70% if they claim at age 62, and increasing on average 0.4
percentage points each month delayed after that.9 We allow our percent of monthly benefit value

to keep increasing at this increment until 70, in order to match the possible responses in our
simplified scenario. We assume the maximum 2019 full retirement benefit of $2,861 to convert
this percentage value into dollar terms.
       Given a fixed life expectancy, the present value of a monthly payout in either condition is
as follows, where n represents the number of months of expected life left, and r is the prevailing
discount rate, which we assume to be 3%:
                                                                1

Table 5 shows vignette treatment effects on the present value of the respondent’s long-life
recommendation, controlling for the short-life recommendation as well as demographics and SES.
The written vignette treatments increases present value by $2,244 in the annuities condition
(p=0.003) and $2,071 in the Social Security condition (p=0.019). The video vignette treatments
show positive but not statistically significant effects, although Wald post-estimation tests
comparing written to video do not show significant differences (p=0.093 in the annuities condition
and p=0.343 in the Social Security condition). This preliminary analysis suggests that both
treatments not only increased the spread of the recommended values, but also improved welfare
for the hypothetical person.


3.4.2 Interaction Effects

       Our final question is whether we observe heterogeneous treatment effects by age, race and
cognitive ability. We consider age because we expect that vignettes may be more effective for
people who are younger and have therefore had less exposure to or thought less about annuitizing
and claiming decisions. We consider race because we are interested in exploring whether the video
vignette, which featured white actors, was more salient for white respondents relative to other
races or ethnicities. Finally, we consider cognitive ability because we are interested in
understanding whether our treatments help narrow the gap in financial literacy between higher and
lower cognition respondents. Tables 6 and 7 explore the possibility of heterogeneity in vignette
treatment effects on both our binary directionally correct variable and our spread variable.
Columns 1 and 2 in both tables display the interaction of the vignettes with respondent age. Older
adults are more likely to have had exposure to retirement planning concepts (and some may have


                                                13
already made their own decisions about annuitization or claiming Social Security), and may
therefore be expected to respond less to the treatment vignettes. We find that treatment effects do
not vary significantly with respect to age.
        Columns 3 and 4 use the interaction of treatments with black respondents. We might expect
the video vignette to be less salient for black respondents, as the video featured a white financial
advisor and advisee, and some evidence in the medical field suggests that advice is taken more
seriously from professionals of the same race as the patient (Hill et al., 2018; Boulware et al.,
2016). We do not find evidence of this. The coefficients on the video vignette and race interaction
are similar to the coefficients on the written vignette and race interaction.
        Columns 5 and 6 display the interaction of treatment with numeracy. In general, treatment
effects appear not to vary significantly with respondent’s numeric skills (while the coefficients
appear statistically significant in the written vignette of the annuities condition, the effect size is
small). Similar results are observed when we use a financial literacy score10 or educational
attainment in Appendix Tables A.4 and A.5.


4. Discussion and Conclusion
        Use of annuities and Social Security claim age decisions are important in the retirement
planning process since they substantially affect wellbeing and economic security in retirement.
Research finds that people tend to under-utilize annuities and claim Social Security earlier than is
optimal. In this study, we conducted an experiment with a large representative sample of
Americans to investigate the impact of short written and video educational tools on decision-
making and financial literacy surrounding these complex concepts. Our survey included nearly
2,000 Americans ages 30-70 years old. We randomized respondents in a 2x3 design to either
receive the annuity or Social Security scenario, and to either receive no vignette, a written vignette
or a video vignette. The vignettes provided information about the consequences of making
different decisions about annuitization and Social Security claim age, respectively.
        We found that our vignettes affected decision-making and financial literacy. Our measure
of decision-making was the advice that respondents gave to a hypothetical person about how much



10
  This is another measure available in the UAS that is highly correlated with numeracy. It is based on the National
Financial Capability Study (NFCS), a project of the FINRA Investor Education Foundation:
https://www.usfinancialcapability.org/


                                                        14
to annuitize and when to claim Social Security. We believe this measure is better than using own
decisions, since we were able to experimentally manipulate the perceived health of the
hypothetical person in each scenario, and since the responses could be de-coupled from other
aspects of the respondents’ own circumstances, such as amount of money available for
annuitization. In the vignette treatments, respondents’ advice was more responsive to the health
circumstances of the hypothetical person than in the control group. Further, in the vignette
treatments, respondents answered more True/False questions correctly about the concepts than in
the control group.
       We did not find any impact of our vignettes on self-reported concerns about retirement
planning or on expected annuitization decisions and claim age. We might have expected this, since
related work also found that own expected decisions are more difficult to influence through short
experimental manipulations (Perez-Arce et al., 2019). Hence, we view it as a positive that our main
measure included the advice to the hypothetical person, since absent this measure, we might have
concluded that short messages do not have an impact on decision-making. In practice, short
messages may be more impactful if they are delivered at the time of decision, such as together
with the information that Social Security might send individuals about their eligibility to claim, or
bundled with information about annuity products. We leave this idea for future research.
       We also collected data on respondents’ preferences for receiving communications about
annuities and Social Security. Respondents were given a multiple choice question that included
the following modes of communication: watch a video online, read an article online, or receive
information in the mail. The most commonly selected preference for receiving communications
was receiving information in the mail (34.13% of respondents), followed by reading an article
online (28.54% of respondents) and watching a video online (25.5% of respondents). We find that
preferences varied somewhat by age, with participants over 50 being 33% more likely to prefer
receiving information in the mail than younger respondents. Since both written and video modes
of communication proved equally effective, the choice of which to use in practice may depend
both on preferences and on cost. Disseminating videos online has a high fixed cost (i.e., to produce
the video) but a low marginal cost (sending out the link). This low marginal cost means that
disseminating videos online may be easy to quickly scale to a large number of viewers. On the
other hand, providing information through the mail may have lower fixed cost (no need to produce
a video) but has higher marginal cost (the cost of printing and stamps).



                                                 15
       Our study leaves several questions open for future work. From a theoretical perspective,
research should try to better understand what it is about consequence messaging that makes it
effective. This work should include considering why consequence messaging works for conveying
factual information, but is not particularly effective at increasing concerns about consequences. It
would be interesting to understand whether people place more weight on negative or positive
consequences. Future work could also address other types of consequence messaging, for example,
addressing risk perception in a broader range of settings.

     Notes: This table shows balance across treatments for demographics (age, gender and race), socioeconomic status (household
     income and highest level of education attained), order in which the scenarios were presented, numeracy and missing demographic
     data. The nal column displays the p-value from an F-test comparing all treatments. Of 1,808 respondents, 35 said they could
     not view vignette (2%), 6 are missing race data and 1 is missing age. We include missing dummies for age and race.

      Notes: This table shows treatment coecients from regressions of outcome variables on the written and video vignettes,
      as well as controls for age, gender, race, household income, education level, numeracy, recruitment wave and the order in
      which the scenarios were presented. Specication (1) uses whether or not the respondent was directionally accurate as
      the outcome. Specication (2) uses the raw dierence in recommended investment/claim age between the long life and
      short life scenarios as the outcome. Specication (3) uses the same measure, but controls for the baseline amount in the
      unhealthy scenario. Specications (4) and (5) use the percent correct on True/False questions and the dierence in likert
      scale valuation of consequence and non-consequence-related concerns respectively.

            This table shows treatment coecients from regressions of outcome variables on the written and video vignettes, as well
            as controls for age, gender, race, household income, education level, numeracy, recruitment wave and the order in which
            the scenarios were presented. We exclude all respondents who answered that they "could not view" the written or video
            vignette. Specication (1) uses whether or not the respondent was directionally accurate as the outcome. Specication (2)
            uses the raw dierence in recommended investment/claim age between the long life and short life scenarios as the outcome.
            Specication (3) uses the same measure, but controls for the baseline amount in the unhealthy scenario. Specications
            (4) and (5) use the percent correct on True/False questions and the dierence in likert scale valuation of consequence and
            non-consequence-related concerns respectively.

       Notes: This table shows coecients from regressions of outcome variables in the Social Security condition on the written and video
       vignettes, as well as controls for age, gender, race, household income, education level, numeracy, recruitment wave and the order in
       which the scenarios were presented. Specication (1) uses whether or not the respondent was directionally accurate as the outcome.
       Specication (2) uses the raw dierence in recommended claim age between the long life and short life scenarios as the outcome.
       Specication (3) uses the same measure, but controls for the baseline amount in the unhealthy scenario. Specications (4) and (5) use
       the percent correct on True/False questions and the dierence in likert scale valuation of consequence and non-consequence-related
       concerns respectively.

      Notes: This table shows treatment-interaction coecients from regressions of outcome variables in the annuities
      condition. Treatments are interacted with respondent nancial literacy score (continuous) and respondent's highest
      level of education (binary). In each case, the rst column uses whether or not the respondent was directionally
      accurate as the outcome. The second column uses the raw dierence in recommended investment between the long
      life and short life scenarios as the outcome. All regressions control for the written and video vignettes, as well as age,
      gender, race, household income, education level, numeracy, recruitment wave and the order in which the scenarios
      were presented.

(Link B1: Annuities Vignette: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AbXiHpXewU )

Bill is talking to his financial advisor in an office about how to spend down his savings in
retirement.

Financial advisor: Good to see you today. How can I help?

Bill: Well, I’ve just retired recently and started claiming my Social Security benefits, and now I
need to figure out how to budget my retirement savings.

Financial advisor: As a financial advisor, I can help you with that. It’s a tradeoff. You can decide
to spend down your retirement savings relatively quickly. In that case, you’ll be more likely to
enjoy your money while you’re alive. But you also run the risk of having to cut back on your
spending.

Bill: So, if I start spending relatively quickly and take all those vacation trips I’ve been wanting
to, then I run the risk of not having the money when I need it?

Financial advisor: That’s right. You could also decide to spend down your savings relatively
slowly. In that case, you’ll be less likely to run out of money. But then you run the risk of not
getting to enjoy all of your money while you’re alive.

Financial advisor: According to data from Social Security calculators, a man turning age 62
today can expect to live, on average, until he’s 82 years old. That’s about 20 years.

Financial advisor: The issue is, of course, we can’t know now whether you’ll live until 82 or
beyond - these are just averages.


                                                 19
Financial advisor: For example, if you think you’ll only live until you’re 80, you could spend
each more money each month, but then you would have to cut back on your spending if you live
past 80.

Bill: But if I don’t live to 80, I may not be able to enjoy all my savings.

Financial advisor: Or if you think you’ll live until you’re 90, you should spend less each month,
but again you’ll still have to cut back on your spending if you live past 90.

Bill: These are difficult decisions.

Financial advisor: The good news is that there are financial products that can help you reduce the
risk of running out of money during your lifetime. One thing I can suggest is an annuity.

Bill: Ugh, annuities! I’ve heard that annuities are so complicated, and if you die early, basically
you’re throwing your money away.

Financial advisor: That’s not entirely true. Annuities are like insurance against outliving your
money. You pay a premium up front, but then you’re guaranteed a monthly payment until you
die. That means if you live longer, you also get to spend more money.

Bill: That’s not such a bad deal … so I make a payment now, and in return, I get a stream of
income for life?

Financial advisor: Research shows that many people should consider annuitizing, but very few
actually do. That’s probably because of the misinformation floating around about annuities.

Bill: But if I buy an annuity, and I don’t live as long as I expected, I still run the risk of not
having a chance to spend most of my money before I die.

Financial advisor: That’s true. But you do not have to annuitize all of your savings. You could
annuitize half or even a quarter.

Bill: Ah, that’s interesting. I’ll think about it.

Financial advisor: Great, let’s talk again soon.

(Link B2: Social Security Vignette: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyOi27efL4Q )

Bill is talking to his financial advisor in an office about when to claim Social Security.

Financial advisor: Good to see you today. How can I help?

Bill: Well, I’ve been thinking about retiring soon, and I’m wondering what’s the best time to
actually claim my Social Security benefits.

Financial advisor: As a financial advisor, I can help you with that. Your retirement benefits
depend on the age when you begin claiming. It’s a tradeoff: you can decide to claim earlier. In
that case, you would have lower monthly benefits, but you’d also get to enjoy these benefits for a
longer period.

Bill: So if I claim sooner, I get less money per month?

Financial advisor: That’s right. You can also decide to claim later. In that case, you would get
higher monthly benefits, but you’d get to enjoy these benefits for a shorter period.

Bill: So I get more money per month, but I don’t get to enjoy it for as long a time. These are hard
decisions.

Financial advisor: According to data from Social Security calculators, a man turning age 62
today can expect to live, on average, until he is 82 years old. That’s about 20 years!

Financial advisor: The issue is, of course, we can’t know now whether you’ll live until 82 or
beyond – these are just averages.

Financial advisor: For example, if you think you’ll only live until you are 80, you could claim
sooner so you could enjoy these benefits for a longer period of time.

Bill: But the monthly payments will be lower.

Financial advisor: That’s right. Or if you think you’ll live until you are 90, you may want to
delay claiming so you could get higher monthly payments.

Bill: So, the benefits will be higher, but I don’t get to collect them for as long. These are hard
decisions.

Financial advisor: Let me tell you more. You can claim any time after age 62. But for every year
you delay, your benefits are increased by 5 to 8% each year.


                                                 21
In this example, suppose you want to claim at age 62 – the earliest you could claim – your
monthly benefit would be $750 a month. Or if you delay until 63, your benefits go up to $800 a
month. Your benefits continue to increase each year until you get to your maximum monthly
benefit of $1,320 at age 70. You can still claim after that, but your benefits won’t increase.




This is just an example based on retirement planning calculators available on ssa.gov and your
earnings may differ. View your Social Security statement or visit ssa.gov to learn about your
own benefits.


Bill: I understand that if I delay claiming I can get more money per month, but what if I just want
to retire now. I’m so tired of working, and I just want to enjoy my life.

Financial advisor: A little known fact is you do not have to start claiming the same year you
retire. You can retire, live off your retirement savings, and claim later if you want to.




                                                22
Financial advisor: For most people who have any retirement savings at all, delaying claiming
could make sense for them because the amount of interest you earn on your retirement savings is
lower than the amount of interest you get from Social Security just by postponing claiming.

Bill: Huh, I didn’t know that. I’ll think about it.

Financial advisor: Great, let’s talk again soon.
