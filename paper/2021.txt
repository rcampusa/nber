                       The Youth Labor Market in the 80s:
      Determinants of Re-Employment Probabilities for Young Men and Women




                                    ABSTRACT




       This paper presents an analysis of the determinants of re—employment

 probabilities for young workers in the U.S.    Using data from the new National
 Longitudinal Survey youth cohort a model is developed to analyze the transi-

tion probabilities from nonemployment
                                         to employment. The key factors examined
include personal characteristics,
                                     unemployment income, local demand conditions,
and   duration   dependence. There are significant differences between the labor

market experiences of whites and nonwhites, and males and females. High

school dropouts have many more difficulties in the labor market than those

who remain In school longer and/or
                                      receive other types of training. Local
demand conditions are a strong determinant of the duration of spells of

nonemployment and there appears to be strong evidence of negative duration

dependence in re—employment probabilities for both young males and young
females.

     Youth unemployment in the United States, as in most other developed
 countries, continues to be a challenging issue for policy-makers. For
 instance, figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found the overall

unemployment rate in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 1982 to be 10.7

percent. However, for young workers, age 16-19, the unemployment rate was
24.3 percent, compared with 16.2 percent in 1972. For black youths the
numbers were even bleaker; with 49 percent of black youths unemployed in
1982 compared with 33 percent in 1972. If one includes the number of
young workers who were out of the labor force but not in school or in the
military these percentages become much greater.

    Some argue that policy-makers should not be particularly concerned
about youth unemployment because it is simply part of a productive and
efficient job search process. In other words, time spent unemployed for
young people is time spent accumulating valuable information about the
labor market. However, periods of unemployment (or nonemployment) may
have long term employment consequences for two major reasons. First, the
loss of valuable work experience may make it more difficult for youths to
find employment. Labor theories such as human capital imply that since
substantial investment in human capital should occur in the early years of
work, early joblessness is particularly costly. If there is no investment
in human capital during periods of nonemployment the entire earnings
profile of the worker will be depressed.

    Perhaps more importantly, dual labor market theory suggests that early
nonemployment might lead to poor work habits, weak labor force attachment,
and general alienation from society. The joblessness experience itself
may alter the attitudes of unemployed youths if they become more
                                    —2—



discouraged about their chances of successfully finding work and this

spills over into their job search behavior. In addition, employers may
use employment records as a signal of potential productivity. In this
context even a one time shock which causes an increase in the level of
unemployment may have long term consequences on the equilibrium level of

unemployment.
    The youth labor market experience can be analyzed in a variety of

ways. One approach is to try to explain changes in youth unemployment
using time series data. Studies using these type of data by Feidstein
(1973), Wachter and Kim (1982) and Clark and Summers (1982) have

attempted to show how aggregate demand, relative wages, and demographic

changes have affected both cyclical and secular trends in youth
unemployment. One of the advantages of time series analysis is that it

is possible to assess the impact on aggregate youth unemployment of those
explanatory variables that government policies might have some impact

upon.
    Using survey data, both cross sectional and longitudinal1 it is
possible to explore a variety of issues that can not be properly
addressed with time series data. For example, studies by Meyer and Wise

 (1982), Rees and Gray (1982), Leighton and Mincer (1982), amd Clark and

Summers (1982), have investigated how factors such as educational
qualifications, family characteristics, turnover rates, employment
histories, race and sex affect the probability of being unemployed for

young workers in the U.S. These studies typically used data from the
 late 60's or mid 70's for their analyses.
     Besides analyzing the characteristics of the stock of unemployed

 young people, several studies have attempted to determine the factors
 influencing the duration of unemployment. Studies by EllwoOd (1982),
                                      —3—


 using data from the National Longitudinal
                                             Survey, NLS, young men's
 cohort, and Corcoran (1982), using the NLS young women's cohort, have
 attempted to investigate the "scarring effects" of lack of work
 experience in the years immediately following
                                                 school leaving in the late
 60's and early 70's. Both papers find some evidence that after
 controlling for individual differences, early unemployment results in
 worse future employment and earnings prospects.

     Moreover, the contributions of Stephenson (1976) and (1982), Heckman
 and Borjas (1980), Flinn and Heckman (1982a) and (1982b), Lynch (1985),
 and Wolpin (1984), have tried to link theoretical developments of search
 theory with data on either the duration of nonemploymnent or unemployment
 of young people. The studies by Stephenson, Heckman and Borjas, and

Flinn and Heckman analyzed data from the early years of the NLS young
men's and women's cohorts; thus their examinations of the youth labor
market focused on a period of relative
                                       economic prosperity. Utilizing
data from the new NLS youth cohort allows us to examine how the recession
of the early 1980's affected young workers and whether or not the

importance of certain parameters of interest has changed over time. In
particular, we shall investigate whether or not there is evidence of

state dependency in youth nonemployment, the role of personal

characteristics, unemployment income, and local demand conditions in
explaining the determinants of re-employment probabilities for young
workers.

    There are five major findings in this paper:
    (1)   There are significant differences in the labor market experience
of nonwhite compared to white youths and between males and females. The
expected completed duration of a spell of nonemployment for a "typical"

youth is slightly longer for males than for females.   This expected
                                      —4—



duration of nonemployment is twice as long for nonwhite males and five

times greater for nonwhite females.
    (2) Completed years of schooling and non-governmental training
significantly increase the probability of becoming re-employed.
    (3) Young males who are not working have fewer chances of
successfully transiting to employment as they get older. In other words,
the male youth employment problem does not appear to go away as young

males age.
    (4) Local demand conditions are a strong determinant of the duration

of spells of nonemployment.
    (5) There appears to be strong evidence of negative duration

dependence in re-employment probabilities for both young males and young

females.
    The theoretical model used here is briefly described in the next

section, followed in section two by a description of the data. In
section three we present our results and in section four we discuss the

problems associated with unobserved heterogeneity.   Finally, in section

five we summarize our major findings and discuss possible policy

implications.


I. The Model
    The theoretical framework we use for the following analysis is a

simple job search model such as that presented by Mortenson (1970) and

Lippman and McCall (1976). This model assumes that when a worker becomes
unemployed, the expected completed duration of his or her unemployment or
nonemployment spell (or inversely, the re-employment probability) will

depend upon two probabilities --   the probability of receiving a job offer
and the probability of then accepting the job offer. The probability of
                                            —5—



 receiving a job offer will be determined by personal characteristics such
 as education and training and local demand conditions which are typically

 proxied by the local unemployment rate. The probability that an

 unemployed individual will then actually accept a job offer will be
 determined by their "reservation" wage. This is the minimal acceptable
 wage which equates the marginal benefits of accepting a job offer with
 the marginal costs of rejecting that offer and continuing to search. An
 individual will reject all offers below this wage. Factors which will
determine this wage include variables such as the expected distribution
of wages, the costs of search, any unemployment income, and the

probability of receiving a job offer. The lower an individualts
qualifications the lower will be the potential wages available and

consequently the reservation wage will be lower. Higher unemployment
income will not alter the probability of receiving a job offer but it

will raise the reservation wage since the loss of earnings due to

unemployment becomes smaller. Finally, a low probability of receiving a
job offer will reduce the reservation wage since an unemployed individual
knows that if she or he rejects a job it may be a long time before
another offer is obtained.

    The re-employment probability, h(t), which is a function of the
variables described above, is also known as the hazard or failure rate in
renewal theory [1]. The hazard rate or re-employment probability can be
expressed in the following form:


         h(t)dt =   g(t)dt/(l   —   G(t))                                 (1)




where g(t)dt is the probability of accepting a job offer between time t
and t+dt, (1 -   G(t))   is the probability of not being employed at time t,
                                          —6—



and t is the duration of the current spell of nonemployment.
    If we integrate eq. (1) we obtain the survivor function:


         1 -   G(t)   =   exp[ -h(z)dz]                                  (2)




which implies the density function:


         g(t) =   h(t)exp[    -h(z)dzJ
                                                                         (3)




   Although we are using search theory to justify the inclusion of
particular variables in our estimation, we are not estimating a
structural model but instead a reduced form search model. This means
that we will observe the total effect of variables on the duration of

nonemployment rather than the separate effects on the reservation wage
and the probability of receiving a job offer. Since this type of
estimation does not give us any direct insight into the role of
reservation wages, our estimation cannot be viewed as a direct test of

search theory. Our estimation does have the advantage of not making any
specific distributional assumptions required in structural analyses. We
are reluctant to impose any additional assumptions than are already

necessary to study re-employment probabilities.
    It is possible to use equations (2) and (3) to develop an appropriate
likelihood for our data which will allow us to estimate the determinants
of re—employment probabilities for young workers. We use two types of
data for our study. The first data set is composed of the stock of young
workers in the NLS youth cohort not working at the 1982 interview date.
We can then update their labor history on a weekly basis through the 1983
interview and observe whether or not they have been successful in finding
                                                             —7—



employment during that interval. If they are successful, we can identify
the exact date of their re-employment. This implies that our likelihood
will contain observations on both completed and uncompleted spells of

nonemployment. The appropriate form for the likelihood given this type
of data is:


               NU                                       NE
           L=fl[1—G(t+h)]ll[gj(tj+sj)]
             i1 1 —        ]=1 1 —
                                 G1(t1   )                           Gj (ti)          (4)

where NU is the number of individuals still not working by the second
interview, t is the duration of joblessness at the first interview, h is
the number of weeks between the two interviews, NE is the number of
individuals who find a job by the second interview, and s is the exact
number of weeks after the first interview before becoming re-employed.
This form of the likelihood allows us to control for the length bias
problems associated with stock data.
    We also examine a smaller subsample which is composed of the inflow
into nonemployrnent at the 1982 interview date. Therefore, only those
individuals who are just entering the state of nonemployment from
employment are included in this group. The likelihood for this smaller
inflow sample is:


                NU                                      NE
           L = It            —                        ] II
               1=1
                     [   1       G
                                     1
                                       (t + h.1   )          [   gj (tj +   sj)   1   (5)
    In   order to operationalize this likelihood we need to select an
appropriate functional form for G. Since we have censored observations
(uncompleted spells of nonemployment by the second interview) we have
chosen two distributions, the Weibull and the Log-logistic, which are
convenient for censored data. We assume that the hazard or re-employment
probability can be decomposed as follows:
                                                         —8—



         h(t) =     1(X)iP2(t)                                               (6)




where we assume for both distributions that:


          1(X) = exp[X'B]                                                    (7)




X' is a vector of personal characteristics and local demand conditions.
    For the Weibull distribution the survivor function, 1 -    G(t)   is:


                                                 a
         1 —    G(t)       =   exp(—exp(X'B)t        )                       (8)
and for the Log-logistic distribution the survivor function is:


         1 —    G(t)           (1 + tctexp(XIB))                             (9)




Therefore, the hazard functions for the Weibull and the Log-logistic
distributions are respectively:


                       (   ct-i   )
         h(t)    =ct t                exp(X'B)                              (10)


                   (a-i)                          —1
         h(t) =ct t      exp(X'B) (1 + t exp(X'B))                          (11)



   The Weibull hazard is monotone decreasing if ct<1, monotone increasing

if a>1, and constant if a =1 (this is also the exponential hazard). In
other words, if the hazard is constant then differences in duration

spells will only be determined by personal characteristics, local demand
conditions and other determinants of the reservation wage and the
probability of receiving a job offer. If the hazard is decreasing
(increasing) then, ceteris paribus, the subsequent expected duration of a
                                      —9—



 spell of nonemployment will be larger(smaller) the longer the individual
 is not working. Job search theory predicts that as the spell of
 unemployment lengthens the reservation wage will fall, implying an

 increasing hazard (positive duration dependence). On the other hand, if
 employers use employment records as a signal of potential Productivity
 then the hazard will be decreasing (negative duration dependence) .   The
 hazard may also decline if the experience of not being employed causes

greater discouragement amongst those youths who experience longer periods
of nonemployment.

    The Log-logistic hazard is identical to the Weibull hazard apart
from the term appearing in the denominator. It is monotone decreasing
jf °<l and if a >1 it resembles the log-normal hazard in that it increases

to a single maximum and then decreases towards zero thereafter. This
formulation allows us to see whether or not there may actually be a

period of positive duration dependence followed by negative duration
dependence.


II. The Data

    For our analysis we have chosen to examine the determinants of the
duration of periods of nonemployment for youths in the National

Longitudinal Survey, NLS, youth cohort. The NLS youth cohort is a sample
of 12,686 males and females who were 14 to 21 years of age at the end of

1978. They were first interviewed in 1979 and have been interviewed
every year since about their education, jobs, military service, training

programs, marriage, health, and attitudes. The response rate in 1985 was
over 95 percent of the group originally interviewed. We have restricted
our sample to those youths who were not employed at the 1982 interview
but were not in school or in the military. In addition, we have required
                                   —10—



that the individual's date of last enrollment in school was before the
starting date of their last job and that they did not return to school in

the year following the 1982 interview. All of the youths in our sample
have been employed immediately before their current spell of
joblessness. We chose this selection criteria so that we would restrict

our analysis to the experience of young workers who appear to have
entered the labor market "permanently". We did not wish to model the

transition from school to first job or to include in our study those
youths who only entered the labor market during the summer between school
sessions. Using the 1983 interview we were able to determine whether or

not youths not working at the 1982 interview obtained a job during the
following year. For those who were successful in finding employment we

know the completed spell length of their period of nonemployment. For
those still not working by the 1983 interview, we observed an

"uncompleted" spell length. Approximately eighty percent of the males
and sixty-three percent of the females have completed their spell of
nonernployment by the 1983 interview. We concentrated initially on
transitions from nonemployment to employment because of the difficulty

with the NLS data of identifying the exact sequence of weeks spent
unemployed or out of the labor force. There is evidence, however, (Gonul
(1985)) for youths and in particular for young males, that there is
little difference between weeks spent "unemployed" and "out of the labor

force."
    Table 1 presents some selected unweighted characteristics of the
sample we have examined. The weighted characteristics are almost
identical with the exception of nonwhites. The NLS has deliberatly
over-sampled nonwhites so that while nonwhites represent 34% of our total

sample they are only 20% of the weighted sample. There are some major
                                    —11—



 differences between the males and females in our sample.   Perhaps the
 most striking difference is the much higher percentage of females who are
 married and not living at home. Males are more likely to be on layoff
 than females and to have earned on average higher wages in their last

 job. Females are earning hourly wages very close to the minimum wage
while the average hourly wage for males is over $4.00. Given these
differences between males and females we have analyzed these two groups
separately.

    It is sometimes argued that the U.S. youth. labor market is

characterized by the majority of young people going in and out of work
quite frequently and experiencing relatively short spells of
joblessness. However, as the frequency distribution presented in Table 2
indicates, this is probably not an accurate description of the labor
market experience of all of our sample. In Table 2 only eighteen percent
of the males and fourteen percent of the females have spells of

nonemployment less than three months. Over a third of the males and over
fifty-five percent of the females have spells of nonemployment greater
than fifty—two weeks.

    Our theoretical model implies that the re-employment probability,

h(t), is determined by the probability of receiving a job offer and the
probability of then accepting that job offer. Given the distribution of
wages, the factors which will be the most likely to influence the

probability of receiving a job offer are local demand conditions (proxied
here by the local unemployment rate) and personal characteristics. We
expect that nonwhites might experience longer durations of joblessness,
especially if they are being discriminated against in the labor market.
Other variables which might determine the probability of receiving a job
offer include human capital variables such as whether or not the
                                   —12—



individual had any training (vocational, technical, other skills, or
governmental training programs) and the completed number of years of

schooling. If an individual is on temporary lay-off, we would also
expect that their duration of noriemployment would be shorter. Other
variables we have used include whether or not the individual lives in an

SMSA (the "inner City" problem), whether or not they are healthy, whether
or not they live at home (a proxy for search intensity or parental
pressure to get a job), age, whether or not they are married, and the

length of the last spell of nonemployment.
    All of the above variables may also affect the reservation wage. A
variable which is assumed to have a direct affect upon the reservation

wage but not on the probability of receiving a job offer is unemployment
income. Unemployment income subsidizes job search so that the more
unemployment income an individual receives the higher the reservation
wage, ceteris paribus. In our analysis we use the average amount of
unemployment compensation the respondent receives while unemployed. As
shown in Table 1 many of the respondents do not receive unemployment
compensation primarily because they are not eligible for it but also

because they often do not claim it even when eligible.
    In previous studies researchers have included the ratio of

unemployment income to expected earnings. This "replacement ratio" has
no specific justification within a job search framework so we include the
two variables separately in our estimation. To proxy for expected
earnings we use a predicted earnings variable obtained from an earnings
equation estimated for all employed youths in the cohort at the 1983
interview. As Nickell (1979) has noted, it is more appropriate to use a

fitted value from an earnings equation than any actual level of income,

which will be endogenous. However, there are still problems of
                                   —13—



endogeneity even with this measure so we also present results of a true
reduced form model where we do not include expected earnings. [2]


II. The Results
    Tables 3 and 4 present our findings [3] on the determinants of

re-employment probabilities for young males and females. Equation 1
estimates the Weibull hazard without any explanatory variables to

establish "starting" values for alpha and the log likelihood. Alpha
indicates not only whether or not the hazard is increasing, decreasing,
or constant but it is also a measure of misspecification since it can be

shown that the inclusion of significant variables will raise the value of
alpha. Equations 1, 2, and 3 assume a Weibull distribution for the
hazard while equation 4 assumes the Log-logistic distribution. This
allows us to examine the sensitivity of the parameter estimates to the
somewhat arbitrary distributional assumptions which we have made.
    Personal characteristics which lower the re-employment probability
for both males and females include being nonwhite, having completed fewer

years of school, and poor health. For females, being married decreases
their re-employment probability, while receiving some form of vocational
or technical training, or being on layoff, significantly raises their
re-employment probability. It is interesting to observe the positive
effects of training for females and none for males even though Table 1
shows that the average amount of technical, vocational and other skills
training is about the same across the two groups.

   Another personal characteristic that is important for males is age.
Usually when discussing how to solve the problem of young workers there
is the easy "solution" of just waiting for them to get older. However,
for young males in our sample their re-employment probability actually
                                  —14—



declines as they age. This is similar to findings presented in Ballen

and Freeman (1983)
    Local demand conditions seem to be critical for both males and

females regardless of distributional assumptions. This implies that
these youths are not simply sampling a variety of jobs and experiencing
short spells of joblessness between "samples". They appear to be
constrained by the probability of receiving a job offer. This is also
consistent with Holzer's (1986) findings (using data from the 1981 NLS
youth cohort survey) that very few of those who are unemployed turn down

job offers.
    We find in all of our equations that neither the expected wage or
unemployment income are significantly different from zero. Given the

small percentage of our sample that actually receives any form of
unemployment income this result is perhaps not so unexpected.
    In all of the equations presented we can not reject the hypothesis
that the hazard is declining and it is declining even faster for the
females than for the males. In the Log—logistic model for males, alpha
equals 1.06 suggesting that the hazard first increases and then
decreases. However, given the standard error we are not able to reject

the hypothesis that alpha equals one and in the Log-logistic case this
implies a declining hazard. This suggests that f or both males and

females the probability of becoming re-employed, ceteris paribus declines
with the duration of a spell of nonemployment, contrary to what our

simple job search model would predict.
    We repeated our analysis on a more homogeneous subsample of youths
composed of those with only twelve years or less of completed schooling.
These results are presented in Appendix A. The results are virtually

identical to what we found for the larger sample except that we also
                                       —15—



 observed evidence of lagged duration dependence. For this group of
 youths not only does the present duration of their spell of nonernployment

 decrease their re-employment probability but also the length of their
 most recent past spell of joblessness (always excluding time spent in

 school). This subsample typically has been in the labor force for a
 longer period of time than our original sample.

     In an attempt to see how sensitive our parameter estimates are to the

 distributional assumptions we made about the hazards, we estimated both
Weibull and Log-logistic hazards. While most of the coefficients are

virtually identical (after dividing them by the value of alpha) this is
not the case for the layoff coefficient in the male and female equations
and the SMSA coefficient in the male equation.     Being on layoff
dramatically raises the probability of becoming re-employed in the
Log—logistic specification compared with the Weibull specification for
both males and females.

    Since the coefficients presented in Tables 3 and4 are not
particularly intuitive we calculated the expected completed duration of a
spell of nonemployinent for different types of individuals using the
coefficients from equations 3 in Tables 3 and 4.    Integrating the Weibull
survivor function, equation 8, we obtained the expression for the
expected completed duration of a spell of nonemployrnent;


         E(T)   F (1/a +   l)exp(—(x'B)/a)                              (12)



    A "typical" male is white, is 21 years old in 1982, has completed 11

years of school, is unmarried, lives in an SMSA with an 11 percent
unemployment rate, is healthy, lives at home with his parents, has no
formal job training, is not on layoff, and has had a past spell of
                                   —16—



nonemployment of 15 weeks. The expected completed duration of
joblessness for this typical male is 7.2 weeks. If we make this male
nonwhite his expected spell length increases to 14.1 weeks. If instead
he lives in an SMSA with a 20 percent unemployment rate his spell
increases from 7.2 weeks to 19 weeks. Finally, if this male is "typical"

but he has finished college his expected completed duration is only 2.6

weeks.
    If we repeat this exercise for females (the same characteristics as

for males except that completed years of school equals 12 and the length
of the past spell of nonemployment equals 18 weeks) we find that the
expected completed duration of joblessness for a typical female is only
5.4 weeks. However, if we make this female nonwhite her spell length
increases dramatically to 24 weeks. If instead she lives in an SMSA with

a 20 percent unemployment rate her spell length increases from 5.4 weeks
to 17.8 weeks. If she has completed college her expected spell is only
1.2 weeks or if she has taken some sort of vocational, technical or other

skills training her expected spell length is only 2.6 weeks. Finally, if

she has all of the "typical" characteristics except that she is married
and is not living at home with her parents her expected completed
duration of nonemployment increases to 20.3 weeks.   This last finding

highlights an important difference between the males and females in our
sample. Even though these individuals are relatively young there is
already some evidence that non—labor market activities of young females

alters their labor market experience from that of males.
    To see how the current length of nonemployrnent affects the
probability of becoming re—employed we can see how the re—employment
probability, equation 10, declines for a "typical" respondent with the

number of weeks nonemployed. The re-employment probability for either a
                                    —17—



 "typical" male or female who has not been working for one week is

 slightly greater than 30 percent. If they have not been working for
eight weeks this drops to 8 percent and if they have not been employed
for fifty two weeks their re-employment probability is only 2 percent.


IV. Unobserved Heterogeneity

    Before concluding that there is negative duration dependence in the

transition probability from nonemployment to employment we must discuss
the possibility that our parameter estimates may be biased due to the

omission of unobserved variables such as motivation. As is well known
this may lead to spurious negative duration dependence.   Equation 1 in
Tables 3 and 4 presents estimates of alpha excluding all the explanatory
variables for males and females. Including a wide range of observable

factors increases the estimate of alpha from .32 to .37 for the riales and
from .2 to .3 for the females. It is hard to imagine how any unobserved

heterogeneity that remains in our sample will have an effect large enough

on alpha to raise it significantly over one given that including a wide
range of significant observable variables does not alter its value very
much. Nevertheless in this section we present some additional attempts
to take into account the impact of unobserved heterogeneity on our
parameter estimates.

    As discussed in Cox and Oakes (1984) misspecification of the baseline

distribution of the hazard may or may not have a significant effect on
the estimates of the coefficients of the explanatory variables. However

the standard errors on these coefficients will be too low(high) if the
dispersion of the baseline distribution is more(less) than that
specified. Therefore we estimated Cox's (1972) proportional hazard

model. This model is nonparametrjc or semi—parametric in the sense that
                                           —18—



it involves an unspecified function in the form of an arbitrary base—line
hazard function. This proportional hazards model is specified as:


            h(t;X) =   h0(t)exp(X'.B)                                        (13)



where h 0(t) is an arbitrary and unspecified base-line hazard function.
The model is "distribution free" since the estimates of the B's depend

only on the rank ordering of the dependent variable vector and are
invariant with respect to monotonic transformations on the dependent

variable.     (See Kalbfleisch and Prentice (1980) and Cox and Oakes (1984)

for a more detailed discussion) .       While using this method means that we
will not be able to say anything about state dependency in youth
nonemployment it does allow us to examine the robustness of the estimates

of other parameters of interest.
    No intercept parameter is estimated for the proportional hazards
model since the likelihood is invariant with respect to translations of
any of the independent variables. The likelihood we use for this
estimation allows us to have censored and tied data, however, it does not

allow us to condition on length of nonemployment at the first interview
date. Therefore, we restrict our analysis to a sample of youths who were
just entering the state of joblessness from employment at the 1982
interview date. Our findings on this reduced sample are presented in
Appendix B where we first estimate the Weibull hazard specifying the
likelihood in the form of equation (5) and then estimate Cox's

proportional hazard with       Breslow's    (1974) modification for tied data.

Comparing results in Tables 6 and 7 indicates that while the coefficients
obtained using Cox's proportional hazard model are somewhat smaller than

those obtained assuming a Weibull distribution, they do not appear to be
                                                   —19—



  sig1ificant1y different.

     A major disadvantage of this method given the nature of our data
                                                                      is
 the substantially reduced sample size. Another approach is to
                                                                follow the
 suggestions of Heckman and Singer (1984) and control for unobserved

 heterogeneity in a nonparametrjc way. Assume that we have a Population
 divided into J homogeneous groups. The hazard then for individual i
                                                                     with
 measured covariates Xi in group j is:


          h.(t) ct
            1]
                             (a —1)
                                      exp(XB
                                           1 +A)
                                               J                                        (14)

 The survivor function associated with this hazard is:

                              J
          1 —    G(t)    =        p. [exp(—exp(x'B +      A.)a]
                                                          J                             (15)
                             j=1


 and the density is:


                                   (a—i)                                        a
          g(t) =         p [at
                   j=1
                                           exp(x'B + A. ) (exp(—exp(x's +
                                                      J
                                                                            A) t
                                                                            J
                                                                                    H   (16)



    The number of groups, J, is unknown so we began with J=1 and
incremented until the likelihood failed to show a significant

improvement. The results presented in Tables 3 and 4 are equivalent to
the case of J=1. We then assumed the existence of two mass points (J=2)
and we estimated the appropriate likelihood function obtained by

substituting equations 15 and 16 into equation 4. There was no
significant improvement in the value of the likelihood and all of the
parameter estimates were virtually identical to those obtained with J=1
for both males and females. The estimate of p was either at or near the

upper or lower bound of p, and A1 and A2 were identical. [5]
                                   —20—



Unfortunately, even this approach does not guarantee that there is no

problem of unobserved heterogeneity. As Trussell and Richards (1986)
have shown, even with this type of nonparametric representation of
heterogeneity, results can still be sensitive to the choice of the

hazard. However, apart from creating a truly nonparametric estimator all
we can do is try a variety of approaches and observe what happens to our
estimates. In our case the fundamental finding is that the results
presented in section 3 are quite robust even when the heterogeneity
problem is accounted for. This probably reflects the relatively greater
homogeneity of our sample compared with the composition of other samples

where some of these approaches have been applied.


V. Conclusions
    In the previous sections we have tried to identify significant
factors which affect the length of joblessness for youths. We have
grouped together time spent out of the labor force (but not in school or

in military service) with time spent unemployed (and actively searching
for employment on a weekly basis) and redefined this as nonemployment
time. We have then attempted to determine the factors which will affect

the probability of successfully becoming re-employed for young workers
using data on their employment histories during the severe recessionary
period of the early 1980's.
    The re-employment probability for both young males and females in our
sample is significantly reduced if the individual is nonwhite even after

controlling for a wide range of other characteristics. In spite of
affirmative action legislation nonwhites still seem to be experiencing

much more difficulty than their white counterparts in the labor market.
                                   —21—



Our results may still underestimate the "true" racial diferences among

young workers since we have conditioned our estimation on having been

employed before becoming nonemployed. Ballen and Freeman (1983) show
that many black youths never even find that first job.

    Local demand conditions play an important role for both males and
females. Being in a depressed area more than doubles the expected
duration of nonemployment for males and more than triples the spell
length for females. This suggests that youth unemployment should
significantly decline as the economy improves.

    Investments in human capital are important determinants of the
probability of transiting from nonemployment to employment. There are
high returns to having completed college for both the males and females.
Unfortunately, in our sample, 40 percent of the females have not even
completed high school with only 16 percent of them less than 19 years
old. Fifty two percent of the males have not completed high school with
only 18 percent of them under 19 years of age. There seems to be an
increasing trend for youths in the U.S. not to complete high school which
appears inconsistent with the demands of the new high tech growth areas
of our economy.

    Training in the form of vocational, technical or other skills

training significantly increases the re-employment probability of
females. This. variable does not seem to affect males even though the
same percentage of males and females have had this type of training.

Training obtained in some sort of government program does not seem to be
very effective in improving the chances of these youths to become

employed.
   There appear to be significant differences in the labor market
experience of male and female workers. There is evidence that the non
                                   —22—



labor market activities of females alters their labor   market   experience.

In particular, as soon as females become married their nonemployment
spells significantly lengthen. Even when employed there still appears to
be substantial labor market segregation with only 15 percent of the
females in our sample employed in manual work in their last job while

over 57 percent of the males were manual workers in their last job.
    Perhaps as important as the variables that are significant are those

that are not. In particular, unemployment compensation is never a
significant explanatory vaLiable in any of our equations. We would not

expect, therefore, that cuts in unemployment compensation would be an
effective tool to shorten the length of unemployment spells for young

workers.
    Finally, there is strong evidence of negative duration dependence in
re-employment probabilities of young workers. This implies that as the

spell length of nonernployment increases the probability of becoming
re-employed declines sharply for the youths in our sample. This may be

the result of employer's using the length of a youth's spell of
nonemployrnent as a signal of some undesirable but unobservable

characteristic or youths becoming more discouraged as their spell length
increases. This suggests that for many youths in the U.S. today their
nonemployment experience is not part of a productive job search process
where they are incurring short spells of joblessness in order to find

better employment.
