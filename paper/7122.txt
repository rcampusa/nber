Introduction

       The age at which successful practitioners typically do their best work is known to vary

across professions. Studies by psychologists have shown that mathematicians, physicists, and

poets typically make their most important contributions at younger ages than do astronomers,

biologists, and novelists.1 Psychologists consider these differences to be a function of the rates at

which creative ideations can be produced and elaborated: they believe that both of these processes

are more rapid in disciplines that deal with abstract conceptual entities than in those whose central

ideas are more complex and concrete.2 The psychologists’ empirical studies have been based on

the assumption that the typical peak age for creativity in a profession is invariant over time, or

changes only gradually.3 Yet economists have pointed to a variety of factors that can potentially

produce rapid changes in the relationship between age and productivity in a given activity.4 This

paper presents a case study of a profession in which a change in the criteria for quality produced a

dramatic change in the age at which successful practitioners executed their best work.

       The profession considered here is modern American painting. We use the records of

paintings sold at auctions since 1980 to estimate the relationship between artists’ ages and the

value of their work for two successive birth cohorts of successful modern artists. The particular

artists studied include the most important American painters born in the first 40 years of this

century. Our argument is that a shift in the nature of the demand for fine art occurred during the

early 1950s, and that this shift produced a decline in the age at which successful contemporary

painters typically produced their best work. The timing of the shift leads us to divide the artists

studied into those born during 1900-20, who entered the profession before the shift occurred, and

those born during 1921-40, who entered the profession during or after the shift in demand. This
                                                  4

shift occurred in the American market, so the sample of artists to be studied consists of painters

born in these periods who worked in the US. Since our interest is in successful artists, the sample

was defined to be all such painters of sufficient stature to have had at least one painting

reproduced in three or more of six leading surveys of art history. 5 These artists are listed in Table

1.

       The sample itself is of some interest, for there are several clear contrasts between the two

birth cohorts. One is the difference in size, as the second contains more than twice as many

painters as the first. Another concerns the degree of heterogeneity: whereas ten of the fifteen

painters of the first cohort are identified with a single type of painting, Abstract Expressionism,

the second cohort contains members of many different movements, including Color-field Painting,

Op Art, Pop Art, Minimal Art, Conceptual Art, and others. Both of these differences - the

increasing number of successful American artists, and their increasing stylistic diversity - may be

results of the increase in the demand for contemporary American art that is the central change

driving the hypothesis to be considered in this paper.



Changes in Artists’ Careers: A Hypothesis

       As noted above, the earlier of the two cohorts of artists considered here is dominated by

the Abstract Expressionists. This was an informal group that originated in New York during the

1930s, when most of its members were employed by the WPA. These artists entered a profession

in which there was little immediate demand for their work. Few galleries sold the work of

American painters during the 1920s, and this changed little during the Depression and World War

II. One of the Abstract Expressionists, Adolph Gottlieb, later recalled that “By the age of 18 [in
                                                  5

1921], I clearly understood that the artist in our society can not expect to make a living from

art.”6 These artists were nonetheless committed to their profession, and their development was

greatly affected by the arrival of a number of leading European modern artists in New York

during World War II. One of the most prominent of the Americans, Jackson Pollock, stated in

1944: “I accept the fact that the important painting of the last hundred years was done in France

... Thus the fact that good European moderns are now here is very important, for they bring with

them an understanding of the problems of modern painting.”7

       During the late 1940s, Pollock and his colleagues blended the approach of the European

Surrealists with a variety of American influences to develop a genuinely new art. In a famous

essay, the critic Harold Rosenberg described this new art as “action painting”: “What was to go

on the canvas was not a picture but an event. The painter no longer approached his easel with an

image in his mind; he went up to it with material in his hand to do something to that other piece of

material in front of him. The image would be the result of this encounter.”8 Abstract

Expressionism was an art in which the touch of the individual painter was central. From both

American and European teachers, the Abstract Expressionists had learned the skills of the modern

artists who had proceeded them, and had found them inadequate for their purposes. Believing -

in Pollock’s words - that “new needs need new techniques,” they experimented with new kinds of

paint, new ways of applying paint to canvas, new surface textures, new all-over compositions, and

new visual images.9 Although these artists came to be considered as a group - by themselves as

well as by critics - they had little in common except their dissatisfaction with existing methods of

painting.10 The work of each came to be known for a distinctive idiom, made up of particular

expressive gestures and visual effects that recurred throughout his paintings.
                                                  6

       By 1950 the Abstract Expressionists, the youngest of whom was 35, had all gone through

an extended period of experimentation in developing their personal styles. They had done this in

the absence of any significant demand for their work: thus in 1949 their most eloquent advocate,

the critic Clement Greenberg, bemoaned the fact that “these individuals must still waste valuable

energy in the effort to survive as working artists in the face of a public whose indifference

consigns them to neglect and poverty,” and complained that “it remains as difficult as ever for a

young American painter or sculptor working in an advanced mode to win real attention in New

York.”11 This situation changed greatly during the ‘50s. The persuasive essays of Greenberg

began to have an impact, and the demand for the work of Pollock and others began to grow.12

The small number of pioneering galleries devoted to selling contemporary American art also

began to grow.13 When young artists of the second cohort considered here arrived in New York

to become professional painters, they consequently found a very different situation than had their

predecessors. As William Rubin, director of the Museum of Modern Art, later wrote, “By 1958,

when [Frank] Stella came to New York, the art-buying public had become convinced that

Americans could produce major painting, worthy of comparison with the best of earlier European

modern art. And it was now clear that this work could be sold at prices that made an artists’s

profession economically feasible.”14

       Greenberg’s promotion and the increasing number of outlets for American paintings did

not simply increase the demand for contemporary art; they also changed the nature of that

demand. The Abstract Expressionists strongly believed that the importance of their art lay in its

subject matter. Although their work was non-representational, they insisted that the purpose of

their imagery was to communicate ideas and feelings. Thus for example in 1943 Adolph Gottlieb,
                                                   7

and Mark Rothko jointly declared: “There is no such thing as good painting about nothing. We

assert that the subject is crucial.”15 Yet Greenberg disagreed. He dismissed the “symbolical or

`metaphysical’ content” of the Abstract Expressionists’ work as “half-baked.”16 In his view their

contribution lay entirely in the formal properties of their paintings, in their innovative use of “line,

color, and form,” without reference to subject matter.17

        Greenberg’s formalist approach had little effect on Pollock and his contemporaries, who

were already mature artists when Greenberg began to write about their work, but it had a great

impact on their successors. Young artists impressed by Greenberg’s analysis of the success of the

new American painting came to “conceive of stylistic change in terms of the decisions of

individual artists to engage with particular formal problems thrown up by the art of the recent

past,” in the words of Michael Fried, a young critic and disciple of Greenberg, in 1965.18 A critic

who disapproved of Greenberg’s approach remarked in 1968 on the pervasiveness of its influence,

“how often recent American Abstract painting is defined and described almost exclusively in terms

of internal problem-solving. As though the strength of a particular artist expressed itself only in

his choice to conform with a set of existent professional needs and his inventiveness in producing

the answers.” The critic, Leo Steinberg, complained that “The dominant formalist critics today

tend to treat modern painting as an evolving technology wherein at any one moment specific tasks

require solution ... The artist as engineer and research technician becomes important insofar as he

comes up with solutions to the right problem.”19

        Henry Geldzahler, appointed in 1966 as the first curator of contemporary art at New

York’s Metropolitan Museum, argued that growing attention from the media and the increasing

importance of the gallery system also contributed to an increased demand for innovation in
                                                  8

painting. National magazines began to take note of the rise of Abstract Expressionism at the end

of the 1940s, and their new interest in American painting meant that their “concern for

immediacy” focused attention exclusively on the “novel moments” in artists’ careers. Galleries

would hold shows of the work of each of their associated artists at regular intervals, and dealers,

faced with “an audience overeager to spot trends, rising reputations, and falls from favor,” wanted

to assure that audience that their current shows contained new and improved work.20 In view of

the importance of innovation, Geldzahler compared the recent development of modern art to “a

group research project, the way pure mathematics might be.”21

       The impact of Greenberg’s criticism and of the expanding gallery system produced a new

regime in modern American art. In 1968 Greenberg himself surveyed the results, and concluded

that “Until the middle of the last century innovation in Western art had not had to be startling or

upsetting; since then ... it has had to be that. And now in the 60s it is as though everybody had

finally ... caught on not only to the necessity of innovation, but also to the necessity - or seeming

necessity - of advertising innovation by making it startling and spectacular.” Producing

conspicuous innovations had become a preoccupation: “Today everybody innovates.

Deliberately, methodically. And the innovations are deliberately and methodically made

startling.”22 Similarly, Geldzahler recalled “in the late 1950s being shocked to hear painters, who

believed in the primacy of de Kooning’s position and who admired him, wondering aloud whether

next year’s show would repeat his success, whether he could consolidate his lead not by painting a

beautiful show but by changing in an unexpected and unpredictable way.” Geldzahler believed

that younger artists understood how to respond to the pressure of the demand for innovation

because they had learned from the experience of their elders: “the younger generation has had the
                                                      9

example of the successful Abstract Expressionists before them and are much less vulnerable than

were the artists in the fifties, the first to sit on this particular griddle.”23

        The growing demand for innovations changed the nature of modern art. Whereas

Abstract Expressionism had developed gradually through trial-and-error experimentation, the

trademark touch of its practitioners was now replaced by a conceptual approach that valued new

ideas above technique. Among the most successful members of the later cohort was Frank Stella.

Michael Fried, a college friend, later recalled that when he and Stella were students at Princeton,

“Greenberg was the only art critic we valued and wanted to read.”24 In 1960, two years after

graduating from college, Stella had a one-man show at one of New York’s leading galleries.

Fried described these paintings, “in which parallel stripes of black paint, each roughly 2 ½ inches

wide, echo and reecho the rectangular shape of the picture support until the entire canvas is

filled,” as “a significant advance on the work of the Cubists or even Mondrian,” because they

embodied “more consistent solutions to a particular formal problem.”25 Stella insisted that his

work had no symbolic meaning: dismissing “people who want to retain the old values in painting -

the humanistic values that they always find on the canvas,” he stated that “My painting is based on

the fact that only what can be seen there is there ... What you see is what you see.”26

        Some artists of the later cohort devised new methods of producing art that avoided any

possibility of the visible gestures that characterized Abstract Expressionism. In 1967, Sol LeWitt

declared that “In conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work ...

[A]ll of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair.

The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.” LeWitt observed “This kind of art ... is usually

free from the dependence on the skill of the artist as a craftsman.” In LeWitt’s case, this freedom
                                                 10

was often accomplished by having his work executed by someone else. Of his trademark wall

drawings, he wrote: “The artist conceives and plans the wall drawing. It is realized by

draftsmen.”27 LeWitt made no stipulation that the artist must approve the executed drawing, and

he often does not see the completed works done from his plans. The Pop artist Andy Warhol’s

paintings were made by applying images to canvas through a silk screen. “The silk-screens are

made from photographs taken by someone else, and the screening is often done by someone else

in Warhol’s factory, so that the artist’s part can be isolated as the choice of images and the

decision to repeat the image and perhaps to magnify it.”28 The procedure was a direct

consequence of Warhol’s philosophy: “The reason I’m painting this way is that I want to be a

machine.”29 Another successful Pop painter of the ‘60s, Roy Lichtenstein, did execute his

paintings by hand, but in such a way that it would appear otherwise: “I want my painting to look

as if it had been programmed. I want to hide the record of my hand.”30

       For these and other artists in the second cohort, the ideas represented by their work

became the work’s focal point: as one critic wrote of LeWitt, their procedures “made the initial

intention more important than the execution.”31 The deemphasis of craftsmanship, and the

growing role of conceptual innovation, made painting progressively less like the disciplines

described by the psychologists as concrete, and more like those they consider to be abstract:

whereas the achievements of the Abstract Expressionists rested on techniques developed over

extended periods, the most celebrated accomplishments of the later cohort were primarily

ideational, with technique relegated to a minor role, if any. An implication of this change is that

for producing work of high quality, the value of experience in the profession should have been

reduced, as painting should have become one of the disciplines in which significant contributions
                                                 11

are typically made by the young.32 This analysis of the American market for contemporary art

therefore leads to the prediction that successful artists coming of age in the 1950s and ‘60s - those

of the second cohort considered here - should have executed their best work at ages younger than

those at which members of the first cohort had produced theirs. This is the hypothesis to be

tested below.



Data and Econometric Analysis

       The data analyzed in this paper are drawn from auctions held during 1980-96. The source

of these data is the annual editions of Le Guide Mayer, which complies the results of fine art

auctions held all over the world.33 Mayer classifies the works sold into five groups: prints,

drawings, watercolors, paintings, and sculptures. This study collected the records of all sales of

paintings and watercolors by the 51 artists listed in Table 1 from the 17 annual editions of Mayer

for auctions held during 1980-96. This yielded a total of 4,395 sales of individual works. Most of

these sales occurred in the United States, and nearly 90% were sold by the two leading auction

houses, Sotheby’s and Christie’s. For each painting in the data set, the coding for this study

recorded the support (paper or canvas), size, date of execution, date sold, and sale price.34

       Table 1 presents summary statistics for these data. Just over one quarter of the paintings -

1,109 - were done by artists born during 1900-20, while 3,286 were painted by artists born during

1921-40. The mean age of the artists of the first cohort when their paintings were produced was

51, while the mean for the second cohort was 42. The youngest age observed in the sample is for

Jackson Pollock, who was 19 when he produced a painting included here, while the oldest, of 79,

is for Agnes Martin. Works by members of the first cohort sold on average for twice as much as
                                                       12

those by the second cohort - $230,000 for the first cohort as opposed to $115,000 for the second

(in 1983 dollars).

        Our interest is in comparing across cohorts the relationship between the price of a painting

and the artist’s age at the date of its execution. We do this by estimating a regression in which the

price of a painting is expressed as a polynomial in the age of the artist, interacted with whether the

artist was born after 1920. A number of other variables are also included in the regression. In

view of the large differences in the value of works by different artists, we include fixed effects for

individual artists. There were substantial fluctuations in the art market during the years from

which our data are drawn, so our regressions include binary variables for the year of sale. A

binary independent variable was included to indicate whether a work was done on paper or

canvas, and the size of the work was controlled using the natural logarithm of the surface area.



        Formally, our specification is given by

        ln(Price)ij = $1 Pre i Age ij + $2 Pre i Age ij2 + $3 Pre i Age ij3 + $4 Pre i Age ij4

                +(1 Post i Age ij + (2 Post i Age ij2 + (3 Post i Age ij3 + (3 Post i Age ij4

                +N1 Paperij + N ij ln(Area)ij + E    51
                                                      k=1    Rk I (i=k)

                 +E   96
                       y=80   2y I (Saleyear ij = y) + gij

where Ageij denotes the age of artist i when his jth painting was executed; Prei is a binary

variable equal to 1 if the artist was born during 1900-20; Posti is a binary variable equal to 1 if the

artist was born during 1921-40; Rk denotes a set of dummy variables for individual artists [(I(i=k)

is an indicator function equal to 1 if i=k]; and I (Saleyearij = y) is an indicator function equal to 1

if painting ij was sold in year y.
                                                   13

        Several remarks are in order. First, the results presented below are based on a fourth-

degree polynomial in the artist’s age. The choice of degree was based on a test for the

significance of higher-order terms.35 The results are similar, however, when the age-price profiles

are estimated using either a third - or fifth-order polynomial. Second, to account for differences

in the variability of different artists’ sale prices, each artist’s paintings are weighted by the inverse

of the mean square error for that artist. The number of observations varies across artists.

Treating each painting as an observation implicitly weights artists with more sales more heavily

than those with fewer sales.36 Third, the model presented above does not include controls for the

year a painting was produced. To allow for the possibility of vintage effects, we reestimated the

equation with such controls.

        The regression estimates are presented in Table 3. Figure 1 plots the age-price profiles for

each cohort, from the estimates of the first column. For the first cohort, prices increase from age

20 to the early 50s before declining; the implied peak is at 50.6 years. As predicted above, prices

peak considerably earlier for the second cohort. The implied maximum is at 28.8 years. Thus

whereas artists born through 1920 tended to produce their most valuable work late in their

careers, artists born after that date typically executed their most valuable work within the first

decade of their careers.

        We test for differences in the age-price relationships in two ways. First we test for the

equality of the age-price profiles. The F-statistic for the equality of the two age profiles in column

1 is 72.6, with 4 and 4,368 degrees of freedom in the numerator and denominator, respectively,

compared to a critical value of 2.38 at the 5% level. Our main interest, however, is in comparing

the peak ages across cohorts. The estimated ages of peak value differ by 21.8 years. To test for
                                                  14

the equality of the peak ages, standard errors for the peaks were constructed using the delta

method. The standard errors for the peak ages are .815 and 1.105 for the first and second

cohorts, respectively, while the standard error for the difference is 1.37. The t-statistic for the

equality of the peaks is 15.9.

        Inclusion of the vintage effects has little effect on the age-price profiles, as shown in

column 2 of Table 3. The peak age of the first cohort declines slightly, to 49.9 years, while the

peak of the second cohort increases to 31.2. The difference in the peak ages remains highly

statistically significant.



Market Values and Critical Evaluation

        The art market is often dismissed by scholars and critics as having little relevance to art

appreciation. This has been particularly common for contemporary art: in 1962, in a well-known

remark, one critic complained that the new art was attracting a new clientele, and that art galleries

were being invaded by “gum chewers, bobby soxers, and worse, delinquents.”37 A salient

question consequently concerns whether auction prices for contemporary art reflect sophisticated

critical judgments.38

        Implicit evidence of scholars’ judgments of the timing of the most important stage of an

artist’s career can be drawn from the reproductions contained in books about contemporary art.

These reproductions are chosen to illustrate each artist’s most important contribution. Without

assuming any single judgment to be definitive, considering a number of books can provide a

survey of informed critical opinion.

        Table 4 is based on a tabulation of illustrations contained in 26 books, published since
                                                  15

1980, that analyze contemporary painting. For each of 20 painters, the table shows the total

number of illustrations of that artist’s work contained in the 26 books, the median date of

execution of the paintings represented by those illustrations, and the artist’s age at that date. The

20 artists selected comprise the 10 painters from each of the cohorts considered here who had the

greatest number of paintings sold at auction during 1980-96; the 10 from the first cohort account

for 89% of the paintings in the sample done by members of their cohort, while the 10 from the

second cohort account for 59% of all paintings in the sample done by members of theirs.

       Table 4 shows a clear difference between the two cohorts. For 9 of the 10 artists in the

first cohort, the median painting illustrated was done when the artist was above the age of 40; for

two it was done above the age of 50. In contrast, only one of the 10 artists in the second cohort

executed his median painting above the age of 40, and three painted it while still in their 20s. The

mean of the ages in Table 4 falls from 45.4 for the artists of the first cohort to 33.9 for those of

the second. Table 4 thus demonstrates clearly that scholars agree with the result obtained above

from the auction market, that the age at which successful modern American painters typically did

their best work declined sharply between the two cohorts considered by this study.



Conclusion

       When Frank Stella was given a retrospective exhibit at New York’s Museum of Modern

Art in 1970, at the age of just 33, the critic Harold Rosenberg remarked acidly that “The young

master is a new phenomenon in American art.” Rosenberg declared flatly that “It is inconceivable

that Cézanne, Matisse, or Miró could have qualified for a retrospective in a leading museum after

their first dozen years of painting; certainly Gorky, Hofmann, Pollock, and de Kooning did not.”
                                                  16

Rosenberg argued that “For a coherent body of significant paintings to spring directly out of an

artist’s early thoughts, a new intellectual order had to be instituted in American art.”39

       Although Rosenberg deplored this situation, his analysis of it was correct, and it is

precisely this new intellectual order that underlies the econometric results obtained in this paper.

The sudden increase in the demand for contemporary American art during the 1950s, with the

increased premium it placed on innovation, transformed the nature of American painting. As the

experimental methods of the Abstract Expressionists were replaced by a variety of conceptual

approaches, and the expressive gestures of Pollock, de Kooning, and their contemporaries gave

way to the mechanical and geometric productions of Warhol, Stella, and others, the value of

experience to painters declined sharply, and the age at which successful artists produced their best

work declined precipitously. Modern American painting consequently offers a striking case study

of a profession in which a shift in demand produced a sudden and radical change in the careers of

successful practitioners.

34.   The sale price given by Mayer is the hammer price, i.e. it includes the commission charged
      by the auctioneer to the seller, but not the premium charged to the buyer. See Orley
      Ashenfelter, “How Auctions Work for Wine and Art,” Journal of Economic Perspectives,
      Vol. 3, No. 3 (Summer 1989), pp. 23-36, for a discussion of auction practices.

35.   The fourth-order polynomial was chosen by including fifth-order terms in age and testing
      for their joint significance. The p-value for the F-test that the fifth-order terms were 0 was
      .076. An F-test of the hypothesis that the fourth-order terms were 0 yielded a p-value
      beneath .0001.

36.   The results are similar when each painting is weighted by the inverse of the number of
      paintings by that artist so that each artist receives equal weight.

37.   Madoff, Pop Art, p. 32.

38.   Use of critical evaluations can also dispel sample selection issues. Auction prices are
      available only for privately held paintings; once paintings enter a museum collection, they
      rarely return to the auction market. In many cases, an artist’s most important works are
      owned by museums, and are consequently not reflected in one age-price profiles. If
      museums acquire artists’ best works our age-price profiles will be flattened. Critical
      evaluations can provide another source of information, immune to this selection, with
      which to check our estimates.

Dependent variable is log of sale price. Standard errors in parentheses. Regressions weighted by
the inverse of the mean square error for each artist to control for inter-artist differences in the
variability of sales prices.

Note. Deviation of log sale price from cohort mean calculated from a quartic in age when painting
was executed interacted with birth of artist pre- / post-1920 controlling for artist fixed effects,
