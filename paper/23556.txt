Equilibrium in a Competitive Insurance Market Under Adverse Selection with Endogenous
Information

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the existence and nature of equilibrium in a competitive insurance market
under adverse selection with endogenously determined information structures.

Rothschild-Stiglitz (RS) characterized the self-selection equilibrium under the assumption of
exclusivity, enforcement of which required full information about contracts purchased. By
contrast, the Akerlof price equilibrium described a situation where the insurance firm has no
information about sales to a particular individual.

We show that with more plausible information assumptions - no insurance firm has full
information but at least knows how much he has sold to any particular individual - neither the RS
quantity constrained equilibrium nor the Akerlof price equilibrium are sustainable.

But when the information structure itself is endogenous - firms and consumers decide what
information about insurance purchases to reveal to whom - there always exists a Nash
equilibrium. Strategies for firms consist of insurance contracts to offer and information-revelation
strategies; for customers - buying as well as information revelation strategies. The equilibrium set
of insurance contracts is unique: the low risk individual obtains insurance corresponding to the
pooling contract most preferred by him; the high risk individual, that plus (undisclosed)
supplemental insurance at his own actuarial odds resulting in his being fully insured. Equilibrium
information revelation strategies of firms entail some but not complete information sharing.
However, in equilibrium all individuals are induced to tell the truth.

The paper shows how the analysis extends to cases where there are more than two groups of
individuals and where firms can offer multiple insurance contracts.

1. Introduction

    Understanding the existence and nature of market equilibria in the presence of information imperfections

(asymmetries) has been one of the most challenging topics in economic theory over the past half century.

Neither of the two prevalent models, that due to Rothschild-Stiglitz (1976) of a self-selection equilibrium, nor

that of Akerlof (1970), a price equilibrium, are fully satisfying. Equilibrium may not exist, when it exists, there

may be no trade, or no trade for a subset of the population for whom trade would seemingly be beneficial.



    Moreover, one of the most important implications of adverse selection models is that self-selection

equilibria are associated with distortions (relative to the full-information equilibrium). In insurance markets,

low-risk individuals purchase too little insurance - with perfect information, they would have obtained full

insurance. When the distortion associated with self-selection is too large, there is always a pooling contract

(purchased by high and low risk individuals) that will be preferred, in which case the “separating” equilibrium

cannot be sustained. In this case, there exists no competitive equilibrium.



    In addition, both the Akerlof and Rothschild-Stiglitz equilibria are dependent on unrealistic information

assumptions. Rothschild-Stiglitz (1976) denoted by RS hereafter, for example, described a model where every

contract purchased by an individual is fully known to each firm. This enables a firm to sell contracts to its

customers exclusively. On the other hand, in Akerlof’s model firms engage in price competition but each insurer

is uninformed of trades (amounts of insurance purchased) with other insurers. 1 Rothschild-Stiglitz assumes too

much information, Akerlof too little. If it is possible for a new insurance firm (or even an existing firm) to hide

some information about the insurance it has provided, the RS equilibrium will be broken, as we will show.

Intuitively, this is obvious: the low risk individual identifies himself by rationing the amount of insurance that


1
  Akerlof focused on the market for used cars. What we describe as the “Akerlof model” is the natural extension of that model to
insurance. (Individuals typically buy only one used car; a critical question in the insurance market is how much insurance does each
individual purchase at the market price). Moreover, in Akerlof’s model, the seller was the more informed agent; here it is the buyer.
This distinction is not important. It is important that in the game theoretic framework set out below, the uninformed party (the seller)
moves first. See Stiglitz and Weiss (1990, 2009).
2
he purchases, and whenever there is a rationing constraint, there is an incentive to circumvent the constraint.



    This paper explores equilibria in which market participants decide on what information to share with others.

Individual insurers may choose to reveal to or hide from other firms contract information - contracts that they

have sold. Individuals may choose to reveal to or hide from any firm the contracts that they have bought from

others.



    The fact that individuals and firms can hide information has profound implications for self-selection

equilibria, because it means that the insurance firm may not be able to extract the information he would

otherwise have been able to obtain from the choices an individual makes. In a market with hidden knowledge,

the amount of trade undertaken by an informed agent (the size of the insurance policy purchased) conveys

valuable information about his type. Based on this insight, Rothschild-Stiglitz (1976) characterized the

competitive equilibrium in an insurance market under adverse selection while presenting the possibility of the

non-existence of equilibrium. They did so in an environment where firms can offer individuals contracts

exclusively2.


    But if the individual has simultaneously some hidden contracts, the insurer may not be able to make the

same inferences. High risk as well as low risk individuals may purchase the quantity-constrained policy. At the

same time, allocations - like the pooling equilibrium preferred by the low risk individual - may not be “broken”

in the way that such equilibria are in the standard RS analysis: RS showed that there was a policy, at an implicit

price lower than the pooling contract, which would be purchased only by low risk individuals, ensuring that the

pooling equilibrium couldn’t be sustained. But if there are other hidden policies, high risk individuals might

purchase the putative breaking contract, making that contract unprofitable, so in fact it would not be offered - in


2
  Exclusivity means that if an individual purchases a policy from one firm, he cannot purchase any additional insurance from any
other firm. In the absence of information about what insurance individuals have purchased, it may be impossible to enforce an
equilibrium relying on exclusivity. In the case of a market with moral hazard and identical individuals, it may be possible to offer a
large enough policy such that no one wishes to buy any additional policy that could profitably be offered. Determining the conditions
under which this is true is the central question in Arnott-Stiglitz (1987, 1991a).
3
which case it would not have broken the pooling equilibrium. 3 In short, once there is not full disclosure, the

entire RS analysis breaks down: it is conceivable that an allocation that RS showed could not be an equilibrium

might be; and it is clear that the RS allocation itself is not an equilibrium. 4



    Similarly, the Akerlof price equilibrium has to be rethought in situations where firms have some information

about quantities - they at least have information about the quantities of insurance that they have sold to a

particular customer.


    Endogenous information equilibria

    This paper thus considers equilibria in the context of endogenously determined information. An insurance

firm chooses not only a set of contracts to offer, but also decides on what information to share with which firms.

An individual, similarly, not only chooses a set of contracts among those offered by firms but also decides what

information to reveal to which firm. We analyze the full equilibrium - in contracts and in information sharing.


    In this context of endogenous information, we ask i) whether an equilibrium exists, ii) if an equilibrium

exists, what an equilibrium set of contracts and information-revealing strategies looks like, and iii) is the

equilibrium Pareto efficient?


    We first establish two results, with important consequences for the large literature which has developed

since Rothschild-Stiglitz and Akerlof, based on their models: with endogenous information structures, neither

the Akerlof nor the RS equilibrium exists. Both are “broken,” i.e. assuming the putative Akerlof or RS

equilibrium, there exists a set of contracts, within the endogenously determined information structure, which

can be offered and make a profit.




3
  Recall the definition of as RS equilibrium, requiring that there does not exist another insurance policy which could profitably be
offered, which would be purchased by someone.
4
  See also Pauly (1974).
4
    But while the Akerlof and RS contracts do not constitute an equilibrium, there always exists an equilibrium

(unlike in RS) in which both high and low risk individuals buy insurance (unlike Akerlof), and the equilibrium

includes a pooling contract (which can never happen in RS).


    Characterizing an equilibrium for this model is not as complex as it looks. First, we identify a unique set of

combinations of insurance coverage and premium for each type of individuals that might be sustained in

equilibrium, which is what we call an equilibrium allocation. 5 We identify the only allocation which is

sustainable in the presence of incentives on the part of firms and individuals to reveal or hide their contract

information: the pooling allocation most preferred by the low-risk type plus supplemental full-insurance for the

high-risk type. Second, we show that the equilibrium allocation can be sustained as a Nash equilibrium; there

always exists an equilibrium – a set of contracts and set of information-revealing strategies.


    Thus the market equilibrium is markedly different from either that analyzed by Akerlof 6 or RS. There is a

pooling contract - the low risk subsidize the high risk. But the high risk buy a (here, supplemental) contract at

their own “odds” to bring them to full insurance. In many ways this looks like some insurance markets observed

in practice. Individuals are offered a pooling contract (by the government, or their employer) and then some

purchase additional insurance, presumably at odds reflecting their own risks. 7 Moreover, the informational

structure endogenously determined both by firms and by their customers resolves the problem of the non-

existence of equilibrium under adverse selection noted by R-S.


    In the following section we discuss some of the related literature. Section 3 introduces the basic model. We

describe the game structure, the institutional framework for information-revelation, define the (Nash)




5
   Thus, when we refer to the “allocation,” we are referring to the insurance policies bought and sold. The equilibrium allocation
describes the amount of coverage of each type. Since all insurance firms are identical, it makes no difference which insurance firm
offers which policy to which individual. As we note below, the kinds of insurance policies offered (e.g. a fixed sized contract at the
pooling price) does make a difference.
6
   Trivially, the equilibrium allocation coincides with Akerlof’s when the amount of pooling allocation preferred by the low-risk type
is zero.

   Often, the supplemental purchases are by rich individuals, not by high risk individuals. Individuals differ in respects other than the
accident probability, as assumed here.

equilibrium, and propose a candidate allocation - called the equilibrium allocation - that might be sustained as

an equilibrium under some feasible informational structure. It is shown that there is at most one possible

equilibrium allocation. Section 4 analyzes a set of equilibrium information strategies that can always sustain the

equilibrium allocation. Section 5 discusses some other related issues, such as extension to the case with many

types or a continuum of types. Some welfare properties of the equilibrium outcome, together with some

concluding remarks, are given in Sections 6 and 7.



2. Previous Literature

    We cannot summarize here the vast literature which developed following the early work of Akerlof and RS.

This literature explored the application of the model to different contexts (markets), different equilibria

concepts 8, and, to a limited extent, the consequences of different information structures.


    The importance of assumptions about information should be obvious: as we noted, whether or not an

insurance firm can offer insurance exclusively is critical in determining whether an equilibrium exists and

characterizing the equilibrium allocation in a competitive market. 9 10


    Several recent papers have addressed the nature of equilibrium under adverse selection when firms cannot



8
   Different equilibrium concepts may seem more appropriate in different contexts (see, e.g. (Stiglitz [1976, 1992, 2009]) just as
whether a market is best described by a screening equilibrium or a signaling equilibrium may differ according to context (see Stiglitz
and Weiss [1983, 1990, 2009].)
9
   For instance, as we also noted, RS showed that an equilibrium may not exist under exclusivity and that if an equilibrium existed, it
was a separating equilibrium, that is the different groups did not buy the same insurance policy. There could not be a pooling
equilibrium. The concept of a pooling equilibrium had been introduced somewhat earlier (Stiglitz, 1975). In a model where resources
could be allocated by identifying characteristics (i.e. screening), there could exist a pooling equilibrium, a separating equilibrium, or
multiple equilibria, one of which entailed pooling, another of which separating.
10
    Some strategic equilibrium concepts other than Nash have been employed (Wilson [1977], Riley [1979], Miyazaki [1977], Spence
[1978]) to characterize a market outcome under adverse selection. Later in the paper we comment on these reactive equilibria. Hellwig
(1986, 1987) has shown the sensitivity of the standard results to the precise game-theoretic formulation. Others (e.g. Engers-
Fernandez [1987]) have formulated dynamic extensions of the adverse selection model in a Nash equilibrium game-theoretic
framework. In these models, rather than there being no equilibrium there are a multiplicity of equilibria. Dubey-Geanakoplos (2002),
on the other hand, formulated a type of a signaling model describing how a pool, characterized by a specific level of insurance it
offers, can be formed in a perfectly competitive environment when an individual is constrained to choose a single contract, thus
implicitly again assuming exclusivity. Using an equilibrium refinement concept, they showed there always exists a unique
equilibrium, which involves separating allocations served by different pools. This work has been extended by Bisin and Gottardi
(1999) to a context of non-exclusivity, but in a rich model incorporating both adverse selection and moral hazard in which non-linear
pricing plays a key role. See also Bisin and Guaitoli (2004).

sell contracts exclusively. (See also the earlier papers of Pauly [1974] and Jaynes [1978].) Ales-Maziero (2012)

and Attar-Mariotti-Salanie (2014, 2016) establish that the problem of underinsurance by low risk types or of

equilibrium non-existence could become even more severe: under non-exclusivity, an equilibrium, if it exists,

entails no insurance for low-risk types, and the chance for equilibrium existence is even lower.


    By contrast, under somewhat different assumptions, Attar-Mariotti-Salanie (2011) explores the possibility

that under non-exclusivity an equilibrium may entail some pooling and thus some insurance for low-risk types.

In particular, in a more general model of adverse selection with non-exclusivity they characterize a pooling

equilibrium as well as a separating one with no insurance for the low risk type. But while in their model trade is

welfare-enhancing for both sellers and buyers, they set the maximum amount of trade exogenously. This

implies they do not have to worry about the incentive for over-trading (purchasing “too much” insurance) on the

part of the high risk type, which turns out to be one of the crucial issues that we have to deal with in this paper.

More recently, Attar-Mariotti-Salanie (2016) analyze conditions for existence of equilibrium, which turned out

be restrictive, mainly due to excessive demands for insurance by high-risk consumers. 11


    As we noted in the introduction, this paper not only explores the consequences of different information

structures, but more importantly, the implications of endogenizing the information structure - allowing firms

and individuals to decide what information to disclose to whom. The closest works to our paper within the

adverse selection literature are Jaynes (1978, 2011) and Hellwig (1988), who analyze a model with a certain

type of strategic communication about customers’ contract information. Jaynes (1978) characterizes an

equilibrium outcome that involves a pooling allocation plus supplemental provision at the high-risk price,

sometimes referred to as the Jaynes’ allocation, which is the allocation upon which our analysis focuses. 12

However, as Hellwig (1988) clarified, the pooling contract equilibrium and the associated strategic

communication presented by Jaynes (1978) is not a Nash equilibrium but a reactive equilibrium, responding to


11
   The insurance allocation upon which they focus is in fact the allocation which we show is the unique equilibrium allocation with
endogenous information.
12
   This equilibrium allocation upon which we focus also appears elsewhere in the literature, in particular, in Beaudry and Poitwevin
(1993, 1995) and in Gale (1991).

the presence of particular deviant contracts. 13 While our work differs from that of Jaynes and Hellwig in several

ways, perhaps most important is that we consider information revelation strategies by consumers as well as

firms. This turns out to be critical in the analysis of the existence of a Nash equilibrium. 14


     Moral hazard

     The consequences of imperfect information concerning insurance purchases and the consequent non-

exclusivity of insurance have also received some attention in the insurance-with-moral hazard literature. In that

case, the market price-equilibrium is particularly inefficient - individuals buy excessive insurance; and it is easy

to show that it is possible that the only price equilibrium entails no insurance, a result parallel to the no-trade

result of Akerlof (1970) in the context of adverse selection. 15 Arnott-Stiglitz (1987, 1991a, 1991b, 2013) 16

observe, however, that a firm can make use of the quantity information of his own sales - even if it has no

information about that of others. They refer to the resulting equilibrium as a “quantity” equilibrium, show that it

always exists, and that it never coincides with the exclusive contract equilibrium, may not coincide with the

price-equilibrium, may occur at a point where the individual is just indifferent between buying one or more

units of insurance, and may entail positive profits. 17 Further, they introduce the concept of a latent policy - a


13
   Hellwig (1988) argued that Jaynes’ equilibrium was not a sequential equilibrium of a two stage game with firms simultaneously
choosing policy offers and communication strategies at stage one, and therefore was not a Nash equilibrium, though he showed it was
sequential equilibrium for a four-stage game with firms choosing communication strategies after observing competitors’ contracts. In
response, Jaynes (2011), while keeping a two-stage framework, characterizes a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium, which requires
communication strategies as well as contract strategies to be sequentially rational based upon the beliefs derived from Bayes rule
(conditional upon those strategies). He shows that for any given deviant contract of a particular type, there can be a large enough
number of firms such that the deviant contract is unprofitable. The appropriate question, though, is given a particular value of N, is
there some deviant contract that will break the posited equilibrium. The answer is that there is. That is why we have introduced not
just communication between firms, but also communication between customers and firms.
14
   The role of information structure in determining an equilibrium outcome, which is critical for the existence of an equilibrium in this
paper, has also been recognized in the recent literature on so-called information design and Bayes correlated equilibrium for a game
with incomplete information. Characterizing Bayes-correlated equilibrium for given prior information, Bergemann-Morris (2013,
2016) showed that increasing prior information reduces the set of the equilibria. Taneva (2016) and Kamenica-Gentzkow (2011), on
the other hand, solve for the information structure that can lead to the optimal outcome. But in contrast to this literature, here,
uninformed firms move first to compete with each other for contracts to offer and the information structure emerges as part of the
market equilibrium. This paper highlights another role of the endogenously information structure, in supporting an equilibrium that
would otherwise be unsustainable. There are a number of other studies, such as Gossner (2000), that examined how different
information structures lead to different outcomes using Bayes Nash equilibrium or alternative solution concepts.
15
   Unlike RS, an equilibrium always exists (under the given information assumptions), though it may entail positive profits.
16
   See also Stiglitz (2013a). Of course, it is not just purchases of other insurance policies covering the same risk that affect relevant
behavior; risk taking can also be affected by consumption of other goods. As Greenwald and Stiglitz (1986) emphasize, there are
fundamental pecuniary externalities which arise whenever there is moral hazard. See also Arnott and Stiglitz (1990).
17
   The essential insight is that even though actions may be continuous in the amount of insurance purchased, the amount of insurance
purchased may be discontinuous in insurance offerings: a small supplementary (deviant) policy may induce discontinuous purchases
8
policy not purchased in equilibrium, but which would be purchased were an entrant to enter; and with that

purchase, the entrant would lose money. The latent policy serves to deter entry, enabling even a positive profit

equilibrium to be sustained.


    Verifiable disclosure

    There is a literature dating back to Stiglitz (1975), Milgrom (1981), and Grossman (1981) on verifiable

information disclosure which is linked to the analysis here. The central result, which Stiglitz has dubbed the

Walras’ law of screening, is that if there is verifiable disclosure of types, there can be no pooling equilibrium, as

each type finds it worthwhile (if the costs of verification are low enough) to have itself identified. Here, it will

turn out, individuals reveal the amounts of insurance they purchase - information that may be relevant for

implementing a self-selection equilibrium - but then whether they are honest in their statements will be revealed

subsequently, i.e. it will be effectively verified. The verification, though, is not done through a test (a screening

mechanism), but through disclosures on the part of the firm, or subsequent disclosures (possibly to other firms)

by the individual himself. It turns out, though, since there is no formal verification mechanism, the standard

unraveling argument does not apply, but the rational expectations that there would be such an unravelling has

behavioral consequences for the high risk individuals plays a critical role in shaping the equilibrium.



3. Model

    We employ the standard insurance model with adverse selection. An individual is faced with the risk of an

accident with some probability, Pi . Pi depends upon the type i of the individual. There are two types of

individuals – high risk (H-type) and low-risk (L-type), who differ from each other only in the probability of

accident. The type is privately known to the individual, while the portion                   of H-type is common knowledge.

The average probability of accident for an individual is 𝑃𝑃�, where 𝑃𝑃� ≡ 𝜃𝜃𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 + (1 − 𝜃𝜃)𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 .




of insurance, leading to discontinuous changes in behavior, so that even if there are profits in equilibrium, a small entrant would make
losses. This is the consequence of the fundamental non-convexities which arise in the presence of moral hazard. See Arnott and
Stiglitz (1988).
9
     An accident involves damages. The cost of repairing the damage in full is d. An insurance firm pays a part

of the repair cost, α. The benefit is paid in the event of accident, whereas the insurer is paid insurance premium


β when no accident occurs. 18 The price of insurance, p, is defined by β/ α. (In market equilibrium, the amount

of insurance that an individual can buy may be limited.) The expected utility for an individual with a contract

(α, β) is



     Vi �α, β� = Pi U �w − d + α� + (1 − Pi )U �w − β�.                                          (1)


     where U” < 0 (individuals are risk averse.) The profit 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 of insurance firm offering a contract �α, β� that

is chosen by i-type (i=H,L) is


          𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 �α, β� = (1 − 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 )𝛽𝛽 − 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 𝛼𝛼                                                (2)

     There are N firms and the identity of a firm j is represented by j, where j = 1, --, N.


3-1. The standard framework

     Before analyzing an equilibrium with endogenous information, we review the standard RS and Akerlof

models to see more precisely why endogenous information matters so much and to identify the challenges that

have to be addressed in constructing an endogenous information equilibrium.


     Akerlof equilibrium

     We begin with the competitive price-equilibrium, which we also refer to as the no-information price

equilibrium, because no insurer has any information about the purchases of insurance by any individual. In the

price equilibrium, different individuals choose the amount of insurance at a fixed price. In the competitive

equilibrium, the price of insurance will reflect the weighted average accident probability. Figure 1a illustrates.




18
   This has become the standard formulation since RS. In practice, customers pay β the period before the (potential) accident,
receiving back α + β in the event the accident occurs, i.e. a net receipt of α.
10
α is on the horizontal axis, β on the vertical axis. At α = d − β there is full insurance. From (2), the break-

even premium for each type of individual is β = 1−𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 𝛼𝛼 for i = H. L. These break-even loci are depicted in the
                                                                                     𝑖𝑖


figure, as is the break-even pooling line, where the average accident probability reflects the different amounts of

insurance bought by the different types. 19 We denote the purchase by a high risk individual at a price

corresponding to an accident probability 𝑃𝑃 as 𝛼𝛼𝐻𝐻 (𝑃𝑃), and similarly for the low risk as 𝛼𝛼𝐿𝐿 (𝑃𝑃). The weighted

average accident probability is then

      Since the high risk buy more insurance, i.e., since 𝛼𝛼𝐻𝐻 (𝑃𝑃) > 𝛼𝛼𝐿𝐿 (𝑃𝑃), the weighted accident probability 𝑃𝑃�(P)

is higher than the population weighted average 𝑃𝑃� (in Figure 1a), where


         𝑃𝑃� = 𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 𝜃𝜃 + 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 (1 − 𝜃𝜃).                                                                    (2b)

That is, 𝑃𝑃�(P) > 𝑃𝑃�.

        Now we define a (competitive) price equilibrium as                                𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒 satisfying the following conditions: (a)

(uninformed) sellers have rational expectations 𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒 about the quality or the accident probability of the buyers;

                                                                                                                     𝑃𝑃 𝑒𝑒
(b) with those rational expectations, prices are set to generate zero profits (equal to                                       ); and (c) at those prices
                                                                                                                    1−𝑃𝑃 𝑒𝑒

consumers buy the quantities that they wish. 20 Thus, a price equilibrium 𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒 satisfies




19                                                                                                                                 𝑃𝑃
     Throughout the paper, when we say a “price reflecting an accident probability P” we mean (from 2) a price          .
                                                                                                                   1−𝑃𝑃
20
     The latter conditions are equivalent to the standard conditions of demand equaling supply, for this particular model.

         𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒 = 𝑃𝑃� (𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒 )                                                                               (2c)

      A price equilibrium 𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒 is depicted in Figures 1a-1e. In Figure 1a, the high risk individual’s purchase of

insurance is denoted by B, the point of the tangency of their indifference curve 𝑉𝑉 𝐻𝐻 to the break-even line with

                𝑃𝑃 𝑒𝑒
the slope      1−𝑃𝑃 𝑒𝑒
                         ; that of the low risk individual is denoted by A. Figures 1b, 1c and 1d plot the RHS of (2c) as a

function of 𝑃𝑃e over the relevant range [𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 , 𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 ]. There is an interior equilibrium when the RHS crosses the 45o

line. The “normal” case (on which we focus) entails the low risk individual buying some insurance even at a

price corresponding to P H . Thus, 𝑃𝑃� (𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 ) ≤ 𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 , with 𝑃𝑃�(𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 ) < 𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 so long as the low risk type buys some

insurance at P H . Moreover, 𝑃𝑃�(𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 ) > 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 . Finally, it is easy to establish that 𝑃𝑃�(𝑃𝑃) is a continuous function of P.

Hence, there exists at least one value of P, 𝑃𝑃e , for which equation (2c) holds. We call this the no-information

price equilibrium. Figures 1c-1d show that there may be multiple no-information price equilibria. 𝑃𝑃� (𝑃𝑃) is

normally upward sloping, as the low risk individuals diminish their purchases of insurance at the high price.

This is the normal (and original) adverse selection effect. But the slope depends on the elasticities of demand of

the two groups as well as their relative proportions.


      Zero insurance for the low risk

      There is one special case, that where there is zero insurance for low-risk types in the price equilibrium. This

arises if 21


                                                                                            𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻
      𝛼𝛼𝐿𝐿 (𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 ) = 0 or                  (0,0) = 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝑉𝑉𝐿𝐿 (𝛼𝛼, 𝛽𝛽)   s.t. β =            𝛼𝛼.          (3)
                                                                                           1−𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻


      Condition (3) says that at the price corresponding to the high risk individuals, low risk individuals do not

buy any insurance, so that 𝑃𝑃� (𝑃𝑃) = 𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 for P = 𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 (and typically for some values of P less than 𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 ).

Condition (3) will hold when 𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 is so high relative to the low risk type’s marginal rate of substitution at zero

level of insurance that their demand for insurance is zero. 22 An Akerlof equilibrium, which is defined to be a


                         𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 𝑈𝑈′(𝑊𝑊−𝑑𝑑)        𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻
21
     (3) implies                           ≤            .
                        1−𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 𝑈𝑈′(𝑊𝑊)         1−𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻
22
  The equilibrium associated with (3) is analogous to the no-trade equilibrium in Akerlof, which is why we have referred to it as the
Akerlof equilibrium. The low risk individuals would obviously like to get insurance, but because of adverse selection, they choose, in
12
price equilibrium where only the high-risk individuals purchase insurance, is depicted as a corner solution in

Figures 1d and 1e. The Akerlof equilibrium is the unique price equilibrium in Figure 1e while it is one of the

multiple price equilibria in Figure 1d.


     We can summarize these results in

     Proposition 1a) There exists at least one no information price equilibrium. If (3) is satisfied, there exists a

boundary equilibrium- an Akerlof equilibrium - in which only high risk individuals purchases insurance. If (3)

is not satisfied, there exists at least one interior equilibrium with 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 < 𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒 < 𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 . There may exist multiple

equilibria.


     Nash equilibria and non-existence of a partial information price equilibrium


     In the no-information price equilibrium, the insurance firms simply take the price as given, but have rational

expectations about the risk of those who buy insurance at that price. There is no strategic interaction among

firms. We could define a price equilibrium in a Nash-Bertrand fashion by adding another condition that each

firm, taking the prices of others as given, chooses the price which maximizes its profits. In this case, it can be

shown that there exists a unique price equilibrium, the lowest price at which (2c) is satisfied. 23


     More interesting is the Nash equilibrium with partial information. While a firm doesn’t know the size of the

policies taken up by an individual from other firms, he knows the size of his own policy. An insurance firm can

offer a large policy - he knows to whom he sells, so he knows he wouldn’t sell a second policy to the same

individual. 24


     We define a partial-information (Nash) price equilibrium as an equilibrium where the insurance firm knows




equilibrium, not to. This no-trade result is different from that of Stiglitz (1982) and Milgrom and Stokey (1982) where though there
are asymmetries of information, buyers and sellers effectively have the same utility function—one side of the market is not trying to
share inherent risk with another.
23
   This should be can be contrasted with the multiplicity result in Proposition 1a.
24
   In the context of moral hazard, the implication of this simple observation were explored in Arnott-Stiglitz (1991a, 1987). See also
Jaynes (1978).
13
at least information about the amount of insurance it sells: a partial information price equilibrium is a set of

contracts such that (a) each contract at least breaks even; (b) each individuals buys as much insurance at the

price offered at he wishes; and (c) there does not exist any policy which (given the information structure) can be

offered which will be purchased and make a profit.


      Any policy proposing to break a price equilibrium must satisfy two conditions: to be purchased, it has to

have a lower price than the market price, but to make a profit, it must have a higher price than that

corresponding to the actual pool of people buying the policy.


      Consider a deviant firm that secretly offered a quantity policy, say the policy which maximizes the utility of

                                                                                                           ′   ′
the low risk individuals at a price corresponding to P′, with 𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒 > P′ > 𝑃𝑃� (such as (α , β ) in Figure 1a). It

sells only one unit of the policy to each individual, and restricts the purchases of all to the fixed quantity policy.

Then everyone will buy the policy, and it will make an (expected) profit. It thus breaks the price-equilibrium.


      The one case where this argument doesn’t work is that where the following condition (3’) is satisfied: 25


                                                                                   𝑃𝑃�
     𝛼𝛼𝐿𝐿 (𝑃𝑃�) = 0      or       (0,0) = 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝑉𝑉𝐿𝐿 (𝛼𝛼, 𝛽𝛽)   s.t. β =   1−𝑃𝑃�
                                                                                        𝛼𝛼          (3’)

      Note that the condition (3’) is stricter than (3), i.e. (3) can be satisfied, and yet (3’) may not be. This means

that even if there exists an Akerlof price equilibrium (where only the high risk buy insurance), the Akerlof

equilibrium is not a partial information Nash equilibrium. A quantity-constrained contract (α′ , β′) can break it.

(See figure 1f.)


      We have thus established


      Proposition 1b 26


                              𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 𝑈𝑈′(𝑊𝑊−𝑑𝑑)        𝑃𝑃�
25
     (3’) implies that                          ≤           .
                          1−𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 𝑈𝑈′(𝑊𝑊)            1−𝑃𝑃�
26
   In a somewhat different set-up, Jaynes (1978) presents a set of results similar to Proposition 1b.The condition for the existence of a
partial information price equilibrium, (3’), is stricter than that specified by Jaynes (1978), which would be equivalent to (3).
14
     There is no partial information price equilibrium where both types of individuals buy insurance, that is, a

price equilibrium where firms can offer an undisclosed quantity contract and ration the sale, say one policy to a

customer. There is a Nash partial information price equilibrium where only the high risk individuals buy

insurance if and only if condition (3’) is satisfied.


     What is remarkable about Proposition 1 is how little information is required to break the price equilibrium

(and even the “corner” Akerlof equilibrium): the firm just uses its own contract information to implement the

quantity constraint.


     It is natural to ask, if there is not a price equilibrium, is there some analogous equilibrium, with say fixed

quantity contracts? Consider a case where the two groups are quite similar. Each insurance firm sells insurance

in fixed units, say �𝛼𝛼�, 𝛽𝛽̅ �, say the policy which is most preferred by the low risk individual along the break-

even pooling line. The high risk individual would not want to buy two units of that insurance. But he would

supplement his purchase with the undisclosed insurance at his own price, in an amount that brings him to full

insurance. Below, we show that this kind of pooling contract cannot be an equilibrium: there is always a deviant

policy that could be offered that would be taken up only by the low risk individuals, given the posited

information structure.


     In other words, given this partial information structure, there is no equilibrium, ever, where both groups

buy insurance. By contrast, with the more complex endogenous information structure, to be described later in

the paper, there is always an equilibrium.


     Rothschild Stiglitz equilibrium 27

     Central to the analysis of Rothschild and Stiglitz was the assumption that there was sufficient information to

enforce exclusivity; the individual could not buy insurance from more than one firm. Once we introduce into the



27
   This section follows along the framework of Rothschild-Stiglitz, analyzing separately pooling and separating equilibria. The
following subsections formalize the analysis, describing the Nash equilibrium in information and contracting.
15
RS analysis unobservable contracts, in addition to the observable ones, the whole RS framework collapses.

Exclusivity cannot be enforced. We assume that undisclosed contracts can be offered, and will be offered if they

at least break-even. We ask, given the existence of such contracts, and given that the deviant contract that might

break any putative equilibrium itself may not be disclosed, can the RS analysis be sustained? That is, will it be

the case, as RS argued, that any possible pooling equilibrium be broken (i.e. there is no pooling equilibrium),

and will it still be the case that, provided the two groups are different enough in accident probabilities, that a

separating equilibrium exists?


      Breaking a separating equilibrium

      It is easy to show that the standard separating contracts - the policies that would have separated had there

been no hidden contracts, so exclusivity could have been enforced - no longer separate.


      Figure 2a shows the standard separating pair of contracts. C is the full insurance contract for the high risk

individual assuming he was not subsidized or taxed and A is the contract on the low risk individual’s break-even

curve that just separates, i.e. is not purchased by the high risk individual. In RS, the pair of contracts {A, C}

constitutes the equilibrium so long as A is preferred to the contract on the pooling line which is most preferred

by the low risk individual. 28 But {A, C} can never be an equilibrium if there can be undisclosed contracts,

because if there were a secret offer of a supplemental contract at a price reflecting the “odds” of the high risk

individual, such as AC’ in Figure 2a, then both the high and low risk individuals would buy A and it would not

separate. And it would obviously be profitable to offer such a secret contract.


      Breaking a pooling equilibrium with no disclosure of deviant policy

      RS showed that there could be no pooling equilibrium by showing that because of the single crossing

property, there always exists a contract which is preferred by the low risk individual and not by the high risk,

and lies below the pooling zero profit line and above the low risk zero profit line. But the ability to supplement



28
     If this is not true, there exists no equilibrium.
16
the breaking contract may make the contracts which broke the pooling equilibrium, under the assumption of no

hidden contracts, attractive to the high risk individual. If that is the case, that contract cannot break the pooling

equilibrium: there is no contract which can be offered which attracts only the low risk individuals.


      Figure 2b provides an illustration. The pooling contract A is the most preferred policy of the low risk type

                                              𝑃𝑃�

                                                     , 29 the only possible pooling equilibrium. Consider the high-risk price line

through A. The high risk individual also purchases the insurance contract A, thereby obtaining a subsidy from

the low risk individual, and supplements it with secret insurance at the high risk odds (represented in figure 2b
                                                                                                          𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻
by AC’, where C’ is the full insurance point along the line through A with slope                                        . 30 Consider a policy D o
                                                                                                        1−𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻


below the low risk individual’s indifference curve through A, above that for the high risk individual, and which

also lies below the zero profit line for high risk individuals through A. D o would be purchased by the high risk

individual. In the RS analysis, with exclusivity, D o would have broken the pooling equilibrium A. Now, it does

not, because the high risk individuals would buy D o and the (secret) supplemental insurance. 31 And if they do

so, then D o makes a loss, and so D o could not break the pooling equilibrium.


      But the question is, are there any policies which could be offered that would break the pooling equilibrium,

that would be taken up by the low risk individuals, but not by the high risk individuals even if they could

supplement the contract with a secret contract breaking even. The answer is yes. There are policies which lie

below the zero profit pooling line and above the zero profit line for low risk individuals (that is, would make a

profit if purchased only by low risk individuals), below the low risk individual’s indifference curve (i.e. are

preferred by low risk individuals), and lie above the high-risk zero profit line through A (i.e. even if the high

risk individual could have secretly supplemented his purchases with insurance at his actuarial fair odds, he

     Sometimes referred to as the Wilson equilibrium.
                                                                                                                 𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻
30
     Recall that at full insurance, the slope of the indifference curve of the high risk individual is just             , and full insurance entails α
                                                                                                              1−𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻

= d − β.
31
   This is different from the way that the matter was framed by Wilson and Riley, who described the policy A as being withdrawn
when a policy such as Do is offered (which is why their equilibrium concepts are typically described as reactive). Here, policy offers
are made conditional on certain (observable) actions. See the fuller discussion in the next sections.
17
would be worse off than simply purchasing A, the pooling contract). These policies break the pooling contract.

In figure 2b, any point (such as D 1 ) in the shaded area in the figure, which we denote by z, can thus break the

pooling equilibrium. It should be obvious that the set z is not empty.


     Formally, for any point such as D 1 , 𝑉𝑉𝐿𝐿 {𝐷𝐷1 } > 𝑉𝑉𝐿𝐿 {𝐴𝐴}, while 𝑉𝑉𝐻𝐻 {𝐷𝐷1 + 𝑆𝑆𝐻𝐻 } < 𝑉𝑉𝐻𝐻 {𝐴𝐴} where in the obvious

notation 𝑉𝑉𝐻𝐻 {𝐷𝐷1 + 𝑆𝑆𝐻𝐻 } is the maximized value of the high risk individual’s utility, when he purchases policy D 1

plus supplemental insurance at the actuarial odds, 𝑆𝑆𝐻𝐻 , bringing him to full insurance. 32


     We collect the results together in


Proposition 2.

     (a) The RS Separating Contracts do not constitute an equilibrium, if firms can offer non-loss making

         undisclosed contracts.

     (b) The pooling equilibrium may always be “broken” if there exists undisclosed supplemental insurance

         and if a deviant firm can choose to keep his offers secret.

     (c) Some of the contracts that broke the pooling equilibrium in the standard RS equilibrium with exclusivity

         no longer do so.


     The analysis so far has assumed the information structure, i.e. that the deviant contract and the

supplementary policy at the price corresponding to 𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 are not disclosed. The remaining sections focus on the

core issue of an endogenous information structure, with the simultaneous determination of contract offers and

information strategies of firms and with contract purchases and information disclosure by individual customers.


     3-2. Strategies of firms and customers, Game Structure, and Equilibrium

     We model the insurance market as a game with two sets of players, the “informed” customers, who know




32
   Note that the utility 𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 of an individual is a function of total amount of insurance α and and the total premium paid β, which can
be expressed in terms of the policies purchased (such as A or 𝐷𝐷1 ). The notation 𝐷𝐷1 + 𝑆𝑆𝐻𝐻 refers to the {α, β} associated with the
purchase of D1 plus the optimized value of secret insurance along the price line associated with the high risk individual.
18
their accident probabilities, and the uninformed insurance firms (all of whom are identical), who do not know

the characteristics of those who might buy their insurance. They have no way of directly ascertaining their

potential customers’ accident probabilities. They know that if they ask their customers, they won’t necessarily

tell the truth (the high risk customers have an incentive to claim to be low risk), but they may try to infer their

type from the choices they make. In the Stiglitz’ analysis of monopoly insurance markets (1977), the insurance

firm structures their choices so as to make those inferences “efficiently” (with the least loss of profits to the

insurance firm); in the Rothschild Stiglitz analysis of competitive insurance markets, firms know what other

policies individuals purchased, even if they cannot control the choice set, and thus they can enforce exclusivity.

Here, what each firm knows is being endogenously determined not only through inter-firm communication but

also through information disclosure by its customers, and as a result exclusivity may not (and in equilibrium

will not) be enforced.


     Thus, the key difference between the analysis below and that of RS is that they assumed that any insurance

firm knew about all of the insurance purchases of any individual (in which case, the equilibrium allocation is as

if an individual purchased insurance exclusively from one insurance firm); while here, we assume that in the

equilibrium allocation, some insurance purchased may not be observable to other insurance firms and, most

importantly, additional insurance policies can be offered unbeknownst to those offering insurance in the

putative equilibrium.


     The game structure has three stages:


     Stage 1: firms announce their strategies simultaneously. Strategies consist of a set of insurance contracts that

are offered, possibly with conditions, and information policies about what information it will reveal to which

firms. These are commitments, e.g., the firm cannot renege on its offer, if the conditions are satisfied, and if the

firm has information that the conditions of offer have not been satisfied, then it follows through and the




19
insurance policy is cancelled. 33 The firm may impose conditions of exclusivity (no insurance may be purchased

from another firm), limitations on aggregate purchases from other firms, or even minimum levels of insurance

purchased from other firms. Information strategies as well as contract strategies of a firm towards an individual

i may be conditional upon the contract information available about that individual, the endogenous revelation of

which is itself part of the game. The firm may reveal information not only about his own sales, but also

information that has been revealed to it from others. Customers know that if the firm finds out that the

individual has violated the conditions of the contract, the contract is voided. 34



     Stage 2: each customer optimally responds by purchasing a contract or contracts while revealing whatever

information about the contracts he purchased to whomever he wants. The individual can purchase insurance

from more than one firm. 35 The strategy of an individual is thus a choice of insurance policies and a set of

decisions about what information about these purchases to reveal to which firms.



     Stage 3: Each firm discloses (or receives) contract information about its customer to (or from) other firms,

but only as announced in Stage 1. Those announcements may depend on information that has been revealed to

the firm in stage 2. Any purchase of a contract or contracts by an individual is cancelled if the contract

information revealed about him does not meet the conditions required by the contract.




33
   This can be compared to Jaynes (2011) and Hellwig (1988), who formulate a multi-stage sequential game where firms are allowed
not to execute in the later stage the exclusivity announced in the earlier stage.
    We focus on Nash equilibrium, so that each firm (in equilibrium) takes the announced strategies of other firms as given. This
means that the strategy of a firm in stage 1 is not conditional upon the strategies announced by the other firms in stage 1. (When that is
not the case, e.g. when a firm announces that it will not sell a particular policy if some other firm offers a policy belonging to a
particular set of policies, we call the resulting equilibrium, if it exists, a reactive equilibrium. Such behavior is not consistent with the
spirit of competitive analysis, since any firm is sufficiently important that it can alter the behavior of any other firm.)
34
   The game may be formulated in a number of different ways, e.g. if the individual has purchased more than policies he has
purchased allow, then there may be a scaling back of the sales by each firm (according to some rule) to bring the individual into
conformity with the conditionality. The approach we take simplifies the analysis and provides strong incentives for truth telling on the
part of consumers.
35
   When an individual purchases multiple contracts from different insurers, he is assumed to make those purchases simultaneously,
bearing in mind the conditions associated with each policy. As will be shown later, in equilibrium the individual fully discloses all
contracts purchased and the individual knows that accordingly, he cannot violate the conditions associated with any contract
purchased.
20
     The key strategic decisions occur in the first two stages, while the final stage, which does not entail any

additional strategic element in the structure, is simply a working out of the actions and commitments previously

undertaken. 36


     Now we define a Nash equilibrium as follows:

     A Nash equilibrium is defined as a set {𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗∗ }𝑗𝑗 of strategies by firms, such that given {𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗∗ }𝑗𝑗 , there does not

exist any other strategy that any firm can adopt and make higher profits than it is currently making, given the

optimal responses of consumers. 37 When there exists such a strategy, we say that it “breaks” the putative

equilibrium.



     This is a natural extension of the equilibrium defined by Rothschild-Stiglitz (1976), who focus on

competitive markets, where no firm believed that its actions will alter that of others. A strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗∗ of a firm we

consider in the above game structure is not a reactive one, as it does not condition its contract offers and

disclosure policies upon the strategies of the other firms. 38


     We define an equilibrium allocation {(𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 , 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 )}𝑖𝑖 to be a set of insurance policies purchased by each type of



36
   Thus, the last stage does not generate any reactive feature to a firm’s strategy. This is important, because earlier analyses of the
problem at hand were rightly criticized for being “reactive equilibrium,” not Nash equilibrium, and as we noted in an earlier footnote,
contrary to the spirit of competitive equilibrium. See, e.g. Hellwig’s (1988) criticism of Jaynes (1978).
37
    More formally, we should say, given the (equilibrium) strategies of consumers. Consumers have strategies relating to their
purchases of insurance and disclosure of information. Each consumer is assumed to be small, and his actions have no effect on the
behavior of firms, and to know this. Thus, the consumer’s choice of contract(s) is straightforward: he simply maximizes his expected
utility. The analysis to this point is parallel to that of RS, which focused solely on firm strategies, simply because the consumer
strategies were so simple and straightforward. Consumers’ information strategy is slightly more complicated, but is shown below to
entail truth telling about purchases of pooling contracts, but not about purchases of other contracts.
38
   To the extent that a firm may condition its contract offers upon the information disclosed by its consumer, however, the strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗∗
embeds a response to the contract offers by another firm j’, when a consumer purchases insurance from both of the two firms, when
his purchase from j′ is revealed to j, and when, as a result of the contract violation, the policy is cancelled. As will be clear from the
analysis below, it is not this seemingly potential reactive feature itself that leads to the existence of an equilibrium: existence requires
that strategies have to be designed to deter entry by a deviant firm. In RS, entry is easy, because the entrant (deviant firm) can make
use of exclusivity, which follows from the assumed information structure. Here, the information structure is endogenous, so that
whether a firm can deter entry by impairing the deviant firm’s ability to enforce exclusivity is a more complicated matter. In earlier
analyses, the entry deterrence required to establish equilibria depended on reactive equilibria (putting the analysis outside of the usual
Nash equilibrium framework). See Wilson (1977) and Hellwig’s (1988) discussion of Jaynes (1978). We will show instead that the
information revelation made as a part of the optimal response by consumers, interacting with that by firms, in a Nash equilibrium
enables 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗∗ to deter a deviant firm from exercising the exclusivity necessary to break the equilibrium.

individual in equilibrium. It is easy to show that what matters is the total insurance coverage 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 and insurance

premium 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 , and when we refer to the equilibrium allocation, we refer to these totals. The full equilibrium is

characterized by an equilibrium allocation and an equilibrium information structure.


     Normally, we would expect equilibrium allocations to have zero profits 39, for if a firm were offering a set of

contracts making positive profits, some other (new) firm could offer a more attractive set of contracts and still

make positive profits, upsetting the original equilibrium. While RS showed that to be the case in their model

which assumed full information about contract purchases by all individuals, the analysis in section 3.2

establishes the corresponding result more generally, and identifies the unique possible equilibrium allocation.


     We proceed as follows: first we discuss in greater detail the information revelation strategies and the

contract strategies. We then (in the next sub-section) analyze the set of possible allocations, showing that there

is a unique possible allocation. Section 4 then uses this to construct the equilibrium strategies.


     Information revelation

An insurer can, if he wants to, reveal information on particular contracts purchased by a particular individual;

similarly, an individual can reveal information on particular contracts purchased from particular firms.

Consumers and insurance firms may choose either to reveal or to hide information. The contract information

which is relevant for our analysis consists of two elements – the revealed amount of insurance purchased

elsewhere and the revealed identities of those providing the insurance.



     Information revelation by consumers



We make the following further assumption concerning consumers’ information revelation:




39
  The non-convexities associated with incentive constraints imply that in competitive equilibria with moral hazard there may be
positive profits. That is, a policy with slightly better terms than the putative equilibrium policy that makes a profit, induces a discrete
change in behavior, resulting in a discontinuous change in profitability. See Arnott and Stiglitz (1991, 1993) and Stiglitz (2013a).
22
Assumption (A)

     An individual cannot prove that he has no contract information to reveal. But any contract information

     revealed by an individual is truthful.


     In other words, what individuals reveal is the truth, nothing but the truth, but not necessarily the whole truth.

An individual can, for instance, reveal his contract information on the contract(s) that he has with other firm(s)

simply by showing his contract. 40 When an individual has contracts with more than one firm (or even multiple

contracts with one firm), the contract information for the individual would not be fully revealed if he withholds

information on some or all of them. We assume there is no legal framework that can force a customer to reveal

all of his contracts. 41 Thus what each firm knows about other insurance contracts of each insurance applicant is

truthful, but possibly incomplete.


     Since an individual’s particular contract with a firm can affect what he can get from other firms an

individual might ask a firm to “manipulate” the contract for him, facilitating the non-full disclosure, whenever it

is in the interest of a firm and/or of an individual. A firm may divide its true contract into two 42 so that its

customer may choose to reveal only part of what he has purchased. An individual is not able to have non-full

disclosure about the insurance bought from a particular firm without contract manipulation by the firm of the

form just described. We assume that the firm chooses to engage in such manipulation if and only when it is

profitable. Contract manipulation (CM) is a part of a strategy of a firm. We establish below that it will not be

profitable in equilibrium.




40
   This assumes all insurance contracts are written. In the absence of such a written contract, it would be difficult to enforce (except
through “reputational mechanisms,” which are not relevant in the simplified context analyzed here). We ignore the possibility here of
outright fraud, e.g. that the individual simply makes up a contract that does not exist.
41
   In practice, this is not always the case. In his insurance application, he can be asked to reveal all of his existing contracts, and if it
should turn out later that the individual has not been fully truthful, the insurers’ obligation to honor the contract is negated.
42
   The division can be perfectly arbitrary: all that is required is that the sum of the benefits of the two parts equal the total benefit, and
that the sum of the premiums equal the total premiums. We assume, in other words, that regardless of what has been revealed, the
customer pays the full premium, and if an accident occurs, he receives the full benefit.
23
      That this is so is far from obvious. While it should be obvious that non-full disclosure of his insurance

contracts may be in the interest of the customer - it might enable him to get more insurance at more favorable

terms than he might otherwise get - such non-disclosure may also be in the interests of the insurance firm. In

fact, as we shall see, non-disclosure by a firm plays a critical role in sustaining an equilibrium. For the insurance

firm may want to deter sales by others (since such sales undermine the ability of the firm to make inferences

about who is buying its policies), and non-disclosure of information can serve as an entry deterrent. It may

result in the entrant getting an adverse set of applicants. Nonetheless, we show below that contract manipulation

is not part of the equilibrium strategies.


      Information revelation by firms

      Each insurance firm may also choose which contract information it has with a particular customer to reveal

to which firms. A firm may get contract information about its customer i not just from the individual himself,

but also through information revelation by his insurers. A firm j may disclose to each of the other firms some or

all of the contract information Ω𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 for its customer i that the firm j knows about. 43 Thus a firm may not be able

to know full contract information for each of its consumers. We make the further natural assumption that a

firm’s strategy for an individual i can only be conditioned upon contract information revealed about that

individual, not upon any contract information revealed for other individuals. 44


                                                                                                         𝑖𝑖
      An information strategy of firm j specifies a subset of the contract information Ω of an individual i to
                                                                                                         𝑗𝑗


reveal and a set of firms to disclose to, where Ω𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 includes not only information on a contract that j sells to i but

also information on contracts revealed to j to have been purchased elsewhere. 45 Formally, an information


43
   In earlier versions of this paper, we assumed that there were information sharing networks of firms. Firms within the network
agreed to share information—but while they agreed to do so, they could cheat. The results presented here show that nothing depends
on these institutional arrangements.
44
   It is a natural assumption in this context because there are no interaction effects and no reason that information about individual k
would be of any relevance for the sale of insurance to individual i. If a contract for an individual were conditional upon contract
information of others, the optimal response by individuals to strategies of firms would be quite complicated.
                                                                                                              𝑖𝑖
45
     As discussed in Section 5, there are alternative formulations of the model where contract information Ω to be revealed consists
                                                                                                              𝑗𝑗
only of information on a contract sold by j.   Similarly, if the individual purchases from only two firms, the only information that is
24
strategy 𝐼𝐼𝑗𝑗 of a firm j specifies whether or not it reveals to the other insurers (actual and potential) of its

customer i the information on the identities of customer i’s insurers (including j) 46 revealed to j . For the sake of

expositional simplicity, with the information on the identities of insurers being suppressed, an information

strategy 𝐼𝐼𝑗𝑗 is represented by an N-dimensional vector with each element being 1 or 0, indicating whether or not

the contract information for an individual i is revealed to each of the N firms, respectively 47 48. The k-th element

of 𝐼𝐼𝑗𝑗 represents the information policy of a firm j toward a firm k about the identities of insurers (including j)

revealed to j by an individual i. Importantly, the information strategy of a firm j for an individual i can be (and

in the equilibrium strategy will be) conditional upon 𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 (a set of identities of insurers for i that are revealed to j

by the individual i himself) as well. Thus, we will represent the information strategy of a firm j by 𝐼𝐼𝑗𝑗 (𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 ). Note,

by contrast, that the information strategy of a firm in RS is exogenously given by 𝐼𝐼𝑗𝑗 (𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝟏𝟏 for all 𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 ; in the

partial information price equilibrium, by 𝐼𝐼𝑗𝑗 = 𝟎𝟎−𝑗𝑗 for all 𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 , where 𝟎𝟎−𝑗𝑗 is an N-dimensional vector with all

but the j-th element being equal to 0. 49


     Contract Strategies

     One critical piece of information that firm j may use in conditioning its sales to individual i is the total

                  𝑖𝑖
revealed amount 𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗 of insurance i purchased elsewhere, which may be revealed by an individual i 50:


         𝑖𝑖
       𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗 = ∑𝑑𝑑∈𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 𝛼𝛼𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖                                                                     (4)
                        𝑗𝑗




relevant is that on a contract sold by j.
46
   Obviously, formally, since the firm knows the contracts it itself has issued.
47
   There is no information strategy of a firm in RS, where any contract information for an individual is revealed to all the firms.
48
   As formulated, the firm either transmits all information about a particular individual to a particular firm or none, but clearly, the
information strategy can be generalized—firm j can transmit some information but not others (say about the amount of insurance but
not the premium charged). This will be important in the analysis of some of the alternative equilibrium strategies below. If a firm sells
more than one policy to an individual i, then the information strategy would specify which information it will reveal about each
policy. But as we already noted, the only reason to divide the policy into more than one component is to avoid full disclosure, with the
presumption is that it would not disclose the “second” part; but it still has to make a decision about the first. In the interest of
generality, we can think of the kth element of Ii as itself being a vector of 0’s and 1, describing whether it reveals information about
each of the parameters of each of the policies to the ith individual to the kth firm.
49
   It is obvious that one can think of the firm as revealing to itself its sales to customer i.
50
   As we note below, while there is a unique allocation, it can be implemented through multiple alternative information strategies.
Some of these use information beyond that in (4).

     where A(𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗 )( ⊆ 𝑅𝑅>0 ) indicates a set of the levels µ′s of insurance the firm is willing to sell at price q,

which is conditional upon the sum 𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗 of insurance an individual i is revealed to have purchased elsewhere if

�𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 = ∅. Equation (5) is a simple way of representing a general conditional price or quantity contract. A contract
𝐷𝐷

𝜇𝜇(1, 𝑞𝑞) is a policy with benefit α equal to 𝜇𝜇 and premium equal to 𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇. 𝜇𝜇 is constrained; the constraints are,

                                  𝑖𝑖
in general, a function of       𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗 . We assume that firms are committed to fulfilling their contract offer (including

to cancelling policies when the firm obtains information that the contract conditions have been violated).


     Thus, below we will consider several special cases. (i)               In one, α is either zero or 𝛼𝛼�       (where 𝛼𝛼� is the

                                                                                        𝑖𝑖
most preferred level of insurance by the low risk individual at the pooling price) if 𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗 = 0, and 0 otherwise.

That is, the firm only offers insurance to an individual that, according to its information, has not purchased

insurance elsewhere, and then either sells him the policy 𝛼𝛼� or zero. (ii) In another case, 𝜇𝜇 is constrained so

            𝑖𝑖
that 𝜇𝜇 + 𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗 ≤ 𝛼𝛼�. 52 That is, it only sells insurance up to an amount where, based on the information it has, the


51
  Recall that 𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 is defined as the set of identities of insurers for i that are revealed to j by the individual i himself.
52
  𝜇𝜇(1, 𝑞𝑞) can alternatively be written as the scalar 𝜇𝜇 times the vector (1,q)’, where the “prime” denotes the transpose of a vector.
There are many alternative ways of representing the set of contracts, e.g. as (potentially non-linear) functions of what he has
26
individual is purchasing less than or equal to 𝛼𝛼�. (iii) In the standard price contract µ is constrained only by the

amount of damage the individual has suffered, so that the set of available contracts are all policies (µ, µ𝑞𝑞), 0 ≤

µ ≤ d, and there is no conditioning; the contract is made available to all. (iv) The exclusive quantity contract in

                               𝑖𝑖
RS is one which says that if 𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗 > 0, µ = 0: the firm sells the individual nothing if the firm knows that the

customer has bought anything elsewhere. But if the individual has not bought anything elsewhere (to his

knowledge), the firm offers the separating contracts, two distinct contracts each with a particular µ and price.


     Thus, the concept of a contract strategy which is relevant in an environment with incomplete contract

information is different and more general than that used in RS in three respects. First, a contract strategy in RS

is represented by a contract with a particular value 𝜇𝜇 ∈ 𝑅𝑅>0 and has a specific conditionality on contract

information revealed: here, the firm may offer a price contract and/or a multiplicity of quantity contracts, with

the offerings conditional on the knowledge it has about individual’s other purchases.


                                                                                              𝑖𝑖
     Secondly, contract manipulation (CM) is allowed: A firm with a contract strategy 𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗 (𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗 ) engages in CM

if, for instance, it sells an individual two contracts with different values (𝜇𝜇1 ,𝜇𝜇2 ) simultaneously, instead of one

contract with µ (= 𝜇𝜇1 + 𝜇𝜇2 )53 .   P




     Thirdly, if the firm discovers that the individual has not been truthful in the information he has revealed, the

contract may get cancelled.         Whether the firm finds out such information is, of course, endogenous; and in

equilibrium, no individual will have his insurance cancelled. But the knowledge that the policy would be

canceled plays an important role in inducing truth-telling and in deterring entry. 54




purchased elsewhere (possibly a function of all the parameters of those policies) and of the amount he purchases from the given firm.
(Note that restricting the amount purchased is equivalent to imposing an infinite price on purchases beyond the given amount.)
53
   As we noted, this might be important, because it opens up the possibility of partial revelation of insurance purchased.
54                                                                           𝑖𝑖
    A set of contract offers by a firm is conditional upon the information 𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗 revealed by its consumer i, while it is affected only
indirectly by information revelation by other firms, which, as will be shown below, just induces the consumer to reveal truthfully.

27
     We can now represent a strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗 of a firm j as consisting of two parts, a contract strategy and an

information strategy:


                     𝑖𝑖
     𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗 = {𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗 (𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗   �𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 ), 𝐼𝐼𝑗𝑗 (𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 )} for j = 1, --, N.
                         ; 𝐷𝐷                                                        (6)


     Our proof strategy is to first analyze equilibrium allocations, showing that under very weak informational

assumptions concerning disclosure and non-disclosure, the set of allocations that can be sustained is very

limited. Focusing on this limited set of possible equilibrium allocations, we then analyze potential full

equilibrium, identifying both the contract offerings/take-ups and information disclosures that can be sustained

by a Nash equilibrium.


3-3. Equilibrium Allocation

     Any allocation must be of one of four types: (a) different quantities of insurance at different prices for the

two groups; (b) the same quantity at the same price; (c) different quantities at the same price; and (d) the same

quantities at different prices. An allocation (a) is a separating one while (b) is a pooling one. An allocation (a),

which satisfies self-selection constraints will be called as an RS allocation, as it is a candidate for an

equilibrium allocation under complete disclosure (as in the RS model). An allocation (c), on the other hand, is

the standard price equilibrium under complete non-disclosure discussed in Section 3-1, where we showed that it

could never be an equilibrium allocation. It is obvious that an allocation of the form (d) with the same quantity

at the different prices cannot be an equilibrium allocation since no one would purchase the higher price policy

(policies). Now we will see if either (a) or (b) (the non-price equilibria) can be an equilibrium when the

informational structure is endogenously determined.


     First, we establish the following Proposition.


     Proposition 3

     Any allocation (𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 , 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 )𝑖𝑖 with insurance purchased by both groups satisfying self-selection constraints that


28
                                                                                                                            𝑃𝑃�
satisfies the zero-profit condition can be represented by a pooling contract (𝛼𝛼 𝑃𝑃 , 𝛽𝛽 𝑃𝑃 ) (where 𝛽𝛽 𝑃𝑃 = 1−𝑃𝑃� 𝛼𝛼 𝑃𝑃 )

plus a set (𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖𝑆𝑆 , 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑆𝑆 )𝑖𝑖 of supplementary contracts for the two types such that


                                                                  𝑃𝑃
     𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 𝑃𝑃 + 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖𝑆𝑆 , 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽 𝑃𝑃 + 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑆𝑆 , 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑆𝑆 = 1−𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖𝑆𝑆 .
                                                                       𝑖𝑖




     The pooling contract and each of the supplementary contracts break-even. Figure 3 decomposes any pair of

contracts into a pooling allocation and a set of supplementary policies. Project back from the contract (αL , β𝐿𝐿 )

                                     𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿
along a line with slope                     and similarly from the high risk type’s contract. That line intersects the zero profit
                                   1−𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿


pooling line at (𝛼𝛼 𝑃𝑃 , 𝛽𝛽 𝑃𝑃 ), the pooling contract. The addition - going from (𝛼𝛼 𝑃𝑃 , 𝛽𝛽 𝑃𝑃 ) to (αL , β𝐿𝐿 ) - are zero profit

supplementary contracts. Similarly, for the high risk type. Proposition 3 says that for the allocation, the

projections back to the pooling line intersect the pooling line at the same point, the pooling contract (𝛼𝛼 𝑃𝑃 , 𝛽𝛽 𝑃𝑃 ).

The supplementary contract is only the addition (the arrow from (𝛼𝛼 𝑃𝑃 , 𝛽𝛽 𝑃𝑃 ) to (αL , β𝐿𝐿 )). Similarly, for high-risk

types. 55 Note also that in order for (αi , βi )𝑖𝑖 to be an equilibrium allocation, the pooling contract in conjunction

with the set (𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖𝑆𝑆 , 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑆𝑆 )𝑖𝑖 of supplementary policies should satisfy the self-selection constraint. 56 Note too that the

RS equilibrium allocation under complete disclosure has a zero pooling allocation and positive supplementary

one for each of the two types.


     Now we can prove the following Proposition.


     Proposition 4

     Any allocation with incomplete supplementary insurance for high-risk types or with positive supplementary

insurance for low-risk types (including an RS equilibrium allocation) is not an equilibrium one when the

informational structure is endogenously determined.



55
   Assume the projections from A and C to the zero profit line hit the zero profit line at two different points, Z and Z’ respectively.
Since profits are zero along AZ, 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿 {𝑍𝑍} = 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿 {𝐴𝐴}, and similarly for C and Z’. But 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿 {𝐴𝐴}= - 𝜋𝜋𝐻𝐻 {𝐶𝐶}, but along the zero profit
line 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿 {𝑍𝑍} = - 𝜋𝜋𝐻𝐻 {Z}. Thus Z and Z’ must coincide.
56
   An equilibrium in Akerlof (1970), Ales-Maziero (2011) and Attar-Mariote-Salanie (2014), if exists (entailing zero insurance for the
low risk individuals), is the one in which both pooling allocation and the supplemental one for the low-risk type are zero.
29
     The intuition for Proposition 4 is simple. Figure 4 demonstrates that an equilibrium allocation cannot entail

supplemental insurance for the low risk type. Assume {A, C} is an equilibrium allocation satisfying the self-

selection constraints. The high risk individual prefers C, the low risk A. But with potential secrecy, this won’t
                                                                 𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻
work: at A, the slope of 𝑉𝑉𝐻𝐻 is greater than                            , so that high risk individuals strictly prefer A plus
                                                                1−𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻


supplemental insurance that breaks even (at the high risk probability of accident), i.e. using our earlier notation,

𝑉𝑉𝐻𝐻 (𝐴𝐴 + 𝑆𝑆𝐻𝐻 ) > 𝑉𝑉𝐻𝐻 (𝐶𝐶), so {A,C} are no longer a separating set of contracts. The key role of secrecy should be

noted. In RS, the original insurance firm would have observed the supplemental policies originally purchased,

and his contract would have been offered conditional on such policies not being purchased.


     Equilibrium Allocation

     Define �𝛼𝛼�, 𝛽𝛽̅ � as a pooling allocation that is the most preferred by the low-risk type subject to the zero-

profit condition:


                                                                  𝑃𝑃�
     �𝛼𝛼�, 𝛽𝛽̅ � = 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝑉𝑉𝐿𝐿 (𝛼𝛼, 𝛽𝛽)       s.t. β =     1−𝑃𝑃�
                                                                         𝛼𝛼

     𝛼𝛼� = 0 if (3’) holds.

     We can then establish the following Theorem on the equilibrium allocation.


     Theorem 1

     There exists a unique allocation that can be an outcome of a Nash equilibrium. It is a combination of a

pooling allocation �𝛼𝛼�, 𝛽𝛽̅ �, which is the most preferred by the low risk individual, and supplemental insurance

for high-risk type which leads him to be fully insured. The low-risk type buys zero supplemental insurance.


     More formally, the equilibrium allocation is 𝐸𝐸 ∗ ≡ {(𝛼𝛼𝐻𝐻∗ , 𝛽𝛽𝐻𝐻∗ ), (𝛼𝛼𝐿𝐿∗ , 𝛽𝛽𝐿𝐿∗ )}, where
                                                                 𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻
         𝛼𝛼𝐻𝐻∗ + 𝛽𝛽𝐻𝐻∗ = d,            and      𝛽𝛽𝐻𝐻∗ − 𝛽𝛽̅ =             (𝛼𝛼𝐻𝐻∗ − 𝛼𝛼�)
                                                                1−𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻
          𝛼𝛼𝐿𝐿∗ = 𝛼𝛼�, 𝛽𝛽𝐿𝐿∗ = 𝛽𝛽̅ .


     Note that the allocation 𝐸𝐸 ∗ , which is shown diagrammatically in Figure 5, satisfies the self-selection and the
30
zero profit constraints. The intuition for Theorem 1 is clear, given Proposition 4. Any allocation with a pooling

contract (α’, β’) other than �𝛼𝛼�, 𝛽𝛽̅ � will be upset by a contract involving �𝛼𝛼�, 𝛽𝛽̅ �, since the low type would prefer

�𝛼𝛼�, 𝛽𝛽̅ � to (α’, β’) if (α’, β’) entails more insurance than �𝛼𝛼�, 𝛽𝛽̅ �, while everyone would prefer �𝛼𝛼�, 𝛽𝛽̅ � if (α’,

β’) entails less insurance. Thus, �𝛼𝛼�, 𝛽𝛽̅ � will be preferred by the low type individuals in any case and would

“break” the putative equilibrium. 57 Proposition 4 establishes that there cannot be an equilibrium allocation with

positive supplementary insurance for the low risk type, since that would entail a pooling contract with (α’, β’)

providing less insurance than �𝛼𝛼�, 𝛽𝛽̅ �; or with less than full insurance for the high risk type, since clearly the

high risk individual would want to buy secret insurance at his own odds to get him to full insurance. 𝐸𝐸 ∗ is thus

the only possible equilibrium allocation.


4. Equilibrium Strategy

      In this section we will present a set of strategies of firms and a corresponding set of strategies of individuals

that lead to the equilibrium allocation 𝐸𝐸 ∗ , consisting of the pooling contract most preferred by the low risk

individual, and supplemental contracts at the high risk individual’s odds, bringing high risk individuals to full

insurance, proving that there exists an equilibrium in a competitive insurance market under adverse selection

when firms and individuals can choose their information strategies.


      Our analysis focuses on the strategies of firms (for reasons that will be clear shortly). We construct the set of

equilibrium strategies – contract and information strategies – that can lead to 𝐸𝐸 ∗ in two steps: 1) We first

present a simple set of strategies that entails inter-firm communication and no information revelation by

customers, which directly yields 𝐸𝐸 ∗ in the absence of any deviant strategy. 2) After showing that the proposed

strategies are not an equilibrium - there is a possible profitable deviation - we show that a slight modification of

the strategy with information revelation by customers being taken into account can sustain 𝐸𝐸 ∗ as an

equilibrium allocation.



57
     If it entails less insurance, a firm could offer a policy which made profits, being purchased only by the low types.
31
     As an equilibrium entails more than one strategy being pursued in equilibrium, that is, different firms pursue

different strategies. We will simplify the analysis, assuming that each firm offers a single insurance contract,

with an associated information strategy; that is, any given firm either offers the pooling contract with some

disclosure, or offers the price contract corresponding to the high risk individuals secretly. 58


     The hardest part of the proof is establishing that the equilibrium allocation can be sustained. This requires

that it is not possible to “break” the allocation by offering a policy that would be purchased just by the low risk

individual. This, in turn, requires that any individual purchasing the “deviant” policy be able to buy sufficient

insurance at the pooling price and that the deviant firm not know whether the (high risk) individual has done so.

Thus, this information cannot be disclosed to the deviant firm (though, of course, the other firms may not know

who is deviant). But a policy of general non-disclosure will not work, for with no disclosure at all, we have

already established that there is no equilibrium. Correspondingly, if all information is disclosed, we are in the

world of RS, where we know that a pooling equilibrium cannot be sustained.


     Thus, any equilibrium must have some form of selective disclosure based upon information revelation by

customers. The trick is determining what information should be disclosed to whom. The answer turns out to be

somewhat surprising: the insurance firm discloses its sales to individual j only to the firms who have not been

disclosed by the individual j as sellers of insurance to him.


     Simple Strategies with Inter-firm Communication and with No Revelation by Customers

     We first consider an equilibrium which is the natural generalization of the RS equilibrium, where there are

two sets of firms. One subset of firms discloses all of its information (amounts of insurance sold as well as their

identities) to all other firms and sells the pooling contract to anyone who has been revealed not to have

insurance, but zero to anyone who has been revealed to have purchased insurance. Formally, we represent this

as 59:


58
   We discuss later in this paper how the results would change if we allow a deviant firm to offer more than one insurance contract.
59
   Formally, the value of n makes no difference (since the firms are identical and nothing depends on the number of firms selling any
particular contract). For there to be plausible competition, N – 1 > n > 1.

             The second set of firms offers a price contract at the price of the high risk individual and does not reveal any

information:


                                             𝑖𝑖
                    𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗 = 𝑆𝑆2𝑗𝑗 = {𝐶𝐶2𝑗𝑗 �𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗 �, 𝟎𝟎−𝒋𝒋 },                      for j = n+1, --, N,                       (8)

             where 𝟎𝟎−𝒋𝒋       is an N-dimensional vector with all but the j-th elements being equal to 0, and

                      𝑖𝑖                𝑃𝑃                                             𝑖𝑖

             It is clear that the above set of strategies implements the equilibrium allocation. The question is, is it a Nash

equilibrium? Does it pay any firm to deviate?


             Sustainability of {𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗 }𝑗𝑗 as an Equilibrium


             RS showed that one could break a pooling equilibrium by “cream skimming,” offering a contract that would

be purchased only by low risk type individuals; but our discussion of Proposition 1 explained that the presence

of undisclosed contracts changed the analysis.


             Consider a strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑑𝑑 of a deviant firm:

                              𝑖𝑖
              𝑆𝑆𝑑𝑑 = {𝐶𝐶𝑑𝑑 �𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗 �, 𝟎𝟎},                                                                     (9)

             where

                                                               1−𝑃𝑃�

                                                                for 𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗 =0

     The contract 𝐶𝐶𝑑𝑑 �𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗 � is illustrated by B in Figure 6, a point above the high risk individual’s indifference

curve but below the low risk individual’s. 61 The strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑑𝑑 secretly 62 offers anyone with no contract

                                                                                          𝑃𝑃�
information revealed the amount 𝛼𝛼� of insurance at a price lower than                   1−𝑃𝑃�
                                                                                               .   Without 𝑆𝑆2𝑗𝑗 , the strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑑𝑑

would profitably attract only low-risk individuals, making 𝑆𝑆1𝑗𝑗 unsustainable. The possibility of non-exclusive

provision of insurance with non-disclosure, such as when some firms employ the strategy 𝑆𝑆2𝑗𝑗 , however,

reduces the scope of a profitable cream-skimming strategy. High-risk individuals as well as low-risk ones would

choose B, because when B is supplemented by the (secret) insurance at the high risk odds, the high risk

individual is better off than purchasing the pooling contract A; and with both high and low risk individuals

purchasing B, contract B makes a loss. 63


     But the strategy 𝑆𝑆2𝑗𝑗 is not able to completely eliminate the possibility of a profitable cream-skimming

strategy. Consider, for example, another deviant strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑑𝑑 ′ that is the same as 𝑆𝑆𝑑𝑑 except that it offers

contract B in Figure 7 for those with no contract information revealed, a contract with less than 𝛼𝛼�                         of

insurance. This contract will be chosen by low-risk individuals only, because it does not involve an amount of

insurance that is large enough to attract the high-risk. In other words, even with 𝑆𝑆2𝑗𝑗 , �𝛼𝛼�, 𝛽𝛽̅ � is better than B for

high-risk individuals. In general any contract in the shaded area of Figure 7, the set we defined earlier as Z in

Figure 2b 64, will always be bought by the low risk individuals but not by the high risk. Since the shaded area

always exists whenever 𝛼𝛼� > 0, the set {𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗 }𝑗𝑗 of strategies alone cannot constitute an equilibrium in the model




61
   The conditionality of the offer A is necessary to prevent high-risk individuals from choosing it and 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗 .
62
   In fact, 𝑆𝑆𝑑𝑑 may not necessarily be offered secretly. If it is disclosed to all the other firms, an individual customer would not have to
reveal his contract information to a non-deviant firm.
63
   This point was also emphasized by Jaynes (1978, 2011).
64
   This is defined as the set of policies below 𝑉𝑉𝐿𝐿 , the equilibrium indifference curve of the low risk, but above the line through A, the

     Toward an Equilibrium Strategy


     The strategies need to be modified so that any contract, such as B in Figure 7, will be chosen by the high-

risk individuals as well as the low-risk ones. To do this, we must be sure that the high risk individual can

supplement the policy {B} with enough insurance, say, at the pooling price, that he prefers {B} to {A}. The

trick is to do this in such a way that the additional contracts are not purchased in equilibrium - for if they were,

since the high risk individuals would then be buying more pooling insurance than the low risk, the pooling

contract loses money. The {contract, information} strategies we are about to describe do this.

     𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗                                                   𝑖𝑖
           is given by (4) while a contract strategy 𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗 (𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗   �𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 ) is given by (5). 𝑆𝑆2𝑗𝑗 remain unchanged, but
                                                                 ; 𝐷𝐷

strategy 𝑆𝑆1𝑗𝑗∗ has to be modified to offer a consumer i with the revealed contract information about purchases

               𝑖𝑖
from others (𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗 ) additional insurance to bring the total amount of insurance up to at least 𝛼𝛼�                    66
                                                                                                                            ; while

disclosing information on the identities it has of the individual’s insurers (including its own identity) to all the

firms other than the insurers revealed by the consumer. 67


     More formally, we consider the following set {𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗∗ }𝑗𝑗 of strategies


                                 𝑖𝑖
     𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗∗ = 𝑆𝑆1𝑗𝑗∗ = {𝐶𝐶1𝑗𝑗∗ (𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗   �𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 ), 𝐼𝐼𝑗𝑗∗ (𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 )}
                                     ; 𝐷𝐷                          for j = 1, --, n, (1 < n < N)              (10)

     where
                                      �
           𝑖𝑖
 𝐶𝐶1𝑗𝑗∗ (𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗   �𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝜇𝜇(1, 𝑃𝑃 ), μ ∈ [0, 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 �𝛼𝛼� − 𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗
               ; 𝐷𝐷                                            𝑖𝑖
                                                                   , 0�            for  �𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 = ∅
                                                                                        𝐷𝐷
                                1−𝑃𝑃�
                       = 0                                                               �𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 ≠ ∅ ,
                                                                                    for 𝐷𝐷                    (11)




65
   When (3) holds so that 𝛼𝛼� = 0, the equilibrium strategy would be just 𝑆𝑆2, since the contract �𝛼𝛼�, 𝛽𝛽̅ � becomes {0,0}. In this case,
the equilibrium strategy and outcome would be the same as those in Akerlof (1970), Ales-Maziero (2011) and Attar-Mariote-Salanie
(2014).
66
   If the individual has already purchased more than 𝛼𝛼� from others, then nothing is sold to him.
67
   With a slightly different information structure, it is even easier under some circumstances to sustain the pooling contract, even
without the modifications we are about to describe. Consider the case noted earlier where firms offer only 0 or the full pooling
insurance. Then if the two individuals are very similar, so A and C are near each other, it may be that VH(A + B) < VH(C), so that B
separates even without disclosure of purchases of pooling contracts.
35
      and 𝐼𝐼𝑗𝑗∗ (𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 ) is an N-dimensional vector with all the d-th elements (where d ∈ 𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 ), being equal to 0 and

with all the others being equal to 1. 68 The contract strategy brings the individual’s (known) total purchases of

insurance up to (at least) 𝛼𝛼�.


      𝐼𝐼𝑗𝑗∗ (𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 ) is critically different from that of earlier analysis (7), and consists of two parts: disclosing

information on the identities of firms from which a customer i revealed purchasing insurance at the pooling

price to all the firms other than the insurer(s) revealed by the individual i himself, i.e., to all j′ (∉ 𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 ), and not


disclosing the identities of insurers for i to any of the insurer(s) revealed by i himself, i.e., to any j′ ∈ 𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 . There

are two features of the information strategy 𝐼𝐼𝑗𝑗∗ (𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 ) that should be noted. First, it is consumer’s revelation (in

Stage 2), that determines the information disclosure of a firm (in Stage 3). 69 Second, the information strategy

𝐼𝐼𝑗𝑗∗ (𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 ) entails the precise kind of disclosure that can implement the kind of exclusivity necessary to support the

equilibrium allocation 𝐸𝐸 ∗ . 70


      For simplicity we will hereafter omit the subscript j (not the subscript (-j)) in specifying strategies of a firm j

by denoting 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗∗ (≡ {𝑆𝑆1𝑗𝑗∗ , 𝑆𝑆2𝑗𝑗∗ } by 𝑆𝑆 ∗ (≡ {𝑆𝑆1∗ , 𝑆𝑆2∗ }), for example.



      Truthful Revelation of Information by Individuals


      We now assess an individual’s incentive to reveal his contract information to potential insurers, given the

strategy 𝑆𝑆 ∗ . We first prove the following Proposition.


      Proposition 5.

      Given the information revelation strategies of the firms, there exists at least one firm that will have complete

information about any consumer’s purchases of pooling insurance.


68
     Recall that 𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 is a set of identities of insurers of i, who are revealed by i himself.
69
     Not another firm’s disclosure in Stage 3—commitments about which were made in stage 1.
70
     We will show below that this type of a selective disclosure policy is a dominant information strategy for a firm.
36
     Proof: Fix a particular consumer. There are N firms; suppose that the consumer buys insurance from 𝐾𝐾 ≤ 𝑁𝑁

of them. The rest 𝑁𝑁 − 𝐾𝐾 firms (if any) do not matter since they do not share any information and simply

passively receive information. Thus it is without loss to focus on the 𝐾𝐾 firms that have sold a positive amount

of insurance to the consumer.

     A firm can get information in three ways: first of all, by assumption, each firm has information about its

own sales. In addition, the customer may reveal information about his purchases from other firms. Finally,

given the equilibrium strategy other firms will disclose information about this consumer to those firms who

have not been revealed to be its insurers.

     We can represent this by a 𝐾𝐾-by-𝐾𝐾 matrix 𝐴𝐴 with only zeros and ones as entries. An entry of 1 in the 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

place means that firm 𝑖𝑖 has information about firm 𝑗𝑗’s sales to a particular (fixed) consumer, while an entry of

0 means that 𝑖𝑖 doesn’t have information about 𝑗𝑗’s sales.

     The matrix starts out with ones on the diagonal (that is. 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 1 ∀𝑖𝑖 = 1,2, … , 𝐾𝐾 since by assumption each

firm knows its own sales to this consumer), plus perhaps some other nonzero entries, where that consumer

revealed any information. The information sharing/updating algorithm then takes the following form:

     Step 1: entries are generated according to the consumer’s information revelation strategy.
                   𝑛𝑛                𝑛𝑛+1         𝑛𝑛        𝑛𝑛
     Step 𝑛𝑛: if 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 0, then 𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗  = max{𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 } for 𝑘𝑘 = 1,2, … , 𝐾𝐾.

     where the superscript refers to the step in the algorithm. We denote by 𝐴𝐴𝑛𝑛 the information matrix at the end

of step 𝑛𝑛. The updating step is reflecting the fact that if any firm 𝑖𝑖 doesn’t have information that 𝑗𝑗 has been

revealed as a seller of insurance for this consumer, then at the next step it will reveal everything it knows to 𝑗𝑗,

so that 𝑗𝑗, in turn, will know everything it already knew, as well as anything 𝑖𝑖 knew for all other firms for this

particular consumer.

         We now prove the proposition by contradiction – suppose that the algorithm has stopped updating 71,

namely, that 𝐴𝐴𝑛𝑛 = 𝐴𝐴𝑛𝑛+1 and yet there is no firm with a complete knowledge of that consumer’s purchases. In


71
  Clearly, once the algorithm stops updating, it will never start updating again. Moreover, the algorithm will, in fact converge, since
once an entry changes from a 0 to a 1, it will never change back and there are a finite number of entries.
37
the language of this algorithm this means that there is a zero in every row. Also, since the entries are not

changing at this point, we do not have to keep track of the superscript. In particular, say that 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 0 for

firm/row 𝑖𝑖 with 𝑖𝑖 ≠ 𝑗𝑗 so that 𝑖𝑖 doesn’t know that 𝑗𝑗 is a seller of insurance for this consumer. Then we must

have 𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 1 since 𝑖𝑖 would reveal everything it knows to 𝑗𝑗. By definition, for firm/row 𝑗𝑗 then, for all 𝑘𝑘 =

1,2, … , 𝐾𝐾 we have that 𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = max{𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 }. In other words, since 𝑗𝑗 has 𝑖𝑖’s information, it knows everything

is ever knew itself, plus whatever 𝑖𝑖 knows. Note that we’re using the fact that the algorithm has converged

here in asserting this; this would not necessarily be true if the algorithm is still operating. If the 𝑗𝑗’th row does

not contain any zeros, we are done, since then 𝑗𝑗 has complete information about this consumer. Suppose to the

contrary, then, that there is a zero for some 𝑘𝑘 ≠ 𝑖𝑖, 𝑗𝑗 𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 0 (𝑘𝑘 cannot be the same as 𝑗𝑗 by assumption of

own knowledge of sales, and it cannot be 𝑖𝑖 by the deduction above). Thus there is some firm 𝑘𝑘 for whom 𝑗𝑗

doesn’t have information and so 𝑎𝑎𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 = 1. Note that this also means that 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 0 since otherwise 𝑖𝑖 would

have known about 𝑘𝑘’s sales, which it would have revealed to 𝑗𝑗. The latter fact implies that 𝑎𝑎𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 = 1. By the

updating rule, for 𝑙𝑙 = 1,2, … , 𝐾𝐾, 𝑎𝑎𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 = max{𝑎𝑎𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 , 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 }   and 𝑎𝑎𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 = max{𝑎𝑎𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 , 𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 }. Thus we have that 𝑎𝑎𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 =

𝑎𝑎𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 = 𝑎𝑎𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 = 1. If 𝐾𝐾 = 3 we are done. If not, suppose that 𝑎𝑎𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 = 0 for some 𝑙𝑙 ≠ 𝑖𝑖, 𝑗𝑗, 𝑘𝑘. Then 𝑎𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 = 1 and

for 𝑚𝑚 = 1,2, … , 𝐾𝐾 we have that 𝑎𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 = max{𝑎𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 , 𝑎𝑎𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 }. Thus we have that 𝑎𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 = 𝑎𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 = 𝑎𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 = 𝑎𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 = 1, using

the previous steps. In other words, this row has four ones, which means that firm 𝑙𝑙 has information about its

own sales, plus those of three other firms. If 𝐾𝐾 = 4 we are done. If not, we proceed in the same way, at each

step constructing a firm that knows strictly more than the others. Since 𝐾𝐾 is finite, this second algorithm also

converges and will produce a row of ones of length 𝐾𝐾 which contradicts our original assumption that there is

no firm that has complete information. This completes the proof.


     Since there will be some firm with full information for any consumer, that firm will cancel its insurance

contract if the total purchases of insurance for that consumer exceed 𝛼𝛼� (recall that by Theorem 1 there is a

unique outcome that can be sustained in equilibrium, so 𝛼𝛼� is indeed the threshold for cancellation). In this

event the consumer will be left with less than 𝛼𝛼� of insurance bought at the pooling price and therefore worse

38
off than if he purchased just 𝛼𝛼�. Thus, under the given strategies, the consumer—even the high risk individual--

has a strict incentive to truthfully reveal all purchases of insurance at the pooling price and to purchase no more

than 𝛼𝛼�.


     Under-reporting by CM cannot occur in equilibrium. No firm would not agree to it without charging a price
                      𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻
at least equal to             (since it knows for sure that any individual requesting CM is high-risk). But high risk
                     1−𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻

                                                                                             𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻
individuals are at least as well of purchasing secret insurance at the price                         .
                                                                                            1−𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻



     Of course, high risk individuals (or their insurance firms) do not reveal their purchases of the supplemental

policies at the high risk price, because if they did so (truthfully), then all those selling pooling contracts would

condition their sales on such supplemental policies not being bought (for such purchases reveal that the

individual is high risk). 72


     Equilibrium Existence


     We now establish the main Theorem on the existence of equilibrium.


     We now prove 73.


     Theorem 2

     Under Assumptions A , the set 𝑆𝑆 ∗ (≡ {𝑆𝑆1∗ , 𝑆𝑆2∗ }) of strategies described above constitutes an equilibrium,

and supports the equilibrium allocation 𝐸𝐸 ∗ ≡ {(𝛼𝛼𝐻𝐻∗ , 𝛽𝛽𝐻𝐻∗ ), (𝛼𝛼𝐿𝐿∗ , 𝛽𝛽𝐿𝐿∗ )}.


     Proof:


72
   More formally, our strategies S1 entail the individual’s insurers sales of the pooling contract being reduced by the amount of
(disclosed) purchases of supplemental insurance. Hence no high risk individual would make such a disclosure. Later, we analyze
incentives for disclosure of purchases of out of equilibrium offers of insurance.
73
   Throughout we make use of the following assumption: if any firm offers a contract that yields the same utility for a consumer
relative to the entire profile of strategies (and in particular, relative to the equilibrium profile) then no consumer will purchase that
contract. This is essentially a tie-breaking assumption (if a consumer is indifferent, he follows the prescribed strategy instead of
deviating and choosing this other contract) and in equilibrium this can be viewed as focusing on an equilibrium in weakly dominant
strategies.
39
                                  𝑃𝑃�
      In purchasing 𝛼𝛼� at       1−𝑃𝑃�
                                         from 𝑆𝑆1∗ , an individual may either choose to purchase the whole 𝛼𝛼� from one

insurer or choose to purchase partitions of 𝛼𝛼� from multiple insurers. In the former case 𝑆𝑆1∗ coincides with S1

defined in (7). The strategy 𝑆𝑆1∗ plays a critical role in the determination of 𝐸𝐸 ∗ by limiting the total amount

                    𝑃𝑃�
purchased at       1−𝑃𝑃�
                           from all the firms as a whole to 𝛼𝛼�, which is made possible by the information strategy

𝐼𝐼 ∗ �𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 � (firms’ disclosure policy, in particular) together with Proposition 5 ensuring that at least one firm that

has sold j a pooling policy is fully informed about purchases of pooling insurance.



      We prove the theorem by noting what restrictions on the possible outcome have been made by the preceding

results, and then show that the profile of strategies for firms and consumers satisfies these restrictions, and in

addition, is robust to deviations.


      First, we recall the fact that Theorem 1 and the preceding discussion showed that there is a unique

outcome/allocation that can even potentially be an equilibrium. Secondly, Proposition 5 showed that consumers

who try to manipulate their disclosure policy (relative to what is prescribed for them by 𝑆𝑆 ∗ ) will have some or

all of their contracts cancelled. Thus, in any putative equilibrium, given the unique possible outcome, if

consumers manipulate their strategies, they will be left on a lower indifference curve relative to the candidate

equilibrium allocation. Therefore, they will, in fact, reveal truthfully. That is, no consumer can profitably

deviate against any strategy of firms that a) results in the equilibrium allocation and b) utilizes the information

disclosure policy as specified in the previous discussion.



      Consider now the firms’ side; clearly, no firm can do better by changing the price it charges for the secret

supplemental insurance, so we only have to consider the pooling contracts and the associated disclosure

policies. We consider separately the two possible types of deviant contract strategies: one, called 𝑆𝑆𝑑𝑑ℎ , which

                                                            𝑃𝑃�                                                                𝑃𝑃�
entails charging a price that is not lower than           1−𝑃𝑃�
                                                                  , and the other, 𝑆𝑆𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑙 , with a price that is lower than   1−𝑃𝑃�
                                                                                                                                      74F
                                                                                                                                            74
                                                                                                                                                 and


74
     A deviant strategy is allowed to use all the contract information including price of insurance, while the equilibrium strategy uses a
40
finally consider a strategy that involves only deviations with regard to information revelation.


                                                                                         𝑃𝑃�
     Suppose that a firm deviates to charging a price that is weakly higher than        1−𝑃𝑃�
                                                                                                for the pooling contract, and

adopts any information revelation strategy. The fact that this argument works for any information revelation

strategy is crucial, but it is also obvious. Using the (tie-breaking/weakly dominant strategy) assumption that if a

contract that just breaks even relative to the other candidate equilibrium contracts is offered, no player takes up

this contract. Thus, no low-risk types purchase this contract and therefore it cannot make a profit, so this cannot

be a profitable deviation.


     Now consider a deviation to a contract policy 𝑆𝑆𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑙 which charges strictly less for the pooling contract, and

again use any information strategy for the firm. Recall that Nash equilibrium only requires robustness against

unilateral deviations. Since this policy makes all consumers better off, they all purchase it. One key step here is

that the consumers would not reveal to a deviant firm their pooling insurance purchased elsewhere particularly

if its strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑙 entails exclusivity, i.e., requiring no other policies to be purchased. Another key step is, given

their information disclosure strategy, they would all reveal the purchase of a deviant policy to their non-deviant

insurers. This will have two important consequences. First, the revelation by consumers induces their non-

deviant insurers not to disclose their sales to the deviant firm (by their equilibrium information strategy

𝐼𝐼 ∗ (𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 )), leaving the firm uninformed of the consumers’ purchases from the non-deviant insurers. Second, given

that they reveal the purchase of a deviant policy, if the total amount of their insurance exceeds 𝛼𝛼�, some

contracts are cancelled, and they end up worse off, by the same argument as above. Given firm strategies, all

consumers have an incentive to buy at least 𝛼𝛼�. If all consumers purchase 𝛼𝛼�, there are no cancellations, and

since the high risk individuals buy it as well as the low risk, the policy makes a loss and hence cannot be a

profitable deviation.      If a deviant strategy 𝑆𝑆𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑙 does not entail exclusivity or if it entails CM (contract

manipulation), on the other hand, it should attract high-risk individuals whenever the same deviant strategy but




subset of it – insurance amounts purchased and identities of insurers.
41
with exclusivity and without CM does. This is because a strategy with no exclusivity or with CM allows

consumers to purchase more pooling insurance than they could under the same strategy but with exclusivity and

no CM.


     Suppose finally that a deviant firm does not alter its contract policy but instead changes only its information

revelation policy. The only way it can make positive profits is if it engages in cream-skimming. There are only

two ways it can alter its information policy: by not revealing purchases of the pooling contract to those who

under the equilibrium strategies it reveals, or revealing information to those who under the equilibrium

strategies it does not reveal. The former would attract all the high risk individuals (who might hope that thereby

they could avoid detection of buying more than 𝛼𝛼�), so obviously makes a loss. The latter will not deter high

risk individuals (because their optimal strategies entails, in any case, truth telling). Thus, it does not increase

profits. 75


       Hence, this is a Nash equilibrium.


     A final observation: there is a simple way of seeing the difference between our equilibrium and the standard

reactive equilibrium, in which responses to an out-of-equilibrium behavior of a deviant firm destroys the

seemingly profitable opportunities for an entrant. In our analysis, a firm j responds in the same way to contract

information about its customer with a firm j′, regardless of whether the firm j′ is a deviant or a non-deviant

                                                        𝑖𝑖
firm. (Firms base their behavior simply on the amount 𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗 of insurance purchased and the identities 𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 of the

insurers revealed.)


5. Further Discussion

     Uniqueness of Equilibrium




75
   Our definition of equilibrium requires that there be a strictly profitable deviation. Note that if all firms but one deviated by
disclosure to other firms selling the pooling contract, exclusivity could be enforced by that firm, and it could engage in cream
skimming against the rest. This disclosure policy would thus result in a loss of profits.
42
     The equilibrium is not unique: there are other information strategies that can, together with the same

                          𝑖𝑖
contract strategy 𝐶𝐶1∗ (𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗   � 𝑖𝑖 ) (defined in (11)), sustain the equilibrium outcome 𝐸𝐸 ∗ . There are also other
                              ; 𝐷𝐷

contract strategies that also can implement the equilibrium allocation E*. Suppose, for example, that there are

two groups of firms: K firms in group 1 and (N-K) firms in group 2, in each of which a firm shares with the

other members any contract information. Taking each of the two groups as an individual firm, we can think of

the following information strategy that is essentially the same as the information strategy 𝐼𝐼 ∗ (𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ): 1) to reveal

its contract information on 𝑆𝑆1∗ for its customer i to its own group, 2) to reveal contract information for i to the

other group if the other group has no revealed insurer; but not to reveal the contract information for i to the

other group if the other group has a revealed insurer. 76 This information strategy, together with the contract

                 𝑖𝑖
strategy 𝐶𝐶1∗ (𝛼𝛼−𝑗𝑗   � 𝑖𝑖 ), can be shown to constitute an equilibrium.
                     ; 𝐷𝐷


     Extensions to Cases with Many Types

     The result on existence of equilibrium can be extended to the case with many types. (See Stiglitz-Yun

[2016].) An equilibrium strategy in a case with the three types, for example, can be described in a similar way

to the case with two-types. As indicated in Figure 8, there is a pooling contract with all three types, contract A,

the most preferred by the lowest risk type; and a partial pooling contract B with additional insurance pooling

together the two riskiest types, where B is the most preferred along the zero profit line for partial pooling; and

finally, a contract C, providing full insurance to the highest risk type. In equilibrium consumers purchase A only

or A and B or A, B and C, depending upon their types. Consumers truthfully fully reveal to the other insurers

their information about their purchases of the fully pooling contract A (since all purchase the same amount,

such information in equilibrium reveals no information about who they are). Consumers reveal information

about their purchases of the partial pooling policies B only to firms not (revealed to be) selling the fully pooling

policy77. There are three types of firms, those selling the full pooling contract, those selling the partial pooling



76
   The two groups can be thought of as “clubs,” or information sharing associations. Our analysis shows that there can exist an
equilibrium with more than one such association.
77
   As always in this paper, what matters is not firm offers, but firm sales to a particular individual.
43
contract, and those selling the price contract to the high risk individuals. They adopt the same information

strategy as in the case of two types of individuals. 78 Proposition 5 can be generalized to the case with many

types. 79


     By the same reasoning as in the two-type case, there is no room for a deviant contract offering 𝛼𝛼� that

profitably attracts low or medium types, as shown in Figure 8, as riskier types are also induced to choose 𝛼𝛼� by

the equilibrium strategy (as illustrated by the dotted arrow in Figure 8). 80


     This argument can also be applied to the case with continuum types as well. In a case with continuum types

of individuals, where an individual of type θ, for whom the probability of accident is 𝑃𝑃𝜃𝜃 , is distributed over

[𝜃𝜃1 , 𝜃𝜃2 ] with an arbitrary but commonly known, atomless and differentiable distribution with a finite density,

we can think of an equilibrium insurance-premium schedule as depicted by a bold curve in Figure 9. This

schedule generates an equilibrium allocation 𝐸𝐸� , where, say, (a) B in Figure 9 is the optimal point along the

                                                                                                     𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑        𝑃𝑃(𝜃𝜃′)
locus for type θ′ ; and (b) at B (at the optimal insurance α(θ′) for the type θ′),                   𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
                                                                                                            =              where 𝑃𝑃(𝜃𝜃′) is
                                                                                                                1−𝑃𝑃(𝜃𝜃′)



the population weighted average probability of an accident for types θ higher than 𝜃𝜃′ , i.e. the marginal cost

for additional insurance is the break-even price among the riskier individuals buying that policy. Stiglitz-Yun

(2016) shows that there exists an insurance-premium schedule yielding zero profits for each level of partial

pooling insurance, and that with information strategies analogous to those described above, this constitutes an

equilibrium.


     Equilibrium in the Extended Strategy Space


     Once we extend the strategy space of firms so that contract sales to an individual can be conditioned on the


78
   That is, revealing information only to firms not revealed to be sellers to individuals, where a firm reveals information that he has
sold insurance to a particular individual, but also information that he has about the sales of others.
79
   In fact, in the three-type case, an individual has an additional incentive to disclose his purchase from a fully pooling seller, because
otherwise his potential insurer (or a partially pooling seller) discloses to his fully pooling insurer, who then would cancel (in Stage 3)
the contract it sold to him.
80
   By the same token, there is no incentive for contract manipulation.
44
price as well as the amount of insurance purchased and the identity of the insurer, and information revelation

strategies specify the revelation of not just to whom insurance has been sold (from whom the insurance has been

bought) and the amounts of insurance, but also the price, we can formulate a slightly different {information,

contract} strategy supporting the same equilibrium allocation 𝐸𝐸 ∗ , as is shown in the Appendix A. In some ways

the analysis of the equilibrium is simpler, but it requires using latent policies, policies which are only sold in

response to out of equilibrium offers by other insurance firms but which are not purchased in equilibrium. Also,

the information strategy of a firm requires a simpler set of contract information to be revealed: its own identity

(as an insurer of an individual i) only, not the identities of other insurers revealed by its customer. 81


     Deviants who offer multiple contracts

     In the Nash Equilibrium described above, each firm offers a single insurance contract. If we allow for the

possibility that a deviant firm can offer multiple policies, 82 we can show that the main results still hold, but to

do so, we need to modify our equilibrium concept - there can’t exist a set policies which a deviant firm could

offer which would be profitable. Appendix B shows that while the set 𝑆𝑆 ∗ of strategies defined by (10) and (11)

is not an equilibrium (it is not immune against profitable entry), a slight modification of the strategies

constitutes an equilibrium.


6. Welfare Properties of Equilibrium

     As always, the assessment of the Pareto efficiency of the market has to be conducted relative to the

information that is or might be available to the government and the feasible mechanisms for redistribution. If

the government knew who were the low and high risk individuals, it would clearly provide complete insurance

to each, with the nature and magnitude of the redistributions dependent on the available set of redistributive

mechanisms and the nature of the social welfare function. Stiglitz (2009) provides a fuller analysis of the Pareto

frontier in the presence of asymmetric information, where the government controls fully the provision of


81
   We have also explored models in which insurance is purchased sequentially, with sales at any point being conditional on previous
purchases. Preliminary analysis suggests that E* can be implemented using a simpler information strategy than that discussed in this
paper.
82
   This possibility is also raised and discussed by Attar-Mariotti-Salanie (2016).
45
insurance and there are costless redistributions. The high risk individual will, as here, get full insurance, but the

low risk individual will obtain a RS separating policy, whether or not that policy is sustainable as part of a

market equilibrium. The RS equilibrium, when it exists, is Pareto efficient. When the RS equilibrium does not

exist, the Pareto set of contracts entails a subsidy from the low risk individuals to the high risk individuals. In

the equilibrium here, there is a subsidy from the low risk to the high risk through the pooling insurance policy.

But the subsidy is not as efficient as we can obtain when the government fully controls information.


      Any welfare differences between government and private provision arises not from any innate greater

ability of government in the provision of insurance or in its information, but from differences in its incentives.

In models of adverse selection, such as explored here, both the welfare losses and the complexities associated

with insurance contracts and information sharing arise simply because of the incentives to cream skim, and the

attempts by those providing pooling (or partially pooling) contracts to prevent cream skimming. 83 The

government’s objective is not to maximize its own profits (either in equilibrium or in response to out of

equilibrium moves by others), but to ensure that the equilibrium that emerges, given its contract and information

strategies, maximizes social welfare.


     The RS equilibrium is Pareto efficient, given that the government can control the private secret provision of

information (ensuring exclusivity can be enforced). The problem is that the government cannot fully control the

provision of insurance or the information flows concerning its purchase. Insurance is embedded in a myriad of

economic and social relations. (Arnott-Stiglitz, 1991b.. And the government cannot force fully the disclosure of

all of these explicit and implicit insurance contracts.


     This paper has made clear that the inability to control fully the provision of insurance and information about

insurance purchased 84 leads to an equilibrium different from the RS allocation, and indeed different from any


83
  In addition, when firms have some monopoly power, they attempt to discriminate, including through the use of self-selection
mechanisms. There are welfare costs associated with this price discrimination. See Stiglitz (1977).

  The problem is worsened by the fact that, as Arnott and Stiglitz emphasize, much insurance is informal, provided by families, or
implicit, hidden inside employment or other contracts.
46
Pareto efficient allocation - assuming that the private provision of insurance could be controlled. Accordingly,

the private provision of insurance can be thought of as welfare-decreasing. Matters would be better if the

government could proscribe these other sources of insurance provision. But it cannot. Still, there is a

presumption that there exist indirect controls (taxes) or other actions of the government that affect (limit) the

provision of private insurance and increase information flows. But the theory of the second best provides an

important warning: there are some interventions that seemingly improve information (or which limit insurance)

which might have a more ambiguous effect on welfare. For instance, government could establish a national

registry for all (contractual) insurance, 85 which would enable the economy to create the RS equilibrium when it

exists. But in contrast to the model presented here, where there always exists an equilibrium, there are plausible

circumstances in which equilibrium does not exist - indeed, it never exists in the standard insurance model when

there exists a continuum of types. 86


     In comparing the equilibrium described here (where the government imposes no restrictions on the private

provision of insurance and information flows), which for brevity we refer to as the SYK equilibrium, and that

where it controls both fully (the welfare analysis relevant to RS), it is clear that the high risk individuals are

better off. And whenever the RS equilibrium exists, the expected utility of the low risk individual is higher in

the RS equilibrium than in the SYK equilibrium. For we know that the RS equilibrium exists if and only if the

pooling contract most preferred by the low risk types yields a lower level of utility than the separating

contract. 87   88
                    Because when the RS equilibrium exists, one group is worse off in that equilibrium compared to

the SYK equilibrium, one group better off, neither equilibrium Pareto dominates the other. Obviously, with a

sufficiently inequality averse social welfare function, the SYK equilibrium yields a higher level of social


85
   Obviously, non-contractual insurance, such as that provided within the family, would not be included in the registry.

   See Stiglitz (2009).
87
   The pooling contract is preferred (not preferred) to the separating contract provided that (for a given utility function) the differences
are not too large (small). In particular, it is a standard result that, given the utility functions and say 𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 , there exists a ∆𝑝𝑝̂ (>0) , such
that if 𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻 − 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 > (<)∆𝑝𝑝̂ , there exists (does not exist) an equilibrium, i.e. the separating contract is preferred (not preferred) to the
pooling contract.
88
   More precisely, we know that in the RS equilibrium, the high risk individual is indifferent between the contract of the low risk
individual and his full insurance; here the high risk individual strictly prefers his contract. Moreover, in RS, there is no subsidy from
the low risk to the high risk individuals, here there is, through the pooling contract. Accordingly, the insurance obtained by the low
risk individual here is unambiguously worse than in the RS equilibrium.

welfare than the RS equilibrium. 89


     This leads to the difficult question, which we cannot answer here: in the context of adverse selection, are

there ways by which the government could preclude some insurance and/or force more disclosure which would

be welfare increasing? 90


7.   Concluding Remarks

     When contracts are traded with contract information being revealed by firms or by individuals, it is natural

to suppose that firms condition their contracts for an individual upon contract information that is revealed. More

specifically, the strategy of a firm includes what to reveal to whom, as well as which contracts to offer,

conditional upon what (revealed) contract information. Individuals, on the other hand, respond to strategies of

firms by choosing contracts to purchase as well as by deciding on which contract information to reveal to

whom.


     Expanding the equilibrium construct to include equilibrium information revelation strategies is complex, but

in fact helps resolve some longstanding conundrums in information economics. There were two unsettling

aspects of the Rothschild-Stiglitz analysis. The first was that equilibrium often did not exist. In their model with

two types, equilibrium only existed if the two types were not too different in accident probabilities; but if there

were a continuum of types, equilibrium never existed. 91


     The second unsettling aspect of the standard model was that if an equilibrium existed, it was never a pooling

equilibrium. In real life there existed pooling contracts. This led to several attempts to formulate alternative


89
   Here, we are simply comparing the market equilibria that emerge with two different information structures. We have shown that the
equilibrium in the “better” information structure (RS) does not Pareto dominate that in the worse information structure (SYK). But in
the better information structure, there is a government policy (a “lump sum” tax on low priced insurance used to finance a lump sum
subsidy on high priced insurance) which will lead to an equilibrium which Pareto dominates the SYK equilibrium.
90
   Arnott and Stiglitz (1991b) analyze the analogous problem in the context of moral hazard. The essential insight is that if non-
disclosed insurance entails good monitoring, it can be welfare enhancing: public (disclosed) insurance free rides on the monitoring
services of the non-disclosed insurance. Otherwise, it will be welfare-decreasing.
91
   The only possible equilibrium was a fully separating equilibrium; but there always existed a pooling contract that “broke” such an
equilibrium, because the separating equilibrium separated types that were arbitrarily close to each other. That is, there was always a
pooling contract that grouped all of the highest risk individuals together and would be preferred by all of the high risk individuals to
the separating contract. See Stiglitz (2009).
48
equilibrium concepts, most famously by Wilson (1977) and Riley (1979). These were “reactive” equilibria, in

which existing firms responded to the new firm by discontinuing to offer a policy that was no longer profitable

once the new contract was offered. Rothschild and Stiglitz had deliberately formulated their analysis of

competitive insurance markets as a Nash equilibrium, because they wanted to investigate what would happen if

all firms were very small, sufficiently small that no firm by itself could upset an entire market equilibrium.


     The equilibria analyzed here are not reactive equilibria, though market participants are allowed to condition

offers upon observables. What is observable is, at least in part, endogenous. Endogenizing the information

structure/revelation dramatically changes the standard results on the nature and existence of equilibrium. The

earlier work of Akerlof and Rothschild-Stiglitz had, of course, shown the importance of the information

structure: information about insurance purchased conveyed important information about the individual’s type,

and therefore, whether that information was available was central in determining the nature of the equilibrium.

The RS equilibrium could not be sustained without sufficient information about insurance purchases to enforce

exclusivity. And the Akerlof price-equilibrium could not be sustained in a world without full anonymity.

Typically, firms at least know about the amount of insurance that they sell to any particular individual.

Allowing undisclosed contracts and incorporating realistic assumptions about things that insurance firms know,

that they know the identities of their customers and the quantities purchased destroys both the Rothschild-

Stiglitz and the Akerlof equilibria.


     When we endogenize information revelation, the unique equilibrium allocation is a partially disclosed

pooling contract - the pooling contract most preferred by the low risk individual 92 - plus undisclosed

supplemental insurance for the high risk individuals and no supplemental insurance for the low risk individuals.


     There were two difficult parts of the analysis: determining the information structure - what to reveal to

whom - that sustains equilibrium; and establishing the sustainability of the pooling contract. Here, the trick was



92
  That is, the pooling allocation at the population weighted accident probabilities most preferred by low-risk individuals. (This
pooling contract is that upon which Wilson [1977] focused.)
49
to find information and contract strategies that ensured that a contract that attempted to cream skim the low risk

individuals would fail - any such policy would be purchased by the high risk as well, as high risk individuals

supplemented and/or changed in other ways what they would otherwise have purchased. We showed that one

could always find such strategies.


     The endogenously determined equilibrium informational structure 93 entails full non-disclosure of

information on some of the contracts that are traded in equilibrium, with selective disclosure by firms to each

other of pooling contract purchases (depending on whether a firm has been disclosed to be a seller to a

particular individual). In equilibrium, consumers, on the other hand, truthfully reveal their insurance purchases

to all firms. This information revelation by consumers was shown to be crucial in ensuring the existence of

equilibrium.


      We show that this information strategy can sustain the equilibrium against deviant policies - that is, no firm

can profitably offer an alternative policy or pursue an alternative information strategy.


     The insurance model has proven a useful tool for analyzing more generally markets with asymmetric

information, and the papers analyzing imperfect and asymmetric information in that context have spawned a

huge literature, applying the concepts to a rich variety of institutional structures 94. The natural information

assumptions, both concerning potentially hidden actions and potentially hidden characteristics, differ across

markets. This paper has raised questions about both the Akerlof and RS analyses, in both of which information

structures are assumed fixed (though they differ between them). It has shown the lack of generality of both the

results concerning existence and the characterization of equilibrium. Accordingly, it raises questions about the

results in the large literature based on them. In some ways, the results presented here are more consonant with


93
    We showed that the equilibrium allocation can be supported by other information strategies as well.
94
    These papers, as we have noted, include not only the Akerlof and RS models of adverse selection upon which we have focused, but
also the models of moral hazard (including the early and canonical models of Arrow [1963], Arnott-Stiglitz [1988], and Pauly [1974]).
It is important to recognize that, for the most part, these models were not intended to provide a good institutional analysis of the
insurance market; rather, the insurance market provided the paradigm for studying behavior in, for example, labor, product, and
capital markets because it seemed so simple to strip away these institutional details, and study markets unencumbered by them. It was
for this reason that these paradigmic models proved so fruitful. The analysis of this paper should be taken in the same spirit.

what is observed than either those of Akerlof or RS. While RS showed that equilibrium might not exist - and an

easy extension of RS shows that with a continuum of types, equilibrium never exists - we do see markets

seemingly working 95; and while RS showed that pooling contracts never exist, we do see pooling contracts. 96

In some ways, then, the equilibrium that arises with endogenous information looks much more like observed

equilibria: it always exists, and always entails some degree of pooling.


     We hope that this paper will, like the earlier RS and Akerlof analyses, spawn further research in the context

of other markets in the analysis of market equilibrium with asymmetric information where contracts and the

information structure/revelation are endogenously and simultaneously determined.




95
   Though insurance markets often do not work well, and there may be other reasons that we do not see as much entry and exit (or the
Dasgupta-Maskin (1986) mixed strategies) as the RS non-existence of equilibrium would suggest, e.g. imperfections of competition
and costly search.
96
   There are, of course, other reasons that pooling equilibria may exist, related to problems of non-commitment and/or moral hazard.
See, e.g. Roberts (1984), Stiglitz (2013b), Gale and Stiglitz (1989) and Stiglitz and Yun (2013).

     Theorem 3

     Under Assumption A, the set 𝑆𝑆 𝐸𝐸 of strategies described above constitutes an equilibrium, and supports the

equilibrium allocation 𝐸𝐸 ∗.


      The proof of Theorem 3 is similar to that of Theorem 2. First of all, given the strategy 𝑆𝑆 𝐸𝐸 adopted by all the firms,

Proposition 5 holds as all the firms have complete information about the purchases of pooling insurance by all consumers,

implying that the equilibrium allocation 𝐸𝐸 ∗ will be realized. Next, as for the robustness of an equilibrium in response to

any deviancy, the same argument used in the proof of Theorem 2 can be applied here, except for the two following. First,



97
   Latent policies have been employed elsewhere in the literature in insurance with asymmetric information, e.g. Arnott and Stiglitz
(1987, 1991a), and widely employed particularly in the literature on adverse selection with non-exclusivity, such as Jaynes (1978,
2011), Ales-Maziero (2012) and Attar-Mariotti-Salanie (2011, 2016). The term seems to have been first used by Arnott and Stiglitz.

        Appendix B: Deviants using Multiple Contracts

        In this appendix, we consider the possibility of a deviant firm offering a pair of contracts. It does so to induce self-

selection among the applicants - with the self-selection process reducing the costs of the high risk individuals buying

insurance from the deviant. We first explain why the set of strategies considered earlier now doesn’t “work”; we then

describe intuitively the challenges involved in finding an equilibrium strategy. Next we provide the formal analysis,

establishing the main theorem of this appendix. Finally, we note in particular the critical role played in the analysis here of

latent policies, policies that are not taken up in equilibrium but would be taken up out of equilibrium, and which deter

equilibrium-destroying deviations.

        Proposition 6.

        The set 𝑆𝑆 ∗ of strategies defined by (10) and (11) does not constitute an equilibrium


        Figure 10 gives a graphical illustration of why 𝑆𝑆 ∗ cannot be sustained as a Nash equilibrium. {A, C} represents the

equilibrium allocation described earlier. Consider, as earlier, 𝑆𝑆 ∗ that leads to an allocation (A, C) where A and C are

chosen by both types of individuals and by high-risk ones, respectively. Now consider the deviant pair of policies {AB,

G}, where AB is offered without disclosure and G is offered with disclosure and with G being offered conditional on no

additional insurance. There always exists a set (AB, G) such that G is chosen by all the low-risk individuals while AB is

chosen by all the high-risk who simultaneously buy OA. (The high risk individuals supplement AB with pooling

insurance OA). The deviant entrant firm offering (AB, G) may make positive profits because the positive profits from G

can outweigh the losses from AB, since the deviant firm can share with the other firms any losses from (𝛼𝛼�, 𝛽𝛽̅ ) (the

pooling contract) that is chosen by high-risk individuals. (That is, now, only high risk individuals purchase the pooling

53
contract, so it loses money. The deviant firm gets all the low risk individuals for all of their insurance, and the high risk

people only for the supplemental amount AB).


        Finding an equilibrium strategy


        To prevent this type of a deviation, we need to make the choice of G more attractive to high-risk types by providing

                                             𝑃𝑃�
more additional insurance at                        than 𝑆𝑆1∗ does, while limiting the total provision by all the firms to 𝛼𝛼� in equilibrium.

We need to have a latent strategy, which offers an individual sufficient amount of extra insurance at                                             in the presence
                                                                                                                                          1−𝑃𝑃�

𝑆𝑆 𝑜𝑜 can determine the equilibrium allocation 𝐸𝐸 ∗ as Proposition 5 can apply given 𝑆𝑆 𝑜𝑜 . As for the robustness of an

equilibrium in response to a deviant firm k with {AB, G}, we can first note that a high-risk individual i choosing G would

not reveal to k his purchases of pooling insurance from other firms, who also do not reveal to the deviant firm k their sales

to i. We can then show that the deviant firm k cannot make non-negative profits as follows. The maximum profit that a

deviant firm k can get with {AB,G} will be made when G ≈ A ≈ B, and the amount of maximum profit will not

                           𝑃𝑃�         𝑃𝑃
be greater than 𝛼𝛼� ∙ �1−𝑃𝑃� − 1−𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 � ∙ (1 − 𝜃𝜃), where θ is the portion of high-risk individuals. If a high-risk
                                            𝐿𝐿


individual would like to purchase supplemental insurance (from 𝑆𝑆2𝑜𝑜 ) after purchasing G from k and 𝛼𝛼� pooling

insurance from a non-deviant firm, the contract that induces high-risk types not to choose G with the minimum

loss will be B’ in Figure 10.               The loss that the deviant firm makes by offering B’ for high-risk individuals will

                           𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻          𝑃𝑃�
be greater than 𝛼𝛼� ∙ �            −    1−𝑃𝑃�
                                              �   ∙ 𝜃𝜃, implying that the total profit for the deviant firm should not be positive.
                          1−𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻


     We have thus established


     Theorem 4

     If deviant firms are allowed to offer multiple insurance contracts, there always exists a Nash equilibrium that

sustains the unique equilibrium outcome 𝐸𝐸 ∗ ≡ {(𝛼𝛼𝐻𝐻∗ , 𝛽𝛽𝐻𝐻∗ ), (𝛼𝛼𝐿𝐿∗ , 𝛽𝛽𝐿𝐿∗ )}. The Nash equilibrium entails the use of latent

policies.
