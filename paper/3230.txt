                        MAKING ALTRUISM PAY IN AUCTION QUOTAS


                                       ABSTRACT

         With imperfectly competitive product markets, producers react to the

auction of quota licenses by adjusting price upwards from the free trade

level.     As a result, license revenues are significantly lower than if markets

were perfectly competitive.     In fact, they are often zero unless quotas are

very restrictive.     In such markets, giving part of these revenues to the

producers reduces the incentive to raise product prices and leads to the

reappearance of revenues from auctioning quota licenses.     With a foreign

monopoly and no price discrimination, such a policy can lead to a Pareto

improvement over free trade.     The conditions under which such altruism raises

welfare both from free trade and from the status quo are explored.
