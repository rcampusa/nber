                                            ABSTRACT

The wealthy hand-to-mouth are households who hold little or no liquid wealth (cash, checking, and
savings accounts), despite owning sizable amounts of illiquid assets (assets that carry a transaction
cost, such as housing or retirement accounts). We use survey data on household portfolios for the U.S.,
Canada, Australia, the U.K., Germany, France, Italy, and Spain to document the share of such households
across countries, their demographic characteristics, the composition of their balance sheets, and the
persistence of hand-to-mouth status over the life cycle. The portfolio configuration of the wealthy
hand-to-mouth suggests that these households may have a high marginal propensity to consume out
of transitory income changes, a prediction for which we find empirical support in PSID data. We explain
the implications of this group of consumers for macroeconomic modeling and fiscal policy analysis.

1       Introduction

The life-cycle permanent income hypothesis is a valuable organizing framework to an-
alyze both household survey and aggregate time-series data on the joint dynamics of
income and consumption. At the same time, economists have long recognized that
certain aspects of these data are at odds with some of the model’s most salient predic-
tions. This is true for both the standard version of the model (Friedman, 1957; Hall,
1978) and the more recent “buffer-stock” versions (Deaton 1991; Carroll 1997). In par-
ticular, both at the micro and macro level, it is common to estimate a large sensitivity
of consumption with respect to transitory changes in income, whereas according to the
theory these income dynamics should be smoothed.1 It is also common to find that
expected consumption growth is uncorrelated with the real interest rate, a result that
implies a breakdown of the forward-looking Euler equation holding with equality, as
long as the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is not zero.2

The most direct way to account for these facts is through the existence of a sizable
share of hand-to-mouth (HtM) consumers in the population: consumers that spend all
of their available resources in every pay-period. HtM consumers have a high marginal
propensity to consume (MPC) out of transitory income changes, which can account
for the high correlation between consumption and the transitory component of income
growth, even for anticipated income shocks. Moreover, HtM consumers are not on their
Euler equations, and thus they are a source of misalignment between movements in the
interest rate and movements in aggregate consumption growth. The main challenge to
this view asserts that standard measurements using micro data on household balance
sheets conclude that the fraction of households with near zero net worth, and hence
who consume all of their income each period, is too small to quantitatively reproduce
the facts discussed above.

Measuring HtM behavior using data on net worth is consistent with the vast majority
of heterogeneous-agent equilibrium macroeconomic models. These frameworks either
feature either a single asset or two assets with different risk profiles, but the same
degree of liquidity. Notable examples are the Bewley models featuring uninsurable
idiosyncratic risk and credit constraints, in the tradition of Huggett (1996), Aiyagari
    1
     Some notable examples of micro-level evidence on excess sensitivity are Parker (1999), Souleles
(1999), Shapiro and Slemrod (2003a, 2003b, 2009), Johnson, Parker, and Souleles (2006), Parker et
al. (2013), and Broda and Parker (2014). See Jappelli and Pistaferri (2010), for a recent survey.
Campbell and Mankiw (1989, 1990, 1991) provide evidence based on macroeconomic time-series.

(1994), Rios-Rull (1995), and Krusell and Smith (1998), and the spender-saver models
that feature impatient and patient consumers with complete markets in the tradition of
Campbell and Mankiw (1989). This latter class of models has been revived recently by
Gali, Lopez-Salido, and Valles (2007), Eggertson and Krugman (2012), and Justiniano,
Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2013), among others, to analyze macroeconomic dynamics
around the Great Recession. Models by Krusell and Smith (1997) and Carroll, Slacalek,
and Tokuoka (2014a, 2014b) combine the spender-saver insight of heterogeneity in
patience with a standard one-asset incomplete-markets model.

In this paper, we argue that measurements of HtM behavior inspired by this class
of models are misleading because they miss what we call the wealthy hand-to-mouth
households. These are households who hold sizable amounts of wealth in illiquid assets
(such as housing or retirement accounts), but very little or no liquid wealth. As a result,
they consume all of their disposable income every period. Clearly, such households
would not be picked up by standard measurements since they have positive —and
often substantial— net worth.

To obtain a comprehensive measurement of HtM behavior with cross-sectional survey
data about household portfolios, a far better strategy is to use a model with two assets,
one liquid and one illiquid, as the guiding framework. The illiquid asset yields a higher
return, but it can only be accessed by paying a transaction cost. Recent examples of
this two-asset environment are Angeletos et al. (2001), Laibson et al. (2003), Chetty
and Szeidl (2007), Alvarez, Guiso, and Lippi (2012), Huntley and Michelangeli (2014),
and Kaplan and Violante (2014a, 2014b). Through the lens of this two-asset model,
there are two types of HtM households. The poor hand-to-mouth (P-HtM) hold little
or no liquid wealth and no illiquid wealth; the wealthy hand-to-mouth (W-HtM) also
hold little or no liquid wealth, but do have significant amounts of illiquid assets on their
balance sheet. Just like the P-HtM households, W-HtM households have large MPCs
out of small transitory income fluctuations. However, we show W-HtM households are
more similar to non HtM (N-HtM) households along many other important dimensions.
As a result, the W-HtM cannot be fully assimilated into either group. Rather, they
are best represented as a third, separate class of households.

This paper investigates W-HtM behavior theoretically and empirically, and examines
this peculiar but sizable group’s implications for macroeconomic modeling and policy
analysis.

First, we ask why households with significant wealth would optimally choose to con-


                                             2
sume all of their income every period, instead of using their wealth to smooth shocks.
To answer this question, in Section 2 we develop a stylized model based on Kaplan
and Violante (2014a). The model reveals that, under certain parameter configura-
tions, optimal portfolio composition has positive amounts of illiquid wealth and zero
liquid wealth. Such wealthy HtM households are better off bearing the welfare loss
from income fluctuations rather than smoothing consumption. This is because the
latter option requires holding large balances of cash and foregoing the high return on
the illiquid asset (and, therefore, the associated higher level of long-run consumption).
This explanation is consistent with calculations by Browning and Crossley (2001) who
showed that, in a plausibly parameterized life-cycle buffer stock model, the utility loss
from setting consumption equal to income, instead of fully optimizing, is second or-
der. Cochrane (1989) and Krusell and Smith (1996) perform similar calculations in
a representative agent environment. The model also provides useful guidance for our
empirical strategy. In Section 3 we outline this strategy in detail and explain how we
approach measurement issues.

Next, we ask how large the share of W-HtM households is in the population, what
their demographic characteristics are, relative to the other two groups, how their bal-
ance sheets compare with that of the N-HtM, and how persistent their HtM status is
over their life cycle. This empirical analysis is based on cross-sectional survey data
on household portfolios for eight countries: the U.S., Canada, Australia, the U.K.,
Germany, France, Italy and Spain. We describe these data in Section 4. When the
literature on household portfolios has previously examined these data, its emphasis has
been on the allocation between risky and safe assets (see Guiso, Haliassos, and Jappelli
(2002) for a thorough cross-country comparison). Instead, our focus is on the liquidity
characteristics of the portfolio. In Section 5, we study U.S. data, for which we have
several repeated cross-sections between 1989 and 2010, as well as a two-year panel for
2007-2009. In Section 6, we present a comparative cross-country analysis with survey
data from 2010 and surrounding years.

The analysis of U.S. data leads to six main findings. First, between 25 and 40 percent
of U.S. households are HtM, with our preferred estimate at one-third of the population.
We find that one-third of HtM households are poor HtM and two-thirds are wealthy
HtM, meaning the W-HtM represent the vast majority of this group, and would be
missed by measurement of HtM behavior based on net worth. Third, households appear
to be most frequently P-HtM at young ages, whereas the age profile of the W-HtM
is hump-shaped and peaks around age 40. Fourth, the W-HtM typically hold sizable


                                           3
amounts of illiquid wealth: for example, the median at age 40 is around $50,000. Fifth,
W-HtM households appear very similar to the unconstrained N-HtM in terms of their
age-profile of income and the shares of illiquid wealth held in housing and retirement
account. Finally, we determine W-HtM status is slightly more transient than P-HtM
status.

Some interesting findings emerge from a comparison of the U.S. economy with the
other countries we study. In all of the other countries, W-HtM households are a
much greater share of the population than P-HtM households, even more so than in
the United States. However, the total fraction of HtM households varies significantly
across countries. Like in the U.S., HtM households represent more than 30 percent
of the population in Canada, U.K., and Germany, but represent 20 percent or less of
the population in Australia, France, Italy, and Spain. For the euro area countries,
we observe that holdings of consumer debt are minimal, suggesting that the substan-
tial liquid wealth seen, even among the income-poor, may act as a buffer stock that
substitutes for expensive and limited access to credit.

In Section 7 we show that a household’s HtM status has strong predictive power for its
consumption response to transitory shocks. We apply the identification strategy from
Blundell, Pistaferri, and Preston (2008) to U.S. income and consumption panel data
to measure the MPC out of transitory income shocks for each type of household. We
find that W-HtM and P-HtM households have significantly stronger responses than
N-HtM households. In contrast, when we split households into HtM groups based on
net worth only, we do not find a significant difference in the consumption responses of
those two groups.

In Section 8, we argue that the W-HtM deserve their own separate status, in the
cast of characters populating macroeconomic models. We use our empirical estimates
of the share of households in each HtM group, together with simulated MPCs from
three alternative structural models of consumption behavior, to show that the W-HtM
cannot be assimilated to either the P-HtM or the N-HtM. We highlight four areas
where frameworks that do not explicitly model W-HtM households provide misguided
intuition about the effects of fiscal policy: the degree of MPC non-linearity with respect
to the transfer size, the asymmetry of the consumption response with respect to equal-
size income windfall and losses, the optimal phasing-out of stimulus payments with
income for maximizing the impact on aggregate consumption, and the extent of cross-
country dispersion in consumption responses to a fiscal transfer. Section 9 summarizes
and concludes the paper.

2    Wealthy hand-to-mouth behavior: a simple model

We start by analyzing a simple three-period model in order to illustrate the determi-
nants of hand-to-mouth behavior. In this section, we keep the presentation to a bare
minimum. Appendix A contains a more thorough analysis of the problem. The model
is also useful to determine how to detect a household’s HtM status in the data and, as
such, it provides guidance for our measurement exercise.

Household problem.         Consider a household that lives for three periods, t = 0, 1, 2,
but consumes only in the last two periods. Preferences over consumption at t = 1, 2
are given by
                                v0 = u (c1 ) + u (c2 ) ,                       (1)

with no discounting between periods, and with u′ > 0, u′′ < 0. The variable ct denotes
nondurable consumption at date t.

In period 0, the household has an initial endowment ω and makes a portfolio allocation
decision. Two assets are available as saving instruments. An illiquid asset a pays off
a gross return R before the consumption decision in period 2, but cannot be accessed
at the time of the consumption decision in period 1. A liquid asset m can be accessed
before the consumption decision in both periods, but pays a return 1 < R. For now,
we do not allow the agent to borrow, that is, to take a negative position in the liquid
asset, but we later relax this assumption.

After the initial portfolio allocation decision, households receive income y1 and make
their consumption and liquid saving decision at t = 1. In the last period t = 2,
they receive income y2 and consume this amount, their liquid savings from t = 1, and
their savings allocated to the illiquid asset at t = 0, plus the accrued capital income.
Therefore, the only two decisions to analyze are the initial portfolio allocation decision
and the consumption/saving decision at t = 1. Finally, note that since the income
path (y1 , y2) is known at t = 0, there is no uncertainty.

Our characterization of hand-to-mouth behavior concerns the asset position at the
time of the t = 1 consumption decision. We define a household as not hand-to-mouth
(N-HtM) if, after consuming at t = 1, it holds a positive amount of liquid assets, i.e.,
m2 > 0 and a ≥ 0. As is clear from (1), this household will choose c1 = c2 . We
define a household as poor hand-to-mouth (P-HtM) if, after consuming at t = 1, it
does not hold any liquid or illiquid assets: m2 = 0 and a = 0. We define a household
as wealthy hand-to-mouth (W-HtM) if, after consuming at t = 1, it holds a positive

                                            5
amount of illiquid assets but no liquid assets: m2 = 0 and a > 0. Therefore, the
t = 1 consumption/saving decision determines whether an agent is HtM, and the
initial portfolio allocation at t = 0 determines whether a HtM agent is poor or wealthy
HtM. For both HtM households, c1 < c2 .

Solution.     We begin with the initial portfolio allocation decision at t = 0:

                                  v0 = max u (c1 ) + u (c2 )
                                          m1 ,a
                                          s.t.
                             a + m1 = ω
                             c1 + m2 = y1 + m1
                                  c2 = y2 + m2 + Ra
                                 m1 ≥ 0, a ≥ 0

where the first line is the resource constraint in the portfolio choice; the second and
third lines are the budget constraints at t = 1 and t = 2; and the final line collects the
inequality constraints on the choice variables. The first order condition of this problem
with respect to a gives
                                                         
                         ′          ∂m2      ′          ∂m2
                        u (c1 ) 1 +       ≥ u (c2 ) R +       ,                       (2)
                                     ∂a                  ∂a

where the inequality is strict when a = 0. The derivative ∂m2 /∂a reflects the depen-
dence of the liquid savings decision at t = 1 on the amount held in illiquid assets.
The resulting initial portfolio allocation implicitly determines the endowment points
(y1 + ω − a, y2 + Ra) immediately prior to the consumption/saving decision at t = 1.

We now turn to this consumption saving decision at t = 1, given the predetermined
amount invested in liquid wealth m1 = ω − a:

                              v1 (a) = max u (c1 ) + u (c2 )
                                          c1 ,m2
                                          s.t.
                             c1 + m2 = y1 + ω − a
                                  c2 = y2 + m2 + Ra
                                 m2 ≥ 0

where the first and second lines are the budget constraints at t = 1 and t = 2, and the


                                            6
third line imposes the nonnegativity constraint on the choice variable. The first-order
condition of this problem is:
                                      u′ (c1 ) ≥ u′ (c2 ) ,                          (3)

where the strict inequality holds whenever the constraint binds and m2 = 0. For exam-
ple, when y1 is high enough relative to y2 , the agent wants to save some of its income
into period 2, and m2 > 0. In contrast, when y1 is low enough relative to y2 , the agent
would, ideally, like to borrow and it is constrained at m2 = 0. This “short-run” Euler
equation in (3) states that, at t = 1, the relative price of consumption between t = 1
and t = 2 is equal to one, the return on the liquid asset.

Combining (3) with (2) yields

                                   u′ (c1 ) ≥ Ru′ (c2 ) .                            (4)

This is because u′ (c1 ) = u′ (c2 ) when m2 is interior, and because m2 is unaffected by
a marginal change in a when the household is at a constraint. This long-run Euler
equation in (4) states that, from the agent’s viewpoint at t = 0, the relative price of
consuming at t = 1 versus t = 2 is R. Comparing (4) and (3), the intertemporal trade-
off appears to change between t = 0 and t = 1 because the illiquid asset is available as
a saving instrument only at t = 0.

The “short-run” Euler equation (3) implies
                                                               
                                      y1 + ω − y2 − (1 + R) a
                       m2 = max                               ,0 .                   (5)
                                                 2

Since we are interested in characterizing HtM behavior, we focus on the case where
m2 = 0. Equation (5) reveals that a sufficient condition for this case is y2 ≥ y1 + ω:
for a given initial endowment, income in period 2 is so large, relative to period 1, that
even when the total endowment ω is saved into the liquid asset, the household still
desires to consume more at t = 1.

To make further progress on the solution, we assume that u is in the constant elasticity
of substitution (CES) class with elasticity of intertemporal substitution σ. Then, the
long-run Euler equation (4) gives

                                          Rσ (y1 + ω) − y2
                                                            
                           a = max                         ,0 ,                      (6)
                                              R + Rσ




                                               7
From (6), we conclude that the household is W-HtM when
                                                            σ1
                                                     y2
                                         R>                                                        (7)
                                                   y1 + ω

and is P-HtM when the opposite (weak) inequality holds.

It is useful to explain the role of the model’s parameters in determining W-HtM be-
havior. A high relative return R makes the illiquid asset more attractive by raising its
effective return, thereby inducing the agent to tolerate wider consumption differences
across periods in order to achieve a higher overall consumption level. Steep income
growth y2 /y1 reduces the appeal of the illiquid asset as a saving instrument, as the in-
come path already guarantees high consumption later in life. The higher the elasticity
of intertemporal substitution σ, the more the household is willing to absorb a jump in
consumption across periods, and so the more likely it is to save into the illiquid asset
even if y1 is low relative to y2 .3

Since the model is deterministic, W-HtM households choose to invest in the illiquid
asset at t = 0, even though they know with certainty that they will be constrained
in the next period. By acting this way, they consume even less at t = 1 and make
themselves even more constrained. Put differently, the shadow value of an additional
unit of income at t = 1 is higher for the W-HtM than for the P-HtM. If we let this
multiplier be λ, for a P-HtM agent λ = u′(y1 + ω) − u′ (y2 ) and for a W-HtM agent
λ = u′ (y1 + ω − a) − u′ (y2 + Ra), which is larger. Nevertheless, this choice is optimal
because the welfare gain from the rise in the overall level of lifetime consumption more
than compensates for the welfare loss from the consumption gap between t = 1 and
t = 2.

MPC out of a transitory shock.      Suppose that after the initial portfolio allocation
decision, but before the consumption decision at t = 1, the household receives an
unexpected income shock, such as a transfer τ from the government. What is the
household’s MPC out of this transfer? A N-HtM household has an MPC of exactly
one-half, since there is no discounting and it smooths the payment equally across the
two periods. If the transfer is small enough not to throw the agent off its kink (m2 = 0),
then the HtM household’s MPC out of the transfer will be 1. This occurs as long as
τ ≤ y2 − (y1 + ω) + (1 + R) a. This condition is weaker for a W-HtM than for a P-HtM
   3
    Equation (7) reveals that the model is homothetic in y1 , y2 , and ω. In this sense, a high-income
household is as likely to be W-HtM as a low-income one, as long as the life-cycle slope of their income
profiles is the same.


                                                   8
because, as explained above, the former household is more constrained.4 Finally, note
that all these results carry over to the case of an anticipated transfer, as long as the
transfer is small enough that it does not change HtM status at t = 1.

Taking stock.       Our two-period model is an extremely stylized environment that is
useful to describe how W-HtM behavior can arise as a result of giving up gains from
additional consumption smoothing in exchange for the opportunity of investing in a
high-return asset that yields higher levels of average lifetime consumption. This insight
survives in more general environments. We briefly discuss five extensions.

First, for some illiquid assets like housing or large durables such as vehicles, the most
significant component of their return is the service flow they provide to the owner. At
the same time, they have a consumption commitment component, meaning periodic
expenditures that cannot be avoided such as maintenance and repair. Consider a
version of our model with the following in period t = 1. The illiquid asset yields a
utility flow φa proportional to the stock, and these services are perfect substitutes
with c1 (housing can be rented out and thus transformed into c1 ); and the illiquid-
asset’s owner must incur expenditures κa. Then, the counterpart of condition (7) is
one where R is simply replaced by R/ (1 − κ + φ), the effective return on the illiquid
asset.

Second, when the agent can access unsecured credit, there is a second kink in the
budget constraint at the credit limit; this is in addition to the kink at m2 = 0. The
model in Appendix A shows that in this case, households can be W-HtM and P-HtM
either at the zero kink or at the credit limit.

Third, as we show in Kaplan and Violante (2014a), in the presence of income uncer-
tainty, a W-HtM prefers bearing the welfare loss from income fluctuations rather than
holding the large balances of cash required for consumption smoothing. Saving in the
liquid asset means foregoing the high return on the illiquid asset and the associated
higher level of long-run consumption. This explanation is reminiscent of calculations
made by Cochrane (1989), Krusell and Smith (1996), and Browning and Crossley
(2001) who demonstrated that in several different contexts the utility loss from setting
consumption equal to income, instead of fully optimizing, can be second order.

Fourth, in the model the illiquid asset is inaccessible in the intermediate period. In a
   4
    In fact, Kaplan and Violante (2014a) show that, in a richer life-cycle version of this two-asset
model with uninsurable income risk, the average MPC out of transitory income shocks among W-
HtM households is larger than the average MPC among P-HtM households. We return to this point
in Section 8.

                                                 9
more general environment where the illiquid asset can be accessed by paying a fixed
transaction cost, the household may decide to deposit an unexpected positive windfall
into the illiquid account, or to smooth a negative shock by withdrawing from the illiquid
account. This behavior could potentially alter the model’s implications for the MPC
of W-HtM agents. In Kaplan and Violante (2014a), we show that this is the case only
if the shock is large relative to the transaction cost. We return on this point in Section
8.

Finally, in our two-period model, we have abstracted from discounting, but it is easy
to see that with geometric discounting between periods, all the qualitative conclusions
remain intact. Hyperbolic discounting introduces an additional reason to save in illiquid
assets, since illiquidity protects quasi-hyperbolic households from future consumption
splurges (see Angeletos et al., 2001; Laibson et al., 2003), and therefore makes it even
easier to generate W-HtM behavior.



3        Identifying hand-to-mouth households in the data

The stylized model in Section 2 illustrates that there are two types of HtM households:
poor hand-to-mouth (P-HtM) who do not hold any illiquid wealth, and wealthy hand-
to-mouth (W-HtM) who own positive amounts of illiquid wealth. For each type of HtM
household, there are two kinks in the intertemporal budget constraint where MPCs out
of small income changes can be large: zero liquid assets and the unsecured credit limit.5
According to the theory, a household is HtM at the zero kink in period t if it consumes
all its cash-on-hand for the period, and carries zero liquid wealth between t and t + 1.
Similarly, a household is HtM at the credit limit if, at the end of period t, it has
borrowed up to the limit.

Given the theoretical definition of HtM status, ideally, we would observe balances of
liquid wealth at the end of the pay-period — the period that starts at income receipt
and ends just before the next income receipt. Unfortunately, surveys either report
average balances over the period, or balances at a random point in time (the interview
date). As a result, HtM status will be measured with error.

To fully understand this issue, think about a continuous-time generalization of the
     5
    The unsecured credit limit is always a hard constraint. The zero liquid asset position is a hard
constraint for the subset of households who do not have access to credit, and a kink for virtually all
others, since the interest rates on credit cards and other non-collateralized loans are typically much
larger than the return on liquid assets.


                                                 10
model in Section 2 where income is paid discretely at the beginning of the period as
liquid wealth, but consumption occurs continuously –and is constant– over the period.
Then, given the timing mismatch between the discrete income payment and the contin-
uous consumption expenditures, one expects to observe positive (or above credit limit)
balances of liquid wealth even for the HtM households: this makes their identification
especially challenging. In Appendix B, we lay out this enriched version of the model.

We now describe our identification strategy —which builds upon the one used in Kaplan
and Violante (2014a)— starting with the case where liquid balances observed from the
survey are an average over the period.

Average balances.        Let yit denote the income of household i in pay-period t, let ait
denote holdings of illiquid wealth, and let mit denote average balances of liquid wealth
over the pay period.

Panel (a) of Figure 1 depicts a graphical representation of the dynamics of income and
average cash-on-hand mit over a pay period for a HtM household who starts and ends
the period at the zero kink. Its liquid balances peak at yit , when income is paid into
the liquid account at the beginning of the pay period, and are depleted constantly until
they reach zero at t + 1. Average balances over the period are equal to half income.

A conservative criterion to identify HtM agents on the zero kink in the data is therefore
to count those survey households whose average liquid wealth balances are positive (to
capture the fact they are not borrowing), but are equal to or less than half their earnings
per pay-period, where “half” is due to the assumption that resources are consumed at
a constant rate. Specifically, a household is P-HtM at the zero kink if

                                                               yit
                             ait ≤ 0,   and        0 ≤ mit ≤                           (8)
                                                                2

and W-HtM at the zero kink if

                                                               yit
                             ait > 0,   and        0 ≤ mit ≤       .                   (9)
                                                                2

The case ait < 0 is very rare in survey data. It occurs when housing equity is negative
because a decline in house prices has pushed the market value of the house below
the residual value of the mortgage. We include these households among the P-HtM
because, even though they own illiquid assets, they effectively have no means of using
them to smooth consumption and, as such, these households are more similar to the
P-HtM.

                      Figure 1: Illustration of two cases of HtM behavior

This estimator of the number of HtM households provides a lower bound because,
although all N-HtM households would always hold average liquid balances above half
their earnings, some HtM households may also hold, on average, liquid balances above
half their earnings. For example, a household that starts the period with positive
liquid savings, in addition to its earnings, and ends the period with zero liquid savings
is HtM, but its average liquid balance is above half its earnings, and so it would not
be counted as HtM by this criterion. Appendix B makes this point formally.

Next, consider a HtM household at the credit limit −mit < 0. This is a household
that consumes all its cash-on-hand for the period, as well as all its available credit. For
consistency with the strategy above, we propose to count a household as P-HtM at the
credit limit if
                                                                      yit
                          ait ≤ 0,     mit ≤ 0 and       mit ≤            − mit ,                     (10)
                                                                       2
and to count it as W-HtM at the credit limit if

                                                                      yit
                          ait > 0,     mit ≤ 0 and       mit ≤            − mit .                     (11)
                                                                       2

Panel (b) of Figure 1 depicts the dynamics of income and average cash-on-hand mit
over a pay period for a HtM household that starts and ends the period at the credit
limit. It is easy to see that this criterion is also conservative: a household that starts
the period at t with liquid wealth above its credit limit and ends the period at t + 1
having exhausted all its borrowing capacity, would carry an average balance above the
limit, and would therefore escape our criterion based on equations (10) and (11).

Balances at a point in time.                 Some surveys report balances of liquid wealth at

                                                  12
the interview date, which can be thought of as a random point during the pay-period.
Is it still true in this case that our estimator based on criteria (8)-(11) provides a
lower bound on the fraction of HtM households? In Appendix B we show that we
would always miss some truly HtM households. However, we may mistake a non-HtM
households for HtM if its end-of-period liquid balances are less than one-half of its
income away from zero or from the credit limit if it is borrowing. For a bi-weekly
pay-period, this means that the only problematic households are those with one week
or less of income in excess of their kink —households which, for practical purposes, one
may want to identify as HtM anyway.

Consumption commitments.                  Recent literature has emphasized the existence of
pre-committed consumption expenditures —expenditures that a household is commit-
ted to incur every pay-period, unless it pays a transaction cost (either monetary or
in terms of time) to modify its previous commitments (see, for example, Chetty and
Szeidl, 2007; Shore and Sinai, 2010). These expenditures include rent, mortgages or
other loan payments, utility bills, fees for school, gym, or clubs, and alimony. The
key feature of committed expenditures is that they are bulk expenditures incurred at
a point in time that discretely deplete a household’s balance of liquid wealth.

How does the presence of such expenditures affect our identification strategy? Let c̄it
be the amount of committed expenditures for household i at date t. If c̄it is incurred at
the beginning of a pay period, the criterion to identify a HtM household (say, at the
zero kink) should be amended as mit ≤ (yit − c̄it ) /2, while if it is incurred at the end
of the period, the criterion should be mit − c̄it ≤ yit /2. In the first case, our baseline
measurement overestimates HtM status, and in the second case it underestimates it.
Instead, if committed expenditures are incurred smoothly over the period or are paid
in the middle of the pay period, then the criterion should be mit − c̄it /2 ≤ (yit − c̄it ) /2
which is the same as our baseline measurement. We verify the robustness of our
estimates with respect to those consumption commitments that we can measure in our
survey data by using these alternative assumptions about the timing of expenditures.

Definition of HtM in terms of net worth.              For comparison with net-worth based
theories of HtM behavior, we also compute the fraction of HtM agents in terms of net
worth. Let nit = ait + mit be the net worth of agent i in period t. Then, a household
is HtM in net worth (HtM-NW) if

                              yit                                  yit
                  0 ≤ nit ≤         or,     nit ≤ 0 and    nit ≤       − mit             (12)
                               2                                    2

                                               13
Direct survey questions. Finally, whenever the data allow, we also use direct
survey questions as alternate estimates of the fraction of HtM households. These ques-
tions typically ask whether expenditures over the last month have exceeded income,
abstracting from purchases of large durable goods such as housing or cars, and whether
the household usually spends more than its income. Counts of HtM households de-
rived from these questions provide a useful check on the reliability of our identification
strategy based on reported liquid wealth and income.



4     Survey data on household portfolios

The countries included in our study are the U.S., Canada, Australia, the U.K., and
the four largest economies in the euro area: Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. Data
for the first four countries come from their own separate surveys, the U.S. Survey
of Consumer Finances (SCF), the Canadian Survey of Financial Security (SFS), the
Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, and the U.K.
Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS). Data for the euro area countries come from the
Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), a joint project administered by
all of the central banks of the Eurosystem. Appendix C contains a detailed description
of all these cross-sectional surveys.

In order to categorize a household as W-HtM, P-HtM, or N-HtM, we need information
on its labor income and on the amounts of assets and liabilities held in various cate-
gories of its balance sheet. In the rest of this section, we discuss sample selection and
comparability across surveys. Next, we present some descriptive statistics on the asset
and liability distribution across countries.


4.1    Sample selection and data comparability

Each individual survey is tailored to its own country and, as such, the questions asked
and the definitions of particular asset classes vary across surveys. Our main goal is to
be as consistent as possible in selecting the sample, and in defining income, liquid, and
illiquid wealth across surveys.

Sample selection.        In all surveys, we restrict our analysis to households in which

     the head is between 22 and 79 years of age, and drop households only if their income is
     negative or if all of their income originates from self-employment.6 Table 1 summarizes
     the survey years we use for each country, the sample selection, and the final sample
     sizes. Since all these surveys oversample the rich, we always use weights to construct
     sample statistics.

     Income.          In choosing our definition of income, we make an attempt to include
     all labor income plus government transfers that are regular inflows of liquid wealth.
     We exclude interests, dividends, and other capital income because they are realized
     more infrequently. Income in the SCF is gross wages and salaries, self-employment
     income, regular private transfers such as child support and alimony, public transfers
     such as unemployment benefits, food stamps, and Social Security Income (SSI), and
     regular income from other sources excluding investment income. Income in the Cana-
     dian SFS is after-tax total income. There is no distinction between labor, capital, and
     self-employment income. In the HILDA, income is wages and salaries, self-employment
     income, regular private transfers such as child support and alimony, and public ben-
     efits such as the Australian Government Parenting Payment. For the U.K. WAS, we
     define income as net employee earnings, net self-employment income, plus any public
     benefits such as the Jobseeker’s Allowance and Maternity Allowance. Income in the
     HFCS is gross income from wages, salaries, and self-employment, unemployment ben-
     efits, regular private transfers such as child support and alimony, and regular public
     transfers.7
        6
           The only exception to our age range is for the U.K. WAS which provides ages in 5 year age bins,
     so we include households with heads between 20 and 79 years of age.
         7
           The reference period for the income questions differs between surveys. For income variables in the
     SCF, the survey asks for annual income in the previous year. For example, the 2010 SCF uses 2009 as
     its reference period for income. The income reference period differs by country in the HFCS. France


                                                       15
The main discrepancy in income measurement across surveys is that income in Canada
is reported after taxes, whereas all other countries survey gross income before taxes.
For most households, except the self-employed, taxes are withheld at the source and
hence the amount paid into the liquid account —and available for spending— is net of
taxes. Thus, using income before taxes does somewhat overstate the fraction of HtM
households by inflating the liquid wealth threshold. Whenever possible, we verify the
robustness of our results to an adjustment for the individual tax liability.

Liquid wealth.          In the U.S. SCF, we consider liquid assets to be checking, saving,
money market and call accounts plus directly held mutual funds, stocks, corporate
bonds and government bonds. Liquid assets in the Canadian SFS are deposits in
financial institutions plus holdings in mutual funds, other investment funds, stocks
and bonds. In the Australian HILDA, liquid assets include balances in bank accounts,
equity investments, and cash investments (bonds). In the U.K. WAS, liquid assets
include bank accounts, Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), and holdings of shares,
corporate bonds, and government bonds.8 For the Euro area HFCS, liquid assets are
cash, sight (also called current, draft, or checking) accounts, mutual fund holdings,
shares in publicly traded companies, and corporate or government bond holdings.

The main shortcoming in the definition of liquid wealth is the absence of information on
cash holdings. To address this problem, we resort to an imputation procedure based on
data from the 2010 Survey of Consumer Payment Choice, administered by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston (see Foster et al., 2013). We compute the ratio of average cash
holdings measured in this survey to the median value of checking, saving, money market
and call accounts from the 2010 SCF. We then inflate the value of each household’s
checking, saving, money market and call accounts by this ratio in all surveys.9

We define liquid debt in the SCF as the sum of all credit card balances that accrue
and Germany both use 2009 as a reference period, Spain uses 2007, and Italy uses 2010. Wave Two of
the WAS (2008-2010) asks questions regarding the “usual” amounts for monthly income and benefits.
The 2005 SFS uses 2004 as its reference period, and gave its respondents the option of skipping the
income questions and using linked data from their 2004 tax return. Wave Ten of the HILDA uses the
2009-2010 financial year which runs from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010 for its reference period for
income.

     ISAs are accounts designed for the purpose of saving with a favorable tax status. A broad range
of asset categories, including cash, can be held in ISAs. There are no restrictions to how much and
when funds can be withdrawn.

     Average cash holdings, excluding large-value holdings in 2010 was $138. Median checking, saving,
money market and call accounts in the 2010 SCF is $2500, making the ratio about 5.5%. In the HFCS,
information on cash holdings is available for Spain from a non-core module. We check the median
ratio of cash to sight accounts and find it to be about 5% in Spain.

interest, after the most recent payment. Liquid debt in the SFS is credit card and
installment debt. Liquid debt in the HILDA is credit card debt. In the U.K. WAS,
liquid debt is credit card debt, plus any balances on store cards, hire purchases, and
mail orders. In the HFCS, liquid debts are considered to be the balance on credit cards,
after the most recent payment, which accrue interest, and any balances on credit lines
or bank overdrafts which also accrue interest.

The measure of liquid wealth that we use to compute HtM status is net liquid wealth,
or liquid assets minus liquid debt. We also examine a narrower definition of net liquid
wealth that excludes directly held mutual funds, stocks, and bonds from liquid assets,
and a broader one that includes outstanding debt in home-equity lines of credit as
liquid debt.

Illiquid wealth.      Net illiquid wealth in the SCF includes the value of housing, res-
idential and non-residential real estate net of mortgages and home equity loans, private
retirement accounts (such as 401(k)s, IRAs, thrift accounts, and future pensions), cash
value of life insurance policies, certificates of deposit, and saving bonds. Illiquid wealth
in the Canadian SFS is the value of the principal residence and other real estate invest-
ment less mortgages on the properties and lines of credit that use property as collateral.
It also includes retirement savings such as Registered Retirement Savings Plans, Reg-
istered Retirement Income Funds, employer pension plans, and other retirement funds.
In the HILDA, illiquid wealth is net equity in home and other real-estate properties plus
life insurance policies and superannuation (government-supported, compulsory private
retirement funds).10 In the U.K. WAS, we take illiquid wealth to include the value of
the main residence, other houses, and land net of mortgages and land debt, plus oc-
cupational and personal pensions, insurance products, and National Savings products.
The definition of net illiquid wealth in the HFCS is the value of the household’s main
residence and other properties net of mortgages and unsecured loans specifically taken
out to purchase the home, plus occupational and voluntary pension plans, cash value
of life insurance policies, certificate of deposits, and saving bonds.

We also explore broader definitions of illiquid wealth that include the value of businesses
for the self-employed, the resale value of vehicles net of the loans taken out to purchase
them, and other non-financial wealth not included in our baseline, such as antiques,
  10
     Superannuation has some features of private retirement accounts, such as 401(k) accounts in the
U.S., which we include in illiquid wealth, and some features of public pensions (the compulsory nature
of a minimum contribution) which we exclude from illiquid wealth. Because of this ambiguity, we also
offer a sensitivity analysis where we exclude superannuation wealth from illiquid assets.

artwork, jewels, and gold.11 Changing the definition of illiquid wealth affects only the
split between poor and wealthy HtM, but not the total number of HtM households.

Reference period.        The reference period for the liquid and illiquid wealth questions
varies across surveys. In the SCF, it is the interview date for most assets, but for some,
such as checking and saving accounts, when the respondent was unsure, the interview
could prompt for an average balance over the month. The Canadian SFS asks for
information on assets and debts for “a time as close as possible to the date of the
interview.” Both the WAS and HILDA ask for current balances or values of assets and
liabilities. In the HCFS, France, Germany, and Spain use the interview date, and Italy
uses December 31, 2010.


4.2     Descriptive statistics

Table 2 reports some basic descriptive statistics on household income, liquid and illiquid
wealth holdings, and portfolio composition, for each country in the sample.

In all countries, the typical household portfolio structure is rather simple. It comprises
a small amount of liquid wealth in the form of bank accounts, some housing equity,
and a private retirement account. In particular, the median holdings of other financial
assets such as directly held stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and life insurance are zero
everywhere. This is a well known fact in the empirical study of household portfolios
(see Guiso, Halassios, and Jappelli, 2002).

There are, however, some interesting cross-country differences. First, the median net
worth to median income ratio varies a lot across countries: from just above one in
Germany and the U.S. to over six in the U.K., Italy, and Spain. With respect to net
liquid wealth, consumer credit appears a lot less frequent in the Euro area: less than 10
percent of households have credit card debt in France, Italy, and Spain, compared to
30 to 40 percent in the Anglo-Saxon countries. Figure 2, which plots the distribution of
net liquid wealth to monthly income for the eight countries, reinforces this observation.

Housing equity forms the majority of illiquid wealth for households in every country,
with the exception of Germany where median housing wealth is zero, since only 48
percent of the population are homeowners. This homeownership rate is at least 10
percentage points less than in all other countries (see also Eymann and Börsch-Supan,
   11
      In our robustness checks with respect to business equity we include all households whose income
is entirely from self-employment as long as they had non-negative income from their business.

2002). The median value of housing equity relative to median annual income is espe-
cially remarkable in Italy and Spain, where it exceeds six.

There are also large differences in the fraction of households with positive private
retirement wealth: in the Anglo-Saxon countries, at least half of all households hold
a personal retirement account, whereas in France, Italy, and Spain less than one in
ten do. Surely, a big part of the explanation is in the generosity of the public pension
system in these countries: according to the OECD, replacement rates for the median
earner are between 60 and 70 percent in these countries, compared to 40 percent in
the U.K. and the United States (see OECD, 2013). The size of private retirement
wealth in Australia and the U.K. is astonishing. In Australia, this is partly due to
the “superannuation” regulations that require all employers to generously contribute
to tax-deferred retirement accounts on behalf of their employees.12 In the U.K., the
Pension Schemes Act of 1993 created tax-free employer-sponsored (defined benefits)
occupational pensions and (defined contributions) personal pensions. The Pension Act
of 2008 established that workers must choose to opt out of an employer’s occupational
pension plan, rather than opt in (see Banks and Tanner (2002) for more details).

Finally, the proportion of households with life insurance in their portfolio is much
higher in the euro area than in the Anglo-Saxon countries. We conjecture that solid
intergenerational family ties, and a stronger precautionary savings motive linked to the
lower female participation rate, may account for these differences.



5      United States

In this section, we report the main findings for the U.S., using data from the 1989-
2010 waves of the SCF. We begin by estimating the fraction of HtM households and
assessing the robustness of our estimates to a variety of aspects of the definition adopted
in Section 3. We then analyze the key demographic characteristics of N-HtM, P-HtM,
and W-HtM households, and we examine their portfolio composition in more detail.

   In the survey years, the compulsory minimum employer contribution rate was 9 percent of the
employee salary.

5.1         The share of HtM households

Our definition of HtM status is based on equations (8)-(12) . Since the SCF does not
report individual data on the frequency of pay, we need to make an assumption that
applies to all households. Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) data from 1990-2010
reveal that 32 percent of respondents are paid weekly, 52percent of respondents are
paid bi-weekly, and the rest are paid = monthly or at lower frequencies.13 Based on
these findings, in the benchmark analysis we set the pay-frequency to two weeks. In
the benchmark, we also set the household credit limit to one month of income. The
SCF asks respondents to report their credit limit, but most of the other surveys do
not, and hence for comparability we choose a common limit.14

Panel (a) of Figure 3 plots the fraction of HtM households in the U.S. population over
the period 1989-2010 and their split between wealthy and poor HtM. Our estimates
indicate that, on average, 31 percent of U.S. households are HtM over this period.
Of these, roughly one-third are poor HtM and two-thirds are wealthy HtM. This our
paper’s first main result: the vast majority of hand-to-mouth households own illiquid
assets. Looking at changes over time across the two decades covered by our data,
the fraction of HtM households remains fairly stable and the split between poor and
wealthy does not change significantly. The first line of Table 3 reports that the share
  13

    The choice of one month of income for the benchmark is consistent with the SCF self-reported
limits. When setting the limit for households without credit cards to zero, the median self-reported
limit to income ratio is 0.54 in 1989. It grows steadily to 1.7 in 2007 and then drops to 1.2 in 2010.
This evolution of credit limits is even more remarkable when conditioning only on credit card holders
(around 70 percent of the population): the median limit to income ratio rises from 1.2 in 1989 to 3.4
in 2007, and then drops to 2.8 in 2010.

Figure 4: Share of HtM households among homeowners by leverage ratio. SCF 1989-2010.

of U.S. households that are HtM in terms of net worth is less than 14 percent. Thus
looking at the wealth distribution through the eyes of net worth misses over half of the
HtM households in the United States.15

Panel (b) explores the illiquid asset portfolio of the W-HtM households by plotting
the share of W-HtM households that own housing, retirement wealth, or both. About
one-half of W-HtM have both, about a third have positive housing but no retirement
wealth, and a sixth have positive retirement wealth but no housing. A deeper look into
the portfolio of HtM households reveals that, if we condition on homeownership, the
leverage ratio is a strong predictor of HtM status. Figure 4 shows that the fraction of
HtM households doubles from 20 to 40 percent as the leverage ratio rises towards one,
as regular mortgage payments absorb a significant fraction of disposable income and
leave households with little or no liquid savings.


5.1.1    Robustness

Figure 5 and Table 3 summarize our sensitivity analyses. Panel (a) of Figure 5 plots
the shares of poor and wealthy HtM weighted by income. Not surprisingly, the total
fraction of HtM households is smaller than its unweighted counterpart: HtM households
represent roughly 20 percent of total U.S. income, since their income is below the U.S.
average. When we weight by income, the W-HtM represent three-quarters of HtM
households. Panel (b) plots HtM shares when the pay-period is set to a month instead
of two weeks. The fraction of HtM households increases by 9 percentage points and
  15
      HtM-NW are always more numerous than the P-HtM because there are some households with
liquid wealth above the threshold, who are therefore not HtM, but with enough negative illiquid wealth
(i.e., negative home equity) to push their net worth below the threshold.

W-HtM account for most of the difference with the baseline. Symmetrically, the fourth
line of Table 3 shows that, when the pay-period is set to one week, the share of W-
HtM drops by 5 percentage points. In panel (c) of Figure 5, we verify the robustness
of our estimates with respect to the tightness of the credit limit. When we use the self-
reported credit limit in the SCF, the fraction of HtM households drops by 5 percentage
points, with a lower number of W-HtM households accounting for all of the drop.
Finally, panel (d) shows that by including vehicles as illiquid wealth, we move roughly
half of the P-HtM into the W-HtM group but, by construction, the total share of HtM
households in the population is unchanged.

Table 3 contains a number of other sensitivity analyses. We begin with direct questions
on HtM status. The SCF contains a combination of sequential questions aimed at
assessing whether “over the past year, [household] spending exceeded, or was about the
same as, income, and such expenditures included purchases of a home or automobile or
spending for any investments.”16 Based on this definition, the share of HtM households

      These questions (X7510, X7509, X7508) were included in the survey starting from 1992.

Table 3:     Robustness results for fraction HtM in each category in the SCF pooled 1989-
2010. Financially fragile households includes those households within $2,000 in liquid assets
of their income threshold as HtM. Higher illiquid wealth cutoff requires households to have
above $1,000 in illiquid assets to be considered W-HtM. Ret. acc. as liquid for 60+ puts
retirement accounts into liquid wealth for households above age 60. Businesses as illiquid
assets drops the self employment income sample selection and adds business assets to illiquid
wealth and self employment income to income. Direct as illiquid assets classifies directly held
mutual funds, stocks, corporate and government bonds as illiquid assets. Disposable income
subtracts federal income taxes estimated from NBER’s TAXSIM from income. Disposable
income - Reported assumes that each household files their actual marital status and number
of children as dependents. Disposable income - Single assumes that every household files as
single with no dependents. Comm. cons. - beg. of period assumes the household’s committed
consumption is incurred at the beginning of the period. Comm. cons. - end of period assumes
the household incurs it at the end of the period.


is around 44 percent. W-HtM households account for two-thirds of the total, and
fluctuations in this measure over time very closely follow those in the baseline definition
of Figure 5(a). The third row of Table 3 also reports results for another sequence of
direct questions in the SCF. The first question asks households “Which of the following
statements comes closest to describing your saving habits?” We label a household as
HtM if it responds “Don’t save - usually spend more than (or as much as) income.”
Roughly 24 percent of households are HtM according to this definition.

It is reassuring that our baseline estimate of HtM households sits in between the counts


                                                 25
based on these two direct questions, since we interpret the first question as providing
an upper bound and the second a lower bound. Our baseline calculations refer to the
current HtM status for a household. In the first set of direct questions, households that
spent more than their income over the past year because they dissaved or borrowed
are not truly HtM, but they would be classified as such based on the first set of direct
questions. Conversely, the second set of direct questions asks about the usual HtM sta-
tus, and therefore those households who are, at the time of the survey, transitorily into
a HtM status would answer negatively to the question. The cross-sectional correlation
between our indicator of HtM status and the one provided by these two questions is
about 0.3 for each.

Our estimates of HtM households are related to calculations of “financially fragile”
households by Lusardi, Schneider, and Tufano (2011). Based on an ad-hoc survey,
they document that a quarter of U.S. households report that they would certainly be
unable to come up with $2,000 in 30 days, and a similar fraction reports that they could
probably not come up with the funds to deal with an ordinary financial shock of this
size. These authors also emphasize that there are many solidly middle-class households
in this last group. In line three of Table 3, we compute the fraction of households
who are less than $2,000 away from the liquid wealth thresholds for being defined as
HtM. We find that 50 percent of households are “financially fragile” according to this
definition. Of these, 17 percent have no illiquid assets, but 33 percent own housing
and/or retirement wealth. The P-HtM could be mapped into the Lusardi et al. survey
respondents who would certainly not come up with this amount, and the W-HtM into
those that would probably be unable to cope. Overall, our estimates are in line with
those of Lusardi et al., but they also suggest a more nuanced interpretation. Households
in the second group have the means to deal with a shock of this size, for example, by
using their illiquid wealth as collateral for a loan. They may choose not to do it because
the transaction costs involved dominate the welfare gain from smoothing such small
shock, but for larger shocks, they will choose to adjust and smooth consumption. We
return to this shock-size asymmetry of behavior in Section 8.17

The other robustness checks in Table 3 are conducted with respect to the definition
of illiquid wealth, debt, income, and the timing of consumption expenditures. Using
a higher illiquid wealth threshold in the definition of W-HtM ($1,000 instead of $1)
moves about 1 percentage point of households from W-HtM into P-HtM. Broadening
the definition of illiquid wealth to include business equity, or directly held stocks and
 17
      Karen Pence (2011) makes a similar point in her discussion of Lusardi et al.



                                                  26
bonds, or other valuables (artwork, antiques, jewels, etc.) has small effects relative to
the baseline.18 Including all private retirement wealth as liquid wealth for households
aged sixty and above reduces the share of W-HtM households by less than 1 percentage
point.

Around one-quarter of U.S. households simultaneously have positive liquid assets above
y/2 and some revolving credit card debt.19 One may worry that many of these house-
holds have net liquid wealth close to zero, and they would therefore be counted as HtM,
even though they have slack in both liquid wealth and credit. In Table 3 we show that
excluding this group does not affect our calculations much because the distribution
of HtM status within this group is not too different from the population distribution.
Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) were virtually nonexistent before the year 2000,
but in the last decade they became a more common instrument to extract liquidity
from housing.20 Changing the definition of liquid debt by including used up HELOCs
—while simultaneously increasing the credit limit by the total available line of credit—
decreases the fraction of HtM households, as expected, but by only 1 percentage point.

The SCF collects data on a household’s normal, or usual, income as well as on their ac-
tual income. This alternate definition of income has no effect on our calculations. Recall
that our definition of income is gross income before taxes and tax credits. Through the
NBER TAXSIM, we have constructed, household by household, a measure of after-tax
income.21 Under this income measure, the total fraction of HtM households declines,
but quantitatively this effect is very small. The reason is that, in the U.S., the effective
average tax rate is very small at the low end of the income distribution (around zero),
mainly because of the EITC: even in the middle quintile it is only 10 percent. Finally,
as explained in Section 3, accounting for committed expenditures has an ambiguous
effect on the share of HtM agents, depending on whether the expenditures occur mostly
at the beginning or at the end of the pay-period. Table 3 shows that these two oppo-
site timing assumptions bound the share of total HtM households between 27 and 42
  18
      When we include business equity, we also include in our sample all those households whose labor
income comes entirely from self-employment. These households are excluded from the baseline sample.
   19
      In the household finance literature, this observation is called the credit card puzzle (Telyukova
2013).
   20
      The fraction of home-owners with HELOCs in 2001 was 7.1%, 12.9% in 2007, and 10.7% in 2010.
The average HELOC limit in 2001 was $11,087, in 2007 it was $18,984, and in 2010 it was $19,070.
The average percent of the HELOC used was 27.5% in 2001, 31.0% in 2007, and 31.6% in 2010.
   21
      The variables we used in TAXSIM are year, marital status, the number of children, and the
breakdown of income into its parts (wages, UI benefits, etc.). We deducted federal taxes from gross
income. We assumed each household files their actual marital status and claims all their children
living in the household as dependents. As an upper bound, we have also computed the case where
they all file as single without dependents.

5.2       The demographics, portfolio composition, and status per-
          sistence of HtM groups

Demographics.       We now turn to the demographic characteristics of the three
groups of HtM households. Figure 6 plots the share of the population that is W-HtM
and P-HtM by age.22 The bulk of P-HtM behavior is observed in the early stages of
the life-cycle. The fraction of P-HtM households drops sharply until age 30, and keeps
falling steadily over the life cycle until reaching roughly 5 percent in retirement. The
age profile of the fraction of W-HtM households is instead markedly hump shaped: it
peaks at around age 40, when over 20 percent of U.S. households are W-HtM, and
remains above 10 percent throughout the life cycle. Accordingly, the share of N-HtM
individuals increases steadily from 50 percent at age 22 to 80 percent in retirement.

The first three panels of Figure 7 report some demographic characteristics of the three
HtM groups by age. N-HtM households have on average one more year of education
than the W-HtM who, in turn, have one more year of education than the P-HtM. In
terms of marital status, N-HtM and W-HtM households are indistinguishable, whereas
the figure shows that the P-HtM households are 30 percent less likely to be married.
In contrast, P-HtM and W-HtM are both more likely to have children than are N-HtM
households.
  22
    These plots are based on pooled data from all surveys and do not control for time or cohort effects.
We verified that age profiles are similar in both cases, but become more noisy, and hence we present
the raw data.

Figure 8: Age profile of the portfolio composition of the HtM in the U.S., pooled 1989-2010.
To reduce the sensitivity to outliers, means are computed after trimming the overall top and
bottom 0.1 percent of that statistic’s distribution.


Figure 7(d) shows that P-HtM households are income-poor, with median annual income
around $20,000 (in $2010) during the working years, while the N-HtM are high-income
households whose median earnings are $70,000 at their life-cycle peak. The most
surprising finding is that the W-HtM look a lot like the N-HtM in terms of their
income path. The same conclusion holds for the incidence of unemployment and for
the likelihood of receiving welfare benefits, which are both much lower for N-HtM and
W-HtM households than for the P-HtM.

Portfolio composition.       Figure 8 digs deeper into the balance-sheet composition
of the three groups of HtM households. Panel (a) shows that median net liquid wealth
holdings are zero at virtually every age for both the P-HtM and the W-HtM. Median
net liquid wealth for N-HtM households grows steadily from about $2,500 at age 25
until retirement, where it levels off at roughly $15,000.23 Panel (b) reveals that the

the row HtM status in 2007 and the column HtM status in 2009. The last row reports the
implied ergodic distribution.


W-HtM hold significant amounts of illiquid wealth: for example, median holdings at
age 40 exceed $50,000. Hence, W-HtM households are not just P-HtM households
with small amounts of savings in less liquid assets. The next two panels of Figure 8
articulate this observation further. Panels (c) and (d) plot age profiles of the average
fraction of illiquid wealth held in housing and retirement accounts for W-HtM and
N-HtM households. The conclusion is striking: the lines are on top of each other,
indicating that the portfolio allocation of these two groups is nearly identical.

Persistence.      How persistent is a household’s HtM status? We answer this question
by exploiting the 2007-2009 panel component of the SCF. Table 4 reports the 2-year
transition matrix across the three HtM statuses for U.S. households. The diagonal
elements of the matrix reveal that N-HtM status is by far the most persistent, and
W-HtM status the most transient of the three. These transition probabilities imply
that the expected length of HtM status is around 3.5 years for the W-HtM, 4.5 years
for the P-HtM, and 11 years for the N-HtM.



6     Cross-country evidence

The previous section showed that around 30 percent of households in the United States
are HtM, one-third of which are P-HtM and two-thirds of which are W-HtM. In this
section we use household portfolio data from seven other developed economies to as-
sess whether the prevalence of W-HtM households is a common feature of the wealth
distribution across countries and, if so, whether the characteristics of W-HtM in terms
of demographics, income, and balance sheets are similar to those in the U.S.

As discussed in Section 4, we focus our attention on three other Anglo-Saxon countries
$2,000 (Table 2) and hence, even among the N-HtM, there are households with small amounts of
liquid wealth.

                       Figure 9: Fraction of HtM households across countries

—Canada, Australia, and the U.K.— and the four largest euro-area economies, Ger-
many, France, Italy, and Spain. While data is available for more than one point in time
for most of these countries, in order to keep the discussion manageable we focus on
the most recent single cross-section in each country. For Australia and the European
countries this is 2010, for the U.K. it is 2009, and for Canada it is 2005. For the sake
of comparability, we use only the 2010 wave of the SCF for the United States.

Figure 9(a) shows the fraction of poor and wealthy HtM households in each country.
There is a striking similarity in the overall fraction of HtM households, as well as in
their breakdown between poor and wealthy, between the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.
These three countries have a large share of HtM households, exceeding 30 percent.
Australia is an outlier among the Anglo-Saxon countries in two ways: first, the total
fraction of HtM is roughly half the fraction in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada; second,
90 percent of HtM households in Australia are W-HtM. Among the euro-area countries,
France, Italy, and Spain have smaller shares of HtM households than the U.S., U.K.,
and Canada —around 20 percent— whereas in Germany this share is closer to 30
percent. Even for the Euro area countries, the fraction of W-HtM among the HtM
households exceeds 2/3. For all eight countries, Figure 9(a) shows there are more W-
HtM households than P-HtM. Thus a wide-spread feature of international household
portfolios is that a complete characterization of the fraction of the population that is
likely to exhibit HtM behavior requires going beyond those with just low net worth.

Figure 9(b) reveals that there are significant differences in the portfolio composition for
the W-HtM across countries. In Italy and Spain, virtually all the W-HtM own some
housing wealth. Homeowners are also dominant among the group of W-HtM in the


                                                       32
U.S. and Canada. In contrast, around half of the W-HtM in Australia, Germany, and
Canada have no housing wealth. Rather, the majority of their illiquid assets are held
in private retirement accounts. Table D1 in the Appendix provides more information
on the cross-country portfolio composition.

What explains the fact that the euro area countries have a smaller fraction of HtM
households than the U.S.? In the euro area countries, households hold more liquid
wealth relative to their income compared to the United States. As is clear from Figure
2, this fact can be partially attributed to differences in liquid debt. The fraction of
P-HtM households in the euro area countries with negative liquid wealth is 2 to 4 times
smaller than in the Anglo-Saxon countries (see Table D1). Presumably, lower access
to unsecured credit in Europe implies that there are more incentives for households
to hold large balances of liquid wealth for transaction and precautionary reasons. For
example, Vandone (2009) documents that, in 2006, the total value of consumer credit
amounted to 25 percent of disposable income in the U.K., 15 percent in Germany and
Spain, 12 percent in France, and only 10 percent in Italy.

Australia is the country with the largest share of W-HtM, among HtM households.
Table D1 reveals that this can be traced to the very high share of the population that
owns private retirement wealth. As explained in Section 4, the high ownership rate
of retirement accounts in Australia is largely due to the superannuation regulations.
When we exclude superannuation accounts as a component of wealth, the fraction
of P-HtM in Australia rises from 3 to 9 percent, and the fraction of W-HtM drops
accordingly.

Age profiles.      Age profiles of the fraction of poor and wealthy HtM households
in each country are shown in Figure 10. For most countries, the fraction of P-HtM
households declines monotonically with age. The exceptions are Australia and France,
where the age profiles of the P-HtM are flat. There are some marked differences in the
age profiles of the W-HtM that can be explained by differences in portfolio holdings
across countries. In countries where housing wealth is a substantial part of household
portfolios, such as the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., the age profile is hump shaped with
a peak in the early 40s. In contrast, in Australia and Germany, where a high fraction
of W-HtM households hold retirement accounts, the share of W-HtM decreases with
age.

An important caveat to these results is that because we infer age profiles from a single
cross-section, we necessarily confound age, cohort, and time effects. This could explain,


                                           33
for example, why in Spain the share of W-HtM falls steadily with age. This pattern may
reflect time effects, since 25-35 year-olds have faced much harsher economic conditions
upon entry into the labor market than earlier cohorts.24


6.1     Robustness

Table 5 contains an extensive sensitivity analysis on our definitions of P-HtM and
W-HtM households that parallels in Table 3.

Questions on whether household spending exceeded income in the past year are present
in all surveys. Similarly to the U.S., we find larger shares of both P-HtM and W-
HtM households when we use these direct questions to measure the incidence of HtM
behavior. The difference is especially marked for Italy and Spain where, according
to this criterion, over 60 percent of households —and hence three times the baseline
estimate— are HtM. Extending the credit limit from one month of income to one year of
income has a substantial effect for the Anglo-Saxon countries, but virtually no impact
for the euro area countries. This finding is in line with the empirical distribution of
liquid assets documented in Figure 2, which showed that households with negative net
liquid wealth are extremely rare in the euro area countries.25

The fraction of “financially fragile” households (those with liquid balances lower than
the threshold plus 2,000 local currency units) is only 10-15 percentage points larger than
the share of HtM in the Anglo-Saxon countries, but in most of the euro area countries
it is 30 percentage points larger. This result is consistent with the distributions of
liquid wealth reported in Figure 2 showing that in euro area countries there is a large
mass of households just to the right of the threshold.

Shortening the pay-period to a week (or extending it to a month), from the bi-weekly
baseline, has a small impact on the fraction of P-HtM households, but decreases (in-
creases, respectively) the fraction of W-HtM households by 5 percentage points on av-
erage. Including vehicles as illiquid wealth shifts HtM households from poor to wealthy
in every country, but to a lesser extent than in the United States. In two countries,
Canada and Italy, including other non-financial assets (valuables, collectibles, jewels,
  24
     Figure D1 in the Appendix shows age-income profiles for each country by HtM status and confirms
our findings from Section 5.2. The age-income profile for W-HtM households is much more similar to
the profile of the N-HtM than to the profile for P-HtM. The only two exceptions are Italy and Spain,
where the age-income paths for all three groups are very similar.
  25
     Recall that, based on the definitions of Section 3, changing the credit limit affects HtM status
only for households with negative liquid debt.

etc.) in the definition of illiquid wealth shifts 12 and 5 percent of households from poor
to wealthy HtM, respectively.26 Including HELOCs among liquid debt has no effect,
except in Canada, where the share of HtM increases by 8 percentage points.

Our baseline measure of income is income after transfers but before taxes, except for
Canada where it is disposable income. For three countries, the U.S., the U.K., and
Italy, we can analyze the effect of netting taxes at the source for every household.27 In
all these three countries, the effect of this correction is minor.



7      The consumption response of the wealthy hand-
       to-mouth to transitory income shocks

In the previous sections we documented a sizable presence of W-HtM households across
a number of countries, but our survey data did not allow us to investigate the con-
sumption behavior of this group of households. In this section we show evidence that,
as predicted by the theory presented in Section 2, these households have a large MPC
out of transitory income shocks. We use data fom the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID) to estimate the consumption response to transitory changes in income using
the methodology proposed by Blundell, Pistaferri, and Preston (2008, hereafter BPP),
and further examined in Kaplan and Violante (2010). The novelties of our empirical
analysis, relative to BPP, are that we use a more recent sample period with enriched
data and, most importantly, we estimate transmission coefficients of income shocks to
consumption separately for different types of HtM households.

Data source.          Estimating the consumption response to income shocks for house-
holds with different types of HtM status requires a longitudinal dataset with informa-
tion on income, consumption, and wealth at the household level. Starting from the
1999 wave, the PSID contains the necessary data. The PSID started collecting infor-
mation on a sample of roughly 5,000 households in 1968. Thereafter, both the original
families and their split-offs (children of the original family forming a family of their
own) have been followed. The survey was annual until 1996 and became biennial start-
  26
      There are differences in this question across surveys. The SCF and the HFCS ask about the
single most valuable asset not previously mentioned. In HILDA, they ask about collectibles. In the
Canadian SFS, valuables are meant to include also the content of the principal residence. In light of
this, the result for Canada is not surprising.
   27
      For the U.S., we resort to an imputation based on TAXSIM as explained in Section 5.1.1. The
U.K. and Italian surveys ask households about their tax liabilities.



                                                 37
ing in 1997. In 1999 the survey augmented the consumption information available to
researchers so that it now covers over 70 percent of all consumption items available in
the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), and also asked a set of additional questions
on the household balance sheet in every wave.28

Sample selection.           We start with the PSID Core Sample and drop households with
missing information on race, education, or state of residence, and those whose income
grows more than 500 percent, falls by more than 80 percent, or is below $100. We drop
households who have top-coded income or consumption. We also drop households that
appear in the sample fewer than three consecutive times, because identification of the
coefficients of interest requires a minimum of three periods. In our baseline calculations,
we keep households where the head is 25-55 years old. Our final sample has 39,772
observations over the pooled years 1999-2011 (seven sample years).

Definitions.        The construction of our consumption measure follows Blundell,
Pistaferri, and Saporta-Eksten (2014). We include food at home and food away from
home, utilities, gasoline, car maintenance, public transportation, child care, health
expenditures, and education. Our definition of household income is labor earnings
of the households plus government transfers. Liquid assets in the PSID include the
value of checking and savings accounts, money market funds, certificates of deposit,
savings bonds, and Treasury bills plus directly held shares of stock in publicly held
corporations, mutual funds, or investment trusts. Before 2011, liquid debt is the value
of debts other than mortgages, such as credit cards, student loans, medical or legal
bills, and personal loans. In 2011, liquid debt includes only credit card debt. Net
liquid wealth is liquid assets minus liquid debt. Net illiquid wealth is the value of home
equity plus the net value of other real estate plus the value of private annuities or IRAs
and the value of other investments in trusts or estates, bond funds, and life insurance
policies.29 Net worth is the sum of net illiquid and net liquid wealth. Given these
definitions of income and wealth, the HtM status indicators are constructed exactly
as outlined in Section 3, where the pay-period is assumed to be two weeks, and the
credit limit is one month of income. In our PSID sample, 25 percent of households
  28
      Until 1999, the Wealth Files supplemented the annual survey every five years. Starting in 1999,
they became biannual, like the survey itself. In 2009 and 2011, the wealth questions were enriched
further with the Housing, Mortgage Distress, and Wealth Data Supplements.
   29
      The two main discrepancies with the SCF definitions are that we do not attempt a cash imputation,
and both CDs and saving bonds are in liquid, instead of illiquid, wealth. Since these two saving
instruments are not common, we do not expect this discrepancy to affect our results. For example,
if we classify CDs and saving bonds as liquid wealth in the 2010 SCF, the fraction of HtM drops by
only 1 percentage point.



                                                  38
are W-HtM, roughly in line with the SCF estimates, but the share of the P-HtM is 21
percent, and hence is almost twice as large as its counterpart in the SCF.

The BPP methodology.           We refer the reader to BPP and to Kaplan and Violante
(2010) for a thorough description of the methodology. Here, we only sketch the key
steps. As in BPP, we first regress log income and log consumption expenditures on
year and cohort dummies, education, race, family structure, employment, geographic
variables, and interactions of year dummies with education, race, employment, and
region. We then construct the first-differenced residuals of log consumption ∆cit and
log income ∆yit . Recall that, since the survey is biannual, a period is two years.
The income process yit is represented as an error component model which comprises
orthogonal permanent and i.i.d. components. Hence, income growth is given by

                                     ∆yit = ηit + ∆εit ,                             (13)

where ηit is the permanent shock and εit is the transitory shock. This is a common
income process in the empirical labor literature, at least since MaCurdy (1982) and
Abowd and Card (1989) who showed that this specification is parsimonious and fits
income data well. The BPP estimator of the transmission coefficient of transitory
income shocks to consumption, the MPC, is given by

                              \       cov(∆cit , ∆yi,t+1 )
                              MP Ct =                       .                        (14)
                                      cov(∆yi,t , ∆yi,t+1 )

The true marginal propensity to consume out of a transitory shock is defined as

                                             cov (∆cit , εit )
                                 MP Ct =                                             (15)
                                                var(εit )

The estimator in (14) is a consistent estimator of (15) if the household has no foresight,
or no advanced information, about future shocks, i.e.:

                        cov (∆cit , ηi,t+1 ) = cov (∆cit , εi,t+1 ) = 0,             (16)

The estimator is implemented by an IV regression of ∆cit on ∆yit , instrumented by
∆yi,t+1 . Note that ∆yi,t+1 is correlated with the transitory shock at t, but not with the
permanent one. Kaplan and Violante (2010) show that the presence of tight borrow-
ing constraints does not bias the estimate of the transmission coefficient for transitory
shocks —an important finding in light of the fact that we are interested in the dif-
ferential response of HtM households, who may be close to a constraint, and N-HtM

households.

Results.        Table 6 summarizes our results. In our baseline specification, the MPC
of the W-HtM group is the highest, around 30 percent. In other words, in the first
two years, the W-HtM households consume 30 percent of an unexpected change in
income whose effect entirely dissipates within the period. The point estimate of the
MPC for the P-HtM is 24 percent, and for the N-HtM is less than 13 percent. Given
the well known measurement error present in survey data, especially for consumption
expenditures, and the small sample size, it is not surprising that these estimates are
somewhat imprecise. However, the difference between the MPC for the W-HtM and
the N-HtM is statistically significant.

When the sample is split between HtM and N-HtM based on net worth, the estimated
transmission coefficients are very similar across the two groups. The group of HtM-NW
is essentially the same as the P-HtM, and in fact their estimated MPCs are similar.
However, among the N-HtM-NW there are also many W-HtM households that artifi-
cially inflate the estimate of the MPC. Based on this household classification, one would
conclude that there is no evidence of a differential response of consumption to income
shocks for households with different HtM status. A classification based on liquid and


                                              40
illiquid wealth, instead, finds economically significant differences.

The remaining rows in Table 6 offer a robustness analysis with respect to the definition
of income and consumption, household composition, and the assumed pay-period. The
ranking of MPCs between wealthy, poor, and non-HtM is always as in the baseline
specification, and as predicted by the theory, the gap between HtM households based
on the net worth criterion is always very small or is not statistically significant.

Our key finding that the consumption of the W-HtM displays excess sensitivity to
transitory income shocks is in line with some recent findings. Misra and Surico (2013)
expand on the research of Johnson, Parker, and Souleles (2006) and Parker, Souleles,
Johnson, and McLelland (2013) on the U.S. fiscal stimulus payment episodes of 2001
and 2008. They conclude that, for both stimulus programs, the largest propensity to
consume out of the tax rebate is found among households who own real estate but
have high levels of mortgage debt. Cloyne and Surico (2013) exploit a long span of
expenditure survey data for the U.K. and a narrative measure of exogenous income tax
changes. They also find that homeowners with high leverage ratios exhibit large and
persistent consumption responses to tax shocks. Baker (2013) combines several novel
sources of household data on consumption expenditures, income, and household balance
sheets to investigate the comovement of income and consumption, at the micro level,
around the Great Recession. He finds that expenditures of highly-indebted households
with illiquid assets are especially sensitive to income fluctuations. Overall, this body
of work confirms our finding in Figure 4 that highly-leveraged homeowners are likely
to be W-HtM and, hence, to have large MPC out of income shocks.



8     Implications for fiscal policy

What does the existence of W-HtM households, together with their large propensities
to consume out of transitory income shocks, imply for how one should think about
fiscal policy? In this section we use a series of policy simulations from three alternative
models to argue that W-HtM households should be modelled as a separate group:
ignoring them leads to a distorted view of the effects of fiscal stimulus policies on
aggregate consumption.

The first model that we use is the two-asset incomplete markets model from Kaplan and
Violante (2014a, 2014b, KV thereafter). We label this model SIM-2, since it extends
the standard incomplete markets (SIM) life-cycle economy by adding a second illiquid

                                            41
asset that pays a higher return —through both a financial component and a housing
services component— but is subject to a transaction cost. For the reasons explained
in Section 2, the illiquidity due to the transaction cost means that the model generates
households of all three HtM types. The version of the model we use here does not allow
borrowing and has a transaction cost of $1,000.30

The second model, which we label SIM-1, is a standard one-asset incomplete markets
life cycle model. The version that we adopt is the same as in KV, but with the
transaction cost set to zero, and recalibrated to data on net worth alone, rather than
data on illiquid and liquid assets separately. Since this is a one-asset model, it generates
only P-HtM and N-HtM households, and has no W-HtM households.

The third model, which we label SP-S, is a spender-saver model in the spirit of Camp-
bell and Mankiw (1989) and, more recently, Gali, Lopez-Salido, and Valles (2007),
Eggertson and Krugman (2012), and Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2013).
In the SP-S model, some households (the savers) act as forward-looking optimizing
consumers who can save in a single risk-free asset. The remaining households (the
spenders) follow the rule-of-thumb consumption policy of consuming all their income
in every period. This class of models is typically calibrated so that the distinction
between the spenders and savers is based on their holdings of liquid wealth rather
than net worth. Thus, in the SP-S model, the W-HtM and the P-HtM households are
lumped together and considered to be the spenders, while the N-HtM households are
considered to be the savers.

To summarize, SIM-2 is a two-asset economy in which the W-HtM households are
explicitly modeled as a distinct group. SIM-1 is a “net-worth economy” where the W-
HtM households are treated as if they were N-HtM households. Compared to SIM-2,
SIM-1 greatly understates the fraction of HtM households. SP-S is a “liquid-wealth
economy” where both the W-HtM and the P-HtM are treated identically as HtM
households with an MPC that is always equal to 1. Thus, compared to SIM2, SP-S
has the correct number of HtM households, but it greatly overstates their MPC.

From each of these three models, we simulate a cohort of households. For each house-
hold, we compute the quarterly consumption response to a one-time unexpected cash
windfall, or cash loss, of different amounts ($50, $500, $2,000). We then divide the sim-
  30
     We refer the reader to KV for a full description of the model, its calibration, and a comparison
of the predictions of the model with life-cycle data, and with the aggregate consumption response to
the 2001 and 2008 fiscal stimulus payments as estimated by Johnson, Parker and Souleles (2006), and
Parker et al. (2013), respectively.

ulated cohort into twenty-seven bins, based on three income terciles, three age classes
(22-40, 40-60, 60+) and the three HtM groups. For each of these bins we compute the
average consumption response from the model. To obtain an aggregate response of the
economy, we need shares of the population in each of these twenty-seven groups. For
this last step, we use our cross-sectional survey data from Sections 5 and 6.

Table 7 reports the quarterly average MPCs out of a $500 windfall in the three models,
for the HtM groups and for some sub-groups defined by income and age, using group
shares from the 2010 SCF. In the SIM-2 model, MPCs are very small for all N-HtM
households, except for those who are income-poor and old. For high-income households
who are N-HtM, the average MPC is slightly negative. The intuition for this finding is
discussed in detail in KV. It arises because the receipt of a $500 windfall may trigger a
household who has already accumulated lots of liquid wealth, and is close to its planned
date of deposit, to pay the transaction cost and make an earlier deposit into the illiquid
account. Since such a household can effectively save at the rate of return on the illiquid
asset, it chooses to consume less and save more than it would have in the absence of the
income windfall. This example illustrates how explicitly modeling W-HtM behavior
through transaction costs may alter the MPC even for N-HtM households. The MPCs
for both the W-HtM and P-HtM households in the SIM-2 economy are substantial.
They are slightly larger for the W-HtM than the P-HtM, particularly for households
with a high level of income. As explained in Section 2, since the W-HtM have higher
lifetime incomes than the P-HtM, they have higher target consumption and hence
spend more out of an unexpected moderately-sized payment.

In the SIM-1 model, the MPCs for HtM households are almost identical to those for

P-HtM households in the SIM-2 model, and the MPCs for N-HtM households are, in
general, even smaller than those for N-HtM households in the SIM-2 model. In the
SP-S model, by construction, the MPCs for the N-HtM households are the same as in
the SIM-1 model and are equal to one for HtM households.

Policy simulations for the U.S.             We now show that the three models yield very
different predictions for the aggregate MPC out of unexpected, one-time, lump-sum
transfers/taxes of different amounts. Table 8 reports the policy-experiments results
(i.e., the aggregate quarterly consumption responses) for the U.S. using the SCF data
from 2010 to estimate the group shares.

We begin by analyzing a policy experiment where every household receives a $500
transfer, e.g., a stimulus payment. The aggregate MPC of the SIM-2 economy is 0.18.
This value is substantially larger than the MPC of the SIM-1 economy (0.04) because
the SIM-1 economy, by treating the W-HtM households as N-HtM, misses a large
fraction of the population that have high MPCs. The aggregate MPC is highest for
the SP-S economy (0.35) because this model implicitly assumes that all P-HtM and
W-HtM households all spend the entire $500. Our discussion of Table 7 suggests that
this assumption is extreme: in the SIM-2 economy, HtM households spend on average
only 35%-45% of their payments in the quarter they are received.

Table 8 also shows that the degree of size asymmetry in the aggregate MPC differs
remarkably across the three models. In the SIM-2 model, the consumption response to


                                              44
a $50 windfall is 0.29 while the response to a $2,000 windfall is only 0.05. The reason
for this large asymmetry is the availability of an illiquid savings instrument subject to
a transaction cost. For large enough windfalls, many HtM households in SIM-2 may
find it optimal to pay the transaction cost and make a deposit into the illiquid asset.
However, for small windfalls, it is never optimal to adjust the illiquid asset: households
thus face an intertemporal tradeoff governed by the (low) return on the liquid asset,
and thus have a large incentive to consume. This size asymmetry is absent from both
the SP-S and SIM-1 models. In the SP-S model it is absent because of the assumed
rule-of-thumb behavior: the HtM households in the SP-S model always consume their
entire transfer, regardless of its size. In the SIM-1 model there is only a modest decline
in the MPC with the size of the payment because households always face the same
inter-temporal trade off when making their consumption decisions.

The degree of sign asymmetry also differs across the three models. In the SIM-1 and
SIM-2 models, the response to a lump-sum tax of $500 is substantially larger than
the response to a $500 transfer. Even HtM households, who are at a kink in their
budget constraints, desire to save some part of a positive windfall if it is large enough
to push them off the kink. Negative income changes, however, cannot be smoothed
for households at the constraint, and withdrawing from the illiquid account is too
expensive to be optimal —recall that in the calibrated SIM-2 model, the transaction
cost is $1,000. In the SP-S model, the response to positive and negative income shocks
are essentially the same, since the HtM households have an MPC of 1 regardless of the
sign of the shock.

Table 8 reveals that the models have different implications for the optimal degree of
“income targeting” of fiscal stimulus transfers for maximizing the aggregate consump-
tion response. A widely held view is that the aggregate consumption response to a
fiscal stimulus policy, per dollar paid out, is strongest when the transfers are targeted
to households with the lowest income, that is, stimulus payments should be phased
out for middle- and high-income households for maximum effect. This view, which is
based on the conjecture that HtM households are income-poor, ignores the W-HtM,
a group with significantly higher income, as we showed in Sections 5.2 and 6. In line
with this observation, the SIM-2 model generates only a very modest decline (0.26 to
0.20) between the MPC out of a $500 transfer for households in the lowest income ter-
cile and households in the middle income tercile. The corresponding relative declines
across income terciles are much larger under the SIM-1 and SP-S models. In the SIM-1
model, the only high-MPC households are the low-income P-HtM; in the SP-S model,


                                           45
all HtM households are assumed to have the same MPC, while under the SIM-2 model
we saw in Table 7 that, among W-HtM households, MPCs are increasing in income.

Implied cross-country variation in effects of policy We now explore what the
three models predict for the aggregate response to a $500 fiscal stimulus check in each
of the eight countries in our sample. To do this, we use our survey data to estimate the
fraction of households in each country who fall into each of the 27 bins, and then apply
these country-specific group weightings to the model-generated MPCs. To illustrate the
differences in model predictions, Figure 11 plots the estimated aggregate MPC under
the SIM-2 model against the corresponding MPC under the SIM-1 model (triangles)
and the SP-S model (circles).

The figure shows striking differences in the amount of cross-country dispersion in the
aggregate MPC predicted by the three models. There is much less dispersion in the
SIM-1 model compared to the SIM-2 model because, by treating the W-HtM as N-
HtM, the SIM-1 model misses most of the cross-country variation in HtM behavior. In
contrast, there is more dispersion in the SP-S model than in the SIM-2 model. This
is because, by assigning an MPC of 1 to all the W-HtM households, compared to an
MPC of 0.44 in the SIM-2 model, the SP-S model exaggerates existing cross-country
heterogeneity in the fraction of HtM households.

These experiments clearly illustrate why it is important to think deeply about the
behavior of W-HtM households when considering the design of fiscal policies. With
respect to the traditional view based on SIM-1 or SP-S models, we demonstrate three
lessons: (i) there is limited scope for stimulating aggregate consumption by increasing
the transfer size; (ii) the aggregate consumption response to a lump-sum tax is much
stronger, in absolute value, than the response to an equal-size transfer; and (iii) target-
ing stimulus payments exclusively towards low-income families will miss a substantial
fraction of liquidity-constrained households.



9     Concluding remarks

We set out to investigate, theoretically and empirically, the behavior of wealthy hand-
to-mouth households — an often overlooked, but highly relevant part of the population
— and to reflect on their implications for macroeconomic modeling and fiscal policy
design. We conclude by taking stock of what we have learnt.

Theoretically, we showed that wealthy hand-to-mouth behavior can occur when house-
holds face a trade-off between the long-run gain from investing in illiquid assets (i.e.,
assets that require the payment of a transaction cost for making unplanned deposits or
withdrawals), and the short-run cost of having fewer liquid assets available to smooth
consumption.

Empirically, we documented that 30 percent of households in the U.S. are hand-to-
mouth, and that this fraction has been relatively constant over the past two decades.
The share of hand-to-mouth households varies somewhat across the eight countries in
our study, from less than 20 percent in Australia and Spain to over 30 percent in the
U.K. and Germany. Given our identification strategy, these estimates are likely to be
a lower bound. The key finding is that in all countries, the vast majority of hand-to-
mouth households, at least two-thirds of them, are wealthy hand-to-mouth, not poor
hand-to-mouth.

Who are the wealthy hand-to-mouth? We highlight three features. First, unlike poor
hand-to-mouth households, the wealthy hand-to-mouth are not predominantly young
households with low income. Rather, the frequency of wealthy hand-to-mouth status
has a hump-shaped age profile that peaks in the early forties and an income profile
that mirrors strongly that of the non hand-to-mouth. Second, they are not simply poor
hand-to-mouth households with very small holdings of illiquid assets. Rather, they
hold substantial wealth in housing and retirement accounts, in the same proportions
as non hand-to-mouth households. Finally, their hand-to-mouth status is somewhat

                                                                                       47
more transient than that of the poor hand-to-mouth.

Why does this group of households deserve the attention of economists and policy
makers?

Wealthy hand-to-mouth households are important because they have large consump-
tion responses to transitory income shocks —a crucial determinant of the efficacy of
many types of fiscal interventions, such as the fiscal stimulus payments that were
implemented in the last two recessions. To demonstrate this, we use PSID data to
show that the transmission coefficient of transitory income shocks into consumption
is significantly larger for wealthy (and poor) hand-to-mouth households than for non
hand-to-mouth households.

The wealthy hand-to-mouth thus have consumption responses that, in many ways, are
similar to the poor hand-to-mouth, yet have demographic characteristics and portfolio
composition that resemble the non hand-to-mouth. This suggests that the three types
of hand-to-mouth households each need their own unique place in frameworks that are
to be used for analyzing and forecasting the effects of fiscal policy. Macroeconomists
need to move beyond one-asset models, such as those in the spirit of Aiyagari (1994),
Huggett (1996), and Rios-Rull (1995), since these models assume wealthy hand-to-
mouth households are as unconstrained as non hand-to-mouth ones. They also need
to move beyond spender-saver models, such as those in the spirit of Campbell and
Mankiw (1989), and Eggertsson and Krugman (2012), since these models treat all
hand-to-mouth households identically, and thus assume that wealthy hand-to-mouth
households are as constrained as poor hand-to-mouth. In particular, by ignoring the
fact that wealthy hand-to-mouth can use illiquid assets to buffer large negative shocks,
these models exaggerate the financial fragility of this group. In the last section, we
ran several fiscal policy experiments to illustrate where misleading inferences would be
obtained by using either of these two simpler models of hand-to-mouth behavior.

A      A simple model of wealthy hand-to-mouth be-
       havior

In this Appendix, we provide a more detailed analysis of the model in Section (2) of
the paper.

Consider a household that lives for periods, t = 0, 1, 2, but consumes only in the last
two periods of life. Preferences over consumption at t = 1, 2 are given by

                                   v0 = u (c1 ) + u (c2 )

with no discounting. In period 0, the household has an initial endowment ω and makes
a portfolio allocation decision. Two assets are available as saving instruments. First,
there is an illiquid asset a that pays off a gross return R before the consumption decision
in period 2, but cannot be accessed at the time of the consumption decision in period 1.
Second, there is a liquid asset m that can be accessed before the consumption decision
in both periods, but pays a return 1 < R. For now, we do not allow the agent to
borrow, i.e. take negative a position in the liquid asset, but we relax this assumption
in Section A.4. After the initial portfolio allocation decision, households receive income
y1 and make their consumption and liquid saving decision in period 1. In the second,
and last, period, they receive income y2 and consume this endowment plus their savings
in liquid and illiquid wealth. The only two decisions to characterize are therefore the
initial portfolio allocation decision, and the consumption/saving decision at t = 1.

We make the following normalizations and parametric assumptions. Period utility u is
CES with intertemporal elasticity of substitution σ > 0. We set the initial endowment
ω to 1, so the initial portfolio allocation (m1 , a) has the interpretation of shares of
wealth invested in liquid and illiquid wealth. We set y2 = Γ > 1 and we allow two
possible values for y1 , {yL , yH } where yL = 0 and yH > R + Γ. We refer to these two
cases as “low-income” and “high-income” paths. The low income path is increasing
and the high income path is decreasing.

Our characterization of hand-to-mouth behavior concerns the asset position at the
time of the t = 1 consumption decision. We define a household as not hand-to-mouth
(N-HtM) if, after consuming at t = 1, it holds a positive amount of liquid assets, i.e.
m2 > 0 and a ≥ 0. We define a household as poor hand-to-mouth (P-HtM) if, after


                                            52
consuming at t = 1, it does not hold any liquid or illiquid assets, i.e. m2 = 0 and
a = 0. We define a household as wealthy hand-to-mouth (W-HtM) if, after consuming
at t = 1, it holds a positive amount of illiquid assets but no liquid assets, i.e. m2 = 0
and a > 0.31 Therefore, the t = 1 consumption/saving decision determines whether an
agent is HtM, and the initial portfolio allocation determines whether a HtM agent is
poor or wealthy HtM.


A.1     Solution without illiquid asset

We begin by analyzing a special case where there is no illiquid asset. In this case we
refer to the liquid asset as net worth. We solve the model backwards, starting from the
consumption decision at t = 1. The problem faced by the household at t = 1 is

                           v1 (m1 ) = max u (c1 ) + u (m2 + Γ)
                                         c1 ,m2
                                         s.t.
                          c1 + m2 = y1 + m1
                                m2 ≥ 0

which has the solution                                     
                                              y1 − Γ + m1
                              m2 = max                    ,0 .                           (A1)
                                                   2
The interior solution for m2 implies a perfectly smooth consumption path, c1 = c2 =
(y1 + Γ + m1 ) /2 because there is no discounting and the interest rate on the liquid
asset (the only saving vehicle available at t = 1) is 1. The corner solution m2 = 0
yields an increasing consumption path, c1 = y1 + m1 , c2 = Γ. Since the liquid asset is
the only available asset, the initial portfolio allocation decision is trivial, and m1 = 1.

Thus there two cases, depending on the income path. Under the low income path with
yL = 0 < Γ − 1, equation (A1) reveals that the constraint binds at t = 1 and the
household is P-HtM with an increasing consumption profile. Under the high income
path with yH > R + Γ > Γ − 1, the constraint is not binding and the household is
N-HtM with a smooth consumption profile.
  31
    The final case, m2 > 0 and a = 0, which is another form of N-HtM behavior, is never optimal
given the assumptions above, but could be easily accommodated.




                                                53
A.2     Solution with illiquid asset

We now turn to the general two-asset model. At t = 1 the consumption decision is

                    v1 (m1 , a) = max u (c1 ) + u (m2 + Ra + Γ)
                                    c1 ,m2
                                    s.t.
                      c1 + m2 = y1 + m1
                              m2 ≥ 0

which has the solution
                                                          
                                        y1 − Γ + m1 − Ra
                         m2 = max                        ,0 .                    (A2)
                                                2

The interior solution for m2 implies a smooth consumption path c1 = c2 = (y1 + Γ + m1 + Ra) /2,
while the corner solution yields the consumption pair (c1 = y1 + m1 , c2 = Γ + Ra).
Note that under the low income path yL = 0 < Γ − 1 ≤ Γ − m1 + Ra for any feasible
pair (a, m1 ). Therefore, equation (A2) implies that the constraint will bind at t = 1,
regardless of the initial portfolio allocation, and m2 = 0. In this case, the household
is therefore HtM. Instead, under the high income path, yH > R + Γ ≥ Γ − m1 + Ra
for any pair (a, m1 ). Hence equation (A2) implies that the constraint will not bind
at t = 2, regardless of the initial portfolio allocation, and m2 > 0. In this case, the
household is N-HtM.

Next, consider the initial portfolio allocation decision. Under the high income path,
when the constraint is not binding, the problem is
                                                          
                                       y1 + Γ + m1 + Ra
                         v0    = max u
                                 a,m1          2
                                 s.t.
                         1 = a + m1

It is immediate to see that the objective function is steeper in a than in m1 because
of the higher rate of return on the illiquid asset. Hence the household invests all of
its initial endowment in the illiquid asset and we have a corner solution with a = 1.
In this case, the household is N-HtM with a perfectly smooth consumption profile
c1 = c2 = (yH + Γ + R) /2.

Under the low income path (y1 = yL = 0) the constraint binds at t = 1 and m2 = 0.




                                               54
The problem becomes

                           v0 = max u (m1 ) + u (Ra + Γ)
                                      a,m1
                                     s.t.
                             1 = a + m1

which has the solution

                                 Rσ − Γ
                                                               
                                                         R+Γ
                   a = max              , 0 , m1 = min          ,1 .                 (A3)
                                 R + Rσ                  R + Rσ

Note that the portfolio allocation decision will always imply m1 > 0 since the household
needs liquidity at t = 1 for consumption. Thus, it only remains to determine when
a = 0 and when a > 0.
             1
If 1 < R ≤ Γ σ , equation (A3) implies that a = 0 and the household is P-HtM. In this
case the return on the illiquid asset is not large enough for the household to tolerate
the large jump in consumption between t = 1 and t = 2 that would occur if it were to
save some of the initial endowment in illiquid wealth. Hence c1 = 1 and c2 = Γ, and
                                 1
therefore c2 = Γc1 . When R > Γ σ , we instead have an interior solution for the portfolio
allocation, and the agent is W-HtM with consumption c1 = (R + Γ) / (R + Rσ ) and
c2 = Rσ c1 > Γc1 .


A.3     Implications for the MPC out of an unexpected income
        transfer

Suppose that after the initial portfolio allocation decision, but before the consumption
decision at t = 1, the household receives an unexpected transfer τ from the government.
What is the household’s MPC out of this transfer? A N-HtM household has an MPC
of exactly 1/2, since it smooths the payment equally across the two periods. Next,
consider the problem of a household who, in absence of the transfer would be P-HtM,
i.e., it faces y1 = yL = 0 and optimally chose the portfolio allocation (m1 = 1, a = 0):

                         v1 (1, 0) = max u (c1 ) + u (m2 + Γ)
                                            c1 ,m2
                                            s.t.
                         c1 + m2 = τ + 1
                                 m2 ≥ 0



                                                   55
which has the solution                                         
                                                       τ −Γ+1
                                   m2 = max                   ,0 .
                                                          2
For any small payment 0 < τ < Γ − 1, this household remains P-HtM and has an MPC
of 1. Its consumption path is: c1 + 1 + τ, c2 = Γ. If, instead, τ ≥ Γ − 1, the household
becomes unconstrained, consumption equals (τ + Γ + 1) /2τ in both periods and its
MPC out of the transfer drops to (τ + Γ − 1)/2τ which approaches 1/2 as τ increases.

Finally, consider the problem of a household who, in absence of the transfer would be
W-HtM, i.e., it faces y1 = yL = 0 and optimally chose a = a∗ = (Rσ − Γ) / (R + Rσ ) >
0:

                     v1 (1 − a∗ , a∗ ) = max u (c1 ) + u (m2 + Ra∗ + Γ)
                                              c1 ,m2
                                              s.t.
                            c1 + m2 = τ + (1 − a∗ )
                                  m2 ≥ 0

The solution to this problem is:
                                                                     
                                            τ − Γ + (1 − a∗ ) − Ra∗
                           m2 = max                                 ,0 .
                                                       2

This household has a MPC of 1 as long as τ ≤ Γ − 1 + (R + 1) a∗ . This condition is
weaker than the condition for a P-HtM to have a MPC of 1 because the income (and
consumption) ratio between t = 1 and t = 2 is higher for a W-HtM compared to a
P-HtM.32


A.4      Unsecured credit

We now extend the model and allow households to access credit to finance consumption
at t = 1. We assume that households can borrow up to a fraction φ ≤ 1 of their future
income Γ and that the interest rate on borrowing is Rb > 1. Hence the credit limit is
m= φΓ/Rb . To make the exercise interesting, we impose the additional restriction that
Rb < Γ, which ensures that a household with the low income path will always borrow
a positive amount. Indeed, the no-borrowing case studied above can be interpreted as
  32
     Put differently, the shadow value of an additional unit of income at t = 1 is higher for the W-HtM
than for the P-HtM. If we let λ be the shadow value of a unit of income in period 1, for a P-HtM
agent we have λ = u′ (1 + τ ) − u′ (Γ) and for a W-HtM agent we have λ = u′ (τ + (1 − a)) − u′ (Ra + Γ),
which is larger.



                                                       56
a model where borrowing is allowed but Rb ≥ Γ, and credit is so expensive that no
household ever uses it. Since the role of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is
well understood from the previous analysis, we impose σ = 1 (i.e., logarithmic utility)
to simplify the exposition.


A.4.1    Solution without illiquid asset

Under the high income path, the household is not constrained and chooses to save some
of its high income into the liquid asset at t = 1. Since the borrowing constraint is not
binding, the solution with borrowing is unchanged and m2 > 0.

Under the low income path, the problem is more interesting. In this case, m2 ≤ 0 and
at t = 1:

                           v1 = max log (c1 ) + log Rb m2 + Γ
                                                                 
                                   c1 ,m2
                                   s.t.
                     c1 + m2 = 1
                                     φΓ
                          m2 ≥ −
                                     Rb

which has the solution
                                       Γ − Rb φΓ
                                                  
                            m2 = max −       ,−      .
                                        2Rb     Rb
Since Rb < Γ, the household always borrows a positive amount. Moreover, if Rb <
Γ (1 − 2φ), then the credit limit is binding. The household is forced to choose an
increasing consumption path, c1 = 1 + φΓ/Rb , c2 = Γ (1 − φ). If, instead, Γ > Rb ≥
Γ (1 − 2φ), the solution for m2 is negative and interior: by borrowing, it can perfectly
                                                     
smooth consumption at the level c1 = c2 = Rb + Γ /2.

In light of the discussion in Section A.3 about MPCs, only the household at the credit
limit has a MPC equal to 1, and only if the transfer is small enough not to change
its HtM status. For small transfers, a household with an interior negative position is
unconstrained and has a MPC equal to 1/2.


A.4.2    Solution with illiquid asset

Once again, under the high income path the household is not constrained at t = 1, so
allowing for borrowing has no effect on its decisions. Under the low-income path where
y1 = yL = 0, the household may want to borrow at t = 1. Its consumption decision at


                                            57
t = 1 is:

                  v1 (m1 , a) = max log (c1 ) + log Rb m2 + Ra + Γ
                                                                       
                                  c1 ,m2
                                  s.t.
                    c1 + m2 = m1
                                φΓ
                         m2 ≥ −
                                Rb

which has the solution

                                           Rb m1 − Γ − Ra φΓ
                                                                
                          m2 = max                       ,−
                                                 2Rb        Rb


If Rb < Γ, then for every feasible portfolio allocation (m1 , a), the first argument of the
max operator in the above equation is negative, and hence m2 < 0. The credit limit is
binding when Rb < [Γ (1 − 2φ) + Ra]/m1 , i.e., when borrowing is sufficiently cheap. In
this case, consumption is given by c1 = m1 + φΓ/Rb and c2 = Γ (1 − φ) + Ra. When
borrowing is sufficiently expensive, i.e. Rb ≥ [Γ (1 − 2φ) + Ra]/m1 , the solution for
m2 is interior in the negative range and consumption is fully smoothed with c1 = c2 =
                  
 Rb m1 + Γ + Ra /2.

We now analyze the portfolio decision at t = 0. Since we are interested in characterizing
HtM behavior, we focus on the case where the borrowing constraint binds, i.e. m2 =
−φΓ/Rb . In this case, the portfolio problem is:

                   v0 = max u (m1 + φΓ/Rb ) + u (Ra + Γ (1 − φ))
                           a,m1
                           s.t.
                    1 = a + m1

with solution                     (                            )
                                      R+       1 + R/Rb φ − 1 Γ
                       a = max                                  ,0 .
                                                   2R

Using the assumed restriction Rb < Γ, it can be shown that a = 0 if R < Rb (1 − φ) / (1 + φ)
and a is strictly positive if R > Γ (1 − φ) / (1 + φ). The former parameter configura-
tion corresponds to a P-HtM household who has borrowed up to the credit limit. The
latter parameter configuration corresponds to a household who chooses to save into the
illiquid asset and then borrows up to its credit limit. This is a W-HtM household with
negative liquid wealth (at the credit limit). Both households will have an MPC of 1
out of a small transfer.


                                                58
B     Measurement bias

Wihtout loss of generality, let the pay-period be the unit interval [0, 1], where 0 is the
beginning and 1 the end. Denote a generic point within the pay period as t. Let y0 be
income paid at the beginning of the pay-period (by definition), s0 be the liquid saving
transferred from the previous pay-period, and s1 be the end of the pay-period liquid
saving. Initial and final balances of liquid wealth are therefore:

                                     m0 = y0 + s0
                                     m1 = s1 .

We always assume that, during the pay-period, consumption expenditures ct occur at
a constant rate. Recall that this is optimal if, as we have assumed so far, there is no
discounting and the return on the liquid asset is one. Then, at every t ∈ [0, 1], we have
that ct = y0 + s0 − s1 . Moreover, at a point t the balances of liquid wealth are

                     mt = y0 + s0 − ct · t = (y0 + s0 ) (1 − t) + s1 t.

Note that, since t is uniformly distributed over the unit interval,

                                  mt ∼ U [s1 , y0 + s0 ] ,                           (B1)

and its mean (average balances of liquid wealth) is

                                 m̄ = (y0 + s0 + s1 ) /2.                            (B2)


We start by analyzing the measurement of HtM households when what we observe is
average balances of liquid wealth.


B.1     Measurement through average balances

We first analyze the measurement of HtM households at the zero kink, then that of
households at the credit limit.




                                            59
B.1.1   Kink at zero

We abstract from debt for now, so s0 ≥ 0 and s1 ≥ 0. In the model, a household is
HtM when s1 = 0. According to our identification strategy of Section 3, a household
is HtM when m̄ ≤ y0 /2. Given (B2) , this condition that corresponds to

                                     s1 + s0 ≤ 0.

Thus, our estimator is a lower bound because, for this condition to be true it must be
that s0 = s1 = 0, whereas the true definition just requires s1 = 0. Put differently,

                    Pr [m̄ ≤ y0 /2|s1 = 0] = Pr [s0 = 0|s1 = 0] < 1

and
                  Pr [m̄ ≤ y0 /2|s1 > 0] = Pr [s1 + s0 = 0|s1 > 0] = 0

so, we always underestimate the number of true HtM and never mistaken a non HtM
agent for a HtM.


B.1.2   Kink at the credit limit

Let the credit limit be m > 0. In the model, a household is HtM when s1 = −m.
According to our identification strategy, a household is HtM when m̄ ≤ y0 /2 − m, a
condition that corresponds to

                                  (s1 + s0 ) /2 ≤ −m,

which, once again means our estimator is a lower bound because, for this condition
to be true it must be that s0 = s1 = −m, whereas the true definition just requires
s1 = −m. Put differently,

              Pr [m̄ ≤ y0 /2 − m|s1 = −m] = Pr [s0 = −m|s1 = −m] < 1

and
         Pr [m̄ ≤ y0 /2 − m|s1 > −m] = Pr [(s1 + s0 ) /2 = −m|s1 > −m] = 0

so, once again, we always underestimate the number of true HtM and never mistaken
a non HtM agent for a HtM.




                                          60
B.2     Measurement through random balances

Suppose now we observe balances mt at a random point in time t over the period [0, 1] .
Recall that in this case mt is uniformly distributed as defined by (B1) .


B.2.1   Kink at zero

We identify as HtM a household who has mt ≤ y0 /2, an event occurring with probability

                                                    y0 /2 − s1
                          Pr [mt − y0 /2 ≤ 0] =                 .
                                                  y 0 + s0 − s1

If s1 = 0, then the household is truly HtM, but we would catch him only with proba-
bility y0 / [2 (y0 + s0 )], so we are missing some truly HtM households. In other words

                                                        y0 /2
                       Pr [mt − y0 /2 ≤ 0|s1 = 0] =            < 1.
                                                      y 0 + s0

If the household is not HtM, i.e., s1 > 0, then we would mistaken it for a HtM household
only if s1 < y0 /2 because

                                                        y0 /2 − s1
                      Pr [mt − y0 /2 ≤ 0|s1 > 0] =                  .
                                                      y 0 + s0 − s1

To sum up, we may mistaken a non HtM household for a HtM only if its end-of period
savings are below a half of pay-period income.


B.2.2   Kink at the credit limit

In this case, we call HtM anyone with mt ≤ y0 /2 − m. The probability we identifty it
as HtM is
                                                 y0 /2 − m − s1
                       Pr [mt − y0 /2 + m ≤ 0] =                .
                                                  y 0 + s0 − s1

If s1 = −m, and it is truly a HtM household, then

                                                            y0 /2
                 Pr [m − y0 /2 + m ≤ 0|s1 = −m] =                   < 1,
                                                       y 0 + s0 + m

since s0 ≥ −m, which means that we miss some truly HtM households.



                                          61
If the household is not HtM, i.e., s1 > −m, then we would call him mistakenly HtM
only if m + s1 < y0 /2 because

                                                          y0 /2 − m − s1
                         Pr [mt − y0 /2 ≤ 0|s1 > 0] =                    .
                                                           y 0 + s0 − s1

To sum up, we may mistaken a non HtM household for a HtM only if its end-of period
balances of liquid wealth are less than half-income away from the credit limit.



C      Survey data on household portfolios

The countries included in our study are the U.S., Canada, Australia, the U.K., and the
four largest economies in the Euro area: Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. In this
Appendix, we provide background information on each survey.


C.1      United States: SCF

Our data for the United States come from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF).
The SCF is sponsored by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in co-
operation with the Statistics of Income Division of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
The survey has been conducted every three years and collects detailed information on
household balance sheets, income, and demographic characteristics for a representative
cross-section of U.S. households. We conduct analysis on the 1989 to 2010 surveys.33
While the surveys do not normally follow households over time, there is a panel compo-
nent to the 2007 survey where a subset of households were contacted and re-surveyed
in 2009. See Bricker et. al (2011) for more information on the 2007-2009 panel of the
SCF.

The target population for the survey is all private households residing in the U.S. at
the time of data collection. The SCF uses a dual frame sample design. Households in
the first frame are intended to provide representative coverage of various characteristics
of households in the United States. Households in the second frame are drawn from
statistical records derived from tax information provided by the IRS and are intended
to disproportionately select relatively wealthy households. This oversampling design
allows the SCF to more accurately measure the distribution and composition of wealth
  33
     The survey started in 1983, but major technical revisions to the survey were implemented in 1989
and the structure and questions have largely been preserved since then. Since 1992, data have been
collected by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.


                                                 62
for the population as a whole, given the extreme right skewness in the distribution of
holdings for many asset classes.

The main interviewee is the household head. The head is defined as the core individual
in single households, the male in mixed-sex couples, and the older individual in same-
sex couples. In the case of couples, either member can be interviewed and the data
are rearranged after to define the household head in this way. Summary information
is then collected about all other household members. Labor market, pension, and
demographic data on the spouse or partner of the respondent are also collected. See
Kennickell (2005) for more information of the sample design of the SCF.


C.2     Canada: SFS

Our data for Canada come from the Survey of Financial Security (SFS). The SFS is
a cross-sectional survey implemented by Statistics Canada in 1999 and 2005, and is
intended to provide a comprehensive picture of net worth of Canadian households. In
our analysis, we use data from 2005. The survey asks questions on the value of all
major financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.

The surveyed households are a representative sample of all private households in Cana-
dian provinces. Like the SCF, the SFS uses a dual frame sample design. The main
sample is a sample selected from the Labour Force Survey sampling frame. In order
to over-sample high income households, the second sample is drawn from geographic
areas in which there are a large proportion of family units with total income over a
certain threshold.

All individuals older than 15 years of age in the household are asked questions regarding
income, demographics, education, and employment. Questions regarding household
assets and liabilities are asked to the household member deemed most knowledgeable
on the subject. See Pensions and Wealth Surveys Section (2006) for more information
about the 2005 SFS.


C.3     Australia: HILDA

Our data for Australia come from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in
Australia (HILDA) Survey. The Survey is managed by the Melbourne Institute of
Applied Economic and Social Research at the University of Melbourne. HILDA is a
broad social and economic longitudinal survey, with particular attention paid to family
and household formation, income and work. Wave One of the survey was implemented

                                           63
in 2001, and households in the survey have since been interviewed annually.

The original sample for the HILDA survey was a large national probability sample
of Australian households occupying private dwellings. All members of the households
providing at least one interview in Wave 1 form the basis of the panel to be pursued
in each subsequent wave. The sample has been gradually extended to include any new
household members resulting from changes in the composition of the original household.

In addition to regular questions about economic and subjective well-being, the survey
features special modules covering specific topics. In particular, Waves Two (2002),
Six (2006), and Ten (2010) contain data from the wealth module that examines the
composition of household’s balance sheets.

Data for our analysis come from the Household Form and the Person Questionnaire.
The Household Form records basic information about the composition of the house-
hold. The Household Questionnaire is administered primarily to one member of the
household, and covers child-care, housing, household spending, and the wealth modules
in Waves Two, Six, and Ten. The Person Questionnaires are asked to all members of
the household aged 15 years and older, and collects information on family background,
education, employment, and income among other things. See Watson and Wooden
(2002) for more information on the HILDA.


C.4    United Kingdom: WAS

Our data for the United Kingdom come from the Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS).
The WAS is a longitudinal survey that is conducted by the Office of National Statistics
(ONS). The survey is intended to measure the economic well-being of households in the
U.K., by documenting the level of household savings and debt, lifecycle accumulation
of wealth, and participation in pension schemes.

For the first wave, the survey aimed to sample all persons living in private households
in Great Britain. The WAS also uses a dual frame design, using the first frame to meet
precision targets, and the second frame to over-sample the top wealth decile. The
sample for the first frame was drawn from the Royal Mail’s database of all addresses in
the UK. Households where at least one member was likely to have total financial wealth
above a certain threshold were flagged by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs. Flagged
households were sampled in such a way that they had two and a half times higher
probability of being sampled than non-flagged households. Wave One was conducted
from July 2006 to June 2008, and attempts were made to contact respondents for a
follow-up interview two years later for Wave Two. About two-thirds of cooperating

                                          64
households from Wave One completed the Wave Two interview from July 2008 to June
2010. In our analysis, we use data from Wave Two.

The questionnaire is divided into two parts. The first part is the household question-
naire which is completed by one person in the household designated to be the household
reference person, and collects household-level information on household demographics,
as well as information about household assets and liabilities. The second part of the
questionnaire is an individual questionnaire administered to each adult aged 16 or over
in the household, and asks in-depth questions about economic status, education, em-
ployment, benefits, and individual financial assets. See Daffin (2009) and Black (2011)
for more information on the WAS.


C.5     Euro area: HFCS

Our data for Germany, France, Italy and Spain come from the Household Finance and
Consumption Survey (HFCS). The HFCS is a joint project administered by all of the
central banks of the Eurosystem and three National Statistical Institutes. The survey
provides detailed information on balance sheets, demographics, and other economic
variables for households in Euro area countries. Fieldwork in the various countries was
conducted between November 2008 and August 2011.

The HFCS is conducted and financed by each participating institution. For some
member countries, a previous wealth survey had already existed, and for others, an
entirely new survey had to be set up. The HFCS represents an effort towards gradual
harmonization of the content of the surveys across the member countries. The survey
will be conducted in each country every two to three years.

The core questionnaire, asked in every country, is composed of three parts. The first
comprises questions regarding the household as a whole and contains questions regard-
ing household assets and liabilities, transfers, and consumption-saving decisions. This
part is answered by one member of the household deemed to be the main respondent.
The second part of the questionnaire is asked to all members of the household and col-
lects basic demographic information. The final part of the questionnaire is given only
to members of the household over 16 years of age and covers information regarding
employment, pension entitlements, and labor-market income.

There are also a set of standardized, non-core extension modules that the member
countries are allowed to include at their discretion in addition to the core questionnaire.
These non-core questions typically go into more detail on some aspect of the core
questionnaire that the member country wishes to explore. For example, Spain asks

                                            65
   questions that are designed to examine methods by which households pay their bills.

   The target population for the survey is all private households and their current members
   residing in the national territory at the time of data collection. The sampling design,
   however, is chosen by each participating country. France uses a dual frame design,
   exploiting individual data on taxable wealth to create the wealthy sample. The wealthy
   sample is divided into four strata and sampled proportionally according to the relative
   size of the strata. Germany uses regional level taxable income, and oversamples small
   municipalities and, in larger municipalities, street sections with average income over a
   threshold. Spain defines eight wealth strata, based on individual taxable wealth, that
   are oversampled progressively at higher rates. Italy did not oversample in any way.
   See Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Network (2013a) and (2013b)
   for more information on the HFCS.
