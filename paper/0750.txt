                     Career Patterns of College

                 Graduates in a Declining Job Market


                              ABSTRACT

       This study uses Current Population Survey cohort data and the

National Longitudinal Survey for men aged 14—24 in 1966 to examine the

earnings growth of college graduates relative to high school graduates

during the 1970s depressed market for graduates. The principal finding

is that the longitudinal/cohort earnings profile for college graduates

flattened markedly relative to that for high school graduates in the 1970s.

With smaller growth rates of earnings for the college educated in the period

than in previous decades, the evidence lends no support to the hypothesis

that the graduates who suffered economic losses during the period will

recover the traditional college advantage as time proceeds. The finding

that t1ie longitudinal profile of college graduates f1attend contrasts

sharply with the steepening of cross—section profiles in the period,

raising serious doubts about the validity of standard cross—section analyses

of age—earnings curves to assess lifetime income profiles and investments

in training.
Career Patterns of College Graduates in a Declining Job Market



      It is now widely recognized that the job market for college graduates

was severely depressed in the decade of the 1970s compared to earlier decades.

Some studies    have focused on
                             the decline in the relative earnings of graduatea;
                                                     1/
others on changes in the type of employment obtained.    Studies which dis-

tinguish young from older college graduates have revealed a more marked drop

in the ratio of college to high school earnings among younger than among older
                                                                              2/
workers, and a resultant twist in the age—earnings profile against the young.

      Most, though not all, studies of 'overeducation' in the college market

have drawn their conclusions by comparing the relative pay or occupational

attainment of graduates of a given age/sex with the relative pay or occupational

attainment of similar graduates in an earlier period. This is, of course,

a correct comparison for analyzing changes in the pay of workers with a given

amount   of   'human capital', defined by age (experience) and education. It

shows how supply and demand forces affect the pay of labor of a given quality

over time. What it does, not show is how supply and demand forces affect

the pay of the same people over time——the career paths of given individuals.

To evaluate the impact of the declining market on career paths, it is necessary

to compare the wages of persons in a longitudinal or cohort sample over time.

         The present paper seeks to fill this gap in our knowledge of how

the U.S. labor market adjusted to the changed supply and demand for college

graduates in the l970s. It asks two questions about the impact of the market

on career patterns:

         1) How did the decline in the job market for college graduates affect

the longitudinal growth of earnings of college as opposed to high school

workers in the period?

         Whether one should expect a slower increase in the earnings

 growth of given cohorts or groups of college graduates than high school
                                     —2—


graduates is unclear. Theoretically, if income growth is determined

solely by past human capital investments, then one might expect o change

in longitudinal profilds. If, on the other hand, the relative surplus of

college graduates means more graduates competing for promotions, and if

earnings growth depends on the numbers seeking promotions versus the number

of promotions offered, longitudinal growth curves would be depressed in

the 1970s relative to traditional patterns.

         2) Did the young graduates who entered the depressed market in

the early and mid 1970s begin to recoverthe traditional graduate ad'.tantage

over high school graduates by the end of the decade? It has been suggested

that by ignoring possible longitudinal recoupment of earnings as graduates

age analysts have exaggerated the significance of the decline in the market.

This   argument hinges on   interpreting the observed drop in earnings as

reflecting   increased human   capita].   investments by young graduates: their
low initial earnings represent not only drops in the rewards to college
                                                                 3/
education but also increased investments in post—school training.

          Section One of this paper provides a brief review of the evidence

that there was indeed a decline in the job market for college graduates in

the 1970s. By examining data for the entire decade, it shows the decline

was concentrated in the first half of the 1970s, levelling off toward the

end of the decade.

          Section Two examines the question of how specific cohorts and in-

dividuals progressed in the period. Using CPS data it finds that the rate

 of pay of college graduates in given cohorts did not increase relative to

 that of high school graduates in the 1970s, in contrast to historical

 patterns for a widening of the college—high school earnings gap over the

 life cycle. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Young

 Men on the longitudinal progress of the same persons over time, it finds

 a similar marked slowdown in the traditional increase in the income ad—
                                   —3—



vantage of graduates from the 1960s to the 1970s. It further finds that

the young graduates whose earnings were reduced in the period did not begin

to recoup the traditional college advantage toward the .end of the decade.

        Perhaps the most important conclusion to emerge from this study

is that longitudinal/cohort earnings profiles appear to be substantially

4pcted by market conditions, in ways quite different from cross—sectional

profiles. This conclusion has serious implications for the traditional

focus inhuman capital analyses of cross—sectional profiles.as if they

were longitudinal profiles.

         It is important to recognize in the ensuing work that by themselves,

data on earnings of cohorts over time do not enable one to differentiate

among age, time, and cohort (vintage) effects. While the patterns we analyze

are independent of any particular model of how the three effects operate,

the interpretation is not. Our basic assumption is that in the absence of

the market change of the 1970s, the longitudinal profiles of the 1970s

would have been the same as those in earlier decades. If this is a valid

assumption, the changes in profiles can    be   attributed to market effects

rather than vintage effects, due, say, to the different quality of education

of groups. In view of the evidence of significant market changes in the
                                                 4/
period, this seems to be a reasonable hypothesis.

 I. The Changing Pattern of Decline in the College Job Market

         Previous studies have documented a sharp deterioration in the relative

 economic position of college graduates through the early and mid 1970s from

 the peak years of the late 1960s. In this section I update this evidence

and   find   that the rate of decline decelerated greatly at the end of the

 decade, with in some instances college graduates improving their status

 moderately at the end of the 1970s compared to the mid 1970s, without however

 restoring the traditional college economic advantage.

             Table 1 summarizes the relevant data. Part A compares Current
                                 —4—



Population Survey figures on the earnings of four year college to the

high school graduates in 1969, when the college marketplace was strong, in

1974 when it was substantially depressed and then in 1978. To minimize the

impact of cyclic changes on the comparisons, the data relate to the earnings

of year—round full—tinie workers. Annual income figures which include the

income of those without work for part of the year yield similar patterns.

        The table shows a sizeable fall in the relative position of the

highly educated during the period under study, especially among the young.

From 1969 to 1974 the income of 25—34 year old male college graduates

relative to high school graduates dropped sharply, then rose modestly

over the next four years, when the Current Population Survey underrjent a

modest change in methodology. For all men the pattern is similar, with

an income ratio of 1.53 falling to 1.35 and then rising somewhat to 1.40,

though part of the increase is due to changes in imputation procedures.

For women, the timing is different, but still evinces a declining advantage

to the college trained. For 25—34 year olds there is a sharp drop from

1969—1974, followed by a slight decline thereafter whereas for all women,

thE income ratios are steady from 1969 to 1974, but appear to fall in

the latter part of the decade.

        The pattern of falling relative income of college workers is also

• found in the ratio of starting salaries of graduates to average annual

 earnings shown in Panel B of the table, which shows the bulk of the drop

 occurring in the early l970s, with a moderate decline from 1974 to 1979.

         The Panel C data, based on College Placement Council data, reveal

 comparable drops in the early part of the decade for bachelor's, masters,

 and PhD. graduates relative to average workers, but suggest somewhat better

 salary growth rates for the highly educated from 1975 to 1980. Even so,

 the 1980 ratios arc markedly below the 1969—70 ratios for all these groups.

         Panel D summarizes evidence on the proportion of graduates obtaining

jobs   in the traditional occupational area of the college—educated, the

professions. It shows sharp declines in the period, by 9 percentage points

for men and 6 percentage points for women, concentrated as in the other

statistics in the first half of the decade.

            Additional data from the National Center for Education Statistics,

(updated by the author) tell a similar story about the likely occupations
                         5/
of the new graduates.         From 1962 to 1968, the number of college graduates

in the labor force grew by 4,017,000. The number obtaining professional

jobs grew by 2,915,000——implying that 73% of the additional college workers

got professional employment. From 1969 to 1976, by contrast, when the number

of graduates grew by 8,096,000, the number obtaining professioni1 jobs

grew by just 3,751,000—a 46% rate of increased employment in the professions.

From 1976 to 1979, the number      of   graduates increased by 3,706,208, while

the number working as professionals increased by 1,627,000——a 44% rate

of increased     employment in   the professions   As in earlier calculations,

we   find   a dramatic change from the 1960s to the 1970s, with the rate of

deterioration lessening; in this case, leveling off in the late 1970s.

            While more detailed analyses reveal different developments across

college disciplines, the evidence in Table 1 presents a sufficiently clear

picture of market changes to serve as a backdrop for ensuing analysis of

cohort/longitudinal changes.

II. Cohort and Longitudinal Progress During the 1970s Market Downturn

            Did college graduates in the same cohort or longitudinal sample

experience an increasing or slaákening growth of earnings relative to less

educated workers in the 1970s?

            As a first step toward answering this question it Is necessary to

obtain a measure of cohort/longitudinal progress in earlier time periods,

so that we have a benchmark for comparison. Unfortunately, obtaining

 evidence on cohort salary growth rates prior to the l970s is difficult.
                                     —8—



         The   primary   source for cohort data, the published Current Population

Survey reports, has a number of serious problems:      1) from 1956 to 1966,

the published data relate to the income of all workers .and are thus sen-

sitive to cyclical swings; the figures needed to gauge rates of pay, usual

weekly earnings or the earnings of year—round and full—time workers are

not available until 1967; 2) for the period 1956 to 1966 the data are based

on 'ungrouped means', using estimated mean values for income class intervals,

rather than true means, which also mars comparison with ensuing years;

3) beginning with 1975 incomes the interpolation procedure in the CPS changed

in such a way as to raise the earnings of college and older workers; 4) for

one critical group of young workers, those below 25, the CPS fails to dis-

tinguish between student and non—student workers in its published tabulations.

Because of these problems, there are serious difficulties in contrasting
                                                         6/
profile growth in the 1970s with the 1960s or 1950s.

         The other source of cohort data is the Census of Population.     While

the   decennial Censuses enable us to get around some of the problems of the

CPS, until 1980 Census data are available, we lack comparable figures for

the decade of the market turnaround. Census and CPS income data differ in

various ways which makes comparisons of cohort progress based on Census

data for one period and CPS data for the second problematic, at best.

          Data problems notwithstanding, a clear pattern emerges from our

analysis of pre—l970s cohort growth curves. Consistent with traditional

 cross—sectional age earnings profiles, the data show sizeable increases

 in the income of college graduates relative to high school graduates as

 the same aged cohorts age. Our benchmark for evaluating 1970s development

 is thus one of sizeable rises in college to high school income ratios for

 specific age groups.

the income of college graduates to high school graduates prior to the 1970s

market downturn. Panel A follows specific age cohorts over five year periods.

The ages 21, 27, 32, and so forth are selected from CPS Series P—60, No. 92

because they are the midpoints for the 18—24, 25—29, 30—34, etc. age breaks

used in other data. Panel B presents changes in income ratios over decades

for cohorts in the wider 25—34 and 35—44 age goupings

        The general pattern in the data is for college to high school income

ratios to rise with age, (with the exception of the 1958 cohort in Panel A;

all of the ratios show a growing college advantage over the life cycle).

The "averagestT which summarize the cohort change at the bottom of each

panel show larger increases in the income ratios in the younger agL brackets,

with a five year gain of 20 ratio points from 22 to 27, 10 ratio points

from 27 to 32, 6 points from 32 to 37 and 5, and 4 points thereafter in Panel

A; and with decada]. gains of 21 points from 25/34 to 35/44 and 8 points from

35144 to 45/54 in Panel B.

        Because of human capital concern for experience as well as age,

I have reorganized the data in Panel C to focus on the college to high

school income ratio groups with roughly similar years of experience.      Here,

I compare the ratio of the income of college graduates of a given age with

 the income of high school graduates, five years younger.   As the suary

 figures show, the pattern is quite different from the age patterns, with

 thi college advantage falling with ageing. On average there is a 15 point

 drop in the least experienced group considered (zero years), a 9 point drop

 in the next group, a 6 point drop for the group after that and 5 point

 drops on average for succeeding groups.

         Census of Population data on cohort income profiles, summarized in

 Table 3, support the finding that prior to the l970s, when a given age

 cohort aged, the ratio of college to high school income ratios rose by

 generally significant amounts. For 14—24 year olds there was a 22 point

increase for the 1949 cohort over the       ensuing   decade, a 7 point increase

(from a higher base level) for the 1959 cohort; for 25—34 year olds the

gains were 45 points for the 1949 group and 24 points for the 1959 group

(again from a higher initial base).

         We take the patterns in Tables 2 and 3 as our benchmark for assessing

whether or not the l970s saw a change in cohort income growth rates.

The   1970s period
         To obtain a measure of the changing economic position of cohorts

during   the 1970s downturn,, I have   analyzed data from the March and May CPS

Surveys. These surveys contain information on yearly and weekly wages

and salaries and self—employment earningc of thousands of workers. They

have the advantage of covering a large population on an annual basis, which

permits comparison of cohorts over time. I use the CPS data to estimate

semi—logarithmic     earnings functions for the period preceding the market
downturn, 1969 in the case of the May tapes and 1968 in the case of the
March tapes, and then for two additional years during the market downturn,
1973 and 1978 (May) and 1973 and 1977 (March). The one year difference
in the years covered      reflects the fact that the March tapes in a year

relate   to earnings in the previous year while the May       tapes relate to
pay   in the same year.

          The earnings function estimates are given in Table 4. For com-

parability with other studies, the sample excludes farmers, farm workers,

or self—employed persons, and students. The dependent variables are yearly

earnings (wage and salary plus self—employment income of wage and salary

non—farm   workers) and weekly earnings (yearly earnings divided by weeks
worked). In each regression, dummy variables for the various age—groups
 and race are entered, though only the difference between the coefficients

regression for 25—29 year olds, for example, shows the difference in log

earnings of college and high school graduates in 1969; the 1973 regression

shows the difference in log earnings of college and high school graduates

aged 29—33 in 1973, whereas the 1978 regression shows the differences for

the same cohort five years lter, when they are aged 33—37. By following

the difference in coefficients over time we can see how college workers

progressed relative to high school workers in the period..

         To assess how the 1970s downturn affected the longitudinal progress

of graduates it is necessary to compare the changes in earnings ratios in

Table 4 with the changes in earlier pericds. shown in Table 2. Such a

comparison is given in Table 5. Columns 1—3 simply record the difference

between the coefficients in Table 4 for the initial and latest year covered.

Column 4 transforms the Column 2 average income ratios into change in in

income ratios on a comparable basis. For the youngest age group (18—24)

we use the data on decadal changes in Panel Bof Table 2; for the other

groups, we have taken the data on five year changes from Panel A and form

an   approximate nine year   cohort   change comparable to the March   and May
               7/
CPS tape data.

         The table tells a reasonably clear story, particularly for the

youngest age and experience groups. For 18—24 year olds, the historical

pattern was for an increase in ratios of college to high school incomes of

.21 ln points. •By contrast, in the l970s we observe decreases in the ratios

of from .11 to .17 points. For those with 0—5 years experience, the historical

pattern was for an increase in the ratios of college to high school incomes

of .11 points; in the 1970s we observe decreases of from .23 to .32 points.

For 25—29 and 30—34 year olds, there is also some indication of a slackened

growth of relative earnings for college graduates but the evidence is not-

6—10 years, in the 1970s, moreover, appears to fit into the "normal" pattern

of a declining college advantage with experience.

        All told, subject to uncertainties due to the data problems discussed

at the outset, the figures seem to indicate that the cohort income progress

of college graduates, especially the youngest groups, was markedly reduced

relative to that of the high school graduates in the 1970s compared to

earlier decades.

Recouping Relative Income Losses?

        Thus far we have examined the income profiles of cohorts or in-

dividuals as they aged in the 1970s. By looking at persons already on

the market at the outset of the period, we have not focused on the group

which suffered the greatest loss of relative economic position——the new

graduates who entered the market in the seventies. Is there any evidence

that these individuals recouped their relative position as time progresses?

        Table 6 examines the possibility that the young college graduates

cohorts of 1973, whose earnings relative to high school graduates were already

depressed in the declining market, recouped some of their income losses

in the ensuing 4—5 years by obtaining rates of increase, in relative earnings

above historical rates. Column 1 gives the log difference in the income

of college and high school graduates as of 1973 rather than 1968 or 1969

as in previous tables, while Column 2 shows the change in the rates to

1977 (1978),   Column 3 gives the change in advantage between the two years,
Column 4 records the comparable change in ratios in the pre—1970s period,
and Columns    5 and   6 give comparable in ratios from the averages in Table   2.


        With respect to the possible improvement in the income advantage

of the young college graduates of the mid—1970s, the data provide little

support for the hypothesis that graduates who began with low earnings re-

 couped their position as the market leveled off toward the end of the

 decade. Indeed, for 18—24 year olds, there was a decline in the college

premium in contrast to the historical pattern of an improvement. For 25—29

year olds, however, the March CPS         yearly   earnings figures do show a rapid

increase, above the historical average. As this is th only case of a

marked increase in the ratio, at most we would regard the evidence as

mixed: in most of the comparisons graduates do worse than expected; only

for that one group do they do better.

          It is the columns which record ratios of income rather than changes

in ratios which put the nail in the coffin to the hypothesis that graduates

are or were about to recoup traditional economic advantages.            Even for the

25—29 group which enjoyed some recoupment the income ratio at the end of

the period falls far short of the 1ev'ls of economic advantage of graduates

in earlier years. The drop in the initial position has been so sizeable

that moderat&-y large increases in relative income do not suffice to restore

the pre—1970s differentials. Since, moreover, with standard discount rates,

incomes ten or fifteen yearsin the future contribute only            modestly   to


present   values of lifetime incomes, it is apparent that the cohorts of the
1970s have suffered a real permanent loss in lifetime incomes.
Longitudinal data
          To analyze the earnings growth       of specific individuals rather than

cohorts   we turn to the National Longitudinal         Survey of Young Men Aged

14—24   in   1966    (NLS). This is a sample of approximately 5,000 young men
aged 18—24 in 1966,       interviewed yearly in      1971 and then in 1973, 1975, and

 1977. The advantage of this data set is that longitudinal microdata can
be used to caiulate earnings differentials for the same individuals,                 rather

 than relying on cohort averages for different persons, as in           the CPS.

             In   our analysis, we calculate earnings functions for identical

 persons in a given age/experience group in 1966 and in 1971 and then calculate

 earnings functions for a different set of identical persons in the same

 age/experience group in       1971 and   1976. The 1966—1971 changes in    doefficients
                                   —22—



for college iersus high school graduates provide us with our benchmark

of what happened before the market   downturn; the 1971—1976 changes in the
                                                                     8/
college premium represent the new longitudinal pattern of the 1970s.

           Because of the limited age groups, however, there are some problems

in obtaining comparable groups overi:time. In 1966, we examine the progress

of 18—24 year olds but in 1971 the youngest person in the sample is 19,

so we treat 19—25 year olds. The difficulty becomes more     serious   when

we treat experience groups because in 1966 our college group has at most

 2—3 years experience, due to the age cut—off at 24. To deal with this problem

we compare persons with 0—2 years experience in both 1966 and 1971 rather

 than   persons with 0—5 years, as in the CPS data.
           The results of these calculations are given in Table 7. With respect
 to weekly earnings, the evidence in the table is quite striking. Fr the
 data reveal a notable drop in the increase in. the college advantage between
 1966—1971 and 1971—1976. In the former period, among 18—24 year olds the
 college   advantage rose by .27 points compared to a bare .10   point rise in
 the    latter period. The evidence on annual earnings is less clear, however,

 with only modest changes between the two periods. What both the weekly and

 annual earnings data do show, however, is that for the period covered

 the earnings trajectory for college graduates relative to high school

 graduates was markedly lower for the 1971 cohort than for the 1966 cohort.

 This is strong confirmation of the Table 6 finding that graduates did not

 begin to recoup the lost income advantage in the period studied.

 -.     a)  All regressions that included variables for other age or experience by years
        of education groups were <9, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17+. The other
        experience groups were 6—10 and 11—30. Persons for whom the imputed years of
        experience were negative have been deleted from both the age and experience
        samples for comparability of the samples.

        The NLS tape sample was defined as: males age 18—24 for 1966—71 and 19—25 fo
        1971—76; with wages, weeks worked, and experience greater than zero; excluding
        self—employed, agricultural workers, and students. Earnings are wages and
        self—employment income, weekly earnings are annual earnings/weeks worked. Ex—

the picture which emerges from these investigations is consistent with

that found in our analysis.

        Raisian and Donovan's regressions show that college graduates had

slower income gains than high school graduates, by between 1.2 and 1.5

percentage points per year in the period considered. They also found the

difference between the rates of increase diminished toward the end of the

period, though college graduates stilihad smaller rates of gain.   This

is consistent with our evidence on the deceleration of the decline in the

college market.

        Berger reports trend rates of increase that are markedly lower for

college than high school graduates (or other workers) in the NLS and CPS

data sets. He attributes the difference largely to cohort size effects:

the increased supply of college graduates relative to high school graduates

and the greater impact of that change in supply on the earnings of college

as opposed to less educated workers.

        Rumberger's regressions for the NLS in 1971 and 1976, while not

limited to the same persons on the file, yield results which appear to be

stronger than ours, for he finds noticeable declines in the income advantage

of college over high school workers in hourly and annual earnings between

the two periods in contrast to our finding of an increased advantage at a

smaller rate. If we recalculate our analyses so that we no. longer focus

on the same persons we obtain results comparable to his. By including

persons in 1976 who were not in the 1971 sample, such a cohort analysis

adds relatively many inexperienced and thus low wage workers in the latter

sample, reducing the college income advantage obtained from a sample of

persons working in both jears.

         In sum, our results appear .to be confirmed by other analysts, using

 different models.

COuclüs ion

        In this study we have examined the career patterns for college

graduates in the depressed market of the 1970s and found that the changing

market had adverse affects on cohort or longitudinal progress and that young

g;aduates showed little evidence of recovering the traditional advantage

over the less educated. Moreover, we also found striking divergencies

between cross—section and longitudinal income profiles in the period, which

raises doubts about the use of cross—sectional data as a method of approximating

true longitudinal income profiles.

2/      The twist in the profile has been studied by Freeman and by Welch,

among others.

3/      Welch, in partirular, offered this suggestion at the 1978 Cambridge

Confrence on Income Distribution.

4/      See Welch for an effort to develop a model sorting out some of

the effects in longitudinal data.

5/      The National Center data are published in National Center for Edu-

cation Statistics, Condition of Education 1971, Table 1.11. 1 have updated

them using data from U.S. Department of Labor Educational Attainment of

Workers, Special Labor Force Reports, 193 and 240.

6/      See U.S. Bureau of the Census Current Population Reports Consumer

Income Series P—60, Nos. 92 and 105 for discussion of these issues.

7/      Specifically, we have added together the in point changes in the

average ratios for succeeding age or experience groups. For example, the

figure .11 in Column D of Table 4 is the sum of in (1.42/1.32), the change

in the college/high school ratio from 27 to 32 from PanelA, Table 2 and

of in (1.49/1.43), the change in the college/high school ratio from 32 to

37.

8/      Since the CPS cohort data in Table 2 show no remarkable deviation

fcr the 1966—1971 period, the problem of having only this period for com-

parison in the NLS is unlikely to seriously mar analysis.

9/      Note the differences between the patterns of change in incomes in
                               —27—




the longitudinal data compared to the pattern in cohort data. A major

reason for the differences is that over time an increasing number of college

graduates with limited experience are added to the cohort data, reducing

the college/high school income ratios. These workers are not. added to the.

longitudinal files.
