                                              ABSTRACT

In France, firms with 50 employees or more face substantially more regulation than firms with less
than 50. As a result, the size distribution of firms is visibly distorted: there are many firms with exactly
49 employees. We model the regulation as the combination of a sunk cost that must be paid the first
time the firm reaches 50 employees, and a payroll tax that is paid each period thereafter when the firm
operates with more than 50 employees. We estimate the model using indirect inference by fitting the
discontinuity of the size distribution. The key finding is that the regulation is equivalent to a combination
of a sunk cost approximately equal to about one year of an average employee salary, and a small payroll
tax of 0.04%. Our structural model fits well the discontinuity in the size distribution. Removing the
regulation improves labor allocation across firms, leading in steady-state to an increase in output per
worker slightly less than 0.3%, holding the number of firms fixed. However, if firm entry is elastic,
the steady-state gains are an order of magnitude smaller.

1    Introduction

In many countries, small firms face lighter regulation than large firms. Regulation, broadly defined, takes

many forms, from hygiene and safety rules, to mandatory elections of employee representatives, to larger

taxes. The rationale for exempting small firms from some regulations is that the compliance cost is too high

relative to their sales. A necessary consequence, however, is that regulations are phased in as the firm grows,
generating an implicit marginal tax. Because regulations are typically phased in at a few finite points, they

are sometimes referred to as “threshold eﬀects”: for instance, in the case of France, an important set of

regulations applies to firms with more than 50 employees. As a result, the firm size distribution is distorted:

there are few firms with exactly 50 employees, and a large number of firms with 49 employees. Figure 1 plots

the firm size distribution in our French data, illustrating this well-known pattern.

    These distortions have attracted attention in public policy circles. The common wisdom, as reflected in

numerous reports drawn by blue-ribbon panels, is that these regulations are a significant impediment to the

growth of small firms, and should be suppressed or smoothed out. However, there is little work formally
modeling these policies to understand and evaluate their eﬀects. In this paper, we evaluate this common

wisdom by proposing and estimating a structural model of firm growth that explicitly takes into account the


                                                       2
phase-in of the regulation.

   The model serves two purposes, positive and normative. On the positive side, a structural model is

needed to understand the exact sources of distortion. It is not obvious how the regulations should be

modeled, given their scope and complexity (which we discuss in section 2). Are regulations equivalent to
higher per-period costs, or to a sunk cost? The puzzle that quickly emerges is, why are there any firms at all

with exactly 50 employees given the higher costs? Our intuition is that many of these regulations might be

better approximated as a sunk cost (i.e. a one-time investment), since a large fraction of the cost is learning

the regulation, adapting to it, and since some regulations might still apply in the future even if the firm

operates below 50 employees. The presence of the sunk cost also helps explain why there are some firms

that have exactly 50 employees: firms are reluctant to have more than 50 employees the first time that they

reach that limit, but the threshold is irrelevant in subsequent periods, since the cost is already paid. On the
normative side, what are the potential benefits of removing, or smoothing, the regulation thresholds? The

visibly distorted firm distribution suggests that productivity could be increased if firms close to the threshold

grow, as labor would be reallocated towards more productive firms.
   To address these questions, we estimate a model that incorporates both a sunk cost of complying with

the regulation (which captures the cost of learning the regulation for the manager, as well as consulting

with lawyers and accountants, and buying equipment required by the regulation, and the fact that some

regulations might be “sticky”) and a higher per-period cost (which captures the cost that the regulation

creates in every period thereafter). Our model can be solved using standard stochastic dynamic optimization
techniques (Dixit and Pindyck (1994), Stokey (2008)), and we obtain the cross-sectional distribution in closed

form. This is useful when we turn to the estimation because simulating accurately the highly skewed cross-

sectional distribution of firms is challenging. We estimate the model using indirect inference, and match the
discontinuity in the firm size distribution, which is the key evidence that the regulation matters. We further

match the firm size distribution, conditional on having operated above 55 employees in the past. This allows

us to separately estimate the sunk cost and the per-period cost. In spite of its parsimony, our model is able

to match the distribution (and the conditional distribution) fairly well.

   Our main result is that the regulation is equivalent to a combination of a sunk cost of about a year of

an average employee wage, and a small, but significant, additional payroll tax of 0.04%. We next use our
model estimates to infer the social cost of the regulation. Holding the number of firms and total employment

constant, we find that output increases by 0.27% in steady-state if the regulation is removed. This number

captures the misallocation of labor across firms. However when we allow the number of firms to adjust, we



                                                       3
find a smaller eﬀect: output (net of entry costs) rises by only 0.02-0.03% in steady-state. This suggests that

these regulations may not have large aggregative eﬀects.

   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first discuss the related literature. Section 2 presents

some institutional background, our data and some reduced-form evidence that motivates our analysis. Section
3 discusses the model. Section 4 covers our estimation method and presents the empirical results. Section 5

uses these estimates to conduct some policy experiments. Section 6 provides some robustness analysis and

section 7 concludes.

   Related Literature Our paper is related to a recent growing literature which studies the eﬀect of mis-

allocation on aggregate productivity. Building on Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993), Restuccia and Rogerson

(2008) and Buera et al. (2011) suggest that misallocation is an important determinant of aggregate total

factor productivity (TFP). Hsieh and Klenow (2009) and Bartelsman et al. (2009) present empirical evidence
consistent with higher misallocation in poorer countries with lower TFP. Closely related to our paper, Guner

et al. (2008) suggest that size-dependent policies have a large negative impact on total factor productivity

since productive firms have less incentive to grow.
   In the macroeconomic studies of Restuccia and Rogerson (2008) and Guner et al. (2008), distortions arise

due to implicit “taxes”. However these taxes are not directly measured. The regulations that we discuss are

a prime example of these distortions, and they very clearly aﬀect the firm distribution, consistent with these

studies. While our aim is more modest than these macroeconomic studies, since we focus on one particular

distortion, we believe that our focus allows a credible identification of the eﬀect of government regulation on
firms outcomes. In particular, we match the distortion in the firm size distribution, which is the prima facie

evidence that the size-dependent regulation matters.

   While the distortion in the firm size distribution in France is well known (see Cahuc and Kramarz (2004)
and the references therein), few papers have studied it in detail. Ceci-Renaud and Chevalier (2011) document

carefully the impact of the various thresholds (10, 20, 50 employees) on the firm size distribution and on

firm dynamics, by considering diﬀerent data sources. We are not aware of any structural modeling that tries

to apprehend the costs of the distortion. While finishing this paper, we became aware of a recent working

paper (Garicano et al. (2013)) that shares some of our goals and approach. Three important diﬀerences

between our papers are that (1) our model allows the regulation to be a sunk cost rather than a per-period
cost, (2) our estimation method targets the firm size distribution around the threshold, and (3) our policy

experiments assume that the wage adjusts if the regulation is removed. In contrast, their model is static,

their estimation method aims at the entire firm size distribution, and their policy experiments assume rigid



                                                       4
wages. Hence, while we use similar data, we have diﬀerent models, estimation methods, and emphasize

diﬀerent policy experiments. We compare our results in more detail in section 6.3.



2     Motivating Evidence

We first describe the institutional background, then we present our data sources, and finally we show some

simple reduced-form evidence of the threshold eﬀects.


2.1    Institutional Background

This section draws heavily from Ceci-Renaud and Chevalier (2011). Labor laws in France as well as various

accounting and legal rules make special provisions for firms with more than 10, 11, 20, or 50 employees.

    These regulations are not all based on the same definition of “employee”. Labor laws, which are likely
the most important, are based on the full-time equivalent workforce, computed as an average over the last

twelve months. The full-time equivalent workforce takes into account part-time workers, as well a temporary

workers, but not trainees or contrats aidés (a class of government-subsidized, limited duration contracts,
which may be used to hire people that face “special diﬃculties” in finding employment, such the very long

term unemployed or unskilled youth). Hence, it seems fairly diﬃcult for firms to work around the regulation.

    The main additional regulations as the firm reaches 50 employees are:

    - possibly mandatory designation of an employee representative;

    - a committee for hygiene, safety and work conditions must be formed and trained;
    - a comité d’entreprise (works council) must be formed, that must meet at least every other month;

this committee, that must have some oﬃce space and receives a subsidy equal to 0.2% of the total payroll,
has both social objectives (e.g., organizing cultural or sports activities for employees) and an economic role

(mostly on an advisory basis);

    - higher payroll tax rate subsidizing training which goes from 0.9% to 1.5% (formation professionelle);

    - in case of firing of more than 9 workers for “economic reasons”, a special legal process must be followed

(plan social ). This process increases dismissal costs and creates legal uncertainty for the firm.

    This list is not exhaustive, but clearly one would expect these costs to be significant. Some of these costs

are also diﬃcult to model in a tractable manner. In some cases - in particular, the comité d’entreprise - the
firm is required to fund additional worker benefits. To the extent that the process is reasonably eﬃcient,

these rules might simply amount to a substitute form of compensation and have limited eﬀects - the higher



                                                       5
benefits may allow firms to attract better workers or to pay them less.

   In Section 3, we model these costs as a combination of a per-period cost, and a sunk cost that must be

paid the first time the firm reaches 50 employees. (The per-period cost is a payroll tax, but as we discuss

later the implications would be similar if it were a per-period fixed cost.) The per-period cost captures the
static cost of complying with the regulation each period. The sunk cost captures the investment required to

initially comply with the regulation. Some of these investments reflect capital expenditures (e.g., the oﬃce

space and equipment that must be dedicated to the committees). But the main sunk cost is the time spent

by the manager to learn the rules that must be complied with, and to learn how to organize the firm to

deal with the rules eﬃciently. These information costs may include consulting with accountants and lawyers.

This wasted managerial time is likely a primary cost of the regulation: for small businesses, managerial time

is a key scarce input. On the other hand, we suspect that several of these regulations are not very costly once
the manager has figured exactly how to set up processes that comply with the law while minimizing waste.

This motivates our modeling of the regulations as sunk costs. Finally, one argument for modeling the cost

as sunk is that some regulations may keep applying if the firm shrinks below 50 employees. For instance,
the work council (comité d’entreprise) may not be easy to dismantle. In this case, the cost is eﬀectively

sunk. However, ultimately it is an empirical question what is the best model of the regulation - hence we

will design our estimation to allow distinguishing the two types of costs.


2.2     Data

We purchased our data from INSEE, the French statistical institute.1 INSEE combines administrative

(tax) data with statistical surveys to construct the database SUSE, which has data on employment, total
compensation, value added, gross operating surplus, assets, etc. All firms with sales over 3.5 million francs

(around 530,000 Euros) and liable to corporate taxes under the standard regime are included. Moreover,

some smaller firms are also included in these data. For our purpose, the 3.5 million threshold implies that

almost all firms with more than 30 employees or so are included. Hence we focus on the threshold at 50

employees, for which our data is essentially exhaustive. We focus on the period 1994-2000.

2.3    Preliminary data analysis

Figure 1 plots the distribution of employment, pooling data for the entire period (1994-2000), and truncating

at 100 employees. There is clearly a large discontinuity around the thresholds of 50 employees. Many surveys

reveal “rounding” of employment, but this figure shows the opposite pattern.

   Table 1 reports the size distribution of firms by employment over the range 40       59. There is a clear drop
in the number of firms after 49 employees. For example, there more than three times as many firms with 49

employees as firms with 51 employees.

Notes: Fraction is the number of firms for each employment size over the range 40 59, divided by the total
number of firms between 40 and 59; S.E. is the associated standard error; and #Firms is the raw number of
firms in each bin.


   A common way to summarize firm size distribution is to use power laws. With a power law, the log
probability that firm size is greater than x is proportional to x. Formally, P (Size > x) = Cx        ⇠
                                                                                                          where C

and ⇠ are constants. The regulation creates a break in the power law. To illustrate this, Figure 2 displays

the results of two estimations. First, we estimate the parameters C and ⇠ of the power law for firms with
more than 100 employees. The power law seems to approximate well the firm size distribution for all but the

largest firms. This is a well-known result (See Axtell (2001) and Di Giovanni et al. (2011) among others).
Second, we run a regression of the log frequency on log size, with or without a structural break (in both

slope and intercept) at size 50. The presence of a structural break is clearly visible from this second figure.

   Figure 3 plots labor productivity (the ratio of value added to employment) as a function of employment.

There are two patterns in this picture: first, labor productivity is on average higher for large firms, as is well

known. Second, while there is substantial noise in this figure, a local peak of labor productivity is obtained

for 49 employees. This is also a natural implication of the regulation: because firms are reluctant to go over

the threshold, they hire less labor than they would, generating larger output per worker.

   The dynamics of firms around the threshold are also aﬀected. Figure 4 reports the probability that a

firm has an employment level constant between two periods. Overall, this probability declines with firm

size: inaction is more likely for small firms. Yet, this probability increases right before the threshold. The

probability of keeping employment constant between two consecutive years is 34% for firms with 49 employees,
compared to 17% for firms with 40 employees and 11% for firms with 59 employees. This suggests that the

presence of the threshold leads to inaction and slows down employment growth.

   To assess the statistical significance of this result, we estimate a probit characterizing the probability of

not adjusting employment. Explanatory variables are a set of dummies variables indicating whether or not

last period employment was 45, ..., 55, the growth rate of production, last period employment, and a set of

time dummies capturing aggregate shocks. Table 2.3 reports the coeﬃcients. The probability of inaction
increases for firm with a number of employees between 45 and 49. The largest increase is observed for firms

of size 49.
   As we discussed in the introduction, it is unclear exactly how to model the cost of the regulation, and

in particular whether it is a sunk or a recurrent cost. A simple test is to check if the discontinuity in the

firm size distribution is still apparent if one restricts the sample to firms that have already been above the
threshold in the past.2 To reduce the eﬀect of measurement error, figure 5 compares the firm size distribution

in the data with the firm distribution conditional on having been above 55 in the past. While there is still

a spike at 50, its size is substantially reduced by conditioning. Whereas in the unconditional distribution,

there are 2.40 times more firms with 49 employees than with 50, in the conditional distribution, this ratio is
only 1.47. Or to use a broader measure of discontinuity, there are 2.57 times more firms with employment

in the range [47,49] than in the range [50,52] in the inconditionnal distribution, but only 1.13 times in the

conditional distribution. This suggests that the sunk cost is a significant element of the regulation. These
distributions will serve as target moments in our estimation.



3     Model

In this section, we introduce and solve a simple dynamic model of production and employment, based on

Lucas (1978). For simplicity we assume that there is only one threshold. Firms face a regulation which

requires them to pay a sunk cost the first time that their employment exceeds the threshold n, and also face

higher per-period costs if they currently have more than n employees. Hence, our model incorporates both

types of costs, which we separately identify in our estimation.

    We start with a partial-equilibrium model, which is the basis of our estimation strategy. Section 5 embeds
our model of the firm in a general equilibrium framework to perform some policy experiments.

3.1    Model assumptions

Time is continuous and there is no aggregate uncertainty. There is a continuum of firms, which are ex-ante

homogeneous but diﬀer in their realization of idiosyncratic shocks. Each firm operates a decreasing-return

to scale, labor-only production function:
                                                       y = ez n ↵ ,


where ↵ 2 (0, 1) and ez is the exogenous productivity (e denotes the exponential function). We assume that
exit is exogenous and occurs at rate . We abstract from fixed costs in this problem. Given that exit is

exogenous, this is without loss of generality: Fixed costs do not aﬀect the employment decision, and we do
not use profits data in our estimation.
   We assume that log productivity z follows a Brownian motion,


                                                  dz = µdt + dWt .


This specification is attractive not only because of its tractability, but because it is consistent with two

robust features of the data: (i) firm-level shocks are highly persistent, if not permanent; (ii) the firm size

distribution follows a Pareto distribution. As we show below (and as is well known), the geometric Brownian
motion dynamics generate a stationary distribution that is Pareto.

   We also assume that all firms enter with the same productivity z0 . This simplification has little impact



                                                             11
on our results since the moments that we target in our estimation are not sensitive to small firms (which is

where the vast majority of entrants are). Employment n can be costlessly adjusted, and the wage is w. For

simplicity, we assume that n is a continuous choice (i.e., we do not impose indivisibility). If n is greater than

n, a proportional payroll tax ⌧ applies, and a fixed cost cf has to be paid. We assume that the proportional

tax applies to all employment, including that below n, but this is without loss of generality, since we allow

the fixed cost cf to be negative (i.e., the tax could apply only to employment in excess of n). On top of that,

the first time a firm crosses the threshold n, it has to pay a sunk cost F . As discussed in Section 2, this cost

captures the investment necessary to comply with the regulation, including the physical cost of buying an

equipment, but also the informational costs of learning about the regulation and how to adapt to it.

   The presence of the sunk cost makes this a dynamic optimization problem. Let s 2 {0, 1} denote whether
a firm has already paid the sunk cost in the past. The state of the firm is summarized by (z, s).


3.2    Static subproblem

We first study the static problem, to determine the firm profit function which will enter the dynamic op-

timization.3 To find the optimal labor demand and profit of the firm, we first solve the firm’s problem

conditional on operating below the threshold, then we find the solution conditional on operating above the

threshold, and finally we find the overall solution by combining these results.
   The current-period profit function for a firm which operates below the threshold is:

We will maintain this realistic assumption throughout the paper.

Combining our results, we can now write the firm profit, as a function of the current productivity and state
s 2 {0, 1} . Recall that s = 0 means that the firm has not paid the sunk cost and hence is forced to operate

below the threshold, whereas a firm with s = 1 can choose to operate either below or above the threshold.

We can obtain a formula for ⇡(z, 1) by noting the following: (i) if z < z, ⇡ b (z) > ⇡ a (z), since the firm
pays lower wages and fixed costs; (ii) for z > z, the firm will decide to operate above the threshold; (iii) if

   and n(z, 0) = nb (z). Overall, firms which have never operated above the threshold n are distributed

below the threshold or bunched exactly at (more precisely, just below) the threshold, while firms which have
operated above n in the past will be either below, exactly at, or above the threshold. Both sunk costs and

per-period costs lead to bunching at n.


3.3    Dynamic optimization

Given the process for z, and the probability of exit , the firm’s value maximization problem can be written

as choosing a stopping time T to cross the threshold. Formally, for a firm that has productivity z today, and
that has not yet paid the sunk cost, we have:
                                  "ˆ                                            ✓ˆ                                                       ◆#
                                           T                                                1

               V (z, 0) = sup E                e             ⇡(zt , 0)dt +                      e            ⇡(zt , 1)dt   Fe                 .   (4)
                          T            0                                                T


   We normalized the exit value to zero; since exit is exogenous, this is without loss of generality. Intuitively,

the firm will make the switch if its productivity becomes large enough that the benefits from being large

overcome the regulation costs. Denote by z ⇤ the cutoﬀ that triggers the firm to pay the sunk cost. Clearly, z ⇤

is greater than z: given that the evolution of productivity z is uncertain, the firm will delay paying the sunk

cost rather than invest as soon as it expects the investment to be just profitable in the present discounted

value sense.

   The solution of the model can be obtained directly using the results in Stokey (2008), since our model is



                                                                               14

explicitly as choosing a cutoﬀ z ⇤ , given the current value z:

Proposition. The solution to the firm problem (equation (5)) is z ⇤ , the unique value satisfying:

Proof. See appendix.

   The intuition for this proposition is that the firm equates the marginal benefit and marginal cost of

waiting to make the investment. The marginal benefit is that the firm avoids paying the cost early, which is

attractive given positive discounting and the risk of exit. The left-hand side captures the marginal cost: the
firm gives up the increase in profit from operating above the threshold. The integral captures the expected

time spent between z (at which point it is “statically” profitable to operate above the threshold) and z ⇤ . In

the language of Stokey (2008), R1 discounts the time the process z will spend between z and z ⇤ . For given

parameters {↵, n, µ, , ⌧, cf , F, r, } , this equation allows us to find z ⇤ numerically easily.

   An alternative solution method, which does not rely on the results of Stokey (2008), is to write the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, value matching and smooth pasting conditions satisfied by the value

function. Briefly, we have

                                                                                                            2

for z < z ⇤ .4 The boundary conditions are given by value matching:


                                                    V (z ⇤ , 1) = V (z ⇤ , 0)    F,                                         (9)


and by the smooth pasting condition:

                                                      Vz (z ⇤ , 1) = Vz (z ⇤ , 0).                                         (10)


Given the expressions of ⇡(z, 1) and ⇡(z, 0) found above, it is straightforward to solve this system of diﬀer-

ential equation for V (z, 1) , V (z, 0), and z ⇤ . The appendix provides the algebra.

    We conclude this subsection by noting some intuitive comparative statics: higher uncertainty, higher

sunk costs, or higher fixed costs, all make it optimal to wait longer before crossing the threshold. This is the
standard real option eﬀect.

Corollary. z ⇤ is increasing in        2
                                           , F, ⌧, cf and n.

Proof. Diﬀerentiation of equation (6) gives the results.


3.4     Stationary Distribution

Given our interest in the size distribution, we derive the joint cross-sectional distribution over (z, s) in closed

form. Denote the probability density function as f (z, s). Recall that firms enter with z = z0 , and z then

evolves according to a Brownian motion with parameters (µ, ). Firms switch from s = 0 to s = 1 as soon
as z reaches z ⇤ , and exit upon the realization of a Poisson process with parameter                    . We can write the

Kolmogorov Forward equation, which reflects the conservation of the total number of firms, net of exit:

                                                              2 2
                                                 @f (z, 0)     @ f (z, 0)
                                             µ             +              = f (z, 0),                                      (11)
                                                    @z       2    @z 2

which holds for all z < z0 and all z 2 (z0 , z ⇤ ). (See Dixit and Pindyck (1994), appendix of chapter 3, for a
heuristic derivation, and chapter 8 for an application similar to our case.) The equation needs not hold for

z = z0 , since there is entry of new firms.

    The same equation applies to firms which have made the switch:

                                                              2 2
                                                 @f (z, 1)     @ f (z, 1)
                                             µ             +              = f (z, 1),                                      (12)
                                                    @z       2    @z 2
   4 Note that ⇡(z, 0) and ⇡(z, 1) are only C 1 (continuously diﬀerentiable): the second derivative is discontinuous at z =z for

⇡(., 0) and ⇡(., 1), and at z = z for ⇡(., 1).



                                                                  16
which holds for all z 2 ( 1, z ⇤ ) and for all z 2 (z ⇤ , +1), but not for z = z ⇤ .

   Last, we need to state the boundary conditions. The first one is simply the requirement that f is a

density, i.e.
                                         ˆ   +1                               ˆ       +1
                                                     f (s, 1)ds +                             f (s, 0)ds = 1.
                                             1                                         1

To derive the other boundary conditions, the easiest approach is to approximate the Brownian motion with

a discrete random walk, as in Dixit and Pindyck (1994). This yields the conditions


                                                                   f (z ⇤ , 0) = 0,


and f (., 0) must be continuous at z0 , while f (., 1) must be continuous at z ⇤ :


                                                     lim f (s, 0) = lim f (s, 0),
                                                 s!z0                                 s!z0+




                                                     lim f (s, 1) = lim⇤ f (s, 1).
                                                 s!z ⇤                                s!z+


Finally, a stationarity condition holds for z = z ⇤ , reflecting that the number of firms which reach z ⇤ and
have s = 0 is equal to the number of firms which enter at s = 1 with z = z ⇤ , and is equal to the number of

firms with s = 1 which exit in any time period: this leads to

This expression implies that z has an exponential distribution in the upper tail. Since log employment and

log sales are both proportional to z, employment and sales follow Pareto distributions, and the p.d.f. of

employment (or sales) is proportional to n to the power            1 (1   ↵)    1.5

    Figure 6 below illustrates some properties of the firm size distribution implied by our model. In the

absence of any regulation, this size distribution is Pareto throughout, whereas in our model it is only Pareto

for n large enough. The bottom panel depicts the distribution with a per-period payroll tax. There is a

substantial “hole” in the distribution with no firms whatsoever between 50 and 55 employees. This figure

presents an empirical challenge, because in the data there are many firms with an employment level slightly
greater than 49. It would be incredible to attribute the presence of all these firms to measurement error.

The middle panel shows the distribution if the per-period payroll tax is replaced with a per-period fixed

cost. This figure is similar to the bottom panel, which reflects that the two types of per-period costs (fixed

cost or payroll tax) lead to the same implications for the employment distribution. Unless one uses data on

productivity or profits, it seems extremely diﬃcult to distinguish the two. In our empirical work we focus

on the case of a payroll tax, because one provision of the law explicitly implies higher payroll taxes.
    Finally, the top panel shows the impact of a sunk cost on the firm size distribution. The sunk cost model

does not suﬀer from the same deficiency as the per-period cost model: there are no holes in the distribution,

and in particular some firms have exactly 50 employees. These are firms that crossed the threshold in the
past, were subsequently hit by negative productivity shocks, and consequently decided to downsize.

    To establish the economic relevance of these regulations, we now turn back to the data and propose a

simple structural estimation of our model.



4     Estimation

This section proposes a simple estimation of our model using indirect inference. We take advantage of our

closed form solutions which make calculating model moments computationally easy.

    As discussed below, we incorporate classical measurement error in (log) employment; the standard de-
viation of measurement error is        mrn .   Table 3 lists our parameters. The full set of structural parameters
is the vector ✓ = (r, w, ↵, z0 , , µ, , ⌧, F,    mrn ).   We partition this vector into two vectors, i.e. ✓ = (✓p , ✓e )

where ✓p = (r, w, ↵, z0 ) includes parameters that are set a priori, and ✓e = ( , µ, , ⌧, F,            mrn )   is the vector

of estimated parameters.
   5 Note that this implies some restrictions on
                                                 1 to ensure that employment be finite. This in turn restricts the parameters
µ, , 2 . Our estimated parameters satisfy these restrictions, so we do not need to impose them in practice.

   Like calibration, indirect inference works by selecting a set of statistics of interest, which the model is

asked to reproduce.6 These statistics are called sample auxiliary parameters ˆ (or target moments). For an

arbitrary value of ✓e , we use the structural model to generate S statistically independent simulated data sets

and compute simulated auxiliary parameters                       s
                                                                     (✓e ). The parameter estimate ✓ˆe is then derived by searching

over the parameter space to find the parameter vector which minimizes the criterion function:

where W is a weighting matrix and ⇥e the estimated parameters space. This procedure generates a consistent
estimate of ✓e . Following Blundell et al. (2008), we use a diagonal weighting matrix W = diag V                               1
                                                                                                                                   where
V is the variance-covariance matrix of the sample auxiliary parameters. This weighting scheme allows for

heteroskedasticity and it has better finite sample properties than the optimal weighting matrix (see Altonji

and Segal (1996)). The minimization is performed using Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm. We used 5000

diﬀerent starting values to find the global minima. To simulate the model, we draw from the stationary

distribution derived in the previous section, and use standard approximations to simulate the Brownian

4.1        Predefined Parameters

Some parameters are not estimated because they are either normalization or are fairly standard. The wage

rate is normalized to 1. We set the real interest rate r to 5 percent. We assume that ↵ equals 0.66, as in
Cooper et al. (2007). This parameter is a reduced form for the labor share, decreasing returns to scale and

the elasticity of demand. There is limited agreement on this parameter, hence we provide further discussion

and comparative statics in Section 6.1. Finally, the parameter z0 is set so that the average firm has 7.5

employees, as is the case in France.8
   7 See Hall and Horowitz (1996) for details. The sampling is random across firms but is done in block over the time dimension.
   8 This parameter is largely irrelevant for our estimation, because the moments that we target are not much aﬀected by new
firms, as long as they enter below 50 employees.




                                                                              20
4.2     Measurement Error

Our data are based on administrative sources and hence are of relatively high quality. Nevertheless, there

is likely to be some measurement error in our employment variable. We explicitly introduce measurement

error into the simulated moments to mimic the bias these impute into the actual data moments. We do so

by multiplying our model employment nit by a measurement error factor mrnit that is i.i.d over firm and
                                                                                                             9
time and follows a log-normal distribution with mean               1 2
                                                                   2 mrn   and standard deviation       mrn .

    Measurement error also helps capture model misspecification, which can take several forms. First, our

measure of employment is the arithmetic average of the number of employees at the end of each quarter.

This is the relevant measure of employment for some but not all of the regulations. For instance, some

regulations are based on employment measured in full-time equivalent and some other regulations apply if
there is more than 50 employees in the firm for more than 12 months. Second, measurement error also

captures adjustment cost or search frictions which lead to an imperfect control of the size of the workforce.
    Last, we transform our model simulated data by rounding to the closest integer.10


4.3     Auxiliary Parameters and Identification

Table 5 lists our auxiliary parameters (target moments), which can be divided into three groups. We set

to match (i) the average and volatility of growth in employment, and the slope of the power law; (ii) the
distribution of employment around the threshold, as approximated by the density of firms between 40 and 46

employees, between 47 and 49 employees, between 50 and 52 employees, and between 53 and 59 employees;11

(iii) the distribution of employment around the threshold, summarized in the same way, conditional on the

firm having had employment above 55 at any point previously in our data. The rational for the first group
of moments (i) is that we want the model to be consistent with key features of firm dynamics. The rationale

for the unconditional distribution (ii) is that we want to reproduce well the discontinuity in the firm size

distribution, which is the prima facie evidence that the regulation matters. The rationale for the conditional

distribution (iii) is that it allows to distinguish sunk costs from per-period costs. We use a threshold of 55

employees to make this statistic robust to measurement error. Given the normalization of the distributions,

we have a total of 9 moments, compared to 6 estimated parameters.
    Identification of the model’s parameters is achieved by a combination of functional form and distributional
   9 We experimented with a measurement error represented as the diﬀerence of two Poisson distributed random variables,

which has the advantage that measurement error has to be an integer, but we found very similar results.
  10 We set n = 49.01 so that firms find it costly to be strictly above 49 employees.
  11 The distribution is the number of firms in each bin, divided by the length of the bin (7 or 3), and further divided by the

total number of firms between 40 and 59.

assumptions, and is diﬃcult to prove, but the intuition is straightforward. First, the mean employment

growth is informative about the drift µ. The variance of employment growth is informative about the

variance of productivity shocks          and the variance of measurement error     mrn .   The slope of the power

law is informative regarding the variance of productivity shocks         , the drift µ and the exit rate   . The

unconditional distribution is informative regarding the frictions parameters ⌧ and or F and the variance of
measurement error        mrn .   Last, the conditional distribution provides an independent source of information

on ⌧ , F , and   mrn .




4.4    Estimation Results

Table 4 reports the structural parameters estimates together with estimated standard errors. The first row

reports the results for the full model, while the second row reports results assuming that there are only sunk

costs, and the third row assuming that there are only per-period costs. Table 5 evaluates the fit of these
three variants of our model.

   Overall, our data are consistent with a regulation that acts like a sunk cost of slightly more than one

year of a worker’s wage, and a small, but significant proportional payroll tax of 0.04%. Shocks to total
factor productivity are estimated to be 5% per year. The mean growth of productivity is small, consistent

with the small mean employment growth in our data, and the estimated exit rate is around 3% per year,

to fit the Pareto distribution. The full model requires a measurement error of around 2%, or on average

1 worker around the threshold. In spite of its parsimony, the model is able to reproduce reasonably well

all the targeted moments, and in particular the discontinuities in both the unconditional and conditional
distributions. A graphical illustration is provided in the bottom panel of Figure 7.

   Turning to the restricted versions of the model that have only the sunk cost or the tax, we first note that
the parameters summarizing firm dynamics (µ, , ) are reassuringly stable. The model with only the sunk


                                                          22
cost delivers a slightly higher estimate of the cost, and the fit is only mildly worse. The main diﬀerence,

clearly visible in figure 7, is that this model has more diﬃculty fitting the conditional distribution. The

intuition is that in the absence of any per-period cost, and without any measurement error, the conditional

distribution should not have any spike at 49. In principle, measurement error could help, because some firms
that are classified as having been above 55 employees in the past were never actually above 55 employees,

and consequently some remain bunched at 49. However, this mechanism does play an important role because

of the small estimated amount of measurement error. Our small proportional tax helps reconcile the model

and the data as can been seen by comparing the conditional distributions in column 3 and column 4 of table

5 (or the top and bottom panel of figure 7).

    The model with the tax only fits much worse: the minimized criterion is twice larger, and the model

cannot fit well the discontinuity in the two distributions, as seen in Figure 7. The tax is estimated to be
larger, around 0.15%. However, this value is lower than the taxes that are actually set in the law, which

presents an apparent puzzle. One possible interpretation is that some of these regulations are indeed not as

costly as they appear, and represent benefits that are valued by the workers. Measurement error is larger,
because this is the only way the model can generate a non-empty (conditional or unconditional) distribution

to the right of 50. However, measurement error leads to counterfactual implications, such as a high number

of firms with 50 employees, and the shape of the distribution does not match the data (Figure 7).

    We finally examine the ability of the model to account for the large firms’ size distribution. Table 6 reports

the number of firms (and the total employment in firms) above 200, 500, and 1000 employees, normalized
by the number of firm with more than 100 employees (resp. the total employment in in firms with more

than 100 employees). Although these moments are not directly targeted in the estimation, our model does

a reasonable job. The model overestimates somewhat the share of large firms - a limitation which can be
traced back to the failure of Zipf’s law for very large firms.



5     Policy Experiments

In the previous section, we estimated the regulatory cost as perceived by firms. In this section, we use our
estimates to infer the aggregate eﬀect of the regulation on output, employment and average productivity.

From the point of view of a social planner, the regulation misallocates labor across firms and hence reduces
productivity. Moreover, the regulation aﬀects the incentives of firms to enter. To demonstrate this, we embed

our partial equilibrium estimation into a general equilibrium framework, and use it to simulate the response

general equilibrium framework as in Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993). Since this model is well known, we

Here B reflects the preference for leisure, and                is the inverse of the Frisch labor supply elasticity. This

agent supplies work to the market, at the wage wt , and buys or sells assets at the interest rate rt . In

equilibrium, the only assets are the firms. We consider a steady-state stationary equilibrium: there is no
aggregate variation, since a law of large numbers applies, and macroeconomic aggregates are constant. As a

result, the interest rate is constant, rt = r = ⇢.

   For a given wage, we can solve the value function V (z, s; w), the employment policy function n(z, s; w)
and the threshold for paying the sunk cost, z ⇤ (w), and stationary distribution f (z, s; w) as in section 3. We

have added the wage as an explicit argument to these functions to emphasize the dependence. Firms are
assumed to enter at a cost k. Since all firms enter with a productivity z0 , the free entry condition reads,


                                                          k = V (z0 , 0; w).                                        (13)


   Denote the flow of firms entering per unit of time E, and denote M f (z, s; w) the stationary distribution
of firms where M is the mass of firms and f is the probability density function. With exogenous exit at rate

 , the flow of entrants per unit of time E must equal M in a stationary equilibrium.

   Total output is then given by

A stationary equilibrium is given by {Y, C, E, M, w, N } such that E =                  M and the equations (13)-(17)

are satisfied, and the value function, policy function, and cross-sectional distribution V (z, s), z ⇤ , f (z, s) are

obtained as in section 3.

   In this model, the free entry condition pins down the equilibrium wage. Given this wage, the number of
firms adjusts the scale of the economy so that labor demand equals labor supply; that is, there is a perfectly

elastic supply of firms.

   We close by mentioning three issues. First, we need to take a stand on whether the regulation cost is a
real resource cost (that must be deducted from the resource constraint, as we have assumed in equation (17)

above) or is a transfer (which is rebated lump-sum to households, and hence disappears from equation (17)).

In reality it is likely that both components are present. Hence we will present the results for the two possible

assumptions. Second, we only calculate steady-states and abstract from transitional dynamics. We believe

this is appropriate to examine the long-run eﬀects of the regulation on employment and productivity, which
are the key questions of interest, but of course this makes the welfare comparison inaccurate. Relatedly, our

calculations have little to say on the desirability of the regulations themselves since we do not model the

benefits of the regulation. The goal for us it to understand if there are significant costs to the regulation.


5.2     Results

We first discuss the calibration of the macroeconomic parameters, then we present our results.


5.2.1   Calibration

We set the entry cost k and the initial productivity z0 so that (i) the wage is normalized to one, as assumed

in our estimation, (ii) the average firm size matches the French data (7.5 employees per firm). We also

need to parametrize labor supply preferences. We set an elasticity of labor                = 1 (see Chetty (2012) for a

discussion), and B such that total employment is 0.25. These are standard values in the macroeconomics

5.2.2   Results

Table 7 presents the results of our experiments. This table reports the full model result in the bottom row

as well as some partial results that are helpful in understanding the mechanism. Specifically, row 3 considers

the case where labor supply is perfectly inelastic, and rows 1 and 2 assume that entry is inelastic. In this

case, we perform the experiment as follows: starting from the equilibrium with the regulation and with
elastic entry, we remove the regulation and calculate the equilibrium, discarding the free entry condition and

simply assuming that the number of firms M remains constant. Rows 1 and 2 diﬀer in the assumed labor

supply elasticity.

   The first row can be interpreted as the pure productivity gain from reallocation; i.e. how much of an

increase in output can we obtain, holding total employment constant, simply by reallocating labor across

firms. This is the solution to the allocation problem:

                                                                    ˆ   1

where n(z) is the employment of firms with productivity z. The gain in total output, holding total labor
constant, is 0.27%, which is significant.

   One way to understand this experiment is to decompose it into two steps. In the first step, the regulation

is removed, but the wage is kept constant; in the second step, the wage adjusts (up) so as to bring employment
back to its initial level. In the first step, output and employment increase by 0.84% and 0.87% respectively,

as many medium-sized firms grow by going over the threshold and hence demand more labor. Average labor

productivity falls sightly as many firms that were previously constrained in their employment are now able

to increase it. In the second step, the wage rises and reduces labor demand of both very large firms and

very small firms, which end up shrinking. We note that this result goes some way towards addressing the

observation that France has relatively less medium-sized firms than comparable countries (See Bartelsman

et al. (2009) or Bartelsman et al. (2013) among others).
   Row 2 reports the results if one allows labor supply to adjust; this has essentially no eﬀect on the results.

Labor rises slightly due to lower taxes. But the higher eﬀective productivity of the economy has no direct
eﬀect on labor supply, since these preferences are compatible with balanced growth (hence a pure increase

in productivity has perfectly oﬀsetting income and substitution eﬀects).

    Rows 3 and 4 allow for elastic entry. Perhaps surprisingly, but consistent with Fattal Jaef (2012), this

yields quite diﬀerent results. Allowing the number of firms to adjust reduces dramatically - even overturns

- the steady-state output gains. Since firms close to the threshold can grow, the economy needs fewer firms,
which economizes on entry costs. Overall, output actually falls slightly in the new steady-state, but the
reduced entry costs imply that consumption rises. If labor supply is elastic, the wealth gains from removing

the threshold further reduce labor supply and output. However, this eﬀect is fairly small.

    Table 8 presents some additional policy experiments to better understand the results. (These experiment

assume elastic labor and elastic entry, as in row 4 of table 7.) First, our results are somewhat smaller if

the regulation cost is a transfer rather than a real resource cost. The main diﬀerence is a smaller wealth

eﬀect, leading to smaller changes in consumption and employment. Second, one might ask, how much of the
eﬃciency gain can be achieved by extending the threshold to 75 employees rather than 50? The answer is,

not much - consumption (output net of entry and regulation costs) rises by only about 0.0033 percent, about

one-fifth of what is obtained by removing the regulation altogether.12 Third, the motivation for the phase-in

of the regulation at 50 employees is that it is too costly to impose the compliance cost on small firms. We

can evaluate this argument by considering the counterfactual, what would happen if all firms were subject

to the regulation? With free entry, this would have dramatic eﬀects on the number of firms. For instance,
the eﬀect of imposing the sunk cost on everyone is to reduce output by 2.50 percent, with the number of

firms declining by a whooping 7.86 percent. It is safe to say, then, that applying the regulation to all firms
would be quite costly, which suggests that the phase-in is perhaps not such a bad policy. We also consider a

variant of the model where entry costs are not paid in terms of goods but in terms of labor. In this case, the

reduction in the number of firms is smaller, leading to a higher total output. Finally, as shown in the last

row, and not surprisingly given our estimates, the vast majority of the gains from removing the regulation

comes from removing the sunk cost, rather than the payroll tax. We found that all the results discussed in
  12 Of course, if the threshold is pushed suﬃciently high, the gains converge to those obtained by fully eliminating the thresholds;

but this convergence is slow.

this table are robust.

    One criticism of these experiments is that the free entry assumption is too extreme. In this spirit, figure

8 presents the results where we vary the elasticity of supply of firms. To do so, we extend this model by
relaxing the assumption that entry is perfectly elastic at cost k. To generate an upward-sloping supply of
entrants to the economy, we suppose that in each period there is a pool N of potential entrants, which diﬀer

in their entry cost. The entry cost is distributed according to the cumulative distribution function H. In a

given period, only potential entrants with an entry cost below V (z0 , 0; w) will enter. Denote k ⇤ the threshold

value for k: V (z0 , 0; w) = k ⇤ . Then the flow of entrants E is N H(k ⇤ )

    We parametrize the c.d.f. H as a log-normal distribution with standard deviation         v.   This parameter

captures the heterogeneity of entry costs and hence the (inverse) elasticity of supply of entrants. For each

value of    v,   we recalibrate the model and run the policy experiments. Figure 8 shows that as we reduce      v,

the results approach row 4, where entry is perfectly elastic: there is a large decline in the number of firms M
and a smaller increase, or even a decrease, in output Y . As we increase heterogeneity in entry costs      v   and

hence reduce the elasticity of firms, we see a smaller reaction in the number of firms and a larger increase

in output. In the limiting case, we go back to row 2 of table. It is however diﬃcult to pin down a realistic

value for    v   from cross-section data alone.

This section first discusses how our results are aﬀected by some parameter choices, in particular the return
to scales ↵, then provides estimates of the cost of the regulation by sector, and finally compares our results

to those of the contemporaneous, closely related study of Garicano et al. (2013).

6.1      Sensitivity Analysis

We do not estimate the curvature of the production function ↵, which is diﬃcult to identify in our data.

There is substantial disagreement on the value of this parameter, which captures not only the labor share,

but also decreasing returns to scale and the elasticity of demand if firms’ outputs are imperfectly substitute.
Finally this parameter must be adjusted to account for the absence of capital in our model. If capital is

flexible, the elasticity of demand is infinite, and there is constant return to scale, then ↵ should equal one.

Relaxing any of these assumptions leads to a lower ↵.13 Rather than defending very strongly a particular

value of ↵, in this section, we report (in table 9) the results from estimating our benchmark model for
diﬀerent values of ↵.

    With higher ↵, the eﬀect of productivity shocks on employment is amplified. As a result, the model with

higher ↵ requires smaller shocks to match the observed volatility of employment growth. The eﬀect on the

estimated cost of the regulation is ambiguous: on the one hand, the benefits to growing are larger, which

means the estimation should likely require a larger cost to fit the observed inaction; on the other hand, the
shocks are now smaller, which implies a smaller cost is enough to reconcile the model and data. It turns out

that this second eﬀect dominates, so that the estimated sunk cost is significantly smaller with larger ↵. The
other parameters are largely unchanged.

    These estimates in turn aﬀect the policy experiments. Given the lower estimated sunk cost, the model

with higher ↵ leads to smaller gains from removing the regulation. For instance, the row 1 is 0.13% with

the higher ↵, instead of 0.27%, while the lower ↵ implies a gain of 0.40%. These results suggest that future

research on estimating the relevant value of ↵ would be useful for our exercise.
  13 Specifically,   if the elasticity of demand is 1/✏, and the production function is y = zk↵ n⌫ , and if capital is flexible, the
                                                  1   ✏    ⌫(1   ")
reduced form profit function is ⇡(z, n) = z 1 ↵(1 ✏) n 1 ↵(1 ✏) , while if capital is fixed, ⇡(z, n) = z 1 ✏ n⌫(1 ") (in both cases,
up to a multiplicative constant). If " = 0 (perfectly elastic demand) and ↵ + ⌫ = 1 (constant returns to scale), and capital
is flexible then the reduced form profit function is linear in n. However, if " > 0 or ↵ + ⌫ < 1 or capital is fixed, there are
decreasing returns to n.

Notes: This table reports the steady-state eﬀect of removing the regulation on output, employment, the
number of firms, the real wage and consumption, for diﬀerent parameter values (in % change). The sunk
cost and wages are kept constant (not reestimated) as we change the parameters.


   As a sensitivity analysis, we also provide in Table 9 the eﬀect of removing the regulation for diﬀerent

parameter values. In particular, we show that a lower mean growth leads to larger eﬀects, and so does a

lower standard deviation or a higher exit rate. The intuition is that all these parameter changes tend to

make firms smaller on average, so that there are more firms close to the threshold, for which the regulation
bites more. One important implication is that if we underestimate     because our model abstracts from labor

adjustment costs, we will understate the eﬀect of the regulation.


6.2    Sectoral Results

In this section, we study how our results vary by sector. We consider three broad sectors: manufacturing,

construction, retail; and we further consider the smaller hospitality industry (lodging and restaurants). In

principle, this sectoral heterogeneity is useful in validating the mechanism since there could be technological
diﬀerences across sectors. However, as shown in figure 9, the discontinuity in the firm size distribution is

observed in all sectors, and perhaps unsurprinsgly it is similar across the diﬀerent sectors.

   We estimate our model in each sector separately; table 11 reports the parameter estimates for each sector,

and table 12 reports the fit of the model for each sector. For these estimations, we set the parameter ↵ in

each sector according to the labor share observed in each sector. Unsurprisingly, the labor share is estimated

to be larger in construction and hospitality.14 For reasons explained in the previous section, a larger labor

share implies, ceteris paribus, a smaller volatility of shocks, and a lower cost of misallocation. The main

diﬀerences in the moments between sectors are that (a) the volatility of employment is larger in retail, and

especially in hospitality; (b) while the unconditional distributions are strikingly similar across sectors, the
conditional distributions have almost no spike in the bin [47,49] in manufacturing and construction, while

there is a clear spike in retail and especially in hospitality.
   The estimation reconciles these model features with the data by postulating a larger volatility process

in manufacturing and in retail. The sunk cost is smaller in construction than in the other three sectors.

Hospitality is subject to a large measurement error (i.e., shocks may be less persistent). Given the importance

6.3       Comparison with Garicano et al. (2013)

This section compares our results with those of the contemporaneous, related study of Garicano et al. (2013).

Both papers focus on the same striking fact, use similar data,15 and analyze it using a simple structural

model. However, we obtain diﬀerent estimates of the regulation cost and the output gains from removing
distortions. What is the source of these diﬀerences?

       We see three key diﬀerences between our papers. First, our model is dynamic and distinguishes between

sunk costs and per-period costs, while their model is static and hence assumes that the regulation costs

are paid each period if a firm operates with more than 50 employees. This diﬀerence, while conceptually

interesting,16 is not critical in explaining why our study finds much smaller eﬀects: even when we consider

the model with only a payroll tax, our estimated tax is significantly smaller. This leads to the second

diﬀerence, which lies in our estimation strategy. Our view is that the key feature of the data is the sharp
discontinuity around 50, which we believe we ought to match precisely. Hence we target moments based

on the distribution around the threshold. Their strategy is to evaluate the model using the entire size
distribution. This is an attractive approach that is also more ambitious. In the absence of tax, their model

implies a Pareto distribution over the entire range of firm size. One concern is that the estimated tax may

end up accounting for deviations of the observed size distribution from the Pareto distribution. Indeed, it
 15 The  period studied and some details of data construction diﬀer, however.
 16 The  sunk cost model has additional implications beyond the conditional distribution that we have emphasized in our
estimation. Because growing above 50 employees is now an investment, it is sensitive to expectations about the future, and to
uncertainty.

is well known that the Pareto distribution does not fit well for very small firms and for large firms, and this

is observed in many countries, including countries which do not have an explicit size-dependent regulation.

We believe this explains, in part why they estimate a large tax. Moreover, the model by construction does

not fit well around the threshold. However, to be fair, our approach is sensitive to model misspecification of

a diﬀerent type, e.g. if our model does not generate reasonable dynamics around the threshold.
   Finally, regarding the policy experiments, their paper finds a similar eﬀect on output (0.02%) of the

regulation when wages are flexible. The larger output loss reported (0.8%) is driven by the assumption
that the proceeds of the tax are wasted. However, rather than this standard flexible wage experiment,

Garicano et al. (2013) prefer to emphasize an exercise that assumes fixed wages and generates a much larger

eﬀect: output goes down by around 4%. The mechanism is the following: after-tax wages are assumed to

be completely rigid. As a result, a higher payroll tax increases the pre-tax wage (paid by the employer)

one-for-one. The production function implies an elasticity of labor demand equal to 5. Since the tax is

estimated at 1.3%, and applies to 70% of the population (those who work in a firm with more than 50
employees), an elasticity of 5 implies an employment eﬀect of 4.5%, and an output eﬀect of 3.6%. This

simple calculation approximates their results, and it clarifies the key mechanism of this exercise, which is
unrelated to reallocation but rather focuses on the distortionary eﬀect of payroll taxes when after-tax wages

are rigid.



                                                      36
    We are somewhat skeptical of this calculation. First, a standard finding in the public finance literature

regarding the incidence of payroll taxes is that these taxes are passed through to workers, suggesting that

after-tax wages eventually adjust. The reduction in after-tax wages would decrease the size of the employment

eﬀect.17 Second, their argument applies to all payroll taxes - and of course, the 1.3% that is estimated is

only a small part of labor taxes in France (which, combining standard payroll taxes, the personal income

tax, and VAT, add up to well over 40% at the margin). Their rigid wage model implies a huge sensitivity of

employment to taxes. By comparison, Prescott (2002) argued that the diﬀerence in hours worked between

the United States and France could be accounted for solely through distortionary taxes in a neoclassical
model, assuming that government spending was perfectly substitute with private consumption. But even his

model implies a much lower sensitivity of employment to taxes: an increase in labor taxes of one percentage

point reduces employment by around 0.8%, or about six times less than in Garicano et al. (2013).18 Overall,

it is unclear that the assumptions of complete wage rigidity and a highly elastic labor demand are the most

appropriate ones for this question.



7     Conclusion

Our paper studies a particular regulation which clearly distorts the firm size distribution, leading to an

obvious misallocation of labor - a channel that has been emphasized in the recent literature. Our paper
hence provides a “case study” that is complementary to broader macroeconomic approaches (Hopenhayn and

Rogerson (1993), Restuccia and Rogerson (2008) and Buera et al. (2011)).

    We show that the regulation can be modeled as a combination of a sunk cost and a payroll tax. Our model

fits the size distribution discontinuity around the threshold well, and it also fits the smaller discontinuity

in the conditional distribution. We obtain plausible estimates of the costs of the regulation. Removing the
regulation leads to an increase of output close to 0.3%, holding fixed employment and the number of firms.

These eﬀects are an order of magnitude smaller if firm entry is elastic.
    There are several interesting extensions. First, incorporating labor adjustment costs or search frictions

would be useful to take into account the fact that it is diﬃcult, and costly, for a firm to control its labor force

perfectly. Second, introducing in the model other margins of adjustment, such as hours worked or capital,

would generate some factor substitution close to the threshold: if it is costly to increase employment, firms

may react by using other inputs. Third, the regulation may have additional costs, to the extent that it
  17 The  high legal minimum wage in France might partially prevent this adjustment.
  18 This  value is calculated starting from zero taxes, as in Garicano et al. (2013) or as in our paper. The elasticity is twice
bigger if we calculate it at the current level of taxes.


                                                               37
makes it costly for firms to experiment. Finally, given the limitations of our data for small firms, we have

abstracted from the existence of other thresholds (at 10 and 20 employees), but incorporating them would

be useful to quantify the total eﬀect of these regulations on the firm life-cycle.

Appendix
The first section presents distribution of employment around the threshold. The second section presents the

proofs of some model results and formulas.



A     Distribution of Employment around the threshold

Figure 10 presents the firm size distribution around the threshold at our estimated parameter values for

the data, the model without any regulation, the model with only a sunk cost, the model with only a wage

tax, and the full model. For completeness, the left panel shows the distribution without measurement error

while the right panel shows the model with measurement error. Figure 5 provides the same experiments for
the unconditional distribution. Both pictures use our parameter estimates. Note how the wage tax model

generates a significant “hole” in the unconditional distribution without measurement error, and a very large
“valley” after employment 52 even with measurement error. This is in sharp contrast to the data.

    Also notable is the fact that the very small tax that we estimate is enough to generate a significant

diﬀerence in the conditional distribution between the model with only sunk cost - which generates no spike

at 49 - and our full model - where there is noon at 50 in the conditional distribution without measurement

error, and a significant spike at 49. All these features are then smoothed by measurement error.

B      Proofs

B.1     Proof of Proposition 1

First, note that the function V (., 1) is twice continuously diﬀerentiable (see Stokey (2008), Chapter 5.6 for

a proof). Using the previously computed ⇡(z, 1) gives:

for any z, and

for z < z ⇤ . Note that ⇡(z, 0) and ⇡(z, 1) are only C 1 (continuously diﬀerentiable): the second derivative is
discontinuous at z =z for ⇡(., 0) and ⇡(., 1), and at z = z for ⇡(., 1).

   The boundary conditions given by value matching:


                                                                    V (z ⇤ , 1) = V (z ⇤ , 0)                F,                                                      (20)

and by the smooth pasting condition:

       The general solution of the associated homogeneous ODE (i.e., without the term ⇡(., .)) is A1 eR1 z +

       Ve satisfies the ODE for z <z, provided that b0 solves:

Turning to the ODE for V (z, 1), we again look for a solution, which we guess as

                                                                       z

                                                 r+

and the general solution is
                                           V (z, 1) = Ve (z, 1) + A3 eR2 z + A4 eR1 z


Finally we need to determine A1 , A2 , A3 , A4 and z ⇤ . A standard argument implies that A3 = 0 (the investment

option values goes to 0 if z ! 1). Moreover, A4 = 0 since as z !                                            1 the firm value remains finite. Last,

A1 = 0 for the same reason. The two scalars A2 and z ⇤ are thus determined by the following system of two

equations in two unknowns:
                                                                                   ⇤
                                            Ve (z ⇤ , 1) = Ve (z ⇤ , 0) + A2 eR2 z                          F,




                                                                               47
                                                                                       ⇤

Given the formulas for Ve and that z ⇤ > z >z, this can be rewritten as:

                              z⇤                             n↵                     ⇤          wn            ⇤

This characterizes entirely the solution. It is easy to verify that this yields the same results as those obtained

in the main text using the theoretical results of Stokey (2008).


B.3     Derivation of the Stationary Cross-Sectional Distribution

To solve for f, first note that the general solution of the ODE (11) is


                                                                               1z                  2z
                                                     f (z, 0) = D0 e                + D1 e              ,


where   1   <0<   2   are the two real roots of the characteristic equation:

                                                                                        2
                                                             =         µX +                 X 2.
                                                                                    2

   The ODE must be solved separately on each interval. Given that f is a density, the exponential terms
which do not go to 0 as |z| ! 1, must disappear. This yields the following simpler form:


                                                                  2z
                                    f (z, 0)         =   C1 e          , for z < z0 ,

                                                     =   C2 e     1z
                                                                       + C3 e       2z
