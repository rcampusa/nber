“To Establish a More Effective Supervision of Banking”: How the Birth of the Fed Altered
Bank Supervision

NBER Working Paper No. 16825
February 2011

                                             ABSTRACT

Although bank supervision under the National Banking System exercised a light hand and panics were
frequent, depositor losses were minimal. Double liability induced shareholders to carefully monitor
bank managers and voluntarily liquidate banks early if they appeared to be in trouble. Inducing more
disclosure, marking assets to market, and ensuring prompt closure of insolvent national banks, the
Comptroller of the Currency reinforced market discipline. The arrival of the Federal Reserve weakened
this regime. Monetary policy decisions conflicted with the goal of financial stability and created moral
hazard. The appearance of the Fed as an additional supervisor led to more “competition in laxity” among
regulators and “regulatory arbitrage” by banks. When the Great Depression hit, policy-induced deflation
and asset price volatility were misdiagnosed as failures of competition and market valuation. In response,
the New Deal shifted to a regime of discretion-based supervision with forbearance.

        “An Act to provide for the establishment of Federal reserve banks, to
        furnish an elastic currency, to afford means of rediscounting commercial
        paper, to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United
        States, and for other purposes.”—the title of the Federal Reserve Act of
        1913 [emphasis added]

           While the formation and development of the Federal Reserve has been
intensively studied, histories of the Fed, from Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz’s
Monetary History (1963) to Allan H. Meltzer’s History of the Federal Reserve (2003-
2009), have focused almost exclusively on monetary policy.1 The quiet work of bank
supervision has seemed somewhat pedestrian compared to the high profile determination
of interest rates, monetary aggregates and exchange rates. Yet, the founders of the Fed
regarded bank supervision as a key element in their new policy regime, placing it in the
title of the Federal Reserve Act. Unfortunately, in spite of this headlining, the effective
approach to bank supervision that had developed under the National Banking System was
slowly undermined in the Fed’s first decade and a half.
           Although the National Banking System had frequent banking panics that
increased the severity of recessions, its regulation and supervision successfully limited
losses to depositors. Supervision before 1913 had a relatively light hand and may be
characterized as a regime that aimed at reinforcing market discipline with prompt closure
of insolvent institutions. Its panics were primarily driven by liquidity problems rather
than solvency issues, even if a few bank failures inaugurated a panic. The underlying
causes of these frequent crises were the prohibition on branch banking, which created a
fragmented system of undiversified unit banks, and the absence of a central bank.
           The situation in which reformers found themselves after the Crisis of 2008
would not have been unfamiliar to the fathers of the Federal Reserve System.                     After a
half century, the banking regime created during the Civil War was outdated. Ignited by
the collapse of fast-growing new institutions outside the federal “safety net,” the Panic of
1907 led to a demand for an overhaul of the regulatory system. In response, the Federal

  Even contemporary authorities remained relatively mute on the subject. Charles Dunbar’s classic banking
text, The Theory and History of Banking (1st ed. 1891, 5th ed. 1929), makes on the briefest mention of
examination and supervision: “The Board exercises many supervisory functions over the reserve banks
which are similar to those which have long been exercised by the Comptroller of the Currency over
national banks. Examination of reserve banks is under its direction.” Dunbar (1929), p. 311.

Reserve Act created a lender of last resort and sought to subject state-chartered banks and
trust companies that had operated with weaker regulations to federal rules.
           When the Fed opened for operation in 1914, a conflict immediately arose with
the Comptroller of the Currency over which agency would control federal supervision.
Competition between these agencies slowly weakened oversight of banking. In addition,
the opening of the discount window provided a new option for troubled member banks.
Previously, when a bank saw declining profitability and the possibility of failure, its
directors might close the bank in advance of insolvency, fearful of the penalty of double
liability that would fall upon them and the other shareholders, should the bank fail.
These voluntary liquidations kept the number of actual insolvencies relatively low.
Under the new regime, a troubled member bank now could obtain loans from the
discount window, enabling it to continue operation in the hope of recovery.
           Although the new Federal Reserve regime of bank supervision weakened the
effectiveness of the pre-1913 system and raised the costs of bank failures, it left most of
its principal elements in place.         This old regime was only toppled when the Great
Depression led to a loss of faith in markets. Under the New Deal, supervision designed
to reinforce market discipline was replaced by discretionary supervision with
forbearance, setting the stage for the crises of the late twentieth century.2


I. The Problems of the National Banking System, 1864-1913
        A. Origins
        The Panic of 1907 and subsequent recession of 1907-1908 highlighted the need to
redesign the National Banking System. This ageing regulatory regime was the product of
an earlier effort to tackle the key issues of how to ensure financial stability. Following
the expiration of the Second Bank of the United States’ charter in 1836, the federal
government abandoned any role in the regulation of the banking system. The states then
experimented with a variety of regimes, but the predominant one was “free banking.”
This type of banking system had two key characteristics: free entry or very low barriers
to entry and the issue of banknotes by each individual bank that were guaranteed by the

purchase of an equivalent amount of state bonds valued at par.3 After some initial
difficulties, these state “free banking” systems expanded, providing increased
intermediation and a relatively safe currency. However, the unanticipated shock of Civil
War undermined many state systems. As the values of state bonds fell, the backing or
insurance behind banknotes declined, producing a wave of failures.4 In 1861, there were
1,601 banks, dropping to 1,492 a year later.5
        Congress responded to this crisis, and the desire to build a deeper market for
federal bonds, by creating the National Banking System.                     Patterned on the states’
antebellum systems, the National Currency Act of 1863 and the National Bank Act of
1864 established a federal “free banking” system. While setting high standards for
reserve requirements, minimum capital, and lending, the objective was to create a
nationwide federal system generating a large number of new “national” banks and
absorbing the state banks.6 The banknotes issued by national banks were given a much
better backing than state banknotes had secured---U.S. government bonds---which
ultimately provided a uniform, perfectly safe currency for the public. The Act of 1864
also created the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to examine the national
banks and ensure that they complied with the regulations.                        The agency’s name
emphasized the initial primacy of protecting the security of national banknotes.
           In terms of the key design issues for a supervisory regime, the National Banking
System was remarkably simple. There was no central bank, and high-powered money
was largely determined by the balance of payments under the Gold Standard.7 Hence
there was no potential conflict price stability and financial stability because of the
monetary policy conducted by the central bank. The absence of a central bank also made
bank supervision completely independent. If Congress had succeeded in winding down
the state banking systems, with their separate state regulatory agencies, there would have
been only one nationwide regulator of the banking system, the OCC. Although the OCC
was formally a bureau of the Treasury, it was granted a considerable degree of

independence. The head of the agency, the Comptroller, was appointed by the President
on the nomination of the Secretary of the Treasury, with the advice and consent of the
Senate for a term of five years, freeing the Comptroller for the immediate pressures of the
electoral cycle. Although most pre-1914 Comptrollers did not complete a full term, some
were renewed.8 The Comptroller was given a salary of $5,000, but he was required to
post a substantial bond of $100,000 for the faithful discharge of his duties. He was also
given a Deputy Comptroller with half the salary and half the bond and the right to hire
the necessary clerks and examiners.             The agency reported regularly to Congress
providing highly annual detailed reports. Concerned about the safety of the bank-issued
currency, the examiners valued assets according to the market and were charged with
prompt closure in the event that they discovered a bank to be insolvent.
        Yet, state banks did not all join the National Banking System, as they recoiled at
the prospect of meeting the new tougher national bank regulations. In 1865, Congress
responded to this resistance by imposing a 10 percent tax on state bank notes, a vital
means for funding their loans.          Although state banks did not completely disappear,
national banks became the dominant financial institutions. This victory is seen in Figure
1, which reports the number of banking institutions by charter type. By 1870, there were
1,612 national banks and a mere 325 state banks, with national banks holding 88 percent
of all bank assets.9 For the next two decades, national banks maintained their pre-
eminence across the country.          Although a few states permitted some limited type of
branching, all national banks were unit or single-office banks.             Based on the National
Banking Act’s requirement that a national bank’s “usual business shall be transacted at an
office or banking house located in the place specified in its organization certificate,” the
second Comptroller of the Currency ruled in 1866 that branches were forbidden.10

   In an era where communications were slow, this decision may have made sense from an examiner’s point
of view, as it would be difficult to examine a bank and its branches simultaneously.

                 B. The Re-Emergence of State Banks
                 The strict regulatory regime imposed on national banks created incentives for
innovations that would slowly undermine National Banking System. Given that states
retained their authority to charter financial institutions, they played a crucial role in these
developments, which would have profound consequences for the stability of the financial
system. Over the course of the next several decades, individual states, seeking to expand
the number of financial institutions within their borders revised their bank legislation.
They engaged in “competition in laxity” by lowering their minimum capital, reserve and
lending requirements, which resulted in a “regulatory arbitrage” with institutions
searching for the least onerous regulations.11 National banks found two new competitors,

   The success of the growing state banking systems ultimately forced Congress to reduce the lowest of the
tiered minimum capital requirements. In 1864, this requirement set $50,000 as the minimum capital for
towns with a population under 6,000. The Gold Standard Act of 1900 set a new lower bound of $25,000
for the minimum capital required for banks starting up in towns with a population of under 3,000. White

                State-chartered banking systems began to revive in the third quarter of the
nineteenth century when states revised their banking codes and set regulations that were
considerably weaker than those governing national banks. Most importantly, the states
substantially lowered the minimum capital needed to open a bank.12 Combined with the
general prohibition of branch banking and steady economic growth, these regulations
encouraged a rapid increase in the number of very small banks throughout the country,
particularly the Midwest and West. State banks eventually outnumbered the national
banks by late 1890s, and then experienced an explosive growth in the early twentieth
century, garnering an increased share of assets, as seen in Figures 1 and 2. They were
able to expand because they developed deposit banking more quickly than national
banks. Figure 3 shows that before the Civil War banknotes and deposits played roughly

an equal role in funding state bank lending, with capital representing the other major
share. By the 1850s deposit banking was gradually moving ahead of the use banknotes.
The national banks seem to follow these trends; but the state banks, forced by the 1865
tax to abandon note issue, focused on deposit creation, reaching a share of deposits to
liabilities that national banks only matched in 1900. The constraints on national banknote
issue, notably the declining number of outstanding U.S. government bonds, kept
banknotes’ share of funding very modest.13 The result was the national bank regulations
that “insured” banknotes protected a smaller and smaller share of bank customers, as
“uninsured” deposits soared, opening the potential for greater losses in the event of a
failure.

  There is a large literature on the “conundrum” of low national banknote issue. For example, see James
(1976), Cagan and Schwartz (1991), and Champ, Wallace, and Weber (1992).


                                                                                  8
         The result of the rapid growth of single office banks was the emergence of two
serious weaknesses in the American banking system that did not appear in Canadian or
European banking systems where branching was permitted and entry often limited by
high initial minimum capital requirements: (1) Many small American banks’ loan and
deposit bases were relatively undiversified so they were more vulnerable to shocks and
prone to failure and (2) An elaborate correspondent banking system was necessary to link
these banks with national money markets and facilitate the clearing of checks. The
correspondent system was further encouraged by high federal and state reserve
requirements that permitted banks to hold their part of their reserves outside of their own
vault and in accounts at major city banks where they earned interest. These large pools of
liquid funds, concentrated primarily in New York, were invested by city banks in call
loans to the stock market.            The financial system was thus integrated but potentially
fragile. Panicked country banks could withdrawal their deposited funds from money
centers, stressing city banks and financial markets. This fragmentation of the banking
system and the correspondent banking system thus played key roles in nineteenth century
panics, including 1907.


         C. The Rise of the Trust Companies
         The second class of institutions that challenged the National Banking System was
the trust companies, permitted to combine traditional banking with trust operations,
which were banned to national banks. These institutions opened under state charters with
regulations that were often weaker than the regulations governing state banks.14 They
prospered in the financial centers where they became tough competitors of national
banks.15 Trust companies grew at an astonishing rate in New York State. In 1897,
national banks had $915 million in assets, state banks $297 million, and trust companies
$396 million in New York.16 But only a decade later, in 1907, while national banks had
grown to $1.8 billion and state banks to $541 million, trust companies had expanded to
$1.4 billion in assets. The effects of the new entrants on the banking system are visible in
Figures 1 and 3. The number of trust companies rose quickly in the last decade of the

nineteenth and the first decade of the twentieth centuries. As they were larger urban
institutions, they did not challenge national and state banks in sheer numbers, but they did
garnered a larger share of all bank assets. While their share was just over 20 percent
nationally, they were more important in financial centers. Furthermore, they operated
outside the federal regulatory system, sometimes with only modest state oversight.
           The fragmented system of unit banks, tied together by correspondent balances,
could turn a banking panic by the public into a bankers’ panic. In spite of this fragility,
there was no central bank. Central banks were created by most developed countries by
the end of the nineteenth century; but the political economy of the U.S. prevented the
establishment of one. The problems created by the absence of a central bank were
highlighted by the discussion about the “inelasticity” of national banknotes or what today
would be termed the inability to expand high-powered money/currency to the financial
system in response to crises. National banknotes were tied to the outstanding stock of
government bonds, and they did not increase when there was a flight to cash during
seasonal stringencies, common in this period, and financial panics.
           The private market provided only a partial solution to the absence of a central
bank by its temporary issue of clearing house loan certificates in crises.               These
instruments, backed by the assets of individual banks, gave some additional liquidity,
especially to the clearing operations between banks. But to participate, banks had to be
members of the clearing houses. In these institutions, banks had to trust one another
completely because of the large balances that they built up against one another before
settlement. To alleviate concern, they monitored each other more closely and frequently
than the official federal and state regulators.           Thus, they had particularly good
information on the solvency of their members. During panics, the creation of high
denomination clearing house loan certificates enabled banks to replace coin and
banknotes in their clearing house exchanges, enabling their to pay out more cash to their
nervous depositors. Their success eventually led to the issuance of small denomination
notes that circulated with the public briefly in times of crisis.17
           Clearing house loan certificates helped to alleviate earlier panics, but the Panic of
1907 reflected the most recent evolution of the financial system: the emergence of the

trust companies as a “shadow” banking system, competing with but not fully accepted by
their more heavily regulated rivals, the banks. As they did not conform to the same
regulations as the banks, they could only corresponding members not full of the clearing
houses, as the banks were dead set against allowing these rivals to gain the added
protection of the clearing house. The Panic of 1907 exploded when the Knickerbocker
Trust Company, a major New York financial institution approached the New York
Clearing House for assistance. When it was denied, the news prompted a run on all trust
companies that eventually spread to the banks. Neither the intervention by J.P. Morgan
or the U.S. Treasury proved sufficient to halt this panic, which was only contained by the
declaration of a suspension of payments by banks.18


         D. Panics
         The obvious fear of reformers in the latter years of the National Banking era was
the frequency and severity of banking panics, which occurred at both regional and
national levels. Two studies commissioned by the National Monetary Commission,
established after the Panic of 1907, examined these crises. O.M.W. Sprague’s volume
focused on the crises of 1890, 1893 and 1907 but Edwin W. Kemmerer’s close reading of
the Commercial and Financial Chronicle uncovered eight major and twenty-one minor
panics.19 Subsequent scholarship has identified five major banking panics between 1864
and the founding of the Fed: 1873, 1884, 1890, 1893 and 1907.20 Some of these panics
did not degenerate into a full-blown scramble for liquidity, and 1884 and 1890 are
sometimes classified as “incipient panics” or moments of “financial distress.”
         It is widely agreed that these panics had severe consequences for the economy.
Pointing to six recessions that hit the U.S. between 1895 and 1912, Allan H. Meltzer
concluded that “financial panics, interest rates temporarily at an annual rate of 100
percent or more, financial failures, and bankruptcies were much too frequent.”21 He
emphasized that other countries did not suffer the financial trauma that afflicted the U.S.
economy because they had lenders of last resort. Compared to the post-World War II era,

Christina Romer determined that the pre-Fed era had greater volatility in GNP, industrial
production, commodity output, and the unemployment rate.22                        While the length of
recessions was about the same, expansions were considerably longer in the post-World
War II period. In general, she found that the frequency and severity recessions were
greater before the founding of the Fed. For the years, 1890-1908, Jeffrey Miron reported
that panic years had substantially lower real GNP growth than non-panic years and that
the elimination of major panics after the founding of the Fed shortened the length of
recessions from 17.5 to 14.25 months.23 Most recently, Andrew J. Jalil confirmed that
panics independently and significantly diminished the growth of output and contributed
to deflation. More importantly, recessions with major banking panics were more severe
and longer than recessions without panics.24
         While most scholars would agree that the severity of the 2007-2009 recession was
amplified by the Panic of 2008, confirming the pre-1914 pattern, the pre-Fed panics were
different. In contrast to the most recent financial collapses, including the banking/savings
and loan disaster of the 1980s and the Crisis of 2008, the panics of the National Banking
Era were primarily liquidity events rather than solvency events. The scramble for
liquidity contributed to the severity of economic downturns, but the panics were not
driven by widespread bank insolvencies nor did they create insolvencies that ultimately
led to substantial losses to shareholders, depositors and other stakeholders. As liquidity
events, the banking industry was subject to massive withdrawals of deposited funds by
the public and corresponding banks often leading to a suspension of payments. However,
unlike contemporary events, the solvency of the entire banking industry or even a
significant fraction was not ultimately in question.                  In this pre-1914 world, bank
regulation and supervision played a crucial role in setting the incentives that limited
solvency problems.

   Miron (1986) Additionally, for the National Banking era, Grossman (1993) found that a “small bank
failure” shock could lead to a 2 percent decline in real GNP while a large bank failure shock could produce
a 20 percent decline in GNP.
24
   For the years 1825-1914, the average decline in output for recessions with panics was 7.9 percent, with
the average time from peak-to-trough 1.4 years and trough-to-pre-downturn peak 1.7 years, contrasting 4.8
percent, 1.2 years and 1 year for recessions without panics. If only the post-Civil War era is considered the
severity and length of recessions with panics is even greater. Jalil (2009), p. 34.

II. Supervision, 1864-1913
           A. Disclosure
           Of the three basic components of bank supervision---disclosure, examination,
and disciplinary action---disclosure was emphasized under the National Banking System.
The emphasis on disclosure reflected the belief that market discipline was the best means
to ensure the soundness of banks. Because there was detailed proprietary information
that could not be revealed to the public, examinations also played a key role in ensuring
bank solvency; but, apart from fines for late disclosure of information, the only
disciplinary actions a Comptroller could take were the revocation of a bank’s charter and
the declaration of a suspension with appointment of receivers to liquidate the bank.
           The OCC was established to ensure compliance with the new federal
regulations.25 Initially, national banks were required to provide a detailed quarterly
report and a very limited monthly statement. The fixed dates and absence of auditing
permitted banks to engage in “window dressing.” In 1869, Congress responded to
Comptrollers complaints and instituted “call” reports of condition to improve disclosure.
National banks were required to provide the Comptroller with five call reports per year
with information on their balance sheets; and three of these were set on dates randomly
chosen by the Comptroller to limit opportunities for manipulation of banks’ books.
Every day’s delay in delivery of the call report was subject to $100 fine.26 These reports
appear to have provided significant information, as they were valued by the financial
industry. Banks in Reserve Cities requested the Comptroller to publish more frequent
information from the call reports so that they could better follow the changing condition
of their corresponding banks in the countryside.27

request from the American Bankers Association to publish not only call report data for each national bank
on the date nearest the first of October but also for the date nearest the first of April. U.S. Comptroller of
the Currency (1889), pp.53-54.

           B. Examination and Discipline
           While providing information on the general condition of a bank, the call reports
were aggregate by nature, and examination was thus a vital component of supervision for
detecting fraud and ensuring compliance with regulations by delving into details of bank
operations that would be deemed proprietary and inappropriate for public disclosure. The
initial purpose behind the examinations was to ensure that banks would be able to redeem
their banknotes upon presentation. Examinations were conducted from the “bottom up”
where examiners scrutinized the cash, assets and accounts of the bank to ensure that they
complied with the letter of the law.28 Although Comptrollers sent examiners instructions
for examination, they emphasized that there could be no “cast-iron rules covering minute
details.”29
           The Comptroller of the Currency was charged with performing a minimum of
two examinations per year for all national banks.                 These examinations were to be
unannounced so the bank officials had no opportunity to hide any problems. Examiners
were appointed by the Comptroller with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.
Their compensation was set by statute, as were the assessments levied on banks to fund
their payment. Out of these fees, examiners had to pay for expenses and their assistants.
Beyond these very basic tenets, no limits were set on the number of examiners that could
be appointed; and there were no fixed terms of office, oath of office, bond, or
geographical districts, leaving the Comptroller with considerable discretion for
deployment of his examiners.30 Yet, the Comptroller’s ability to increase disclosure by
printing more frequent call reports or managing examiners by expanding his staff were
limited by fact that his office in Washington D.C. was funded by Congressional
appropriation and increases were rarely forthcoming.
        National bank examiners were paid a fee for examining a bank, based on the
bank’s capital. Before the 1875 Amendment to the National Bank Act, an examiner was
paid $5 for each day of examination and $2 for every 25 miles he traveled by the

examined bank.31 As large city banks were bigger and more complex, compensation for
examiners of banks in reserve cities was determined by the Secretary of the Treasury
upon recommendation of the Comptroller. A schedule of assessments for banks was set to
fund these fees. For banks outside of the established reserve cities, the examination fee
ranged from $20 for a bank with capital under $100,000 to $75 for a bank with a capital
over $600,000.
           Although examinations were supposed to be unannounced, the surprise was
often compromised by the predictability of an examiner’s travel plans given his efforts to
minimize cost, enabling banks to prepare for a visit if forewarned.                      Comptrollers
regularly complained about the incentive effects of these legislated fees. In Hearings
before the House Committee on Banking and Currency, Representative Joseph W.
Babcock reported that cashiers in a chain bank that had been visited by an examiner
would telegraph to the other member banks, “the examiner here to-day; lookout, he is
coming.”32 In the 1901, Annual Report, Comptroller William Ridgely recommended the
payment of fixed salaries to examiners instead of fees.33 Ridgely reiterated his complaint
in his report of 1906.34 However, Congress remained immune to these pleas throughout
the National Banking era.
           The third and last element of supervision, disciplinary action, was limited to
moral suasion the revocation a bank’s charter. Consequently, prudential supervision was
circumscribed, with the Comptroller relying upon the cooperation of the directors and
officers of a bank to correct violations.35 Although many Comptrollers emphasized the
importance of discussing the principles of good management with bank officials and
requesting correction of problems, the Office of the Comptroller did not accept
responsibility for a bank’s mistakes. Comptroller Knox wrote:

   “This is a matter of very great importance in the interest of good administration, and the effective
supervision of national banks. Every Comptroller of the Currency has agreed in this opinion, and has
recommended that this change be made. The examination and supervision of national banks will never be
what it should be, until this recommendation is carried out.” U.S. Comptroller, (1906), p. 65.

        It is scarcely to be expected, if a robber or a forger is placed in control of
        all its assets; that a national bank can be saved from disaster by the
        occasional visits of an examiner.36

          C. The Operation of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
          Supervision by the OCC was thus intended to reinforce market discipline,
primarily through disclosure requirements and surprise examinations, where assets were
marked to market and prompt closure was enforced for insolvent institutions. A review
of the extant records of the OCC reveals a remarkably light supervisory hand, as one
might expect in such a regime.
          Table 1 presents some basic numbers about national banks and the OCC from
1884, when the first budgetary data was reported, to 1913.37 The second to fourth
columns of Table 1 report the number of national banks and their nominal and real
assets.38 The more rapid growth after 1900 reflects effects of the Gold Standard Act of
1900, which lowered the minimum capital requirement, permitting entry of considerably
smaller institutions. At the same time the size of large city institutions was expanding, so
that even with the growth of small banks the average size of a bank was 20 percent larger
in real terms after 1900 compared to the previous decade. Columns 5 and 6 show the total
nominal and real assessments levied on the banks to cover the salaries and expenses of
examiners.     Unfortunately, the number of examiners in Column 7 is much rarer
information; but taken with the data on revenues to pay their compensation, the pattern
shows a very modestly-sized agency growing with its expanding industry.. In 1889, there
were only 30 examiners for 3,239 national banks. The number of examiners grew,
increasing from 75 in 1902 to 114 in 1908. Yet, this remained a small staff, as the
number of national banks increased from 6,007 in 1902 to 8,710 in 1908.

*Estimate based on the average salary of an examiner and total salaries.

           Examiners had considerable independence in conducting their examinations and
hiring and paying their assistants, though the number of these individuals was apparently




                                                    17
never reported to the Comptroller.39 Nevertheless, given the fixed compensation it is
unlikely that the number of these assistants grew relative to the number of examiners over
time, and thus the number of examiners and assessments represent a reasonable proxy for
the effort expended in examination. The independence of examiners seems to have left
some Comptrollers uncomfortable, and there were frequent requests to Congress to
amend the National Bank Act to gain control over the appointment of assistants, set fixed
salaries for both examiners and assistants, and require them to post bonds while taking an
oath of office.40 However, there was no response from Capital Hill.
           Even though the number of banks per examiner fell from over 100 in 1889, it
remains to modern eyes, surprisingly high. For the period 1902 to 1911, it varied
between 60 and 70 examiners per bank.              At two required visits a year, each examiner
would have to be performing 120 to 140 examinations per year. Given the time needed
for travel between banks in the rural part of the country and given the size and
complexity of large city banks, these reports could not have been exhaustive.
Furthermore, bank assets appear to have been growing faster than the number of
examiners.     They rose from $80 million per examiner in 1902 to $91 million in 1911,
suggesting that visits to a bank required more and more work.
           In spite of this work load, national bank examiners seem to have been relatively
well compensated.        The average compensation for an examiner for 1902-1911 was
approximately $4,307. Even if their expenses consumed up to half of this sum, their pay
would appear to be good in comparison to the Deputy Comptroller who was paid a salary
of $2,500, the clerks in the OCC’s Washington D.C. office who received $900 to $1800
or perhaps even the Comptroller who earned $5,000.41 At the same time, the average cost
of an examination remained relatively low for a bank, rising from about $40 to $70 per
year during this fifty year period.
           Relatively little was written about the actual work of national bank examiners,
given the confidential nature of their activities. One very knowledgeable banker, James

B. Forgan, President of the First National Bank of Chicago believed that examiners had
good intelligence about the state of a bank:

        A competent examiner—and there are many such now in the government
        employ—while he can not pass judgment on all the loans in a bank, can,
        after a careful examination, or series of examinations, form a wonderfully
        correct judgment as to the general character of its assets and as to whether
        its management is good or bad, conservative or reckless, honest or
        dishonest.42

Yet, examiners were not always this well-received. The Comptroller reported that while
“some bank officers look upon the work of the examiners as unnecessary and
inquisitorial,” the “benefits derived from the visits of a competent examiner are, as a rule,
fully appreciated by the managers of the associations.”43 The Comptroller found that this
“friendly attitude” was more common among banks “possessing ample capital and
transacting an extended business” where the managers would not be able to personally
supervise all the details of the business.      Therefore, an independent knowledgeable
outside review was sometimes appreciated in these circumstances. Examinations, except
when fraud or insolvency was discovered, remained advisory. Forgan summarized the
value of an examination:

        Examinations, as they are now conducted, have a most beneficial
        influence on bank management, especially by way of restraint. The
        correspondence carried on by the Comptroller, based on the examiners’
        reports, does an inestimable lot of good in the way of forcing bank officers
        to comply with the law and in compelling them to face and provide for
        known losses as they occur. Supervision by examination does not,
        however, carry with it control of management and can not, therefore, be
        held responsible for either errors of judgment or lapses of integrity.
        Examination is always an event after the act, having no control over a
        bank’s initiative, which rests exclusively with the executive officers and
        directors, and depends entirely on their business ability, judgment, and
        honest of purpose.44

           Well aware that the examination process gave him only an advisory role, the
Comptroller appears to have become much more anxious after the Panic of 1907.

Attempting to pressure bank directors to become more attentive to the problems of
national banks, the Comptroller ordered examiners to ask directors a set of fixed
questions. When Philadelphia’s national bank examiner, Frank L. Norris confronted the
directors of the Philadelphia National Bank in 1908, they were angry and resentful.
Questions included “How many of the Directors know the conditions of the Bank in all
its details?” How many know nothing at all about the condition of the Bank? “Have the
Directors full knowledge of the habits and general standing of the Bank’s employees?”
The president of the bank answered them perfunctorily and protested the right of the
Comptroller to interrogate its directors and officers.45
           The Comptroller’s frustration appears to have been increasing on the eve of the
passage of the Federal Reserve Act, even though there was no apparent increase in the
number of insolvencies or their costs. The 1912 Annual Report reported an effort by the
Comptroller to more forcefully engage the directors of national banks in the process of
examination.46 The Comptroller reported that for years the agency had been urging
directors to create examining committees of their own to look into the affairs of their
banks at stated intervals, in order to supplement the work of the national bank
examiners.47 The Comptroller complained that directors did not understand the nature of
examinations and were unfamiliar with “the proper methods of verifying many assets and
liabilities of the bank.”48 To remedy the situation, the Comptroller send a circular to all
national banks on July 9, 1912, directing them to ensure that the directors would be able
to provide national bank examiners will the best possible assistance at the next
examination. In spite of these efforts by the Comptroller, the system of supervision set
up by the National Bank Act remained largely unchanged until the Federal Reserve Act.

   The concern about the quality of management appears to have been shared the Clearing Houses. Before
the Panic of 1907, only the Chicago Clearing House had appointed an examiner (in 1906) to examine its
member banks on a regular basis. Afterwards, the clearing houses in Minneapolis-St. Paul, St. Louis, Los
Angeles, Kansas City and Philadelphia employed an examiner. Cannon (1910), pp. 137-147.

          D. The Supervision of State Banks
          Like regulation, supervision of state-chartered banks was generally lighter than
the supervision experienced by national banks. In some states, the creation of a state
bank commission or state banking board only occurred after the Panic of 1907. In
general, the federal system of supervision came to be regarded as best practice; and the
slow drift to adopting rules similar to those for the Comptroller of the Currency sped up
after 1907. While state banks were generally subject to weaker supervision than national
banks, trust companies largely escaped state supervision until after 1907. In New York,
for example, the superintendant of banking did not have the power to take possession of a
failing trust company until 1907, although he had been given this power for state banks in
1892.49
          For most of the National Banking era, state banks were required to provide one or
two reports per year on their condition to a designated state official on specified dates.
Towards the end of the period, states revised their laws on disclosure and followed the
OCC’s practice of requiring reports on days that were not known in advance by banks.50
Yet, even in 1910, the number of required reports was generally fewer than the
Comptroller’s five. Only nine states required five annual reports, twenty-two required
four, nine required two, four required three, and one required one report. In all cases,
state law required that the reports be published in local newspapers. After the Panic of
1907, more states came to regard the Comptroller’s rules as best practice and several
began making “call reports” on the same days as the OCC.51
          Regular examinations only began to become the norm for state banks in the latter
years of the century. Before 1887, only New York, Indiana, Minnesota, California and
Iowa required regular examinations, though five additional states could make
examinations if they believed that a bank was in trouble.52 By 1910, 41 states and
territories authorized regular examinations of state banks, though twenty only called for
one annual examination. Some of these states only set up regular examinations after the
Panic of 1907. For example, California had no state supervision by examination until

1909, when responding to public concern and a plan by the clearing houses to institute
their own examinations, the legislature empowered the state supervisor to conduct
them.53 In almost all states, examiners were paid a fixed salary, in contrast to the fees for
national bank examiners that so troubled the Comptrollers.                    Most of the funds to
compensate state examiners came from fees assessed on the banks.
        Like the Comptroller, state bank supervisors’ powers over their chartered banks
was circumscribed and generally limited to taking action only when a bank was
determined to be insolvent.           While the Comptroller gained no additional authority
immediately after the Panic of 1907, state legislatures granted more powers and
discretion to state bank supervisors. By 1920, fifteen states gave bank supervisors the
authority to “direct the discontinuance of unsafe and unauthorized practices.”54 A post-
panic New York special commission was blunt:

        Under existing law, he (the superintendent of banks) may criticize
        objectionable practices when they come to his knowledge, and report
        continued delinquencies to the attorney-general. His criticism is hence in
        large measure academic and may be given scant consideration by
        delinquents…..Were he clothed with the powers to “direct the
        discontinuance of unsafe practices,” no institution would dare continue the
        same after having been admonished by him.55

Interestingly, no ability to fine or otherwise discipline banks, short of closure, was
considered.     Even in this respect, state bank supervisors had less power than the
Comptroller of the Currency. The Comptroller had the power to appoint a receiver for a
national bank, but a state bank examiner had to apply to the courts to appoint receivers
for state banks and trust companies. Only after the Panic of 1907 did some states begin
to follow the national bank practice.56
           The minimal data that is available for the state banking authorities suggests that
the resources available for state supervisors were more modest than those at the disposal
of the Comptroller. The OCC’s 1911 Annual Report provided a brief survey of the state

appointed receivers in 1907 were more costly than those appointed by the OCC, absorbing 13 percent
compared to 8.9 for the Comptroller-appointed receivers for the period 1865-190s. Barnett (1911), p. 169.

systems of examination. According to this report, there were a total 224 state bank
examiners for all states, compared to the 113 national bank examiners. However there
were far more state banks, numbering 17,913,57 implying that there were 80 state banks
per state bank examiner, significantly more than the 64 banks per national bank
examiner. This higher workload was not accompanied by higher compensation.                                 State
bank examiners were paid an average of $2,300 compared to the average national bank
examiner income of $4,356.58 Overall, while national bank supervision may have
exercised a light hand, state surveillance of state-chartered banks and trust companies
was minimal in the third-quarter of the nineteenth century and then slowly began to move
towards the OCC’s model of supervision.


III. Consequences and Costs of Supervision, 1864-1913
            A. The Role of Double Liability
            To evaluate the effectiveness of supervision in the National Banking era, there
is one additional important feature of bank regulation---double liability---that needs to be
discussed but which has hitherto received relatively attention.59                     Concerned about the
incentives for shareholders, Congress imposed double liability on the shareholders of
national banks in the National Banking Act. In discussion of the Act, Senator John
Sherman emphasized that the purpose of the rule was not only to provide greater
protection from loss in the event of a failure but also to provide the appropriate incentives
to shareholders. He argued that in addition to giving security to creditors, double liability
“tends to prevent the stockholders and directors of a bank from engaging in hazardous
operations.”60
            Under the national banks’ double liability rule, if a bank failed, shareholders at
the time of failure could be forced to pay an assessment up to the par value of the stock in
order to compensate depositors and other creditors. This regulation provided a strong
incentive to owners to check the risk-taking activities of bank management. If a bank

   It should be noted that it is unclear in the report if the state examiners had to pay for their expenses out of
their compensation.
59
   Grossman (2001, 2007, 2010) is the only exception. He provides a careful survey of liability rules but
probably understates their effects as his analysis focuses on the differences in liability among the state
systems, which had weaker enforcement than national banks.

   Macey and Miller (1992)

were faring poorly, the directors of a bank had the statutory right to vote to voluntarily
liquidate the bank while it was still solvent, enabling them to protect shareholders from
assessments. Consequently, to understand the operation of bank supervision, one needs
to look at both insolvencies and voluntary liquidations---a phenomenon that has been
overlooked.
           Like many other dimensions of bank regulation, the assignment of liability to
shareholders of state banks evolved over the National Banking Era. In 1870, 12 states
imposed single liability, 18 states double, and the remainder had no law or statutes that
were ambiguous.61 By 1900, only five states did not fix shareholder liability, while 11
states elected to impose single liability and 32 chose double liability. However, there was
a notable difference between the states assignment of liability and the National Banking
Act. While the Comptroller had the right to impose an assessment on shareholders to pay
out depositors, creditors of failed state banks, in most states, had to pursue shareholders
in court, making collection of funds more costly and difficult. Furthermore, this state
liability was enforceable only after the assets of the bank have been exhausted. In
contrast, a national bank receiver could impose an assessment and begin distribution to
depositors before a bank was finally closed.62 Given this generally weaker liability
regime for state banks, it would be expected that the constraints on risk-taking would be
reduced and it would be less likely that a troubled banks would voluntarily liquidated
before it became insolvent.


           B. Voluntary Liquidations and Failures
           A comparison of national bank and state bank voluntary liquidations would be
very instructive, but unfortunately, there are is no data on state bank voluntary
liquidations. Consequently, analysis must be limited to national banks. Figures 4 and 5
display the number of national bank voluntary liquidations and insolvencies and the
percentage of these relative to the total number of national banks. For the National

  Barnett (1911), pp. 78-85. Seven states did provide an additional guarantee for depositors after 1907 in
the form of deposit insurance schemes for their state-chartered banks. However, these short-lived
guarantee systems did not play a major role in protecting the banking system See White (1983) and
Kumbhakar and Wheelock (1994). Grossman (2007) finds that states the seven states that adopted deposit
insurance had double liability in effect or legislated it at the same time

Banking era, over four times the number of banks, 2,373 were voluntarily liquidated
compared to 501 that were closed as insolvent. The total capital of voluntarily liquidated
banks was $432.8 million and for insolvent banks it was $89.1 million.63
                     To the twenty-first century eye, the surprising feature of these charts is the
number of banks that were placed in voluntary liquidation compared to the number that
were insolvent. It suggests that shareholders and directors were quite cautious. When
directors voluntarily liquidated a bank they appear to have been successful in picking the
right moment, as few of these banks were subsequently found to be insolvent.64 When a
bank was past saving, it was quickly closed by the authorities, revealing a readiness to
close an insolvent bank that stands in stark contrast to today when closed banks all show
substantial losses. Occasionally, the Comptroller erred and suspended a bank that was
later found to be technically solvent and some of these were re-opened.

                   Figures 4 and 5 also suggest that the worst years for national bank failures were
the 1890s when the number and percentages of insolvencies peaked. By the first decade
of the twentieth century, insolvencies have sunk to the low levels preceding the nineties,
while voluntary liquidations are considerably higher. Whether it was the chastising
experience of the 1890s or the increased vigilance of examiners, thanks to the growth in
their number seen in Table 1, the national banking system appears to have more carefully
protected the interested of its depositors.

                   What losses were experienced by insolvent banks? Figures 6 and 7 show the
number and percentage of national banks, state banks, and trust companies declared to be
insolvent in each year between 1864 and 1913. Unfortunately, there is limited data for
failures of state banks and trust companies before the 1890s; however failures of all types
of institutions do appear to have been more frequent in the last decade of the nineteenth
century than in the first decade of the twentieth, in spite of the severity of the Panic of


                                                                          26
1907. For the years where there is comparable data, the percentage of state banks failing
was greater than the percentage of national banks and the percentage of trust companies
failing higher than both.                        There is a notable spike in trust company failures in 1907,
reflecting their fate during the Panic of 1907.

                 These higher failure rates by state banks and especially trust companies suggest
that they may have been taking greater risks. Because of the regulations that promoted
smaller, less diversified state banks, they might be expected to have a higher failure rate
and a higher loss rate. They might have protected themselves by increasing their capital
relative to their assets to offset this danger. Figure 8 graphs the capital to asset ratio for
state banks and national banks from 1834 until the creation of the Federal Reserve. This
longer time frame provides a necessary perspective on the risk exposure of these
institutions. Unfortunately, trust companies did not provide reports in most states that

                    Figure 8 captures the well-known long downward trend of the capital to asset
ratio over the course of the nineteenth century.65 This key ratio hovered around 40
percent for state banks in the late antebellum period, though it was higher in the 1840s.
Visually, the national bank capital to asset ratio appears to continue the trend for pre-
Civil War state banks, ultimately falling to around 20 percent. The surprise in Figure 8 is
the much lower capital asset ratio for state banks in the late nineteenth century,
suggesting that they were taking greater risks than national banks and perhaps higher
returns. This assessment probably understates their risk-taking as their loan portfolios
were not as constrained as national banks in most states, permitting them for example to
lend extensively on real estate, enabling a greater maturity mismatch. If local banking

markets had been fully competitive, one would not expect to see the persistently lower
capital to asset ratio and higher failure rates for state-chartered institutions. But, local
banking markets, especially on the frontier had strong elements of local monopolies.
The lower minimum capital requirements of state banks permitted the creation very small
institutions in small towns where a national bank could not set up shop.66

                    C. The Costs of Bank Failures
                    The record of costs from the closure of national banks looks quite favorable
relative to the experience of the Great Depression, the S&Ls crisis, or the 2008 financial
collapse. Between 1865 and 1913, 540 banks were declared to be insolvent.                                                                                      This
number is higher than the 501 insolvencies that were compared to voluntary liquidations
in Figures 5 because 39 were restored to solvency.                                                        These 540 national banks had an

initial capital of $86.8 million or roughly on average $160,000 each. The total assets of
these banks on the date that were closed were $360 million, of which 35.9 percent were
estimated to be good, 31.5 percent to be doubtful, and 18.9 percent to be worthless with
an additional 13.5 percent recovered since suspension. There were $28.6 million of
offsets for these banks. The receivers recouped $183.9 million from the sales of assets
and $22.5 million in assessments on shareholders or 89.5 and 10.5 percent of the total
collections. Tracking down and enforcing the assessments was clearly difficult and
costly. Receivers assessed shareholders $46.4 million but recovered only 48.6 percent of
the total. The costs of closing these banks down were modest, with $5.4 million spent on
legal expenses and $9.5 million spent on receivers’ salaries or 4.1 percent of assets and
7.8 percent of the proven claims.                   Payments to depositors and other creditors totaled
$146.9 million out of $191.0 million of proven claims for a payout ratio of 76.9 percent.
Total losses thus amounted to $44 million for this 50 year period.

                 Note: The payout ratio is calculated as the payments divided by the proven claims. If offsets are
                 included, the recoveries by depositors would be higher.

        The sum of $44 million represents a very modest cost, no matter how it is
measured. In 2009 dollars, $44 million is approximately $1 billion, which would seem a
relatively small sum for the cumulative losses. On average, losses were $880,000 per
year. This was a tiny fraction of the deposits of national banks, which even in 1870 stood
at $706 million in 1870, growing to $1,085 million in 1880 and $1,978 million in 1890.67
In terms of GDP, $880,000 and $44 million were 0.01 and 0.6 percent of GDP in 1870
and 0.006 and 0.3 percent of GDP in 1890. These total losses are on the same order of
magnitude as the losses that Hugh Rockoff calculated for the free banking era from 1838-
1860, a nominal $1.9 million or 0.01 percent of GDP.68 However, they pale next to the
losses experienced during the Great Depression. Friedman and Schwartz calculated that
$2.5 billion were lost by depositors and shareholders during the years 1929-1933,
representing 2.4 percent of contemporary GDP or $39 billion in 2009 dollars.69 One
estimate of the costs of the savings and loan and bank failures of the early 1980s was
$126 billion, or 3.4 percent of contemporary GDP and $200 billion in 2009 dollars.70
One estimate of the losses from the 2008-2009 collapse was $1.7 trillion or 11.6 percent
of 2008 GDP.71
        One might argue that these aggregate numbers hid the pain of high losses in
individual years, but that does not seem to be the case. Figure 9 reports the number of
national bank failures in each year between 1865 and 1913 and the payout to depositors
and other creditors. The decade of the 1890s, punctuated by panics and four recessions
stands out as the worst experience, but national banks then returned to the previous
pattern of failures and payouts. Yet, even in the most extreme years of 1891, 1894, and
1896 when payout ratio fell to 38.7, 42.1, and 46.7 percent, losses totaled $4.2, $2.2 and
$3.6 million. Given that national bank deposits stood at $1,974, $1,939, and $2,141
million, losses were no more than 0.3 percent of all deposits.
        Unfortunately, the record of losses from the state bank insolvencies has not been
well preserved. As previously discussed, state bank supervisors were generally not given
control over failed banks, and consequently few statistics on failures were collected by

these officials. Barnett’s study for the National Monetary Commission (1911) only found
four partial studies. Inference from these is difficult because no attempt was made to
separate state, private and savings banks, partly because definitions of these institutions
varied from state to state. In 1879, the Comptroller investigated the failures of state,
private and savings banks for the three previous years and found that 210 banks failed,
which had an average payout ratio of 66 percent.72 Trust companies were omitted from
this and subsequent studies. The Comptroller’s own records show that there were 33
insolvent national banks from 1876 to 1878, with payout ratios of 75.0, 98.5, and 91.3
percent for each year.73 In subsequent studies in 1895 and 1896, the Comptroller found
that 1,234 of state and private institutions had failed since 1863 and had paid out less than
50 percent of claims. For national banks over the same span of years, 330 failed, paying
out an average of 67.7 percent of proven claims. In 1899, the Comptroller examined state,
private and savings banks that had failed between 1893 and 1899 and determined the
payout ratio to be 56.19 percent. Over this same interval, national banks paid out 74.5
percent.
         Barnett found one additional state study. In 1909, after reviewing the receivers’
reports, the Secretary of the Nebraska State Banking Board compiled some statistics for
1901-1909. During this period, the average deposits of state banks totaled $50 million.
The total deposits in failed banks were $451,557. These banks ultimately had $187,955
in unpaid claims, implying a recovery rate of 58 percent.74 Assessing this information is
difficult, though it would appear that the stricter liability rules and supervision of national
banks led to better payout ratios. The only econometric study of the effects of double
liability was conducted by Richard Grossman who found that double liability state banks
were associated with lower risk taking and lower failures rates than single liability state
banks.75 However, his work only compares the effects of state regulations; the effects of
stricter national bank rules, where the Comptroller not the courts enforced the laws, may
have had a more profound effect on the safety of banks in the national system.
Nevertheless, the state systems did not result in much larger losses to depositors. Even

though failures were more numerous, state banks were significantly smaller than national
banks, so that total losses were probably around the same order of magnitude as those
experienced by depositors of national banks.               Addition of these losses to the totals for
national banks would not alter the picture of very modest losses during the years 1863-
1913 compared with subsequent crises.


           D. The National Banking System: An Assessment
           The National Banking era receives a mixed review in most historical accounts.
While there was an expansion of banking services and an integration of money and
capital markets, it is viewed as inherently flawed because of the large number of banking
panics compared to the contemporary experience of other nations.76 However, it is
important to understand the defects that contributed to these crises. First and foremost,
the prohibition of branch banking created a system of thousands of unit banks, many of
which had undiversified deposit bases and loan portfolios. To clear and collect checks
and find better use for their seasonally fluctuating balances, the country and small city
banks relied on their correspondents in large cities.                   Federal and state reserve
requirements that permitted these banks to keep more than half their reserve on deposit in
interest earning accounts with these same big city correspondent banks added further to
these sizeable “bankers’ balances. Investing heavily in the most liquid market of the day-
--call and time loans to the stock market---tied the fate of Main Street to Wall Street and
visa versa. Many experts realized this key weakness of the system and its origin---the
general prohibition on branching. But, calls for reducing the barriers to branching were
met with fierce opposition from many unit banks that feared being driven out of business
by branches of large banks. In spite of the weakness of individual banks, regulation and
supervision set the incentives and level of monitoring that ensured that losses from bank
failures were very, modest, if not minimal.
           The second deficiency of the National Banking era was more widely
acknowledged: the absence of a central bank. Contemporary experts and most historians
believe that a lender of last resort could have squelched most panics by providing credit
to liquidity-constrained banks in the midst of a crisis. The identification of this problem

76
     On the integration of financial markets, see Bodenhorn (1995).


                                                      33
points to the key fact that these panics were liquidity rather than solvency events.
Although a few insolvent institutions might provoke initial bank runs, there were no
system-wide failures or losses. Which of these two problems was pre-eminent? Many
countries like the United Kingdom, France and Germany had both central banks and
widespread branching. But, the Canadian experience offers a useful comparison. With a
similar distribution of economic activity and seasonally fluctuating demands for credit,
Canada had an economic structure similar to that of the U.S. The critical difference was
that Canada permitted nation-wide branching but had no central bank until 1935.77 In
contrast to the U.S., Canada did not suffer from frequent numerous bank runs and panics,
pointing to a well-diversified integrated banking system as essential to limiting panics.
This comparison suggests that the first priority of Congress should have been to reform
the nation’s banking structure. The political economy of banking, however, made this
impossible and hence reformers focused on the establishment of the Federal Reserve.


IV. The Advent of the Fed
           A. The Incomplete Reform of Regulation and Supervision
           While the primary focus of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was the creation of a
central bank that would be palatable to the banks and the public, the legislation did
attempt the needed restructuring of the banking system. The reforms of 1913 were not as
bold as the reforms under taken in 1863-1864, leaving a good portion of the financial
system under control of the states. During the Civil War, Congress was willing to take a
stick to the financial system---a tax on state banknotes---to induce banks to join the
national banking system; but the Act of 1913 and subsequent amendments offered mostly
carrots to bring banks into the Federal Reserve System.              The problem with the
establishment of the Federal Reserve from the point of view of regulation and supervision
is that it set a precedent for patching up some of the problems and failing to
fundamentally reform the system. The inability to do more directly contributed to the
next great financial crisis of 1929-1933.
           By setting up a central bank, the Federal Reserve Act created the potential for a
conflict between the objectives of price stability and financial stability. The failure of the

     Bordo and Redish (1987) and Bordo, Redish and Rockoff (1994).


                                                   34
early leaders of the Fed to quickly recognize the implications of this conflict contributed
to the waves of bank failures in the early 1920s and the Great Depression. In addition,
by giving the Federal Reserve authority to supervise state member banks the Act did not
make a decisive decision about whether supervision should be located inside or outside of
the central bank. While before 1914, there had been one federal banking agency that
squared off with the numerous state agencies, the Federal Reserve Act was the first step
in the multiplication of federal regulatory agencies that have inherently conflicted
interests.78 Concerned about effectively exercising their mandates, state and federal
agencies in the 1920s gradually weakened regulation and supervision to induce banks to
change their charter or member status, permitting “regulatory arbitrage.” Compounding
these problems was a gradual reduction in transparency because the Federal Reserve
banks were not official government agencies like the OCC and were not similarly subject
to Congressional oversight. The overall philosophy of bank supervision that aimed at
reinforcing market discipline continued to inform the activities of the OCC, but the Fed’s
additional concerns about its discount operations slowly began to undermine it.


              B. Conflict between the Fed and the OCC: Examinations
              The Federal Reserve Act created two conflicts between the Federal Reserve
Board and the OCC. First while membership in the Fed of existing national banks was
mandatory, the Federal Reserve Board had the right to decide on the membership
application of any state-chartered banks. By granting a national charter to a bank, the
Comptroller could create a new member bank without the approval of the Fed. Secondly,
the Federal Reserve Act did not contain any provision that required the Comptroller to
provide the Board or a Federal Reserve Bank with copies of national bank
examinations.79 In his memoire of the Fed’s early years, The Formative Period of the
Federal Reserve System (1925), Governor W.P.G. Harding reported that during his eight

78
  While the Federal Reserve Act was pending in Congress, there was discussion about whether to have the
OCC moved from the jurisdiction of the Treasury to the Federal Reserve Board or to simply abolish the
OCC and transfer its operations to the Board. Such suggestions were rejected and the Comptroller was
made a member of the Reserve Bank Organization Committee and a member ex officio of the Federal
Reserve Board. The Comptroller was granted a salary of $7,000 for his membership on the Board in order
to raise his total salary to that of other board members (Harding, 1925, p.6).

                                                  35
year tenure, the Comptroller granted charters for several new national banks against the
recommendations of Federal Reserve banks and even granted national charters to state
banks that had been refused membership, thus ensuring that they automatically acquired
it without the consent of the Board. As the OCC was directed to examine national banks
twice a year, the Board deemed it unnecessary to have regular examinations, assuming
that the OCC would furnish the Federal Reserve banks with copies of its examiners’
reports. However, the Comptroller only provided limited reports, reserving the right to
decide what information the Fed would receive.
             The Comptroller of the Currency in office at the time of the creation of the Fed,
John Skelton Williams, fought to maintain the prerogatives of the OCC and had icy if not
hostile relations with the Fed. When Williams’ five-year term as Comptroller expired on
February 2, 1919, President Wilson nominated him for another five year term,             But,
several Senators blocked his nomination and no action was taken when Congress
adjourned on March 4, 1919. Under the law William could continue as Comptroller until
his successor was appointed. When the Sixty-Sixth Congress convened, the Senate
Committee on Banking and Currency led by a hostile chairman refused to make a
favorable report and no action was taken, even though there appeared to be a majority of
Senators who would have voted for his appointment. By the end of 1920, this appeared
to be a permanent impasse and Williams decided to retire from office early in March
1921. During this time he became increasingly hostile to the Board. He attacked the
amount of credit available to New York City member banks in contrast to those in the
interior and argued for lowering interest rates.80
             In these circumstances and given the escalating number of banks failures, it is
surprising how little discussion in the literature there is about examination and
supervision. W. Randolph Burgess mentions the supervisory activities of the Federal
Reserve banks only twice in his authoritative book The Reserve Banks and the Money
Market (1927). In his analysis of the lending activities of these banks, he emphasizes that
both safety of rediscounts and advances are ensured by the quality of the collateral and
the shortness of the credit. Losses to the Federal Reserve banks were thus “negligible.”
Member banks were required to file statements of the customers who presented paper to

                                               36
the banks in excess of $5,000. To verify the quality of the collateral, the New York Fed
maintained a file on 50,000 to 60,000 individuals and businesses. Examination gets short
shrift: “They [the Federal Reserve Banks] maintain staffs of bank examiners who from
time to time examine member banks and still more frequently collaborate with federal
and state authorities in such examinations.”81
           In Burgess’ view a key function of examination was to provide information to
the Federal Reserve bank officers in charge of lending to members to “prevent too
constant or too large use of borrowing facilities.” In New York, this gave the Fed a list of
banks whose condition was not satisfactory so that loans to them could be scrutinized.
Those banks that made use of Fed credit for an unreasonably long period were then
subjected to special inquiries to determine the “necessity for the borrowing.”82 If
borrowing was in excess of its capital and surplus, the bank was automatically placed on
the list for inquiry.83 Burgess emphasized the importance of discretion in handling each
of these cases. The example he gives is very telling because it is a very different from the
Comptroller’s view of the nature of supervision:

                  Take as an example the perplexing problem of lending to a
                  bank in the farming area of the Middle West in recent
                  years. The First National Bank of Crestland is loaded with
                  doubtful farm paper, much of it representing sometime
                  equities in real estate. They bring all their good paper to
                  the Federal Reserve Bank to rediscount. Shall the Reserve
                  Bank take it and lend them the money? If the Reserve
                  Bank refuses, failure may follow. If it makes the loan, it
                  assumes the responsibilities of continuing in operation a
                  bank probably insolvent. If failure should then come the
                  depositors might find much of the good assets re-
                  discounted at the Reserve Bank and unavailable to pay
                  depositors. The Reserve Bank must consider not only the
                  safety of its loan, but the interests of the depositors. Can
                  the bank be saved by a loan? If not, will the depositors be
                  better off under an immediate liquidation, or a later
                  liquidation, when the bank may have dissipated many of its
                  best assets? These are some of the questions the Reserve
                  Bank has to face. The answer depends on a careful scrutiny

   Under the national banking system banks were not permitted to borrow in excess of their capital, but
Federal Reserve Act allowed them to do so.

                    of each bank, in constant cooperation with state and
                    national supervisory authorities. (Burgess, 1927, p. 236-7)

             On this matter the Fed ran into a conflict with the OCC, especially under
Williams, which believed that it should not disclose the information collected during
examinations to the Fed, except where it might have direct bearing on its discount
operations. What Burgess recognized was the discount window had created moral hazard
for banks that borrowed. Following Walter Bagehot’s Lombard Street, a nineteenth
century European central bank might not have worried about the total condition of a
borrowing bank, just whether it had good collateral. But, the Fed apparently assumed
responsibility for the depositors and creditors of the bank.
             This shift in the approach to supervision was abetted by the struggle between
the Fed and the OCC for control of supervision. This contest arose because the Fed tried
to appease state member banks who objected being subject to the same, more stringent
regulations as national banks. Rather than coerce them to adhere to these regulations and
risk their departure from the system, the Fed slowly weakened supervision for all national
and state member banks. Just as state banks did not jump to become national banks after
the National Bank Act of 1864, so too were few state-chartered banks convinced of the
benefits of Fed membership that they willingly submitted to its generally more rigorous
regulations. The Federal Reserve Act had tried to bring in most institutions into the fold
by a variety of changes, lowering reserve requirements and differentiating between
demand and time deposits and giving trust powers to national banks.84 But, few state
banks responded; and by 1917, only 53 of the over 19,000 state banks had taken out
membership. Amendments to the Act of 1913 made membership slightly more attractive
to larger state institutions and membership rose to 513 in 1918 and 1,042 in 1919,
cresting at 1,648 in 1922. While these state banks accounted for half of all state banks’
assets, there were still 19,000 outside the regulatory purview of any federal agency. At
the same time the number of national banks under the aegis of the Comptroller slowly
rose from 7,518 in 1914 to a peak of 8,236 in 1923. Needless to say, the Federal Reserve
was very sensitive to any slippage in the number of its members.

           The most visible example of the effects of competition between agencies
followed from the transfer of authority to request call reports from the OCC to the Fed
and the resultant decline in the number of call reports. The Federal Reserve Act gave the
Board of Governors the power to demand reports and examine member banks, but
initially the OCC carried out examination of state member banks in addition to national
banks. When in 1915, Comptroller Williams asked for a sixth report and more detailed
information, he provoked a flood of complaints.85. As a consequence of this uproar and
the inequality between the requirements imposed on national and state member banks, the
1917 Amendment to the Federal Reserve Act ordered state member banks to make their
reports of condition to their Federal Reserve bank, setting the minimum number of call
reports at three---not the five required of national banks. Furthermore, the power to set
call dates was transferred to the Board. In 1916, the surprise call year-end call reports
were abandoned.86
         This regime shift was not completed until after Williams left office in late 1921.
But, once he had departed, disclosure began to weaken. In 1922, the number of reports
fell back to five---the number that had been requested continuously since 1870.87 Then in
1923, it dropped to four and remained at that level for 1924 and 1925. There is no
comment in the Annual Reports of the Comptroller of the Currency or the Federal
Reserve Board or in the Federal Reserve Bulletin; but in 1926, there were only three call
reports---one for April 12, June 30, and December 3. In 1927, the Board called for four
reports, a number it adhered to in subsequent years. What is missing for 1926 is the report
that was traditionally called for in October, a shocking omission as this is the most fateful
month of the year for financial crises. Why was it omitted? While the answer may lie
somewhere in the archives of the Federal Reserve, there are two possible reasons. The
Fed could have been under pressure from the national banks to reduce their reporting and
put them on a par with state member banks. If so, this is an example of the “competition
in laxity” between state and federal regulators that had led to a reduction of capital and
reserve requirements in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and continues to

bedevil contemporary American regulators.88 Alternatively, the Fed may have been
alarmed by the condition of some banks, given that real estate values had begun to
decline in the third quarter of 1926. The decision to skip the October call might have
been made to give banks time to raise capital or make other adjustments. If this were the
case, it represented a significant shift towards discretionary supervision.
        The record of bank examination reveals no such obvious deterioration and in fact,
the Federal Reserve Act adopted some of the recommendations that pre-1913
Comptrollers had long requested. The payment of a fixed fee for each bank examined
had caused the examinations to be less than a surprise as examiners movements became
more predictable as they sought to minimized travel costs. The new Federal Reserve
regime eliminated this incentive and put examiners on a salary and paid their expenses.
In addition they were provided with paid assistants.89 The OCC also gained an increased
ability to monitor its examiners, reorganizing its operations by Federal Reserve District
and appointing a chief national bank examiner with responsibility for all examiners in the
district.90 Although the Comptroller was initially responsible for examining state member
banks, the 1917 Amendment transferred this power to the Federal Reserve banks who
organized their own examination departments.91


        C. Examination in the Early Fed Years
        The resources available to the Comptroller under this new regime are shown in
Table 2.     The increase in resources devoted to examination is marked, but probably
reflects the need to manage the growing number of insolvencies. In 1915, the number of
examiners was little different, perhaps a bit lower than in 1913. But, beginning in 1916,
there is a steady rise, peaking in 1923 at 234 examiners, nearly double the number before
the foundation of the Fed. As the number of national banks changed little, the number of
banks per examiner declined to the mid-thirties.             This change suggests that examiners
had more time to spend per bank; however it is unclear how much of this increase was
associated with the higher number of bank failures in the early 1920s. There are two

   State banks complained about bearing the cost of state examinations in addition to those of the Fed,
though the Board could accept state examinations in lieu of additional federal ones (Kirn, 1945, p. 164).

series representing the resources that are not completely compatible nor do they overlap.
The first is the traditional revenue from the fees or assessments from examinations, and
the second is the reported examination expenses, which would include salaries and travel
expenses of the examiners. Nevertheless, they show the same pattern, doubling in real
terms from the years around the founding of the Fed to the mid-1920s, but again the
published record is silent whether this represents any change in supervision activity or the
management of failing banks.

        The Federal Reserve banks initially relied on the Comptroller’s examiners and
state supervisors examiners, only slowly creating their own examination staffs. The
Federal Reserve Board created its own staff of examiners whose numbers are shown in
Table 3. Conscious that state-chartered banks had no desire to be examined by two
regulatory authorities, the Fed was given discretion to use the reports of state authorities.
As a result, the relatively large number of banks per examiner does not imply that the Fed
make less effort than the OCC to examine its banks.

IV. Price Stability v. Financial Stability
           A. The Unexpected Deflation Shock
           Against this backdrop of interagency conflict, the conflict between the twin goals
of price stability and financial stability quickly emerged. When inflation began to pick
up speed in 1920, the Federal Reserve responded by quickly raising interest rates.92 This
action, often deemed to be an excessive response, produced a sharp recession and a
significant deflation. There was no historical precedent that would have prepared the
financial sector for this action. During the Civil War, the price level had more than
doubled but the deflation that permitted the U.S. join the gold standard at its prewar
parity was gradual, lasting from 1866 to 1879. After World War I when the price level

Banks that had been riding the wartime and postwar booms were hit hardest, with the
small banks in agricultural areas suffering the most as commodity prices plummeted.

Figure 10 shows the percentage of state and national bank failures and the inflation rate
between 1865 and 1929. The unprecedented deflation was accompanied by a lagged
increase in bank failures, as its effects gradually brought a rise in farm foreclosures.94
During the years 1921-1929, 766 national banks and 4,645 state banks failed.                                                                                            The
number of national bank insolvencies was far greater than the 501 insolvencies of 1865-
1913.                                                  Worse yet, the payout ratio for national banks dropped to 40 percent for a total
loss of $565 million ($6.9 billion in 2009 dollars) or 0.8% of 1925 GDP.95 The banking

system might have recovered from this one time shock, as it had recovered from the
1890s, with modest numbers of failures and relatively high payouts. However, the
second great unanticipated deflationary shock of the Great Depression prevented a
complete recovery.      In addition, this onetime shock muddied the water for identifying
other more subtle changes in policy described above.


B. Seasonal Interest Rate and Discount Policies
          Beyond this deflationary event, two permanent features of the Federal Reserve
changed the incentives for banks to take risks: its seasonal interest rate policy and its
discount policy. In the Federal Reserve Act, the Fed was charged with furnishing “an
elastic currency.” For the Fed it was a central obligation to eliminate the seasonal strain
in financial markets. As its first Annual Report emphasized “its duty is not to await
emergencies but by anticipation, to do what it can to prevent them.”96 Miron (1986)
documented that the Federal Reserve promptly carried out policies that reduced the
seasonality of interest rates. Because panics occurred in periods when seasonal increases
in loan demand and decreases in deposit demand strained the financial system,
accommodating credit to seasonal shocks reduced the potential of a crisis. Comparing
1890-1908 and 1919-1928, Miron found the standard deviation of the seasonal for call
loans fell from 130 to 46 basis points, with the amplitude dropping from 600 to 230 basis
points. The reduction of seasonality in interest rates lowered the stress on the financial
system, leading Miron to conclude that it had eliminated banking panics during the period
1915-1929. Most striking, was the absence of a panic during the severe recession of
1920-1921. Both the timing in the decline of seasonality and the role of the Fed have
been challenged, but Miron’s basic results have been upheld.97
          This seasonal interest rate policy is visible in Figure 11, which displays the time
rate for stock market loans and the commercial paper rate. Before the establishment of
the Fed, businessmen and their bankers had to be wary of the sharp seasonal fluctuations,
with the sometime accompanying financial panic. Once fears had been dampened, banks
could more readily take risks, knowing that they would not be subject to the sharp interest

rate spikes in the past. In this environment, a quick deflationary shock such as 1920-
1921 or a longer one, such as 1929-1933, would take a heavier toll on exposed financial
institutions.

                 In addition, a bank which found itself in trouble could, if it were a member of a
Federal Reserve bank, borrow at the discount window. Banks in trouble now had a new
option.          Where before they could voluntarily liquidate or continue with the risk of
ultimately becoming insolvent. At the discount window, they could borrow using some
of their good assets and try to recoup their losses. The danger for depositors and other
creditors was that such a bank would pay out less if it failed because it had pledged more
good assets at the Fed’s window.                       This was the problem that Burgess had identified,
though he thought that the “careful scrutiny” of the regulators would be sufficient to
prevent this outcome.


                                                               45
        Unfortunately, contrary to Burgess’s hopeful expectations, many banks became
long-term borrowers at the discount window.                In 1925, the Federal Reserve Board
collected data on the indebtedness of member banks to their Federal Reserve banks.
This information revealed that contrary to the expectations of the fathers of the Fed, the
discount window turned out to have been more than a facility to increase short-term
liquidity. On August 31, 1925, 593 banks had been borrowing for a year or more.98 Out
of this total 239 had been borrowing continuously since 1920.                These banks appear to
have been severely troubled institutions and the Fed estimated that 80 percent of the 259
national member banks that had failed since 1920 had been “habitual borrowers.” This
problem was confirmed in later years. Of the 457 banks that had been borrowing for
more than a year in 1926, 41 suspended operations in 1927 and 24 liquidated voluntarily
or merged.99


        C. The Growing Cost of Bank Failures
        How did this regime affect the closing of banks and the losses to depositors and
creditors? First, there was no change is the liability of national bank shareholders who
were still subject to double liability.          However, there was one significant change
engineered by the Act of November 7, 1918. Before this act, if two national banks
wanted to merge, one had to be liquidated to permit the other to purchase its assets and
assume its liabilities. Out of the numerous voluntary liquidations, very few banks chose
this option. After 1918, the two banks could consolidate under either charter, subject to
approval of the Comptroller of the Currency. Previously prohibited from acquiring
branches, this legal change gave national banks a crude means to acquire them in states
where branching was permitted.100 While liquidations before 1918 had rarely been used
as a means to consolidate, now banks that were weak might be tempted to combine with a
stronger bank.      This change in the menu of choices makes the comparison of bank
closures before and after 1913 difficult.



98
   On June 30, 1925, there were 9,538 member banks. These 593 banks thus represented 6.2 percent of the
total. Banking and Monetary Statistics (1943) , pp. 22-23.

       Table 4 provides data on national bank closures for the years 1921-1929.                The
number of annual suspensions, which approximates the number of insolvent banks, rose
considerably during the twenties, largely because of the post-World War I agricultural
crisis. Voluntary liquidations were less frequent and consolidations and absorptions were
on the rise.    Yet, even if one treats consolidations and absorptions as voluntary
liquidations, as they might have been before 1914, then the sum of the two 113 and 1104
is still not twice the number of suspensions. In the National Banking era, voluntary
liquidations outnumbered insolvencies by a factor of four. White knights may have been
found for some troubled banks, but fewer banks were taking the cautious path of
voluntary liquidation.

       Again the temporary deflationary shock of 1920-1921 makes it difficult to
evaluate the change in the payout ratio for insolvent banks from the permanent
innovations by the Fed. While this ratio averaged around 40 percent for the 1920s, the
deflationary shock should have abated considerably by the end of the decade. However,
the ratio only reached 50 percent in 1929, which is suggestive, though not conclusive

evidence that banks were responding to the new incentives, taking increased risks relative
to the years before 1913.101
           The changes in bank supervision witnessed in the first fifteen year of the Federal
Reserve had subtle effects on bank behavior and outcomes. A small but significant
minority of banks became dependent on the discount window, voluntary liquidations
were down, suspensions increased, and payouts declined. These changes did not de-
stabilize the system that had arisen during the National Banking era and aggregate losses
remained very modest. In the absence of the Great Depression, Burgess’optimism might
have eventually proved warranted if one is willing to make some strong assumptions. If
competition in laxity and regulatory arbitrage had been brought under control and
supervision reduced the number of borrowers at the discount window, bank failures and
payouts might have returned to the lower levels of the pre-1913 era. If one doubts the
ability to make these changes effective then the American banking system was stuck with
a more costly supervisory regime.


V. Après le Deluge
           These conjectures seem “academic” because of the change that swept over
supervision with the Great Depression.        The assumption of the New Dealers was that
regime of regulation and supervision inherited from the National Banking System had
failed. Yet this regime had kept losses to depositors to a minimum for the fifty years
before 1914, in spite of a fragmented banking structure and the absence of a central bank.
It even appears to have held up reasonably well after the creation of the Fed and the large
unanticipated deflationary shock of 1920-1921. Nevertheless, because of a grand
misdiagnosis, the New Deal swept aside this successful regime and imposed a radically
different one that sharply increased moral hazard and risk-taking.
           The depression devastated the banking system in the years 1929-1933. The
unexpected series of deflationary shocks led prices to fall 23 percent and contributed to
the 39 percent drop in GDP.102 In July 1929, commercial banks, which numbered
24,504, held $49 billion in deposits. By the time the bank holiday ended only 11,878

banks with $23 billion in deposits were deemed strong enough to open immediately. The
losses from insolvent banks, half to depositors and half to shareholders, reached an
unprecedented $2.5 billion or 2.4 percent of GDP.103
           As is well known, the defects of the banking system and even the character of
bankers were held to be primary causes of the depression; and the New Deal responded
with a major reform effort to alter regulation and supervision. Although the influence of
specific lobbies within the banking industry, notably unit bankers and independent
investment bankers have been identified in designing and lobbying for new regulation,
the general argument was that the competitive market had failed and needed to be
subjected to a thorough regulation. The competitive market was replaced by a loosely
organized government cartel with controls on many dimensions of entry and pricing.
This change was based on a failure to recognize that it was large deflationary shocks that
had undermined the banking system and the rest of the economy, not unbridled
competition.
           The massive number of bank failures presented supervision with huge new
challenges. In the past, it was thought that bank examiners could use market prices to
judge the solvency of an institution. The increased volatility of price expectations,
accompanying the jagged downward path of the economy, made the valuation of assets
extremely difficult.        But, instead of identifying the mistakes in monetary policy as the
primary culprit, the reformers argued that markets failed to accurately value assets.
Examiners were now instructed to value assets according to the “intrinsic value” they
would have when the economy recovered. Supervision abandoned efforts to reinforce
market discipline and instead was given discretion to make independent judgments,
permitting forbearance in closing insolvent institutions that might recover later
           The most high profile New Deal change, the creation of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation was accompanied by a change that has all but been forgotten---the
abandonment of double liability. Shareholders under the threat of high assessments
pleaded with legislatures to change the law, while the general public saw little benefit for
retaining this rule.104 Additionally, it was assumed that since depositors were protected by

FDIC insurance, they would no longer need the protection afforded by double liability.
The extra incentive for shareholders to more carefully monitor directors was erased,
leaving supervision with a heavier monitoring burden.         The visible effect of double
liability, voluntary liquidations disappeared. Banks were not closed before they failed,
or even shortly after they became insolvent. The increased difficulty of monitoring them
and growing moral hazard, with perhaps forbearance, meant that they would be closed
only when they were gravely insolvent.
           The proliferation of New Deal and post-New deal federal regulatory agencies
created more competition in laxity with opportunities for regulatory arbitrage and even
regulatory capture.         The sheer number of agencies involved in bank supervision, the
OCC, the Fed, the FDIC, the SEC, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the Federal
Home Loan banks, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, and the
National Credit Union Administration made it more difficult for Congress to provide
effective oversight.
           The incentive effects of these vast changes were, however, hidden for decades.
The Great Depression had winnowed out all but the stronger institutions and induced
them to abandon loans for U.S. government bonds. To serve its enormous financing
needs during World War II, the federal government pushed banks to enlarge even further
their bond portfolios.105 By the end of the war, banks had become extremely safe
institutions, and then it would take decades to unwind from their bond-saturated positions
and permit the full effects of the New Deal incentives to operate. This adjustment was
finished by the late 1970s, when inflationary shocks created a perfect storm that caused
the New Deal regulatory system to collapse.
