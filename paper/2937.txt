The purpose of this study is to analyze the behavior of the inflation tax in an economy
where, due to coordination failure, the inflation rate is not determined by a unique
policy maker but by several competing decision makers. Each decision maker can
effectively print more paper money via the central bank, which operates only as the
printing agency of nominal balances. This market structure generates a competitive
externality. A key result is that the optimal' inflation rate depends positively on the
competitive externality. We provide two examples of scenarios where these externalities
are relevant. First, the case in which the central bank is a powerless agent whose only
responsibility is to print money upon demand by the ministers. The second example is a
common currency area, where several countries operate in a monetary union.
Alternatively, this may be the case of a country composed of several states or
provinces, where the centralized government system is weak and local governments
can use seigniorage to their advantage. The effect of competitive externalities is to
increase the inflation rate, to an extent that puts the economy on the wrong side of the
inflation tax Laffer curve.

1. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
The inflation tax approach originated in Friedman (1969). It considers the case of a
central bank with monopoly power in supplying nominal money balances, which may
use this power to tax money holders by inflation. This approach generated a number of
influential results. First, in the absence of fiscal revenue motives, welfare maximization
requires following optimal deflation, so as to minimize the costs of using money
balances.1 Second, allowing for fiscal revenue motives requires an inflation rate that is
derived as part of the public finance problem, determining the vector of optimal taxes
(see Phelps (1973)).
      The above results were derived for the case of a centralized decision maker,
assuming away coordination problems. This assumption may be questionable in certain
interesting economic situations. For example, if both the central bank and the treasury
are weak, one could envision a situation in which various ministers may compete for
seigniorage. Alternatively, a common currency area composed of several countries may
generate a similar situation. The purpose of this study is to analyze the behavior of the
inflation tax in an economy where, due to coordination failure, the assumption of a
centralized decision maker determining the optimal inflation rate does not hold. This
will allow us to examine how the implicit market structure influences the predictions of
the traditional inflation tax argument. Specifically, we replace the monopolist decision
maker (like the central bank) with several competing decision makers.
      For simplicity we assume that the inflation tax is determined by decisions makers
who are organized in a monopolistic competitive' structure. Each decision maker can
effectively print more paper money via the central bank, which operates only as the
printing agency of nominal balances. The decision makers thus compete among

for example, Phelps (1973), Frenkel (1976), Helpman and Sadka (1979), ..Jovanovic
(1982), Fischer (1982) and Kimbrough (1986).

themselves for the inflation tax revenues. We start by assuming that their number is
large enough for each ones marginal printing decision not to affecting that of the other
decision makers. Latter we extend our analysis to the conjecture variations equilibrium.
We show that the monopolistic competitive' market structure generates a competitive
externality in which each decision maker overlooks the externalities he himself
introduced.2 Our analysis focuses on the role of these externalities in explaining the
inflation tax. A key result is that the 'optimal inflation rate depends positively on the
competitive externality. This externality may generate an inflation rate that put the
economy on the wrong side of the Laffer curve.
      Two examples are given of economic scenarios where these externalities are
relevant. First, we consider the case of the central bank being a powerless agent whose
only responsibility is to print money upon demand by the ministers. If the ministers
have equal power and can not collude into a binding cartel, the economy s
characterized by the above competitive externality. We show that if each minister aims
at maximizing his inflation tax revenue, the Nash equilibrium will yield an inflation
that puts the economy on the wrong side of the inflation tax Laffer curve. The second
example considers an environment where the ministers are replaced with small
countries that operate as part of a common currency area, as may be the case in
Europe in the future.3 Alternatively, this may be the case of a country composed of
several states or provinces, where the centralized government system is weak and the
local governments can use seigniorage to their advantage (as may be the case in Brazil


      2.    These externalities are similar to those identified in the literature on
international coordination (see Hamada (1976)).
      3.    A recent study of monetary policy in a common currency union (Casella
arid Feiristein (1988)) analyze the way monetary arrangement influences the optimum
financing of a public good, in a two country world. A pioneering study of this topic is
Mundell (1961).

and   Argentina). We derive the optimal inflation rate for each country in a Nash
equilibrium, where each country can print more money. We show that in the absence
of a cartel agreement on the division of seigniorage, the optima1 inflation rate for each
country will exceed the optimal inflation rate obtained in a cooperative solution, and
may put the economy on the wrong side of the inflation tax Laffer curve. In both
examples the same externality operates: each minister (or country) is aware that
marginal printing of money for his own benefit will increase inflation and thereby erode
the base of the inflation tax (and reduce welfare), but he overlooks the adverse welfare
consequences of inflation on all other ministers (or countries).
      The above results can solve a puzzle recently observed in the context of the
inflation tax. The public finance approach to inflation tax generated predictions that
cast doubt on the validity of the inflation tax argument as an explanation for inflation.
Specifically, maximizing inflation tax revenues is similar to maximizing the revenue of
a monopoly whose marginal costs of production are nil, yielding an equilibrium at an
inflation rate that yields a version of the unitary elasticity rule. While such inflation
exceeds the socially optimal rate, it sets an upper limit to the inflation rate supported
by the inflation tax argument. Recently, however, several studies detected inflation
rates that seem to exceed those that maximize the revenue from inflation tax,4 putting
the economy on the wrong side of the inflation tax Laffer curve. One explanation for
this phenomenon is the possibility of multiple equilibria, where the same inflation tax
can be raised by either a low or a high inflation rate (see Liviatan (1984) and Bruno




      4.    See Cukierman (1987), Bruno (1988), Edwards and Tabellirii (1988), Kigue]
and Liviatan (1988)). For other relevant empirical studies see Fischer (1982) and
Eckstein and Leidermari (1988). Note that an alternative explanation for the above
observations may refer to time-inconsistent behavior of the type analyzed in Calvo
(1978).
                                           -4-
and Fischer (1984)). This approach explains the high inflation equilibrium by focusing
on parameters like the speed of adjustment and learning. It has problems, however, in
explaining the economic process that may lead the policy maker to such an inefficient
equilibrium. Our analysis explains the process that leads decision makers to the
inefficient equilibrium, without relying on multiple equilibria. We demonstrate that the
competitive externality identified in our analysis may put the economy on the wrong
side of the Latter curve due to the lack of coordination among the decision makers. This
may occur even if the conditions needed to generate multiple equilibria are not met. By
focusing on the decision making process and lack of coordination we suggest that a
reform fails to address the underlying coordination problem will not work, thereby
shifting the emphasis to the political structure of the economy.
       Section 2 describes the derivation of the revenue maximizing inflation tax for the
case of competing ministers; Section 3 considers the case of the optimal inflation tax in
a common currency area, where various states compete for seigniorage. Section 4 closes
with concluding remarks. The Appendix derives several of the equations used in the
paper.


2.    COMPETITION AMONG MINISTERS
Consider an economy with zero growth and two assets: money and real bonds. For
simplicity of exposition, let us assume that there is perfect foresight arid no uncertainty.
Real output (Y) is constant, equal to 1. The Appendix provides a detailed example of the
maximization problem and the budget constraints that yield the following demand
structure. The demand for real money balances is given by:


      (1)         mt

is the price level expected in period t+1. Henceforth we will identify                     with Pt+i. We
assume a very simple fiscal structure: the only tax is seigniorage. Let us denote by Gt
total nominal revenue from seigniorage at time t:

         (2)                Gt = Mt - Mt_i.


      There are n ministers, with symmetric power. Each of them can print money Gt
such that

Each minister prints money so as to maximize his revenue, taking the printing of other
ministers as given. Thus, the condition determining the level of printing by minister h is
given by

inflation rate, with competing minsters. For each of them the tax effect of higher

Note that   as long as we get a partial response ('r ' 1) all our previous results continue to
hold, where the competitive externality is proportional to 1 -      .




3. COMPETITION AMONG COUNTRIES IN A COMMON CURRENCY AREA

We can apply our previous analysis to the case where the coordination problem arises
in a common currency area composed by several countries, each having the capacity to
print money, directly or indirectly. We will solve this problem for the case where the
relevant criterion for each decision maker is to raise a given revenue in a way that will
minimize the welfare loss of taxes. Specifically, suppose that there are two taxes:
seigniorage and income (or endowment) tax (denoted by p). The income tax is associated
with net collection costs (i,) . Thus, each dollar paid by a consumer yields only 1 -      to
                         12
the fiscal authorities. We preserve the assumptions of the previous part, and for




      ii.     This also suggests that one way of overcoming the competitive externality is
                                                                        aG,
by devising a system with a complete response (i.e., where                    1   for i    h).

Note that such a system will not solve the coordination problems in the presence of
incomplete information on the true printing of each minister.
     12.   Alternatively, to collect one dollar the authorities must spend ,/(i-.) on
enforcing the law. Consequently, the private sector pays i/(1-,) for each dollar of net
taxes. Throughout the analysis we assume a constant collection costs. We allow for
collection costs because this issue plays a key role in explaining the use of inflation tax.
As was shown by Kimbrough (1986), the optimal inflation tax is zero. According to
Aizenman (1987) and Vega (1988), the inflation tax is positive if one allows for collection

simplicity assume a neutral rate of time preference (in terms of the Appendix, we
assume that     0). For exposition simplicity we assume a symmetric environment,
where all the members of the currency area are similar in size and in the underlying
economic structure.13 The periodic utility of the representative consumer in country h
is given by

the real balances. The Appendix demonstrates that

which is given by the resources spent on preserving the real balances at their steady
state level. The Appendix demonstrates that the first order condition determining
optimal money balances is given by14

we take the direct approach. The problem facing the authorities in country h is to raise
a given real revenue target, denoted by , in a way that will maximize the welfare of
the, representative consumer in country h. Applying (15), (16) and (18), this is
equivalent to choosing Gh so as to maximize

derivation of (20) yields the following first order condition:

Equation (21) has a simple interpretation: the condition for optimal seigniorage is that
extra printing will save as much income tax payment (the left hand side) as equals the
induced capital loss on the domestic holder of money (the right hand side).
Taking derivatives of the two sides of (19) yields that in a symmetric equilibrium the
following condition holds

makers (n >   1),   we get positive inflation even in the absence of collection costs. This

4.   CONCLUDING REMARKS

Our paper analyzed the determination of seigniorage when several decision makers
determine the seigniorage and the resulting inflation. We focused on the monopolistic
competitive equilibrium, and extended the discussion to the conjecture variation
equilibrium. Our analysis did n1 attempt to model the political factors underlying a
non-cooperative solution that prevent reaching a more efficient cooperative solution.
Taking these factors as given, we focused on the consequences of the interaction among
the various policy makers. We identify the presence of a competitive externality. The
problem here is similar to the case of a fragile cartel, where each agent ignores the
adverse consequences of his cheating on other cartel members. As in the cartel
example, the welfare consequences are clear: it is advantageous to delegate, if possible,
the printing power to one agent, who will generate the cooperative optimal solution and
then distribute the revenue. In the case of the ministers, this will occur if there is
either a powerful finance minister or a powerful central banker. In the case of the
various countries, it will be useful to delegate the power regarding monetary policy to
the central bank, or to one dominant country, subject to the appropriate revenue
sharing rule.
      Our analysis refers to the case where there is no uncertainty. Under this
assumption one can solve the problems generated by the competitive externality by a
sharing rule, where each marginal printing of an atomistic decision maker will trigger
equal printing by all other decision maker. The conseqi.ience of such a rule is to
internalize the competitive externality, but its practical application is limited by the
availability of full information on the printing of each agent and costless monitoring. A
useful extension of our analysis may consider the case where monitoring is costly and
partial, increasing the importance of competitive externalities.

                                         APPENDIX
     The purpose of the Appendix is to provide a detailed description of the economy,
yielding the demand structure applied throughout the paper.

A. The Consumer
We consider consumers whose preferences are given by


      (Al)                u(Ct) +   v()] 1(1 +

where u s the sub-utility from consumption, and v is the sub-utility from money. The
periodic budget constraints for t 0 are given by

      (A2)         PtCt + PtBt + Mt    Pt Y(l — p)   +
                                                         Pt_iBt_i(l   +   )   +   Mt_i


where p stands for an income tax, and we assume the existence of a real, one-period
bond, yielding an interest rate . To simplify, we assume that both output Y and the
real interest rate are time invariant, and that B0 0. We can combine the above
periodic budget constraints into a unif led intertemporal budget constraint:


      (A3)
                    tlI ECt+1/(l+B)t tlI [Y(1_p)]/(l+B)t
where Mt -    Mt
                 - Mt_i. The consumer problem is to choose the vector of consumption
((Ci) and {Mt)) and money balances that maximizes (Al) subject to (A3). The first order
conditions are:


      (A4)                   A
                     Ct

     (A5)
                        amt

where   X   is   multiplier associated with the budget constraint. Note that our assumptions
imply that the solution of (A4) and (A5) are time invariant. The simultaneous solution
of (A4) and (A5) yields the steady state values of C and m. Taking the ratios of the two
first order condiUons we get:

                        av(m)   =
                                    u(C) (1+B)(1+it)-1
      (A6)               am          ac    (1+)(1+ir)


Note that from the budget constraint we get that


        (A7)           C+   m           Y(1 - p).



Solving (A6) and (A7) simultaneously yields the functional solution for m:


        (A8)           m

B. Optimal taxes with a quadratic loss function.
Our discussion in Section 3 was implemented in terms of the utility of the
representative agent. We here describe the derivation of the optimal seigniorage for the
case where the welfare loss associated with the various taxes is given by a loss function.
Suppose that the that the loss associated with the taxes is the net present value of the
periodic loss, given by


        (A9)            L - Cp2 +
                                           - 17 -
where     p is the income tax and C and C, are constants, measuring the size of the
welfare triangles measuring the welfare losses due to the presence of distorted taxes'7
         The aggregate demand for real balances, rn, is given by

         (AlO)      m n k(Tr)Y

where n is the number of the countries in the common currency area, k(rr)
summarizes the functional dependency of the demand for money balances on inflation,
and Y is the fixed GNP in each country. For exposition simplicity we assume a
symmetric environment, where all the members of the currency area are similar in
size and in the underlying economic structure , yielding equal C's
       The problem facing the policy maker h is to raise a given real revenue target, ,
so as to minimize the loss from taxes. Formally, E is given by



                             Gh
         (All)           pY +--

where Gh is the seigniorage and P is the general price level,
         The problem facing the policy maker is to choose (p. Gh) such as to minimize the
welfare loss, L, subject to the given revenue target, E. Applying the (A9). (All) we can
summarize this problem as choosing Gb so as to minimize




           This welfare loss can be derived as a second order approximation of the
         17.
welfare losses around the undistorted equilibrium. It is a useful approximation as long
as the various taxes are small. The size of the various C's are determined by the
various elasticities and by the presence of collection costs associated with the various
taxes.

where         • F/Y is the GNP share of the revenue target. Direct derivation of (A12)

yields:

                              - Gb a(Gh/P) -       an   a(G/P)
      (A13)            CpER          a Gh    C a (G/P) a Gh

In deriving (A13) we make use of the fact that the inflation rate is determined in the
steady state equilibrium by the global seigniorage, denoted by G/P. Applying the fact
that G/P          ii     we get that in the symmetric equilibrium

                                                                       (G/P)

                                                                        a Gh


          Applying the logic of Section 2 (equation (5)) we get a key equation determining
the condition for the optimal non-cooperative inflation rate:

                                                                         GP
          (A15) C - it k(n)]                  =        it _________
                                                                       l••


Equation (AlS) can be interpreted as follows: a marginal increase in revenue collected as
seigniorage by country h will generate two effects: a marginal benefit due to the
reduction in the tax rate, p, needed to collect the given revenue target and a marginal
cost due to the induced higher inflation rate. The first effect (the marginal benefit) is
                                             — 1.9 -

given by the left hand side of (A15), the second effect (the marginal cost) is given by the
right hand side of (A15).
      The presence of the competitive externality is reflected in the fact that each
country view the effective inflation tax base as the aggregate supply of money balances,
n m. As a result, each country internalizes only a portion 1/n of the total effect of a
higher inflation. The cooperative solution is characterized by full internalization, which,
in terms of (A15), will occur for n •   1.The effect of the competitive externality is to
reduce the marginal cost of higher inflation, thereby reducing the right hand side of
(A15), and increasing the inflation rate.
