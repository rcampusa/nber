Fixed Costs and the Product Market Treatment of Preference Minorities

                                              ABSTRACT

It is well documented that, in the presence of substantial fixed costs, markets offer preference majorities
more variety than preference minorities. This fact alone, however, does not demonstrate the market
outcome is in any way biased against preference minorities. In this paper, we clarify the sense in which
the market outcome may in fact be biased against preference minorities, and we provide some conditions
for such bias to occur. We then estimate the degree of bias in a particular industry using an empirical
model of entry into radio broadcasting with two types of listeners, a preference majority and a minority,
and the two types of stations targeting those respective listeners. Listening model estimates are used
to infer fixed costs, which can then be used to find optimal station configurations as well as the welfare
weights on different groups that rationalize the current configuration. The ensuing estimates reveal
welfare weights that are 2-3 times higher for whites than blacks, and 1.5-2 times higher for non-Hispanic
than Hispanic, listeners. The difference between the black and Hispanic results arises from the different
patterns of importing and exporting: Hispanics listen to non-Hispanic-targeted stations more than blacks
listen to white-targeted stations; and whites listen to black-targeted stations more than non-Hispanics
listen to Spanish-language stations. Researchers and policy makers might add product markets to labor
markets and other contexts that warrant attention for disparate treatment of minorities.

1        Introduction

In differentiated product markets with high fixed costs, the product choice set is determined, in
part, by the sizes of the populations of consumers with different tastes. In such situations, pref-
erence majorities may find relatively many products that cater to their tastes, while preference
minorities find relatively few. In light of this well-documented fact, one might be tempted to
conclude that the market favors preference majorities. On the other hand, if high fixed costs are
needed in order to create a product that caters to a relatively small group of consumers, failing to
supply this product may not be viewed as evidence of bias against this group. This paper seeks
to clarify and measure the sense in which markets might be found to favor preference majorities.
Our approach is to analyze the market outcome as if it were generated by a social planner. The
question we address is whether the implicit social planner places more weight on the preferences
of one group as opposed to another.
   The notion of modeling market outcomes as though they were generated by a social planner is
familiar. We teach undergraduates that the perfectly competitive outcome in a particular market
matches the preferences of a social planner who cares equally about consumer and producer
surplus. Less commonly, we could think of the classic monopoly quantity as the choice of a
planner who cares only about producer surplus. In public economics, a particular system of
redistributive taxes may be described via the preferences of a social planner who places differential
weight on different groups. In regulatory economics, the complicated political process that
generates regulated prices is often treated as the reflection of a single planner’s relative preferences
over different groups.1 The task of this paper is to explicitly estimate the welfare weights that a
differentiated product market’s free entry equilibrium implicitly attaches to different groups of
consumers.
   A simplified example makes the exercise clear. Suppose that there are two distinct and
different-sized groups with different preferences, a preference majority with 1,000 members, and
a preference minority with 500 members. Preferences are distinct in the sense that each group
consumes only the product targeted at that group. Assume that a first product targeted at each
group attracts one quarter of the group to consumption, a second attracts an additional eighth,
a third an additional sixteenth, and so on. Fixed costs of products targeting each group are
identical at 100, marginal costs are zero, and the price of output for each group is constant at 1.
Then, total revenue to products targeting the majority grows with entry: 250, 375, 437.5, 468.8,
484.4. With revenue split equally across products, average revenue per product declines: 250,
187.5, 145.8, 117.2, 96.9. Revenues, overall and per firm, are half as large for the firms targeting
the minority. Given fixed costs of 100, the majority gets four products, while the minority gets
one.

   More products targeting one group does not indicate bias, however, because a planner who
cares equally about groups would still choose to offer fewer products to the preference minority.
Instead, possible bias manifests itself as inter-group differences in costs per incremental consumer.
The marginal entering product serving the majority draws 31 individuals to consumption (469-
438), while the marginal entrant serving the minority draws 125. Thus, the market entry process
- our fictitious planner - incurs the same incremental fixed cost to serve an additional 31 members
of the majority as it spends to serve an additional 125 members of the minority; and the planner
rejects a reallocation that would serve 62.5 additional members of the preference minority at the
cost of 31 majority listeners. Hence, the planner must attach a higher weight to majority than
minority consumption.
   We should emphasize that the foregoing example merely illustrates a possibility, albeit a
plausible one. An appendix, below, demonstrates that the result is reasonably general when
preferences are distinct in the sense that each group consumes only its own product (and when
the taste for own-variety is the same across groups). A key point is that just as nothing about
market entry in the presence of fixed costs guarantees an efficient number of products (Mankiw
and Whintson, 1984), no force compels equalization of the planner’s welfare weights for different
groups of consumers in the presence of fixed costs and heterogeneous consumers. The appendix
also shows simple conditions under which distinct preferences lead to implicit welfare weights
that favor the preference majority.
   The argument becomes more theoretically complicated when preferences are not perfectly
distinct, so that (for example) members of the preference majority prefer their own product, but
will also consume some of the product aimed at the preference minority. This is the more general,
and most common, case. We refer below to the importing and exporting of group consumption
across differently targeted products and show how it is reflected in implicit welfare weights. In
general, empirical analysis is required to determine the sign, as well as the magnitude, of any
bias toward the preference minority. Cross-group differences in prices and costs provide further
nuance to the analysis (again, see the appendix), reinforcing the need for empirical analysis.
   While effects of this type can operate whenever preferences differ across groups, their detection
requires not only data on entry and consumption by group but also observations on multiple
markets. Moreover, we require variation in relative group size across market areas. Such variation
is not always readily available: while preferences for some products vary sharply across age or
gender, there is often little variation across geographic markets in age and, especially, gender
distributions.
   We use the radio broadcast market - and listening patterns by race and Hispanic status - as
our empirical context, for three reasons. First, fixed costs are important in this market. Indeed,
all costs are fixed. Second, as Waldfogel (2003) documents, preferences differ sharply between
groups of consumers. Blacks and whites - and Hispanics and non-Hispanics - listen largely to


                                                 2
stations offering different programming formats. Third, terrestrial radio markets are local, and
the share of population that is black or Hispanic varies substantially across US metropolitan
areas. These features together give rise to strategies for measuring implicit planner weights on
different types of consumers revealed by radio listening and market entry patterns.
   Documenting the well-being that markets deliver to different groups of market participants
has a long history in some areas of economics. A large volume of research in labor economics
seeks to measure disparate outcomes in labor markets by race, gender, and other characteristics
and, moreover, whether these disparate outcomes are motivated by animus or other causes.
Other work documents differential patterns of residential location, criminal sentencing, health
status, and other outcomes by group status.2 This work is a first attempt to quantify potentially
differential impacts on well-being operating through product markets. We should note that the
mechanism posited here is not animus but rather simply the way that differentiated product
markets function in the presence of high fixed costs and heterogeneous preferences.
   Literature. This work is closely related to both the empirical work documenting preference
externalities and the structural entry literature. A series of papers on preference externalities
provides descriptive evidence about the operation of differentiated products markets where con-
sumers have heterogeneous preferences, and fixed costs are substantial.3 For example, Waldfogel
(2003) documents that blacks and whites - and Hispanics - have sharply different preferences in
radio programming. Because of fixed costs, groups face more products in markets with more
consumers sharing their preferences. As a result, individuals derive more satisfaction in markets
where they are more numerous. Blacks and Hispanics listen to radio more in markets with larger
black and Hispanic population shares, respectively.
   The empirical entry literature is vast.4 Most relevant to our exercise is Berry and Waldfogel
(1999), which uses data on the number of products available, along with detailed information on
prices and quantities to estimate demand and, by extension, fixed costs. Using these estimates,
they estimate the extent of excessive entry in US radio broadcasting in 1993. They find that free
entry produces three times the number of stations that would be socially optimal for the purpose
of producing advertising. They also point out that the observed entry pattern can be rationalized
as socially optimal by a sufficiently high benefit of programming to users. Said another way, the
model reveals the welfare weight that the hypothetical social planner implicitly attaches to the
listeners at the marginal station. Formally, the current exercise extends this analysis to two types
of products along with two types of listeners which, in turn, allows us to infer welfare weights

     Bresnahan and Reiss (1990) and Berry (1992) use data on the number of firms/products per market to draw inferences
about post-entry competition. Mazzeo (2002) extends the framework to differentiated products, again relying only on
information on the number of products to draw inferences about post-entry competition.

specific to each group. Our strategy for estimating fixed costs in the presence of heterogeneous
stations follows Berry, Eizenberg and Waldfogel (2013) who study the optimality of product
variety in radio markets from the point of view of a social planner who places equal weights on
the welfare of stations and advertisers.
   The paper proceeds in 4 sections. Section 2 presents a theoretical model linking the welfare
weights that the planner attaches to various consumer groups to observable data. Section 3
describes the data used in the study. Section 4 presents estimates of a structural model of
listening which, in turn, allow estimates of fixed costs. Section 5 employs the model for three
tasks. First, we compare marginal entry conditions by race and Hispanic status, finding that
marginal entry adds more minority listeners per dollar of fixed cost. This points to a bias against
minority listeners. Second, we directly estimate the welfare weights that free entry implicitly
attaches to black vs. white, and Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic, listeners. With listening demand
estimates allowing for reasonable substitution patterns (i.e. nested logit), we find that the planner
attaches 2-3 times higher weight to white vs black listeners and 1.5-2 higher weights for non-
Hispanic relative to Hispanic listeners. These disparities in treatment are substantial compared
with economic disparities by group attracting the attention of researchers and policy makers in
other areas of economics. Third, we show that the difference between the black and Hispanic
results arises from differences in the structure of preferences.


2       Model

The goal of this paper is to estimate a model of entry with two types of products and two types
of consumers and to infer the value that - through free entry - the planner implicitly attaches
to the two consumer types. To this end we estimate models of demand that the two types
of consumers have for two groups of products. Given an equilibrium condition, these models
allow us to estimate fixed costs for the two groups of products. Our estimates of fixed costs in
conjunction with demand allow us to infer the planner’s welfare weights.

2.1     Free Entry Equilibrium

There are two types of consumers, a preference minority (which we term blacks) and preference
majority (whites), and there are two types of products, labeled B and W .5 As the targeting
implies, stations aim for their respective groups but also attract listeners from the other group.
We can summarize a market configuration with the pair (NW , NB ), which shows the number of
W-targeted products and the number of B-targeted products in the local market. We assume
that within each type, stations are symmetrically differentiated. Define `W (NW , NB ) as the
    5
     Two comments are immediately in order. First, whites include all non-blacks. Second, despite the notation, the model
will be used for both blacks and whites as well as for Hispanics and non-Hispanics.


                                                           4
per-station listeners to a white-targeted station, and define `B (NW , NB ) analogously. If aW is
the per-listener ad revenue at a white-targeted station, then rW (NW , NB ) = aW `W (NW , NB ) is
per-station revenue at a white-targeted station, with rB (NW , NB ) defined analogously. Finally,
define F CB and F CW as the (exclusively) fixed costs of operating stations of the respective
types.6 Additional entry reduces per-station revenue, both within and across types.
  There is free entry, so a station enters as long as the revenue it expects exceeds its cost.
Equilibrium is achieved when there are no profitable opportunities for entry, and yet every
entering firm is profitable. Thus the equilibrium conditions are


                                rB (NW , NB ) − F CB > 0 > rB (NW , NB + 1) − F CB                                       (1)
                         rW (NW , NB ) − F CW > 0 > rW (NW + 1, NB ) − F CW                                              (2)

  Intuitively, these conditions require that per-station profit be close to zero for both types in
equilibrium. These conditions give rise to the observed configuration (NW , NB ).

2.2    Free Entry as a Solution to the Planner’s Problem

We can also view the problem from a planning perspective. Although there is no planner, we
can use the planning framework in conjunction with free entry to infer the welfare weights that
the hypothetical planner implicitly attaches to different groups.
   First, we allow free entry to determine the number of stations operating and, given the costs
of operating stations, the entire amount of resources to be spent operating stations (K). Then
the planner chooses how many white and black targeted stations (NW and NB ) to operate to
maximize welfare, subject to the constraint that total station operation costs do not exceed K.
That is, the planner maximizes L = W (LB (NB , NW ), LW (NB , NW ))+λ[K −F CB NB −F CW NW ],
where LW = `W NW is the total number of listeners to white-targeted stations, LB is defined
analogously, and λ is a Lagrange multiplier. Ignoring the fact that stations are discrete, the first
two first order conditions for the problem are:


                              ∂L              ∂W ∂LB    ∂W ∂LW
                                 =0⇒                  +         = λF CB , and                                            (3)
                             ∂NB              ∂LB ∂NB ∂LW ∂NB
                              ∂L              ∂W ∂LB    ∂W ∂LW
                                 =0⇒                  +         = λF CW                                                  (4)
                             ∂NW              ∂LB ∂NW   ∂LW ∂NW

  The first of these conditions indicates that the planner chooses a number of black-targeted
stations such that the planner’s welfare weight for black listeners (∂W/∂LB ) times the change in
   6
     Modeling radio stations as having no variable costs follows Berry and Waldfogel (1999) and is justified by the non-rival
and non-excludable nature of the radio signal: there is no marginal cost associated with serving a marginal listener.


                                                             5
black listening with an additional black station (∂LB /∂NB ), plus (∂W/∂LW ) times (∂LW /∂NB )
equals the Lagrange multiplier times the fixed cost of operating a black station. The second
condition is defined analogously. We will develop a way to observe everything but the welfare
derivatives and the Lagrange multiplier below, which will allow us to infer the welfare weights up
to a scalar. That is, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns (plus the Lagrange
multiplier), which we can solve directly for the relative welfare weights attached to the two
groups.
   We can write these first order conditions in matrix notation as Ab = f , where the elements
of A are the change in (white or black) listeners with a one-station increase in the number of
white or black targeted stations, b contains the two welfare derivatives divided by the Lagrange
multiplier, and F contains the fixed costs of operating the two kinds of stations. That is,
                        "               #          "             #               "          #

                            ∂NB   ∂NB                  ∂LB
                                                           /λ                        F CB
                   A=       ∂LB   ∂LW       ,b =        ∂W
                                                                     , and f =
                            ∂NW   ∂NW                  ∂LW
                                                           /λ                        F CW

   We can compute the relative welfare weights b as A−1 f .
   In addition to inferring welfare weights at the existing number of stations, we can solve for
alternative values of NW and NB that correspond to different planning problems. First, we can
maximize total listening subject to the constraint that costs not exceed their current level K.
The resulting maximand is then:

               L = LB (NB , NW ) + LW (NB , NW ) + λ[K − F CB NB − F CW NW ],

  and the first order conditions for this problem are:

                      ∂LB   ∂LW             ∂LB   ∂LW
                          +     = λF CW and     +     = λF CB ,
                      ∂NW   ∂NW             ∂NB   ∂NB
  or, invoking the equal-marginal rule, that
                                    ∂LB         ∂LW        ∂LB       ∂LW
                                    ∂NB
                                            +   ∂NB        ∂NW
                                                                 +   ∂NW
                                                       =
                                        F CB                 F CW

  This has the simple interpretation that if the system is maximizing listening the number of
marginal listeners per dollar is equated across groups of stations.
  Implementing this approach requires us to have estimates of LB (·, ·) and LW (·, ·), F CW , and
F CB , to which we now turn.

3        Data

The data for this study include station-level listening by blacks and non-blacks (whom we term
whites) for all of the commercial radio stations in 127 major US markets in 2005 (and 83 US
markets for Hispanics and non-Hispanics). The listening data are drawn from Aribtron’s Fall
2005 listening survey. Arbitron collects listening data on each station in the US. For markets
with large black populations, they report station-level listening data separately for blacks and
non-blacks. Similarly, for markets with substantial Hispanic populations, Arbitron separately
reports listening data for Hispanics and non-Hispanics.
  The basic listening measure is AQH listening, the share of population listening to a radio
station during an average quarter hour. We treat this as a discrete choice. Because the vast
majority of population (roughly 95 percent) listens to radio at some point, we treat population
as the potential market.
  We observe one important product characteristic, the format of the radio station. We have
two sources of data on formats. BIA classifies each station into one of 20 broad formats (which
they term format categories).7 One of these categories is urban, which we treat, along with jazz
and religious, as black-targeted. Another is Spanish which we treat as Hispanic-targeted. By
tallying stations, we can calculate the number of black- and white-targeted stations - and the
number of Hispanic- and non-Hispanic-targeted stations - in each market. We focus in this study
on the stations broadcasting from inside the metro area. Thus, we treat listening to stations
broadcasting from outside the market as part of the outside good.
  We supplement the listening data with the following information at the market level: black and
white population and the average ad price per listener, which we calculate as the market-level
advertising revenue divided by the number of listeners (from BIA). We have data on black and
white listening and ad prices for 127 markets. These markets average 1.2 million in population
overall, with 0.189 million blacks. On average 9.77 percent of population listens to the radio for
at least 5 minutes during an average quarter hour. Blacks listen more, averaging 10.94 percent
while the white average is 9.37 percent. The annual ad price per AQH listener is $649.8. See
Table 1a.
  We have the analogous data for Hispanics and non-Hispanics for 83 markets, which average
1.5 million in total population, with 0.334 million Hispanics. See Table 1b. These markets have
an average of 30.8 stations overall. Overall listening averages 9.69 percent in these markets.
Hispanic listening is somewhat higher than non-Hispanic listening: 10.76 percent versus 9.18
percent.
  One well-known fact about radio listening (see Waldfogel 2003) is that preferences differ
sharply across groups. As Table 2 shows, the Urban format stations collectively attract 4 percent

of white listening and 55 percent of black listening.8 Two other formats, Religion and Jazz/New
Age have audiences that are over a third black. We treat these three formats as black-targeted;
and based on this designation, there are 7.7 black-targeted stations per market. As Table 3
shows, listening is similarly segregated by Hispanic status. Spanish-language stations attract 53
percent of Hispanic listening but less than a percent of non-Hispanic listening. We treat only
Spanish-language stations as Hispanic-targeted, and the markets with Hispanic listening data
average 4.5 Hispanic-targeted stations.
   The relationship between the number of products available, by type, and the share of various
population groups listening to radio is important for this study, and we document it descriptively
as a step toward building a model. Figures 1a-c show how the share of population listening, overall
and by group, varies with the number of stations N, overall, targeting whites, and targeting
blacks. Figures 2a-c repeat the exercise by Hispanic status. In all figures we see a positive
relationship: markets with more stations attract a higher share of population to listening. The
apparent slope is steeper for black - and Hispanic - listening, meaning that an additional minority-
targeted station raises the share of the minority group listening more than an additional majority-
targeted station raises the share of the majority group listening.


4     Empirical Implementation and Results

To estimate welfare weights we need a model of how black and white listening to black and white
targeted stations vary with the number of black and white stations (the configuration), as well
as the fixed costs of operating each type of station. To estimate these quantities, we need to
develop a listening model that allows us to model how listening to each type of station varies
with the configuration of available stations.

4.1    Listening Model

The utility that consumer i derives from station j is:

                                              uij = xj βi + ξj + ij

   where x includes observable characteristics of station, βi is potentially a person-specific coeffi-
cient, ξj is unobserved quality of the product, and ij is extreme value and iid across consumers
and products. When βi = β, then this results in the logit model. In our context, products have
one observable characteristic, format. For the purpose of entry modeling we will treat stations
as symmetric within format. Individual i is a member of one of two groups (B and W ).
   8
     We verify below that our results are robust to a narrower measure of black stations that includes only the urban
format.



                                                         8
  Here, with the logit model, if there are NB stations in the black format and NW stations in the
white format, the share of group g listening to a particular station in format f may be written:
                                                            g
                                                          e δf
                                       sgf   =            g          g
                                               1 + NB · eδB + NW · eδW
  and the share of group g’s population listening to stations in format f , denoted by a capital
S, is given by
                                                                    g
                                                            Nf · e δ f
                                 Sfg (NB , NW )   =            g          g
                                                    1 + NB · eδB + NW · eδW
  where f = B or W and g = B or W .
  Following Berry (1994), we can estimate the parameters of the logit model by regressing a
station’s mean utility for listeners in a group on a black station type dummy, separately for
black and white listening.

                                         ln(sj ) − ln(s0 ) = xj β + ξj

  where sj is the share of consumers choosing product j, s0 is the share choosing the outside
good, x contains a constant and a black-targeted station dummy, and ξ is the characteristics of
product j not observed by the econometrician. This specification allows groups to have different
preferences for differently-targeted stations, and the results will confirm this. While the logit
model is easy to estimate and implement, it incorporates potentially unrealistic substitution
patterns, which we will give the data the opportunity to reject.
  The nested logit model is a generalization of logit that allows pre-determined groups of products
to have different levels of substitutability within the nest vs outside the nest. Logit allows
each product a different mean utility - and therefore share - but products are otherwise equally
substitutable. The simplest nested structure that makes sense in this context follows Berry and
Waldfogel (1999). All radio stations are in the nest. The outside good (non-listening) is separate.
This model has the following expression for the share of group g’s population listening to each
station in format f :

                                      g                            g                 g          (1−σg )
                                  eδf /(1−σg )                NB eδB /(1−σg ) + NW eδW /(1−σg )
    sgf (NB , NW )   =      g                  g          ·
                       NB eδB /(1−σg ) + NW eδW /(1−σg ) ) 1 + NB eδBg /(1−σg ) + NW eδW
                                                                                       g
                                                                                          /(1−σg ) (1−σg )
                                                                                                  


  Simplifying, the share of group g individuals in the market listening to stations in format f
overall is:

                                                                       δB /(1−σg )       δW
                                                                                                     
                     NB e             + NW e                 1 + NB e               + NW e

   The parameter σg describes the substitutability among products in the radio station nest. If
σg = 0, then this model reverts to the plain logit. in this case, each station adds substantial
variety and attracts additional consumers to the market. Higher values of σg reflect greater
substitutability among stations. If σg = 1, then additional stations add nothing to the value of
offerings to consumers.
   Again following Berry (1994) and Berry and Waldfogel (1999), we can estimate this model
with the regression:

                              ln(sgj ) − ln(sg0 ) = δjg + σg ln sgj /(1 − sg0 ) + ξj .
                                                                               

   That is, we regress the log share of the product less the log share of the outside good on a
dummy for format as well as the product’s share of inside products. The latter term is endogenous
and requires an instrument. Because the term is essentially the reciprocal of the number of
products, measures of market size (black and white population) provide natural instruments.
We estimate the equation separately by group. Thus, as with logit, we allow blacks and whites
to have different preferences for black and white targeted stations. We also allow blacks and
whites to view stations as differently substitutable for one another.
   Table 4 reports results. The first two columns report simple logit estimates, showing that
blacks prefer black stations, and whites prefer white stations. Columns (3)-(6) report nested-logit
estimates following the single-level nesting specification described above. The σg parameters are
significant - and closer to 1 than 0 - rejecting the logit model and indicating strong substitutability
of stations. The σg parameter is higher for whites than blacks, indicating that whites view
radio stations as closer substitutes for one another than do blacks. Table 5 presents first-stage
regressions, in columns (3) and (6). The endogenous variable, which is the station’s share of
group listening, is lower as the group is larger, as expected. Markets with more people have
more stations and lower listening shares for each station. Own-race relationships are especially
strong. Columns (5)-(6) in Table 4 report IV estimates from the one-level nest model. Apparent
substitutability is higher in OLS than in IV estimates.
   We also explore a model with nests at two levels. First, consumers choose whether to listen
to radio. If they listen to radio, they make a second choice of whether to listen to black or white
targeted radio stations. This is analogous to the model Verboven (1996) employs to analyze
automobile choices in European markets. This model has two substitution parameters, one that
reflects the substitutability of stations within each group (σ1 ) and a second that reflects the

                                                        10
substitutability of the nests for one another (σ2 ). As before, we can estimate these parameters
and the differential mean utility by station format separately for each group, via the following
estimating equation:

                                                                              
                  ln(sj ) − ln(s0 ) = xj β + σ1 ln sj /sf + σ2 ln sf /(1 − s0 ) + ξj

   This regression has two endogenous terms. The first term is the station’s listening as a share
of listening to the stations in the format f (black or white). The second share on the right-hand
side is the format’s share of total listening (e.g. all black station listening as a share of total
listening). The two shares on the right hand side are endogenous, and we instrument them
using measures of the size and composition of the population (white and black population). The
model with one nest is a special case of the model with 2 levels, with σ1 = σ2 . Columns (7)-
(10) of Table 4 report estimates from these two-level nested logit models. Using OLS, the two
substitution terms are quite similar for white listeners, while the second term is lower for blacks
(indicating that stations are better substitutes within than across formats). In the IV estimates,
the substitutability across formats falls substantially for whites.
   Tables 6 and 7 re-estimate these models using Hispanics and non-Hispanics rather than blacks
and whites. Many patterns are similar. We reject the simple logit. Instrumental variables
estimates of the one-level model indicate less substitutability of stations than OLS estimates.
The two-level model yields IV estimates for some correlation coefficients (σ) that exceed the
value 1, implying a rejection of the model as these coefficients are restricted to lie in the [0, 1)
interval. We therefore rely on the 1-level IV model in the remainder of our analysis.

4.2    Station Fixed Costs

We assume that there is free entry, and we assume that the configuration we observe is a Nash
equilibrium. Recall that rB (NB , NW ) = aB `B (NB , NW ) is the revenue per black-targeted station,
with an analogous term defined for white-targeted stations. Then, following Berry, Eizenberg
and Waldfgoel (2013), we can infer bounds on fixed costs from the equilibrium conditions


      rB (NB + 1, NW ) < F CB < rB (NB , NW ) and rW (NB , NW + 1) < F CW < rW (NB , NW ).

   We can estimate revenue with our listening model in conjunction with our estimates of market
size (population of the respective black and white groups P opB and P opW ), along with our data
on the per-listener annual advertising revenue.
   Implementing this requires estimates of the ad prices at minority and majority-targeted sta-
tions (aW and aB ). Unfortunately, we do not have access to ad prices at the station level (only
at the market level). There is some reason to think that ad revenue per listener differs between

                                                 11
minority and majority-targeted stations. For example, in a study commissioned for the FCC,
Ofori (1999) presents evidence that minority-targeted stations generated less revenue per listener
than white-targeted stations. Napoli (2002) shows that power ratios (estimates of station revenue
per listener) were about 25 percent lower for minority-targeted stations.
   Given this finding, one approach would be to constrain the ad price to be 25 percent lower
at minority-targeted stations relative to majority-targeted stations. Yet, a problem with this
approach is that it does not allow the price per listener to vary with the group mix listening
at the stations. This is a problem because minorities listen to majority-targeted radio stations
when minority-targeted options are absent. If we assume that majority-targeted stations get
higher prices per listener regardless of listener composition, we get the perverse effect that a
first minority-targeted station reduces market ad revenue as minorities shift from the majority-
targeted station where by assumption all listeners receive a high price per listener to minority-
targeted station where listeners receive low prices.
   A natural solution to this problem is to price listeners, rather than stations, by type. We can
infer prices per listener type from Napoli’s estimate that average prices per listener are 25 percent
lower at minority-targeted stations. Define bB as the black share of listeners to black-targeted
stations, and define bW as the black share of listeners at white-targeted stations. Then if the
prices of black and white listeners are pB and pW , respectively, then the price per listener at a
black-targeted station is pW (1 − bB ) + pB bB . The price per listener at a white-targeted stations
is analogously defined as pW (1 − bW ) + pB bW . Finally, define pB = φpW . Then Napoli’s estimate
implies that (1 − bB ) + φbB = .75[(1 − bW ) + φbW ]. The b terms are available as data (see Tables
2 and 3), so we can solve for φ directly. We find that φ = 0.635 for blacks relative to whites
and φ = 0.708 for Hispanics relative to Hispanics. We observe an average ad price per listener
in each market (a), which we can express as a = pW (1 − b) + φpW b. Thus, pW = a/[1 − b + bφ],
and pB = φpW . We estimate our models in two ways. First, we estimate the models with equal
prices per listener across groups (φ = 1). Second, we estimate the models with φ = 0.65.
   Our revenue model, along with some of the conditions for Nash equilibrium, gives us bounds
on fixed costs. For markets with at least one station of each type, we observe both lower and
upper bounds on fixed costs. There is one complication: a few markets (two in the black sample
and eleven in the Hispanic sample) lack a station in the minority-targeted format. Hence, for
those markets we have only a lower-bound for fixed costs.
   One approach to inferring fixed costs is to make a distributional assumption, then to estimate
via maximum likelihood. This approach works when the model has a unique equilibrium station
configuration so that any particular fixed cost pair gives rise to a particular observed number of
stations. In our context we cannot rule out multiple equilibria, so we adopt a different approach
to estimating fixed costs.
   Following Berry, Eizenberg, and Waldfogel (2013), we estimate fixed costs from the bounds


                                                 12
directly. In our context the upper and lower bounds on per-station fixed costs turn out to be
close, on average within 5 percent. Even so, we have to decide, within the bounds, what values
of fixed costs to use. We make a set of decisions that are designed to work against a finding
of bias again blacks and Hispanics. First, we estimate minority fixed costs based on the upper
bound of costs, while we estimate non-minority fixed costs based on the lower bound. Given
the structure of the model this will tend to place higher weights on minority listeners, all things
equal. Next, we have to deal with the markets without minority stations. There are 2 for the
race model and 11 for the Hispanic status model. These numbers are small enough that they
will not much influence our overall results. In these cases, we set minority fixed costs equal to
the estimated non-minority fixed costs.
   Table 8 reports averages of the estimated bounds on fixed costs over markets (recalling that up-
per bounds are used for minority-targeted stations, and that lower bounds are used for majority-
targeted stations). When we assume equal per-listener ad prices across groups, the OLS (IV)
estimates indicate that per-station fixed costs are roughly $2.2 ($2.1) million per year for white
stations and $2.0 ($1.6) million for black stations (noting that the OLS/IV definition applies
to the estimates of the listening equation reported in Tables 4 and 6 above). When we allow
for group-specific prices, we find slightly lower fixed costs for black stations of $1.5 to $1.8 mil-
lion. Patterns are quite similar for non-Hispanic vs Hispanic stations: roughly $2.5 million for
non-Hispanic stations and $1.5 million for Hispanic-targeted stations.


5     Using the Model

5.1   Does the Equimarginal Rule Hold?

Before turning to welfare weights, we first ask whether the current station configurations obey
the equimarginal rule. In particular we can ask how the change in total listening with the dollars
spent on additional majority-targeted station compares
                                                    with the analogousfigure for minority-
                                                                                          
                                          ∂LB       ∂LW                          ∂LB       ∂LW
targeted stations. That is, how does      ∂NW
                                                +   ∂NW
                                                          /F CW compare with     ∂NB
                                                                                       +   ∂NB
                                                                                                 /F CB
across markets? To this end, we calculate the average of the log ratio, for blacks/whites and
Hispanics/non-Hispanics. These log ratios average 0.33 (standard error=0.008) and 0.32 (.035),
respectively. That is, the number of additional listeners generated by a dollar spent on the
marginal minority-targeted station exceeds the number of additional listeners generated by a
dollar spent on the marginal majority-targeted station. This suggests that the planner attaches
higher welfare weights to majority listeners.




                                                    13
5.2   Welfare Weights

Using the empirical estimates of the model, we can of course calculate welfare weights directly.
Tables 9 and 10 present estimates of black and white listener welfare weights from each of the
models. With equal ad prices the nested logit OLS model with one nest (inside goods) yields a
white welfare weight that is 2 times the black weight. Using the IV estimates, the white weight
is 1.56 times the black weight. When we allow for different ad prices across groups, the white
weight is roughly three times the black weight using OLS and over twice the black weight using
IV.
   The welfare weights - and measures comparing groups’ - are random variables. Performing
hypothesis tests requires measure of their standard errors, which we calculate by bootstrapping.
We perform 100 replications (sampling metropolitan areas with replacement), using the resulting
coefficients to calculate the welfare weights in each market. We can compare welfare weights in
multiple ways. If we define, for example, βB as the weight attached to black listeners in a
metro area and β B as the average of the welfare weights across markets, then some methods for
comparing welfare weights across groups include: β W /β B , β W − β B , and βW /βB . The standard
errors show that all of the bias measures from the different-price model are statistically significant.
   Table 10 compares non-Hispanic and Hispanic welfare weights. Using equal prices we see rela-
tively little evidence of differential welfare weights across groups. Neither of the ratios β N H /β H
nor βN H /βH is significantly different from 1, nor are the differences β N H −β H different from zero.
With different ad prices across groups, however, the non-Hispanic weight is 1.5 to 2 times the
Hispanic weight (and statistically significantly different from 1), and the difference in the weights
is statistically significantly positive. We conclude that entry patterns reveal biases against mi-
nority consumers, particularly for blacks relative to whites and less so for Hispanics relative to
non-Hispanics. We note here that we also estimated the black-white model with a narrower set
of black targeted stations (including only urban). All substantive results were similar.

5.3   Exploring the Difference between the Black and Hispanic Results

.
   One aspect of the results is rather puzzling: why does entry in this market give rise to a
smaller relative weight for blacks (relative to whites) than to Hispanics relative to non-Hispanics?
Both groups are of similar relative size, and both groups attract similar amounts of entry. One
possibility is sample composition. The 83 sample markets with Hispanic data are, on average,
larger than the 127 markets in the black sample; and the Hispanic shares average 30 percent,
compared with only 20 percent for blacks in the other sample (see Tables 1a and 1b). Yet, results
for blacks do not change when we restrict attention to the markets whose average black share
matches the average Hispanic share in the Hispanic sample.


                                                  14
   While the preferences differences - between blacks and whites and between Hispanics and
non-Hispanics - are similar in that both minorities have preferences that differ sharply from their
majority complements, there are some important differences. Table 2 shows how black and white
radio listening is divided among black and white-targeted stations (summarized in the last two
rows above the total row). Table 3 shows the analogous distribution for Hispanics and non-
Hispanic listening to Hispanic-targeted and non-Hispanic-targeted stations. A few interesting
differences emerge from this comparison.
   First, consider “exporting” by the respective minority groups, the extent of majority listening
to minority stations: whites listen to black stations, but non-Hispanics do not listen to Hispanic
(Spanish-language) stations. About ten percent of white listening is to black-targeted stations,
while virtually no non-Hispanics listen to Hispanic stations. Second, consider “importing” by
minority groups. Here, Hispanics listen to non-Hispanic stations far more than blacks listen to
white stations. Roughly half of Hispanic listening is to non-Hispanic targeted stations, while
only a quarter of black listening is to white-targeted stations.
   Welfare weights are functions of the matrix of partial derivatives of listening with respect to
entry, as well as station fixed costs. Average listening partials based on the 1-nest IV models
are shown in table 11a and b. As with the raw data, whites listen to black stations more than
non-Hispanics listen to Hispanic stations; and Hispanics listen to non-Hispanic stations more
than blacks listen to white stations.
   These patterns affect calculation of the welfare
                                                 weights directly.With two groups, i and j, the

welfare weight for group i is given by: βi =   ∆   ∂Nj
                                                       F Ci    − ∂Nji F Cj , where ∆ is the determinant
of the matrix A:

                                          ∂Li ∂Lj   ∂Li ∂Lj

  The relative welfare weight (e.g black relative to white) is therefore given by
                                            ∂Lj             ∂Lj

                                                F Cj    −   ∂Nj
                                                                F Ci
  Assuming, as is plausible, that both numerator and denominator are positive, it is easy to see
                         ∂Li                                    ∂L
that βi /βj is higher as ∂N j
                              is higher; and βi /βj is lower as ∂Nji is higher.
  If we treat i as the minority and j as the complementary majority, then βi /βj is more favorable
                     ∂Li                   ∂L
to the minority as ∂N  j
                         is higher and as ∂Nji is lower. That is, the ratio is more favorable to the
minority group, the more that minorities import (majority entry promotes minority listening)
and the less that minorities export (minority entry promotes majority listening). This is intuitive.
Suppose the minority group did not export at all, meaning that the majority did not enjoy the
programming targeted at the minority. Then whatever level of entry targeting the minority would

                                                   15
arise simply because of the planner’s weight on the minority group. If the majority also liked the
programming, then we would rationalize the same level of minority-targeted programming with
a smaller minority weight. Hence, for any entry configuration, a greater exporting by a group is
consistent with a lower welfare weight on that group.
   When we compare blacks and Hispanics, we see two patterns in the data (and model analogues
           ∂Li                                                 ∂L
of data): ∂N  j
                 is higher for Hispanics than for blacks; and ∂Nji is lower for Hispanics than for
blacks. These differences work together to make βi /βj more favorable for Hispanics (relative to
non-Hispanics) than for blacks (relative to whites).
   How much of the difference between βB /βW and βH /βN H do these differences in preference
patterns explain? We can calculate βB /βW using the average values of the cross partials for
blacks/whites in Table 11a, along with the different-price fixed costs from Table 8 ($2.12 million
for whites, $1.49 million for blacks). The baseline ratio is 0.47, indicating that the market
attaches half the welfare weight to blacks that it attaches to whites. When we use the Hispanic
         ∂Li
value of ∂N j
               (177 rather than 104), the ratio rises to 0.58. When we instead use the Hispanic
        ∂L                                  ∂Li
value of ∂Nji (68 rather than 216), holding ∂N j
                                                 at its baseline value, the ratio is 1.06. When we use
Hispanic values for both cross partials, the ratio is 1.32. The cross partials clearly exert a large
impact on the inferred welfare weights. Changing both cross partials changes the result from a
2:1 preference in favor of whites over blacks to 30 percent preference for blacks over whites.
  These results show that, while entry in radio broadcasting implicitly favors whites over blacks,
the magnitude of the finding arises from a specific pattern of preferences that is absent, for
example, for Hispanics vs non-Hispanics.


6    Conclusion

We have shown that with heterogeneous consumers, free entry in markets with fixed costs and
imperfect substitutes can reveal substantially different implicit valuations of different types of
consumers. Free entry results in station configurations that reflect a planner’s implicit valuation
of white listeners that is two to three times of the planner’s valuation of a black listener, on
a per-listener basis; and the non-Hispanic-Hispanic differential is 1.5 to two. The difference
between the black and Hispanic results arises from different preference patterns, that relative to
Hispanics, blacks export more and import less. The resulting differences in welfare weights are
substantial racial disparities, in relation to disparities such as the wage differential, that occupy
the attention of policy makers and researchers. Beyond these specific results, this study points
to differentiated product markets as contexts where free entry can, contrary to the conventional
understanding, give rise to disparate treatment of preference minorities. More research is needed
to determine whether this a widespread phenomenon or a feature specific to particular groups of
consumers in this industry.

A     More General Conditions for Bias

Here we extend the numeric example of the introduction to show that, in the absence of “im-
porting and exporting” of demand across groups of products, the market’s implicit social planner
favors the larger group. In particular, in a model that generalizes the example, we show that
the implicit welfare weight equals price times a measure of the degree of business stealing. Since
business stealing naturally increases in N , this implies that the planner favors the larger group,
or at least the group that receives the greater degree of variety as measured by Ni .
   We assume that the product-share functions are the same across groups, so that differences
in the “taste for variety” do not drive results. Fixed costs can differ across groups, however.
Differences in prices will only overturn the result if equilibrium prices are higher for the minority
group.
   Consider a model with 2 groups that have distinct mutually exclusive preferences: group i only
buys product type i. There are Ni varieties of product i and we follow Mankiw and Whinston
(1986) in treating the equilibrium quantities and prices as functions of Ni . Each product sells
for an equilibrium price pi (Ni ). Because of competition, price may (or may not) decline in the
number of products. The population size is Mi , of which a share Si (Ni ) buys one of the symmetric
products, so that each product has share si (Ni ) = SiN(Ni i ) . We begin by assuming that the only
costs are fixed costs, Fi , and then introduce variable costs later. As is natural, we assume that
S(Ni ) is increasing in Ni while product share s(Ni ) is decreasing in Ni .

The degree of business stealing    The market share of a firm entering into an Ni product equi-
librium can be decomposed as the sum of a “business expansion” effect and a “business stealing”
effect. That is, as we move from a Ni − 1 product equilibrium to a Ni product equilibrium, the
share of the “new” product is the sum of increase in total market share plus the decrease in the
market share of the “old” products:9
                                                                               
                     s(Ni ) = [S(Ni ) − S(Ni − 1)] + (Ni − 1) s(Ni − 1) − s(Ni )                                    (5)

Clearly, the first term in brackets is business expansion: the increase in total output. The second
term is business stealing; it is the absolute value of the decline in the production of the “existing”
Ni − 1 firms when the Ni -th firm enters. We define the “degree” of business expansion as being
the fraction of the new product share that comes from increased total output:

                                                S(Ni ) − S(Ni − 1)
                                                                   .                                                (6)
                                                       s(Ni )
   9
     Note that S(Ni ) = s(Ni ) + (Ni − 1)s(Ni ) and S(Ni − 1) = (Ni − 1)s(Ni − 1) so that S(Ni ) − S(Ni − 1) = s(Ni ) −
(Ni − 1) s(Ni − 1) − s(Ni ) . Solving for s(Ni ) gives (5)




                                                          19
This fraction varies between zero and one; zero is no business expansion (complete business
stealing) and one no business stealing.
   We assume a decreasing degree of business expansion: the fraction in (6) is strictly decreasing
in Ni . This is easy to verify for standard functional forms like the logit and is consistent with a
decreasing marginal taste for variety.
   In what follows it is useful to define the inverse of this fraction as the “degree of business
stealing”:
                                                s(Ni )
                                                            .
                                         S(Ni ) − S(Ni − 1)
This is the ratio of the share of the “new” product to the total market expansion caused by the
move from Ni − 1 to Ni products; it varies between one and infinity, with infinity being perfect
business stealing. Ignoring the discreteness in Ni , we can also define the degree of business
stealing as
                                              s(Ni )
                                                      .                                      (7)
                                          ∂S(Ni )/∂Ni
Following the assumption of decreasing business expansion, the degree of business stealing, as
measured by (7) is increasing in Ni .

Free entry equilibrium         In a free entry equilibrium, ignoring the discreteness of Ni , the free
entry number of firms,   Nie   satisfies

                                       Mi pi (Nie )si (Nie ) − Fi = 0,

or
                                                                  Fi
                                           pi (Nie )si (Nie ) =      .                            (8)
                                                                  Mi
This just says that per-capita revenue equals per-capita fixed costs.

Planner’s Problem     We can compare this to the case where a social planner cares about the
                                                                                  
consumption of group i, Qi (N ) = Mi S(Ni ), according to the function Wi Qi (Ni ) . The social
planner solves the problem
                                                          
                                max Wi Mi Si (Ni ) − Ni Fi .
                                      Ni

Again ignoring discreteness, the social planner’s first order condition is

                                                ∂Wi ∂Si
                                           Mi           − Fi = 0,
                                                ∂Qi ∂Ni
or
                                                ∂Wi ∂Si   Fi
                                                        =    .
                                                ∂Qi ∂Ni   Mi

                                                      20
Plugging in from the free entry condition (8) at the observed Ni = Nie

                                             ∂Wi ∂Si
                                                     = pi (Ni )si (Ni ),
                                             ∂Qi ∂Ni
or
                                              ∂Wi             si (Ni )
                                                  = pi (Ni )           .                                             (9)
                                              ∂Qi            ∂Si /∂Ni
This says that the implied social welfare weight is equal to price times the degree of business
stealing. With no business stealing, the right hand side equals price, implying that the planner
places the “correct” marginal weight of pi on the good.10
    Since we assume that the degree of business stealing is increasing in Ni , if prices and fixed
costs are equal, then we know that whichever group has the larger population (and therefore the
larger Ni ) is implicitly favored by the social planner. As noted in the text, this implies that,
holding total costs constant, total consumption, Q1 + Q2 , could be higher. If fixed costs are
different, then we still know that the social planner favors the group that receives more variety.
Differences in prices can only potentially overturn that result if prices are higher for the group
with less variety.
    Note that the result does not apply to the empirical model of the paper, with shares given by
si (Ni , Nj ), because the tastes are not equal and exclusive. Therefore, empirical work is necessary
to establish any result for the real industry.

Extension to Variable Cost       Consider the case where costs depend on product output, qi (Ni ) =
Mi s(Ni ). In this case the social welfare problem is
                                                                       
                                   max Wi Mi Si (Ni ) − Ni Ci (Mi s(Ni )) .
                                     Ni


The first-order condition is
                                          ∂Wi ∂Si                       ∂si
                                    Mi            = Ci + Ni mci (qi )Mi     .
                                          ∂Qi ∂Ni                       ∂Ni
  10
   This is correct only in the traditional case, unlike radio, where there are no consumption externalities. In radio, it
would make sense for the social planner to place weight on the unpriced value of listening.




                                                           21
This implies that the planner’s marginal value, in excess of marginal cost, is equal to markup
times the degree of business stealing:

The first line divides the first order condition by Mi and the second line substitutes in from the
free-entry equilibrium condition pi Mi si = Ci , implying Ci /Mi = pi si . The third line uses the
fact that
                                    ∂Si    ∂(Ni si )      ∂si
                                         =           = Ni     + si .
                                    ∂Ni      ∂Ni          ∂Ni
The math here is quite similar to the math in Mankiw and Whinston’s (1986) analysis of business
stealing, except that they set the planner’s marginal value to the “correct” level of p and derive
the result that entry is excessive, whereas we solve for the marginal planner’s value that justifies
the observed outcome.
   The result in (10) shows, again, that the implicit planner values the group receiving more
variety, at least if pi and mci are the same for both groups.
