              Inflation, Tax Rules and the Stock Market




                                 ABSTRACT



     This paper shows how the interaction of tax rules and

expected inflation can decrease substantially the share price

per dollar of pretax earnings.   The current analysis extends my

earlier study (NBER Working PaperNo. 276) by recognizing

corporate debt, retained earnings, and the role of diverse share-

holder investments.   As before, the analysis separates household

and institutional investors.

      The substantial fall in the real level of share prices during .

the past decade has raised the cost of capital to firms and
                                                                 l
reduced their incentive to invest in new plant and equipment.

In a previous paper (Feldstein, 1978a), I explained how existing

tax rules make the share prices of nonfinancial corporations

sensitive to changes in the expected rate of inflation.     An

increase in the expected rate of inflation lowers the level of

share prices immediately while continued inflation at any expected

rate causes share prices to rise continually to maintain their

real value.

     A significant feature of that paper was the explicit recog-

nition of two classes of portfolio investors:     "households" that

pay an income tax on dividends and interest and a capital gains

     IThe cost of equity capital is an important component of the
overall cost of capital if firms consider the repurchase of shares
as an alternative to investment in new capacity (Tobin and
Brainard, 1977) or if the £irms' debt-equity ratios influence
the cost of additional funds (Feldstein, Green and Sheshinski,
1979).

tax on nominal capital gains, and "institutions"     (pension funds,

nonprofit organizations, etc.) that pay no tax on portfolio

income or capital gains.   Both types of investors hold equity

shares despite the difference between them in the relative after-

tax yields on stocks and bonds because of their desire to limit
                                          l
risk through portfolio diversification.       In the simplified

framework of the earlier paper, a rise in the expected rate of

inflation unambiguously depresses the price per share that insti-

tutional investors are willing to pay but may raise the demand

price that household investors are willing to pay.     The change

in the equilibrium share price that follows an increase in expec-

ted inflation depends on the portfolio adjustment behavior of

these two types of investors.

     Although the earlier analysis conveys the basic idea of how

inflation affects share prices, it must be extended to provide a

more realistic picture of the interaction of inflation and share

prices.   The present paper introduces three important aspects to

the model of equilibrium share price behavior.     First, the new

analysis recognizes that firms borrow and that the existence of

debt causes inflation to raise the firms' real after-tax earnings

available for equity owners.    Second, in contrast to the



     lMore formally, both types of investors will generally maxi-
mize expected utility by holding mixed portfolios even though, in
the absence of risk aversion, the difference in the relative
after-tax expected yields on stocks and bonds would cause one
type of investor to hold only one type of asset. See also
Feldstein and Slemrod (1978) and Feldstein and Green (1979).
                                3



assumption in the previous paper that firms distribute all   earn~

ings as dividends, the present analysis assumes a realistic ratio
of retained earnings to dividends.   The effect of this is to
magnify the impact on share prices of changes in inflation or
other variables.   Finally, the present analysis recognizes that
households invest in a much wider range of assets than stocks
and bonds including real estate, consumer durables, noncorporate
businesses, depletable natural resources, and such "store-of-
value" assets as land, gold and antiques; some of these invest-
ment opportunities actually become more attractive when the rate
of inflation increases. l Households may also respond to lower
prospective yields on stocks and bonds by increasing consumption.
The households' broad range of alternatives to investment in
equities implies in general that their opportunity cost of
holding shares does not vary in the same way as that of institu-
tions and, in particular, that it does not vary only with the
real net yield on bonds.   This broader set of alternatives is
recognized in the current analysis by explicitly relaxing (but
not completely eliminating) the previous link between the real
net yield on bonds and the required yield on equities.
     With these extensions, the current analysis identifies six
ways in which the interaction of inflation and tax rules affects
share prices;   (1) Historic cost accounting for depreciation and



     lThe interaction of inflation and tax rules affect the net
yield on these assets very differently from the way they effect
either stocks or bonds; see Feldstein (1978b) on land and gold
and Hendershott (1979) on housing.
                                          4




~sting        methods of inventory accounting raise corporate taxes.

 (2)   The deduction of nominal interest payments lowers corporate
          1
 taxes.        (3)   The net increase in corporate tax payments reduces

dividends and retained earnings, thus lowering tax payments by

 shareholders.        (4)   The nominal increase in the value of the

 corporation's capital stock induces a capital gains tax liability

 for shareholders.          (5)    Because households pay tax on nominal

 interest income, inflation lowers the real net yield on bonds as

an alternative to share ownership.2             (6)   The favorable tax rules

 for investment in land, gold, owner-occupied housing, etc. imply

that the real net opportunity cost of shareholding does not fall

as much as the real net yield on bonds and may actually rise.

 In considering these interactions of inflation and tax rules, it

 is important to distinguish households and non-taxable institu-

tions and to recognize that share prices represent an equilibrium

 for these two groups.            All of these ideas are developed more

 fully in the present paper.

       Although it is analytically useful to calculate how infla-

tion affects share prices on the assumption that the pretax return



     lIn evaluating the impact of inflation on the total taxes
paid on the capital income of the nonfinancial corporations, it
is important to bear in mind that this reduced corporate tax
liability is almost exactly offset by the increased tax' liability
of the creditors who must pay ta~ on nominal interest receipts (see
Feldstein and Summers, 1979).

      2As I emphasized in Feldstein (1978a), this stands in sharp
contrast to the popular nbtion that share prices are depressed
because of high nominal interest rates.
                                  5



per unit of· capital is unchanged, a fall in the share price per
dollar of corporate capital would in fact reduce the equilibrium
size of the corporate capital stock and thereby raise the pretax
return until the share price per dollar of capital returned to
its initial equilibrium. l The current paper presents some illus-
trative calculations of the magnitude of the fall in the equili-
brium capital stock that would result under certain simplifying
assumptions.
     In the first section of this paper, I analyze an economy in
which shares are owned only by tax exempt institutions.     The more
complex effects of inflation on households' demand for equity shares
are examined in section 2.     The third section examines the market
equilibrium with both types of investors.
     The limitations of the analytic structure should be stressed
at the outset.     The model presented here does not represent a
full general equilibrium picture of the effects of inflation on
share prices.    Some of the values that are treated as fixed para-
meters should be regarded as endogenous variables in a larger
system.   The role and complete consequences of macroeconomic
policy and debt policy remains vague.    The pretax yield on capital
in the noncorporate sector is not explicitly treated as an endo-
genous variable.    The dynamic specification ignores transitional



     lunder certain conditions, the equilibrium share price per
dollar of capital is unity but the presence of taxation may cause
a different value; see Auerbach (1978), Bradford (1979), Feldstein
and Green (1979) and King (1977).

issues and focuses ori steady state values.     I believe that the

model is nevertheless rich enough and realistic enough to     demon~

strate the principal chanels through which the interaction of

inflation and tax rules affects share prices.

     The present paper is not, however, an attempt to explain

the total fall in the real value of share prices.      The behavior

of share prices during the past decade and a half may reflect

not only the interaction of taxes and inflation but also the

cyclical downturn in economic activity and pretax profitability,

the inability of investors to evaluate real corporate earnings

in an inflationary environment, investors' perception of an
                                            l
increased risk in equity investment, etc.       The goal of the

present paper is more modest:   to examine the way in which tax

rules and inflation interact in affecting the share prices of

nonfinancial corporations and to show that the net effect of

inflation is likely to be negative.   This conclusion stands in

sharp contrast to papers in which Fama (1979), Hendershott (1979)

and Modigliani and Cohn (1979) have argued that the interaction

of taxes and inflation has raised share prices above the even

lower levels to which they would otherwise have fallen.

Hendershott (1979), Malkiel (1978), Modigliani and Cohn (1979),
and Summers (forthcoming).

1.   Institutional Investors


     This first section analyzes an economy in which equity

shares are owned only by    ~ax   exempt institutions like pension

funds and nonprofit organizations. l     This provides a simple way

of separating the effect of inflation on corporate taxes from

its effects on the taxes paid by households and shows why it

is important to distinguish the two classes of investors in the

complete analysis.     The analysis here shows that an increase

in the expected rate of inflation unambiguously decreases the

attractiveness of equity shares relative to bonds for this impor-

tant group of investors and would therefore lower the share value

per unit of capital.

     Consider first an economy in which there is no inflation.

Each share of stock represents the ownership claim to a single

unit of capital (i.e., one dollar's worth of capital valued at

its reproduction cost) and to the net earnings that it produces.

The marginal product of capital (net of depreciation), f', is

subject to a corporate income tax at effective rate T ; in the
                                                     l
absence of inflation, this effective rate of tax is less than the

statutory rate (T) because of the combined effect of the      invest~

ment tax credit and accelerated depreciation.      The corporation




     IThese institutions own a significant and growing fraction
of corporate stock, especially of the stock of major pUblicly
traded corporations. Probably because of their exemption from
capital gains taxes, these institutions account for a dispropor-
tionately large share of all transactions in equity shares.
                                  8



borrows b dollars per unit of capital and pays interest at rate

r.    Since these interest payMents are deducted in calculating

corporate income that is taxed at the statutory rate T, the net'

cost of these borrowed funds is (l-T)br.     The net return to equity

investors per unit of capital is therefore    (l-Tl)f' -   (l-T)br.

To avoid the extra notation of two different corporate tax rates,

I shall define the "equivalent pretax return" p to satisfy (l-T)p

=    (l-Pl)f'; i.e., P is the pretax rate of return which, if taxed

at the statutory rate, would yield the same after-tax return as

occurs when the actual pretax return is taxed at the lower "no

inflation" effective tax rate.    The net return to equity investors

per unit of capital in the absence of inflation is thus (l-T) (p-br) .

       What happens to this net return when the inflation rate rises?

For simplicity, the analysis considers an instantaneous and unan-

ticipated increase to TI which is expected to persist £orever.

Under existing U.S. tax law, inflation raises taxable profits

(for any fixed level of real profits) in two ways.     First, the

value of depreciation allowances is based on the original or

"historic" cost of the asset rather than on its current value.

When prices rise, this historic cost method of depreciation causes

the real value of depreciation to fall and the real value of

taxable profits to rise. l   Second, the cost of maintaining



     2 S pecl. f'lC estlmates
                        .     of the magnitude of this effect are
discussed below. For a more general discussion, see Feldstein
Green and Sheshinski (1978) and Feldstein (1979). Hong (1977):
Motley (1969) and Van Horne and Glassmir.e (1971) discuss the
implications of historic cost depreciation for share values in
the context of a model with a single investor whose discount
rate is unchanged by inflation.

approximation that each percentage point of inflation increases
taxable profits per unit of capital by              ~   implies that the existing
treatment of depreciation and inventories reduces net profits by
T~   per unit of capital.
        When there is a positive rate of inflation, the firms' net
interest paYments «l-T)br) overstate the true cost to the equity
owners of the corporations' debt finance.                Against this apparent
interest cost it is        n~cessary     to offset the reduction in the real
value of the corporations' net monetary liabilities.                These net
monetary liabilities per unit of capital are the difference
between the interest-bearing debt (b) and the non-interest-bearing
nominal assets (a) that consist primarily of cash and net accounts
receivable.
        Combining the basic net profits per unit of capital, the
extra tax caused by the existing depreciation and inventory rules,
and the real gain on net monetary liabilities yields the real net
return per unit of capital:

(1.1)        z   =   (l-T) (p-br) -    T~W   + (b-a)w




     1A1though firms in principle have the option of avoiding the
extra tax by using the 1ast-in/first-out (LIFO) method of inventory
accounting, a total of $7 billion in extra taxes were paid in
1977 because firms apparently regarded that as less costly in a
larger sense than switching from FIFO to LIFO.

If q is the share value per unit of equity (i.e., per unit of
capital net of its prorata share of debt), the corporate return
per dollar of equity is e = z/q(l-b).l
         If the corporation paid all of its earnings out to share-
holders in the form of dividends, e would also be the net return
to the institutions that own those shares.  In fact, corporations
distribute a fraction d as dividends and retain the rest. 2 Since
a dollar of retained earnings is worth p, each dollar of corporate
earnings net of the corporate income tax is worth d + (l-d)p
dollars. 3 The real net return to institutional investors per
dollar of equity shares is thus

               n~




where the sUbscript n indicates that this is a net return and the
subscript i indicates that this is the net return for institutional
investors.


     lTO see more easily that this is true, it is useful to think
about the corresponding aggregates. Let K be total capital and
B=bK be the corresponding aggregate debt. The value of the equity
shares are q(K-B) and the total equity earnings are zK. The
corporate equity yield is thus zK/q(K-B) = z/q(l-b).
     21 assume that d (like b) does not change with the rate of
inflation. Although this is done primarily to focus attention on
the more direct effects of inflation, neither ratio has changed
significantly during the past 15 years.
     3If p is less than 1, institutional investors would obviously
prefer to have all income distributed. Because of their different
tax situation, households will generally prefer some retained
earnings even if p is less than 1. The distribution fraction
observed in the economy reflects the firms' balancing of these
conflicting interests. For an explicit model of the determination
of dividend policy, see Feldstein and Green (1979).

A   simple model of share valuation implies that the price that the
investor would be willing to pay per share would make the real
net earnings per dollar of equity equal to the real net return
on bonds, r-TI.        More realistically, investors require a higher
yield on equity investments than they do on the apparently less
risky bonds.  If the risk differential required by institutional
                    l
investors is denoted O.1S , their portfolio equilibrium condition
can be written

(1.3)         e n1. = r - TI + O.
                                1S
                                  •


Using equation 1.2 to substitute for e . in equation 1.3 gives a
                                                 n1
portfolio equilibrium condition that can be solved explicitly for
the share price:

                                dz
(1. 4)       q   =
                     (l-b) (r- TI + O. ) - z (l-d)
                                    1S


         The effect of inflation on the equilibrium share price
depends on the change in the real rate of interest (r- TI ) and the
change in the equity earnings net of corporate income tax (z).
Econometric studies indicate that the nominal interest rate rises
point-for-point with sustained changes in the rate of inflation,



      lThe subscript s refers to the state of the economy and can
temporarily be i9nored. In general,Q' will be an increasing
function of the number of shares that t~e investor holds in equil-
ibrium.. The current assumption that all shares are held by
institutional investors implies that 0is does not depend on the
rate of inflation if we ignore any effect of changes in the con-
stant inflation rate on the perceived riskiness of stocks.

dr/d'IT   = 1. 1   It is important to emphasize that this "Fisherian II feature

of the economy is an empirical regularity and not a theoretical

necessity.          As Feldstein, Green and Sheshinski (1978) emphasize,

the response of the nominal interest rate to inflation in an

economy without government bonds depends on tax rates, deprecia-
                                              2
tion rules and investor behavior.                 The actual behavior of the

interest rate depends also on government debt policy3 and on the

supply of debt by noncorporate borrowers.               The remainder of the

paper assumes that dr/d'IT       =   I, i.e., that the real interest rate

remains constant.

          With a constant real rate of interest, equation 1.5 shows

that inflation lowers the equilibrium share price if dz/d'IT < 0




      IThe conclusion that inflation raises the nominal interest
rate while leaving the real rate unchanged has been supported by
a large number of studies.   See Fisher (1930), Yohe and Karnovsky
 (1969), Feldstein and Eckstein (1970) and, more recently, Fama
 (1975) and Feldstein and Summers (1978).

      2calculations by Feldstein and Summers (1978) show that, with
existing tax rules, the interest rate would rise by slightly more
than the rise in the rate of inflation if the difference in the
real net yields on stocks and bonds for a typical individual
investor is to be maintained.    They found empirically that the
interest rate movement did not maintain this real net yield
difference but satisfied dr/d'IT = 1.

     3Feldstein (1978c) presents an explicit model of equilibrium
growth that shows how different government debt policies can
modify the real rate of interest in a way that is independent of
the rate of inflation.
                                                 13



and raises the equilibrium share price if dz/d1T > O.                    From equation

1.1,


(1. 5)        ~~   = -(l-T)b       -     T~ +   b - a

                   =   T(b... ~) ... a


         Recent values of these parameters imply that dz/d1T is nega-

tive and therefore that inflation would reduce the short-run

equilibrium share price in an economy in which only tax exempt

institutions own shares.                 In 1977, nonfinancial corporations

had a total capital stock of $1,684 billion and owed net interest-

bearing liabilities of $595 billion,l implying that b                    =   0.353.

The net non-int.erest-bearing assets (consisting of cash and net

trade credits) have a value of $133.9 billion, implying that a                        = 0.079.
Since the corporate tax rate in 1977 was T                  =   0.48, these figures

imply that dz/d1T        =   0.090 -      T~.

         While it is difficult to calculate             ~   as precisely as T, b

and z, it is clear that            T~    exceeds 0.09 and therefore that dz/d1T < O.

Recall that     ~1T    is the overstatement of taxable profits per dollar

of capital caused by inflation at rate 1T.                  Feldstein and Summers

(1979) estimate that in 1977 inflation caused an overstatement

of taxable profits, of $54.3 billion of which $39.7 billion was

due to low depreciation and $14.6 was due to artificial inventory



     lThe capital stock, valued at replacement cost in 1977
dollars, is estimated by the Department of Commerce. The net
liabilities are based on information in the Flow of Funds tables.
See Feldstein and Summers (1979) for more details on both numbers.

profits.         Thus in 1977      ~rr   ~   54.3/1684    ~    0.032.      The implied

value of     ~    depends on the rate of inflation that was responsible

for these additional taxable profits.                         For the inventory component

of the overstated profits, the relevant inflation rate is the one

for the concurrent year; for the depreciation component, the

relevant inflation rate is a weighted average of the inflation

rates since the oldest remaining capital was acquired but with

greater weight given to inflation in more recent years.                                The

consumer price index rose 6.8 percent in 1977, an average of 7.2

percent in the preceeding five years, and 4.5 percent and 1.9

percent in the two previous five year periods. 1                           An inflation rate

of 7.0 percent is therefore a reasonable upper bound for the

relevant rate and 5.0 percent is a reasonable lower bound.                                   A

value ofrr       ~    0.06 implies that        ~   ~   0.53 and therefore that

T~   ~   0.256; even at the upper bound of rr                  =   0.07,   ~   =   0.46 and

T~   =   0.22.       Both of these values are clearly above the critical

value of 0.09 required for dz/drr > O.                    In the analysis that follows,

I shall assume         ~   =   0.53, a value that is also implied by an alter-
                                                                                         2
native calculation presented in the appendix to this paper.

         Two more parameter values are required to calculate expli-

citly the effect of inflation on the real rate of return to equity

percent in 1977 and an average of 5.9 percent for the previous
decade, essentially the same as the CPl.

     2The alternative calculation is based on selecting a hypo-
thetical investment 'and seeing how inflation changes the after-tax
internal rate of return with existing tax laws.

capital:            the equivalent pretax rate of return         (p)   and the real

interest rate (r - TI).            For the period from 1948 through 1976,

the cyclically-adjusted rate               of return on capital in the nonfin-

ancial sector averaged 11.2 percent (Feldstein and Summers, 1977);

using this value implies fl            =   0.112.    In the absence of inflation,

the tax rules as of 1977 imply an effective corporate tax rate of
                    1
T       =   0.38.       Since p is defined by (l-T)p     =   (l-Tl)f l , P   =   0.134.
    l
            The real interest rate is estimated most easily for a period

with low and quite stable inflation.                 Between 1960 and 1964, the

annual rates of increase of the consumer price index varied

between 1.0 percent and 1.6 percent with a mean of 1.24 percent.

The interest rate on Baa bonds varied between an annual average

of 5.19 percent in 1960 and 4.83 percent in 1964 with an overall

average of 5.00 percent.             These figures imply a real interest
                                                 2
rate of 3.75 percent for Baa bonds.


     lThis figure is derived in the following way. The total
1977 tax on nonfinancial corporations (T) is equal to the tax on
real capital income (T flK) plus the excess tax caused by infla-
tion (T~TIK) minus the tax reduction associated with the deduction
of interest expenses (TrbK). According to the national income
accounts, the 1977 tax liability of nonfinancial corporations was
$59.0 billion, the net interest payments were rbK = $33.7 billion,
and profits (with -the eapital-consumption and inventory valuation
adjustments) were flK -·rbK = $113.9 billion. Comgining these
with the Feldstein and Summers (1979) estimate of the excess tax
due to inflation (T~TIK = $19,1 billion) and the statutory tax
rate of T = 0.48 implies that the effective corporate rate in the
absence of inflation would be T l = 0.38.

      2Since the Baa rate fell monotonically during the early 1960's
the implied real interest rate might be as low as 3.5 percent.       '
 (The Baa rate of 8.97 percent in 1977 implies an anticipated
inflation rate of approximately 6.25 percent. Since then the
r~se in interest rates implies an increase in anticipated infla-
t1.on to between 7.50 and 7.75 percent. These calculations of
course assume the continuous maintenance of a constant real rate of
interest.)
                                                16


        Combining these parameter estimates implies that the real
rate of return to equity per dollar of capital in the absence of
inflation would be (from equation 1.1);

(1.6)        z = (1 - T)         (p -    br)
               = .52    (.134 - .353 (.0375»
               =   .0628

With a six percent rate of inflation, z falls to:

(1.7)        z = (1 -      T )   (p -    br) -    Tj.lTI   + (b - n) TI
               =   .52(.134 - .353(.0975»                   - .48(.53) (.06)
                                                                  + (.353 - .079).06
               =   .0530

The rate of return at the level of the corporation thus falls by
approximately one percentage point or one-sixth of its pre-infla-
tion value.
        The share price equation (1.5) contains two parameters that
have not yet been evaluated:                   the dividend pay-out rate (d) and
the risk differential (Ois)'                   In 1977, the corporations paid divi.,..
dends equal to 45.3 percent of their real after tax profits; this
payout ratio has varied cyclically but averaged 45.4 percent
during the preceeding 15 year period.                        I shall assume d = 0.45 in
all of the calculations.                The risk differential (Qis) can be calcu-
lated directly from the share price equation 1.4 by imposing the
long-run equilibrium condition that q                      = 1.    Thus 1.4 implies
                                             17

                    =   .0628 _ .0375
                         .647

                    = .0596
Thus stocks yield 9.71 percent in this no-inflation equilibrium
or 5.96 percent more than the yield on bonds.
        It is now possible to calculate the effect of inflation on
the short-run equilibrium share price for this economy in which
all shares are owned by institutional investors.              For a six percent
inflation, equation 1.5 implies that

(1.9)      q    =              zd
                    (I-b) (r-7r + O. ) -     z (I-d)
                                   J.s
                                .45(.0530)
               =
                    (.647) (.0375     + .0596) - .0530(.55)
               = .708


The short-run equilibrium share price falls to 71 percent of its
no-inflation value.             Note that the proportional fall in q is
nearly twice as great as the proportional fall in z, a magnifica-
tion that results from recognizing the effect of retained earnings.
        In considering this fall in the short-run equilibrium share
price, it is important to bear in mind that it treats the risk
differential (ois) as fixed.              Although inflation may in fact
alter the perceived riskiness of investments in stocks and bonds,
this is ignored here in order to focus on the interaction of
                                      18



inflation anq   ta~ rules. l
     It is alsq important to emphasize that the new share price

in equation 1.10 is calculated on the assumption that the pretax

rate of return (p) remains unchanged and therefore that the capital

stock qf the corporate sector is unchanged.         The lower share

price would reduce investment in the corporate sector and this

would cause the pretax rate of return p         to rise.    The reduced

rate of investment would continue until the share price returned

to its original long-run equilibrium value of q        =   1.   Ignoring

this eventual return to q      =   1 causes equation 1.9 to overstate

the actual short-run fall in the share price.

     To specify the capital adjustment process correctly requires

at least a two-sector model of the economy in which capital and

labor can both move from the nonfinancial corporate sector (and

from other activities where inflation raises the effective tax

rate) to activities like owner-occupied housing that are not

taxed more heavily when the inflation rate rises.           Consider

instead a simpler calculation of the required reduction in the

corporate capital stock if relative prices remain unchanged and

the reduction in capital is the only way in which the pretax rate




     IThe risk differential would also change with the rate of
inflation because of the induced shift in share ownership,
Discussion of this will be postponed until the dema.nd for shares
by household inyestorshas been considered.

of return 1S        . d •1            With this simplification, it is easy to

calculate the long-run reduction in the capital stock that is

induced by a six percent inflation.                   It follows from the share

price equation (1.4 or 1.9) that returning to the original share

value of q      =1    is equivalent to raising z to the value that

prevailed in the absence of inflation or, from equation 1.6,

z   = 0.0628.
        Equation 1.1 can be used to calculate the value p* that is

required to make z           =   0.0628 with TI   =   0.06:


(1.10)          .0628    =   (l-T) (p*-br) - Tl..lTI + (b-a) TI

                        =    .52(p*-.353(.0975»         -   .48(.53) (.06)
                                                                 + (.353-.079) (.06)
                         =   .52p* + .0191


or p*    =   .1575.     Thus the value of p must rise from 0.134 to 0.1575

to reestablish the long-run equilibrium.                      The corresponding change

in the capital stock depends on the form and parameters of the

production function.             A Cobb-Douglas technology with a capital

elasticity of 0.2 implies an 18 percent reduction in the equilibria

capital stock.

        In summary, in an economy with our existing tax rules but in

which all shares were owned by institutions that paid no "personal"




     IThis would be the appropriate calculation if the only alter~
native to investment in corporate capital were government debt.
More generally, it is necessary to recognize the changes in the
relative product prices and in the allocation of labor among the
sectors of the economy.

tax on income or capital gains, a six percent inflation would

induce a fall in the short-run equilibrium share price of nearly

30 percent and a fall in the long-run capital intensity of between

15 and 20 percent.   The analysis for an economy with household

as well as institutional investors is more complex and the

results are more ambiguous.   Before considering the behavior of

this complete market equilibrium, it is useful to begin by analy-

zing the share valuation equation for households.

and the corporate return per dollar of equity is again e               =   z/q(l-b).

A fraction d of this return is paid out as dividends and subject

to individual income tax at rate m.             The fraction that is retained

adds (l-d)q to the value of the firm.                This real increase in the
                                     22



firm's value is eventually subject to a capital gains tax when

the stock is sold.       The postponed tax liability can be expressed

instead as an equivalent present-value tax rate c on accruing

capital gains; since the actual liability is postponed and the

gain taxed at less than the rate on ordinary income, c < m.

        Inflation reduces these net earnings even further by imposing

an additional tax on nominal capital gains.        More specifically,

even though the real share price remains constant at the new real

equilibrium value q, inflation causes the nominpl share price to

rise at 100 rr percent a year.      The real value of this nominal

gain at any time is thus rrq per share or rrq(l-b) per unit of
   .
caplta 1.1    This entails no real gain but does induce an ultimate

capital gains tax liability with an equivalent accrual amount of

crrq(l-b) per unit of capital.

        The real net return to household investors per dollar of

equity value is thus:

(2.2)            =   z[d(l-m) + (I-d) (l-c)q] - crrq(l-b)
                                   (l-b)q


where the subscript h indicates that this is a net yield to

households.

        For institutional investors, portfolio equilibrium was char-

acterized by equating this net equity yield to the sum of the real



      ITO see why this is rrq(l-b) note that the total real capital
stock K minus the value of the debt (bK) is the capital share of
the equity owners and is valued at m per unit of net capital.
Thus the total equity value is E = q(l-b)K.    In addition to any
retained e~rnings, the nominal value of equity rises at the rate
TIE = rrq(l-b)K. The nominal gain per unit of capital is thus
TIq(l-b).

net yeild on bonds and a risk differential that would in general

vary with the number of shares that those investors own..        For

household investors, I shall adopt a similar equilibrium        condi~

tion that the required net equity yield may be written as the

sum of two components:         a real net yield on alternative assets

(n ) and a risk differential that depends on the number of shares
  s
that households own: I


(2.3)


The subscript s on n       indicates that the real net yield on alter-
                       s
native assets varies with the state of the economy, i.e.; with

the rate of inflation.

        For ordinary bonds, the real net yield is (l-m)r - TIi the

assumption that dr/dTI     =   I implies that the real net yield on such

bonds falls by the fraction m of any increase in the inflation

rate.     Investments in other assets are treated much more favorably

in an inflationary economy.        Owner-occupied housing is not affec-

ted by depreciation rules, the nominal capital gains are largely

untaxed, and the deductibility of nominal mortgage interest pay-

ments reduces the real net cost of mortgage finance.         Investments

in nondepreciable property (land, timber, depletable resources,

aBIlity assumption is obviously a simplification that would only
be consistent with expected utility maximization on very stringent
assumptions.

gold, etc.) are also not affected by the historic cost   deprecia~

tion rules.    Although these investments entail eventual capital

gains tax liabilities on their nominal appreciation, this rela-

tively small tax is often more than offset by the tax deducti-

bility of interest payments on the debt associated with these

investments.   Although investments in depreciable real estate

are disadvantaged by the historic cost depreciation rule, the

relatively high ratio of debt to total capital for such investments

implies that even the reduction in real depreciation is often
                                                             l
more than offset by the deductibility of nominal interest.       On

balance, therefore, inflation may lower, raise or leave unchanged

the yield on alternative investments to which household investors

compare the yield on equity.2   The risk premium that a household

requires to hold an additional share of equity should be an

increasing function of the amount of risk that the household is

already bearing.   This relation (and the similar one for institu-

tiona I investors) will be discussed explicitly in section 3.

     Combining equations 2.2 and 2.3 gives an explicit equation

for the price per share that household investors would be willing

to pay:

The analysis in section I showed that the net effect of higher

inflation on depreciation, inventories and the deductibility of

corporate interest expenses reduces the corporation's net of

tax income, z.        Equation 2.5 shows that this lower value of z

reduces the share price.               The taxation of the households' nominal

capital gains, reflected in the term (l-b)cTI in the denominator

of equation 2.5, further depresses the share price.                    Thus if the

household's required yield on equities (n                   + 0hs) uses or remains
                                                        s
unchanged, the interaction of inflation and tax rules unambigu-

ously reduces the share price that households are willing to pay.

Since section I showed that the institution's demand price would

unambiguously decline, a constant or higher value of n                      + 0hs
                                                                        s
means that a higher rate of inflation would unambiguously reduce

the equilibrium share price.

        A significant fall in the household's required yield on equi-

ties is required to prevent a decline in their demand price for

shares.     Even if such a decline in n
                                                 s
                                                     + Qhs does prevent a
decline in the household's demand price, the unambiguous reduc-

tion in institutions' demand for shares might cause a fall in the

market equilibrium price of shares.

the household's demand for equities is easily calculated with the

help of equation 2.5.           It is necessary first to evaluate the two

tax rates paid by household investors, m and c.                  For the average
                                        26



tax rate on dividends (m), I shall use the weighted average of

shareholder marginal tax rates, weighting by the amount of divi-

dends received; Feldstein and Summers (1979) report the value

m   =   0.39. 1     It is more'difficult to estimate the relevant rate

of capital gains tax, c. Long-term capital gains are taxed at
                                             2
about half of the rate on dividends              when the gain is realized.

However, since gains are taxed only when they are realized, the

effective rate is reduced by the postponement of realization.                 In

addition, capital gains that have accrued on assets that are

passed on at the death of their owner completely avoid tax on the

previously accrued gain because the new owner is permitted to

"step up"         his basis to the value at the time of receipt for the

purpose of calculating future capital gains liabilities.              A conser-

vatively low value of c        =   0.05 will be used.

        with these values of m and c and the other parameter values

that were obtained in section 1, it is now possible to use equa-

tion 2.5 to derive the value of n s + 0h s that is consistent with



     lA one percent increase in the dividend receipts of each
taxpayer would increase the income tax liability by 39 percent
of the additional dividends.  This calculation is done with the
NBER T~XSIM model based on 1976 tax rates.

     2until 1978, half of long-term gains were excludable in
calculating taxable income; since then, the exclusion has increased
to 60 percent. The total tax rate on capital gains also depends
on the availability of the alternative tax method (until 1978),
the treatment o£ the excluded portion of gains as a tax preference,
and the reduction in the amount of earned income eligible for the
maximim tax provision (until 1978).

tion 2.5 drops from qo                   =   1 to ql    =    0.598, a more substantial

reduction than the decline in the institutional investors'

demand price to 0.708.



         To prevent this decline in the household's demand price, the

required rate of return would have to drop from 0.0774 to 0.0623

or less. 2         Only if such a decline in n                     + 0hs occurred could the

households' demand for equities increase.                             The possibility of

such a decline and the corresponding change in the equilibrium

share price when households and institutions are considered

together is one of the cases considered in the next section.

      2The value of 0.0623 is obtained from equation 2.5 by setting
q = 1, z = .0530 and (l-b)cTI = 0.00194 and then solving for
n s + 0h s .

3.   Market Equilibrium


      The separate analyses of institutional and household inves-

tors have shown how inflation affects these two components of the

total demand for shares.   An increase in the rate of inflation

unambiguously reduces the institutional investors' demand because

the real net yield on equities falls while the corresponding

yield on the alternative investment in bonds does not.       For house-

hold investors, the demand for equities declines unless the real

net yield on the portfolio of alternative financial and real

investments falls enough to offset the lower return on equities

and the extra tax on nominal capital gains.       If the equity demands

of both households and institutions decline, the market price of

shares must also decline in the short-run and the capital stock

of the nonfinancial corporate sector must decline in-the long-run.

     More generally, a higher rate of inflation might reduce the

real net yield on the alternative assets in which households

invest by enough to increase their demand for equity shares.       The

change in the market equilibrium price then depends on the way in

which the risk differentials of institutions and households (6.

and 0hs1 respond to changes in the distribution of share ownership.

The present section therefore begins by presenting an explicit

model of the determination of   o·1S   and 0h •

     The risk premium that an institution requires to hold an

additional share of equity should be an increasing function of

the amount of risk that the household is already bearing.      More

explicitly, I shall assume that 0is is proportional to the

the dollar value of their equity investment is S.1S q S where q s is

the price prevailing in state s.                     The standard deviation of the

return on the equity portion of the institutions' portfolio is the

product of the dollar value of the equity investment: Sis[d + (l-d)qs]

and stocks is proportion,al to this standard deviation, O.1S can be

written:

where O. is a risk-aversion constant for institutions.

        Note that all of the variables that determine 0is are measur-

able except 0i and 0 p and that only their product matters.                                       Recall

that equation 1.8 showed that in general O.1S                     =   z/(l-b) -              (r-n)

and that with no inflation O.1S             =    0.0596.       In 1967, before the

inflation on perceived risk in order to focus analytic attention on
the interaction of taxes and the steady-state rate of inflation.

0h is the risk aversion constant for households.                              The analysis in

billion are attributable to nonprofit organizations.

      2This would be most appropriate if the other assets in the
households' portfolio could be treated as riskless but, in any case,
the simple additive separability and proportionality specification
of the required equity yield must be regarded as a useful approxi-
mation rather than a general result.

plus the required risk differential when the households currently

own no equities.        For example, no         =   0.04 implies 0ho     =   0,0374 and
                                                                                          -3

chap   =   0.106 . 10- 3 .     The risk sensitivity parameter of households

is thus approximately one-tenth of the                     corresponding parameter

for institutions, a difference that primarily reflects the much

larger total wealth of households.

       The equilibrium share price and distribution of share owner-

ship at any inflation rate must satisfy three conditions:                          the

institutional portfolio balance condition, the household portfolio

balance condition, and the requirement that the total demand for

shares by households and institutions equals the existing supply.

In the short run, with the stock of capital fixed, this provides

three equations that simultaneously determine q s , Sh. s and S 1S
                                                                ..                       In

the long-run, the share price must equal one and the three equations

determine the equilibrium size of the corporate capital stock and

its distribution between households and institutions.

       Consider first the short-run equilibrium with a fixed stock

of capital and a fixed number of shares                S.    The institutional port-

folio balance condition can be written (from 1.4);

Finally, the demand for shares must equal the fixed supply:

These six equations determine the equilibrium share price q, the

share ownership of households and institutions (Sis and                      ~s)   and the

incidental parameters z, 0.                 and 0h .

             The numerical parameter values in equation 3.5 and 3.7 were

 selected to make the equations consistent with the initial equili-

brium of         TI        =    0 and q        =   1 with share ownership Sio                =   100 and ShO           =   700.

The response of q to changes in                                      TI   depends on the initial level of

no and on the way in which it is changed by inflation as well as on

the other parameter values that have been discussed at earlier

points in the paper.                            This is seen more clearly when equations 3.3

through 3.8 are reduced to a set of three equations evaluated at

TI   =   0.06.             A subscript 1 will be used to distinguish the equilibrium

values at             TI    =   0.06 from the equilibrium value with no inflation

that are subscripted with a zero.                                         For convenience, I will define

       Consider first the implications of an initial alternative

yield of n o   =   0.04 that does not change at all when the inflation

rate rises to 6 percent (n l           =   0.04).   Solving equations 3.9 through

3.11 indicates that the price falls from qo                 =   1 to ql   =    0.74.

Institutions increase their share ownership from Sis                      =   100 billion

shares (at qo      = 1)    to Sil    = 122   billion shares (at ql        =    0.74); the

fall in the price per share implies that the total value of their

equity holdings fall from $100 billion to $90 billion.                        Households

reduce their share ownership from Sho               =   700 billion shares to Shl

=   678 billion shares and thus reduce the value of the equity

holdings from $700 billion to $502 billion.                 The institutional

ownership increases from 12.5 percent of total equities to 15.3
           1
percent.

       These results are not sensitive to changes in the initial

level of the alternative yield.              The assumption that no           =   0.03

(instead of no     =   0.04) and that this does not change when the

inflation rate rises to 6 percent implies that inflation reduces

the price to Pl      =    0.76.     Institutional holding rises to 118 billion

shares and therefore to the same $90 billion as with no                       =   0.04.




      lBetween 1967 and 1977, corporate equities declined from
approximately 40 percent of household assets to approximately 25
percent. Equities remained at 55 percent of private pension assets
and rose from 9 percent of the assets of state and local government
employee retirement funds to 23 percent. Among insurance companies,
equities remained at 11 percent of total assets. Thus institutions
as a whole increased the fraction of their assets devoted to equi-
ties. Since the total assets of these institutions also rose some
faster than the total assets of households, the fraction of equities
held by households declined from about 88 percent to about 78
percent.

          The assumed change in the yield on alternative assets caused

by inflation does however have a substantial impact.                       If n falls

from   n~      =   0.04 to n
                               l
                                   =   0.03, the equilibrium price only falls from

qo   =1       to ql   = 0,89.      This fall in n
                                                     l
                                                         implies that households would

actually increase their shareholding to 704 billion shares while

institutions reduced their shareholding.                    The fall in n       required
                                                                            l
to keep the equilibrium share price unchanged implies an even more

implausible decrease in shareholding by institutions; if n falls

from no        =   0.04 to n l     =   0.024, the equilibrium price remains unchanged

at q   =      1 but institutions reduce their shareholds from $100 billion

to $81 billion.           Finally, it is interesting to note that a £all in

n l from 0.04 to 0.027 would be enough to increase                      the price that
                                                                   2
households would be willing to pay in isolation                        but leads to a

fall in the market equilibrium price (ql                   =   0.94) and a substantial

increase in the number of shares held by households (to 722 billion

shares) .

       The equilibrium conditions of equations 3.3 through 3.8 can

now be used to calculate the change in the pretax rate of return 3
that is required for long-run equilibrium.                     Instead of regarding

tion described in the previous footnote,

p       as exogenous (in equation 3.4 ) and q as endogenous, the analysis

will now set q             =   1 and solve for the value of p that is consistent

with        TI   = 0.06.   The solution indicates that with no       =   n
                                                                             l
                                                                                 =   0.04,

p       rise from 0.134 to 0.157.        The 17 percent rise in the required

marginal product of capital implies a significant fall in the
                                                         l
capital stock of nonfinancial corporations.                  Consider again the

simplifying assumptions of section 1 that relative prices remain

unchanged and that the fall in the corporate sector capital stock

is the only way to raise the pretax rate of return.                  A Cobb-Douglas

technology with a capital elasticity of 0.2 implies that raising

p       from 0.134 to 0.157 requires an 18 percent fall in the capital

stock.            If inflation lowers the yield on alternative assets so that

n
    l
        =   0.03, the required rate of return rises to p         =   0.143 and the

Cobb-Douglas technology implies an 8 percent fall in the capital

stock.           Although the simplifying assumptions mean that these figures

are only rough approximations, they do indicate the significant

effect that the interaction of inflation and existing tax rules may

have on the incentive to invest.




      IMore generally, the capital is also reduced in other activi-
ties that are more heavily taxed because of inflation.

4.   Conclusion


      The analysis in this paper has shown that, because of existing

tax rules, a permanent increase in the expected rate of inflation

will depress the price of equity shares and will reduce the size of

the equilibrium capital stock in the affected industries.    This

conclusion is based on calculations that use likely values of the

tax and financial variables and that explicitly recognize the impor-

tant roles of debt finance and retained earnings.

      A number of other recent studies that have reached the opposite

conclusion (that the interaction of taxes and inflation does not

depress share prices) are based on a faulty or incomplete descrip-

tion of the tax effects.    For example, Fama (1979) concludes that

taxes could not be responsible for the fall in real share values

during the 1970's because the ratio of corporate taxes to gross

corporate income (before subtracting depreciation and real interest

payments) has fallen since the 1960's.    I do not understand the

purpose of this comparison since the denominator does not refer to

equity income and the numerator does not include all of the taxes

paid by equity investors.   Modigliani and Cohn (1979) refer to the

fact that inflation reduces the real value of depreciation but
                                        38


                                                                                   1
underestimate the magnitude of this effect by more than 60 percent.

They   ~lso   ignore the extra tax on the portfolio investors and the

way in which the interaction of inflation and taxes alters the real

net yields available on alternative assets.               Hendershott's (1979)

extension and critique of Feldstein (1978) avoids many of the prob-

lems of other studies but his empirical results are difficult to

interpret because he     inadve~tently       uses the    pre~jnflation   nominal

yield on debt to describe portfolio bale-nce.              None of the studies

with which I am familiar recognize the           ~mportance    of distinguishing

among investors in different tax situations, either generally or

the particular distinction between households and tax-free institu-

tions that has been emphasized in the cur~ent paper.

       There are of courSf,    2,   number of vlays in vJhich the present

s-etldy could be extended and strenqthened.             Like any model of a

single market, the results could be improved by imbedding the

current model in a    mor~   complete general      Gquilibri~m    system.     In



       lModigli,ani and Cohn est.imate the effe::::t of inflation on
allmvable depreciation by the capital consumption adjustment CCCA)
estimated by the Department of Commerce. The CCA actually J:'eflects
two countervailing differences b~tween real st~aiqht~line depre-
ciation and the depreciation allowed for tax purposes: acceleration
makffitax-deductible depreciation exceed straight~line depreciation
while inflation reduces the value of tax-deductible depreciation.
In 1977, for example, the "acceleration component!' raised tax deduc-
tible depreciation by $25.0 billion while the ,. inflation component"
reduced tax depreciation by $39.7 billion. The $14.7 billion dif-
ference between 'these two is the net CCA figure of the type used
by Modigliani and Cohn; it is only 37 percent of the true reduction
in depreciation caused by inflation.      (Although the "acceleration
component" grew during the 1970's, this was almost entirely due to
changes in tax laws in the 1960's"and to the growth of investment.
The favorable tax rules and the likely future would therefore have
been anticipated in the late 1960's and reflected in share prices at
that time. Only the subsequent unanticipated inflation and the
associated loss of real depreciation would affect subsequent share
price moments.)
                                 39



this way, the effect of reductions in the stock of nonfiancial

corporate capital on the yields in other markets could be explicitly

evaluated.   An explicit model of the adjustment of the capital stock

would permit a more accurate evaluation of the initial change in

price.   A better empirical specification of the yields on the alter-

native assets in the household's portfolio would also be desirable.

Finally, a more general specification of the other factors that influ-

ence the movement of share prices is a necessary prerequisite to

direct empirical measurement of the extent to which the poor perfor-

mance of the stock market during the 1970's is due to the interac-
                                            l
tion of inflation and existing tax rules.

                                     Appendix

           Historic Cost   Depreciati~_~nd Effective T,~Ra~es



         The text of this paper introduced the parameter W to measure

the extent to which inflation raises taxable corporate income by

reducing the real value of depreciation allowances and inventory

costs.     Although the component of W caused by existing inventory

methops could be calculated directly, the more important deprecia-

tion component required the rather arbitrary selection of "the"

inflation rate responsible for the 1977 understatement of real

depreciation.     The rate of   TI   = .06 was selected to reflect exper-
ience during the life of the then existing capital stock.          The

implied value of the depreciation component of W is 0.19.          Although

the results are not very sensitive to plausible variations in their

inflation rate, it seems desirable to estimate this parameter by an

alternative method.

         The current appendix uses the "hypothetical project" technique

that I employed with Lawrence Summers in an earlier study (Feldstein

and Surruners, 1978).   This method is completely free of the recent

historic experience.       It nevertheless produces a value of the depre-

ciation parameter (say, 1.1 1 ' that is extremely close to the estimate

based on the national account data.          The similarity of the two

results provides substantial support for this value.

         Consider' a ., standard investment" that in the absence of taxes
                                   41


                                                1
has an internal rate of return of 12 percent.       Let the nominal rate

of return that the firm can afford to pay for funds invested in this

project.     In the qbsence of tax this would be 12 percent; with pure

debt finance and economic depreciation, the firm could pay this

nominal return regardless of the corporate income tax.        But less

than economic depreciation would reduce this maximum potential rate
             2
of return.

      The Feldstein-Summers study considered how a 6 percent infla-

tion would change the maximum potential interest rate that a firm

could pay.on the standard project if the project was financed with

one-third debt and two-thirds equity and if the real net equity

yield to typical individual investors had to exceed their real net

yield on debt by 6 percent.    The analysis showed that a maximum

potential nominal interest rate of 3.3 percent with no inflation
                                                          3
would rise to 11.3 percent with a 6 percent inflation.        The assump-

tion of one-third debt finance and a 6 percent yield differential

implies that a 6 percent inflation rate would lower the total

structures, each with its own exponential output decay structure.

paper, T = 0.5, ~ = 0.4, d = 0.5 and c = 0.1.

maximum potential real yield on capital by 1,2 percentage points:

T~lTI    = 0.012 or, with the value of T = 0.5 used in that calculation,

~l   = 0.40.    This estimate is almost identical to the value inferred

from the national account data and embodied in the total value

(including inventory effects as well) of ~ = 0.53 that is used in
the text.




        lThis value of 0.012 can be derived as follows with the nota~
tion of the present paper.    The assumption of a 6 percent yield
differential implies (l-m) i - TI + . 06 = [d (l-m) + (i-d) (l-c)] (2/ (i-b) )
- CTI.   The earlier study found i = 0.033 when TI = a and i = 0.113
when TI = 0.06. These imply 2 = .0709 when TI = a and 2 = ,0656 when
TI   = 0.06.  In the present paper, T~ TI is the change in 2 induced by
the effect of historic cost depreciation; using this would imply
~   = 0.363. But the Feldstein-Summers calculation assumes a rise in
t~e real interest rate and ther.ef.ore an understateme.nt of ~l' The
total nominal return that the firm pays for ~unds is N ~ bC.l-T)i
+ 2 + (l-b)TI. In the absence of inflation, N = 0.0764 while at
TI = .06, N =0.1244.    The real return on c~pital falls from 0.0764
to 0.0694, a fall of 0.012.
