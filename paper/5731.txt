        This paper presents an empirical study of real exchange rate movements from a consumer’s

perspective.   Trade between two countries creates a link between real exchange rate and terms of

trade. It is the private consumption of non-traded goods that induces an equilibrium relationship

between real exchange rate and private consumption of traded and non-traded goods. We use Ogaki

and Park’s (1989) cointegration-Euler equation approach to explore long-run implications from the

equilibrium relationship. Given the stationary preference shocks assumption, the testable restriction

is that real exchange rate and private consumption of traded and non-traded goods in the home and

foreign countries are cointegrated. The empirical evidence suggests that private consumption in the

home and foreign countries accounts for a significant fraction of the long run movements of real

exchange rate in South Korea and Taiwan. Accounting for real government consumption does not

overturn the result.

                                         1. Introduction

       This paper     presents an empirical                 study of real exchange          rate move-
ments from consumer’s            perspective.          For the private agent’s intertemporal
optimal choice of consumption,             the marginal rate of substitution                for the con-
sumption      of two goods       must equal the corresponding                  relative price.       Real
exchange     rate is the relative price of the home country’s                        consumption     bas-
ket in terms of the foreign country’s                   consumption        basket.     Trade between
two countries       creates a link between real exchange rate and terms of trade.
It is the private consumption             of non-traded           goods   that induces an equilib-
rium relationship         between     real exchange           rat e and private consump tion of
traded and non-traded            goods.
       As displayed in Figures 1 and 2, private consumption                          in different coun-
tries and the bilateral real exchange                  rate all exhibit      clear trends and have
different    fluctuations.       Large, persistent            movements      of real exchange         rate
and small cross-country           correlation      of aggregate          private consumption         have
been separate       research     topics in international              macroeconomics.           But sur-
prisingly    few attempted          to account         for the comovement             between     private
consumption        in different countries and real exchange rate both in the short
run and in the long run.
       one   exception       is Backus and Smith (1993).                  They studied a dynamic
exchange      economy      with one traded              good,    one non-traded         good    for each
country,     and an arbitrary        number of countries.              One main theoretical          find-
ing is that fluctuations            in aggregate           consumption       ratio between         foreign
country      and home country         and fluctuations              in bilateral real exchange        rate
have similar dynamics            and are positively             correlated    over time.        However,
based upon eight OECD               countries,         they found little evidence          for the pos-
itive correlation      in the time series data.                  There    are two possibilities         for
the discrepancy       between       theory and evidence.              First, preference        shocks are

not admitted       in their model.           When endowment              shock is the sole external
shock, it can only generate positive correlation                      between changes in the con-
sumption      ratio and changes in the real exchange                     rate. Second,       agents have
identical preferences         across countries.
     In this paper,          we adopt        the Ogaki and Park’s              (1989)    cointegration-
Euler equation       approach         to explore long-run implications               from the equilib-
rium relationship         between         real exchange       rate and consumption             of various
goods in different countries,              Given the assumption              of stationary     preference
shocks,    one testable       restriction      on the long run movements                  of these vari-
ables is that they have similar trend properties                        in the sense that they are
cointegrated.      Here preference           shocks not only induce negative                   correlation
between real exchange rate and consumption                         in different countries,          but also
provide    an identifying         assumption.        Preference       parameters        and weights as-
signed to non-traded              goods    in the construction           of price index determine
the similarity      via elements           in the theoretical          cointegrating      vector.           Het-
erogeneous      preferences         across countries induce dissimilarityy. When agents’
preferences     and weights used in the construction                    of price index are identical
across the two count ries, the real exchange rate becomes                           positively       related
to the cross-country         consumption          disparity in traded goods, but negatively
related to the cross-country               consumption        disparity in non-traded              goods. z
     There is very little empirical                evidence       that any known fundamentals
have reliable effects on the real exchange rate, Most previous studies on real
exchange      rate movements            were taken from producer’s                 perspect ive.3           And
the most popular          hypothesis        is originated        by Balassa (1964)         and Sameul-
son (1964).      It states that real exchange                 rate movements         reflect the cross-
country    difference      in the productivity            differential between traded and non-
traded sectors.       Since significantly         higher productivity y growth in the traded
sector is expected        to occur in the export-led              growth economies,          the positive
relation between real exchange                 rate and cross-country            disparity in produc-
tivit y growth      should        be evident      in those economies.              The real exchange
rat e has been a natural indicator                of export        competitiveness.          Establishing
the positive     relation and underlying              growth mechanism             has become          a cen-
tral research topic in economic                development          (For example,       Ito, Issard and
Symansky        (1996))

   2 Lucas (1982) also studied            a two-country    model     in which the representative            agent
rank the exportable       goods     and importable    goods      according   to its preferences     and must
use currency to purchase the goods.    The relative price of between these two goods                            is
determined by the cross-country difference in the endowments of these two goods.

Isard and Symsnsky        (1996),    Kravis and Lipsey (1987)         and Strauss (1996).

     Adler and Lehman             (1983) found that the real exchange                   rate contains
a stochastic     trend,      and argued that this might be due to the productiv-
ity growth      biased    toward       traded    sector.      Hsieh’s     (1982)     study    provided
evidence      for the role of productivity             differential     without      explicitly      mod-
elling the non-stationarity            of productivity          differential    and real exchange
rate. Recently,      Strauss (1996) found that a cointegrating                   relationship        exists
between      real exchange       rate and productivity            differentials      between      traded
and non-traded        goods.     Even though productivity               differentials     can account
for a significant     fraction of the long-run movement                  of real exchange         rate, it
seems a much higher productivity                 growth rate in the traded sector would
be required      to justify     the long-run       movement          of real exchange        rate.     Re-
cent ly, Froot and Rogoff          (1991) took an alternative             approach       in the expla-
nation of real exchange          rate movement.          They found that the cross-country
difference    in government        spending       can account         for the real exchange           rate
movement.       Since government          consumption         is concentrated        in the purchase
of non-traded       goods,     an increase in government              consumption        increases the
relative price of non-traded           goods to traded goods.            Thus, the real exchange
rate appreciates      in the country with a high growth rate of government                            con-
sumption.
     As documented            in Backus, Kehoe and Kydland                  (1992),     cross-country
correlation     of output      is larger than such correlation                 of consumption          and
productivity      shocks for many industrial               countries.     In a single goods          econ-
omy, however,       the shocks produce           output fluctuations            that are less highly
correlated     than fluctuations        in consumption           and productivity          shocks.      To
account      for this discrepancy        between       theory     and evidence,         recent studies
have introduced       the non-separable          utility function       (Devereux       et al. (1992)),
and the incomplete           markets     (Kollmann         (1991))      in the model.        When       the
consumption       basket in each country            cent ains the non-traded              component,
the cross-country        correlation     of aggregate consumption              could be less imper-
fect if that of non-traded          goods       consumption        is less imperfect.        This is so
simply because        countries     do not share but consume                their own non-traded
goods.     That is, the non-traded             goods can account          for small cross-country
correlation     of consumption.
     The remainder           of the paper is organized             as follows.       In section      2, we
derive the stationarity          restriction     on the trend properties           of real exchange
rate and private consumption               from the Euler equation               for the agent’s        in-
tertemporal      optimization       problem.       These restrictions           are the foundation
for the cointegration          Euler Equation          approach.        In section     3, we describe
the econometric        specifications      concerning        the trend property          of individual


                                                   3
series like private consumption             of traded and non-traded                     goods      and their
implications       for the stationarity          restriction.        Section       4 explains        the data
and reports        empirical    results.   The countries             under consideration                 include
Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and United States. Japan, Taiwan and South
Korea ran huge trade surplus with United States, while Taiwan and South
Korea ran significant          trade deficits with Japan,               Two sets of bilateral rela-
tions are examined        with South Korea and Taiwan each serving as the home
country.      The bilateral     real exchange         rates exhibit         different trend proper-
ties, and there is the cross-country               disparity in private consumption.                          It is
interesting    to know the role of private consumption                        and non-traded              goods
in accounting       for the long run movements                  of real exchange                rate in South
Korea and Taiwan.            The last section cent ains concluding                    remarks.

     Consider       two countries      in a large world economy.                    Imagine that each
economy      is populated      with an infinitely-lived          representative           household.          The
household      in the home country           in period          t is endowed          with X:        units of
export able goods,       Yt” units of importable            goods and Z; units of non-traded
goods.     Goods     Xt and Yt are costlessly traded in the world markets, while
Zt is only traded domestically.
     The household           ranks its consumption              stream, { (Xt Yt Zt )’, t ~ O} ac-
cording     to its lifetime utility function:

is assumed to take the form:

Taking the natural logarithm                  on both sides of the above equations                                    yields

where xt z logXt,           yt = logYt, zt z log Zt, pit G logPEt7 for i = x, y, z, and
uzt = logaxt — Zogait, for i = y, z. In equilibrium,                                       prices and consumption
must satisfy equations          (1) and (2).
      If uzt is stationary           for i = y, z, then equations                              (1) and (2) imply the
stationarity    of both pZt —pyt + aZxt —avyt and pzt —pzt + azxt —aZzt. This
restriction    allows for different                trend properties                     of consumption          of various
goods,    depending      upon preference parameters.                                   For example, when ai > a.,
the restriction       allows goods           i consumption                       to grow at a slower rate than
goods     X consumption          for any given path of relative price and preference
shocks and i = y, z. This is because                            a given change in pit – pzt induces a

in home country              is described            by

in which pt is the logarithm                         of the domestic               price index at time t, and 19Z
is the weight given to goods                         i in the index with 8Z > 0 for i = z, y, z, and
8X+ 19Y+ d= = 1. The error term, uPt, captures the third country effect, and
is assumed to be uncorrelated                         with pit, for i = x, y, z. We se this definition

      For our purpose,                   the real exchange                rate at time t, qt, is defined as


                                                     qt=pt–st–$t,                                                           (4)


in which st is the logarithm                        of nominal bilateral exchange                          rate. A decrease
in st means an appreciation                          of domestic            currency.         The purchasing            power
parity (PPP)           doctrine           states that nominal                     exchange           rate equals the ratio
between      domestic              and foreign prices.                  Therefore        real exchange             rate move-
ments indicate              deviations             from the PPP for pt.                   To sharpen              our focus on
the role of non-traded                   goods,       we assume that the law of one price holds for
the goods that are traded between the two countries.4                                                 This is captured       by
the following          relationship:


                                                          Pit = St + Fit,


for i = x, y. The assumption                         of the law of one price may not be as restrictive
as it appears, we can easily abandon                               this assumption by allowing movements
in pat — St     — fiat,          If these deviations                   contain      a trend component,                 that is,

    4 The law of one price obtains if 1) markets are competitive, 2) there are no t rans-
portation costs, and 3) there are no barriers to trade, such as tariffs or quotas. Hsieh
(1982),    Fisher and Park (1991)                   and Strauss         (1996)    among     others also adopted          this ~-
sumption     for the traded goods.


                                                                   6
the PPP        for pzt or pYt does not hold in the long run, v.~ in equation
(3) will contain         trend component,                 Hence, checking if estimated                    residuals
in equation       (3) is stationary              provides            a diagnostic        analysis    for possible
misspecification         errors.
         Substituting      equation         (3) and its foreign                   country’s     counterpart    into
equation      (4) for pt and jt, respectively                       yields




in which Vt s —vzt + tizt. It is clear from equation                                   (5) that trade between
two countries imposes an equilibrium relationship                                   among real exchange rate,
terms of trade, and private consumption                                  of various goods in the two coun-
tries.     If vt is stationary,            equation       (5) imposes              the restriction       regulating
the comovement            of   qt,   p.t    –   pyt,     Xt,       it,     ,zt   and ;t from the consumer’s
perspective      that




is stationary,     We call this restriction                        the stationarity       restriction,     which is
the foundation          of cointegration-Euler                 equation approach.             The derivation      of
this restriction     does not require any use of budget constraint                                and first-order
conditions      relating to the intertemporal                            choice of consumption.          Hence the
cointegration-Euler            equation         approach            allows for the existence          of liquidity
constraints      or other financial market imperfections,
         The stationarity        restriction           has different long run implications                  for the
comovement         of individual           variables           in equation          (5), depending        upon the
trend properties         of individual          variables.          For example, if the PPP for pt holds
in the long run (that is, qt is stationary), then the stationarity restriction
                               .
requires that pzi — pyt, ~t, xt) Zt and ;t be cointegrated with the cointe-
                                                            ,.             a
grating vector: (iv – 13y,H’)’, in which H’ = (aZ6’z, –&z6z, –azdz, &zOz).5
Suppose there is a change in nominal exchange rate caused by nominal fac-
tors, Both traded and non-traded                         goods consumption                 in the two countries
have a deterministic            influence         on the general price index in each country.
As a result, changes in consumption                        of various goods in both countries have
to manage to maintain the long run relationship                                    between price ratios in the

    5 Here we adopt the definition              of cointegration            given in Campbell    and Perron (1991,
p 164). An n x 1 vector of variables, St, is said to be cointegrated if there exists at least
one non-zero n-element vector ~ such that ~’S~ is trend stationary. This definition does
not require that each of individual             series in St contain             a unit root; some or all series can
be trend stationary.


                                                               7
two countries     and nominal exchange rate, and the nominal factors have ef-
fects only on the short run movements                 of consumption.            On the other hand,
if qt contains a trend component            and pzt —pvt, Zt, it, Zt and ;t are cointe-
grated with the cointegrating          vector:        (eV – @y, H’)’,          then the stationarity
restriction    implies that private        consumption             in equation      (5) cannot    be a
driving force for the long-run         movement         of qt.
     As argued in Hsieh (1982),            different weights (Hi) used in the construc-
tion of the price index can cause the movement                      of qt. To see it, assume that
the law of one price holds for both goods X and goods Y and that there is
                                                  .
no non-traded goods in the world economy (0= = 19z= O). Then equation
(5) becomes
                                    .
                              qt = (@y –    ~y)(pzt     –   Pyt)     +   ~t.



Clearly, it is the private consumption                of non-traded            goods   that creates a
link between      real exchange      rate and private               consumption        in the model,
On the other hand, trade between                the two countries              links terms of trade
                                                                               .
changes with the real exchange             rate changes.             When      19y# t9y and vt. = O,
terms of trade and real exchange                rate have similar dynamics.                 It is the
preference     shocks that make real exchange                  rate and terms of trade have
imperfect     correlation.    If there is only one goods,                say goods Y, in the world
economy,      then 6Y = 19y= 1 and equation                  (5) becomes          qt = Vt, That       is,
unlike the result obtained        in Backus and Smith (1993),                    the PPP for pt does
not necessarily     hold exactly     due to the presence of preference                  shocks.
     Even though         terms of trade can account                 for a significant     fraction     of
real exchange      rate movements         here, the real exchange                 rate (qt ) does not
necessarily    have positive      correlation     with the terms of trade.               The sign of
correlation    is determined     by that of jy – 8V. To see this, consider an increase
in terms of trade (pZt – pyt ) caused by a lower price of import ables.                                If
consumption       of importable     goods is more important                    in home country    than
in foreign     country   in the sense that 8V > 4V, then the value of a unit of
domestic      currency      (in terms of a basket of goods)                    must rise relative      to
that of the equivalent         units of foreign currency.                When real exchange          rate
appreciates,     it is optimal     for private        agents to increase           the consumption
of import ables,      For this case, terms of trade and real exchange                        rate are
negatively     correlated    over time.
      To identify other sources for the movement                         of qt, assume that house-
holds in the two countries have identical preferences (ai = &i, for i = x, y, z)
and that the weights used in the construction                      of price index are the same for


                                                  8
the two countries.        Given those assumptions,               equation    (5) can be reduced
to
                       gt = Qzoz(zt         – it) – azoz(zt       – ~t) + Vt.

It is obvious     that the cross-country            consumption      disparities for the traded
and non-traded       goods account for the movement                 of qt: qt increases with the
cross-country      consumption        disparity in traded goods but decreases with the
cross-count ry consumption            disparity in non-traded            goods.     A country    that
experienced       a real appreciation         of its currency      had enjoyed        either a more
rapid growth in private consumption                  of traded goods or a less rapid growth
in that of non-traded       goods.      Since non-traded         goods will be relatively more
expensive in the fast growing economies,                   the currency of these countries will
experience      a real appreciation.
     Clearly, without       preference        shocks and the third country              effect in the
demand side, we cannot derive the long-run restriction                       on equilibrium      rela-
tionship among real exchange rate, terms of trade and private consumption.
For the productivity       differential models (for example,               Balassa (1964),      Hsieh
(1982) and Sameulson            (1964)),    productivity      shocks did not play such a role.
For example,       in Hsieh’s      (1982)     model,      the supply of labor is fixed but is
mobile   between      the tradable         goods,     and labor is the only input factor              in
production.        Then   the real exchange              rate is a deterministic         function     of
the following      variables:     productivity y differentials between the tradable and
non-tradable       sectors in both countries              and cross-country         disparity   in the
unit labor costs of the traded goods.


                           3. Econometric                Specifications

     The stationarity           restriction    summarizes        the long run equilibrium            re-
strictions from the consumer’s              perspective.      In the closed exchange economy,
equilibrium      consumption        equals its production,         and preference        parameters
can be identified from the stationarity                  restriction if the supply side exhibits
much more volatility            in the long run than the demand               side. For example,
Ogaki    (1992)     and Ogaki        and Park (1989)           achieved     the identification       by
assuming that productivity             shocks have stochastic            trends.
     Instead of modeling            the production          technology    in the supply side, we
consider open exchange            economies         in the world markets.          Trading opport u-
nities imply that the consumption                   of goods X and Y in each country                may
not equal domestic         production         in equilibrium.      For highly open economies
such as South Korea and Taiwan, the trend properties                          of equilibrium        con-
sumption      of both exportable           goods and importable          goods are unlikely to be


                                                     9
closely related to their domestic                              production.          To achieve the identification
of preference     parameters,              it is not sufficient to assume that the productivity
shocks have stochastic                  trend.         This can be done if the trend properties                                       of
export     and import          activities          do not offset those of the corresponding                                        pro-
duction.     And productivity                    shock is the dominant                      driving force in the long
run,
       In empirical      investigation,                it is difficult to obtain the data on the con-
sumption      of exportable              and importable                      for the countries under study, The
focus will be on the two goods                             case: traded goods                       and non-traded            goods.
Let Xt denote           the traded goods.                            Since pzt = pvt in the two goods                             case,
equation      (5) can be reduced                  to

                                                           .                                    .
                    qt =       a.ezxt         –    ‘Z”zit             –   ~ztizzt   +    &.@.        it   +   Vt.                   (6)


Equation      (6) will be used to determine                                  if private consumption                       of various
goods    are capable of placing restrictions                                 on the long-run                  movement           of real
exchange rate in the two countries.                                  According      to the Campbell                    and Perron’s
(1991)     definition     of cointegration,                      even though            the stationarity                 restriction
implies that      qt,    Zt,     ft,     Zt      and ;~ are cointegrated,                           not all the individual
series are required to contain a unit root. The stationarit y restriction                                                     simply
states that there exists at least a 5                            x    1 vector:     (1, —H’) for qt, Ztl it, zt and
;t such that Vt in equation                       (6) is trend stationary.                          Allowing           the presence
of trend stationary            variables in equation                         (6) has important                      implications.     If
some of individual             variables are trend stationary, it is trivially cointegrated.
For example,      if qt is trend stationary,                           then one trivial cointegrating                       vector is
unit vector which selects the trend-stationary                                      variable.             When the model is
true, another cointegrating                      vector is (1, H’)’ with a. dzxt –dz~z~t                                  –azdzzt     +
&z19z2t being trend stationary.                        That is, even private consumption                                    cent ains
trend components,               the st ationarit y restriction                          does not necessarily                     imply
that private consumption                      is a driving force for the long-run                                     movement        of
real exchange       rate.
        To assess the empirical                    significance               of heterogeneous                      utility function
across countries,         we follow the tradit ion in international                                           trade and assume
ai = ~i for i = z, z and 6= = ~,. Then equation (6) can be further simplified
to
                          qt    =      azoz(zt         –       it)    –   azez(zt       – ~t) + vi,                                  (7)

If real exchange          rate and the cross-country                                consumption                     disparity,     xt –
it and Zt – 2t contain                   different             trend components,                      then the stationarity
restriction     implies that qt, xt — it and Zt — ;t are cointegrated.                                                     However,


                                                                      10
when qt is stationary,        the stationarity    restriction does not necessarily imply
the stationarity         of yt – ~t and Zt – ~t for the following        reason.    yt – jt and
Zt — ;t can be cointegrated            with the cointegrating     vector:   (aZOz, —azdz ) so
that aZ8z(zt –it ) – azOz(zt – it) is stationary,            For this case, if goods X has
a lower income elasticity         than goods      Z (aZ > a=), then the stationarity          of
qt forces Zt –it    to grow at a faster rate than Xt –it,          but private consumption
do not have long run effects on qt. In general,                  the cointegration     between
Zt — it      and Zt — 2t does not imply           the stationarity       of aZ6z (zt – it)     –
azOz(zt —it ), the absence of arbitrage opportunities                in the non-traded    goods
between the two countries is very likely to induce the non-stationarity                    of qt.
Finally, the estimates         of aZ /az    and &Z/~Z can be identified            in the above
two specifications.


                            4. Data      and Empirical       Results

       As displayed in Figures 1 and 2, consumption                  of both traded and non-
traded goods       and bilateral real exchange rate all exhibit clear trends.               The
focus here is to explore          the stationarity     restriction    under the assumption
that these series contain trend components,               We first present statistical tests
for the trend property          of individual    series, and then estimate various coin-
tegrating     regressions under the two specifications            of preference     parameters
and the weights given in the construction               of pt.

Data

       The countries        involved    are Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the U.S.
Two    sets of bilateral       relations    are examined     with South Korea          and Tai-
wan each serving as the home country.                 Data on the exchange         rate of New
Taiwan dollars against U, S. dollar and Japanese Yen were taken from                        Tai-
wan Monthly        Financial     Stati~tics, while the exchange         rates of Korean Won
against the two foreign currencies were taken from International                      Financial
Statistics     (IFS).    To study the sensitivity       of empirical     results with respect
to the use of price index as the measure of general price level, the two selec-
tions of pt are: CPI and WPI (or PPI). Japan and South Korea price series
were taken from IFS. Taiwan price series were taken from Taiwan Natioanl
Income       Accounts,     while U.S. series were taken from BuTeau of Labor Statis-
tics. Let qj denote the real exchange rate when CPI is the measure of price
index, and let qiWdenote the real exchange                rate when WPI is the measure.
       Following Kakkar and Ogaki (1993), the real consumption                      expenditure
on durable,      semi-du,rables        and non-durables    is defined as the consumption


                                                 11
of traded goods,         while the real consumption         expenditure    on services is de-
fined as the consumption           of non-traded       goods.     South Korea      data on Xt
and Zt were taken from Na-tional Accounts,                  published     by Bank of Korea,
while Taiwan series were taken from the Taiwan Natioanl Income                        Accounts.
The Japan series on it and ;t were taken from OECD                        Quarterly    National
Accounts,     and U.S. series were taken from Survey of CuTTent Bu9ine~s, pub-
lished by Department          of Commerce,        The per capita real consumption             on
goods      and services is constructed       as follows.    We deflate nominal consump-
tion expenditure         by appropriate      price index, and then divide the resulting
number       by total population.         All data are quarterly        series.   The sample
period     is 1975:1-1994:4      for Taiwan and U. S., and 1975:1-1993:4              for Japan
and South Korea.

Evidence      from time series data

      The real bilateral       exchange      rates are displayed     in Figure 1, the plots
of zt, .zt, it and ~t in Figure 2, and those of Xt — it and Zt — ;t in Figure
3.   Three     points    worth mentioning.        First, Taiwan generally         experienced
a real appreciation        of its currency     against U.S. dollars during the sample
period.     The nominal       depreciation     of New Taiwan dollars against the U.S.
dollars caused a real depreciation            of Taiwan’s    currency     from 1981 to 1986,
and then the real value of New Taiwan dollars was pushed up under the
pressure of the U, S. when Taiwan enjoyed a sizable current account surplus
in the 1986-1989 period.          On the other hand, the bilateral exchange              rate of
Korean Won against the U.S. dollars exhibits a less clear upward trend. The
real depreciation        of Korean Won in 1980 and in the 1982-1986 was caused
by the continuing        nominal depreciation        of Korean Won against U.S. dollars.
When South Korea began to enjoy sizable current account                      surplus in 1986,
Korean       Won was under pressure by the U.S. to have an unprecedented
appreciation      against the U.S. dollars through              1989. After 1989, mild real
depreciation      of the Won against the U.S. dollars were mainly due to two
factors:     the deterioration     of South Korean international           payment      position
and the appreciation          of Japanese Yen against the U.S. dollars since 1991.
As a result, the real value of Korean won against U.S. dollars fell to the level
of the late 1970s in 1993-1994.              The bilateral      real exchange     rate between
South Korea and Japan exhibited                a similar and clear upward trend in the
1975-1994      period.     Unlike the real exchange         rate in South Korea,        the real
exchange      rate between      Taiwan and Japan exhibits a downward                  trend with
volatile fluctuations.


                                                12
        Second, the real per capita private consumption                               expenditures      on traded
goods and non-traded                  goods contain different trend components                         in the four
count ries. Third and finally, the cross-country                           evidence in Figure 2 indicates
that the per capita real consumption                               of services increases with economic
development.              This evidence          is also shown in the cross-country                    disparities
in the private consumption                      on traded goods            and non-traded        goods       in four
pairs of countries.

Testing     foT     the PPP          doctTine

        We first test the trend property                     of bilateral real exchange rate between
home country              and foreign country.               If the real exchange          rate does not con-
tain a trend component,                  then the PPP doctrine for pt holds in the long run.
Otherwise,          it does not hold in the long run.                       Therefore,      testing the trend
property      of bilateral           exchange       rate is equivalent          to testing the PPP              doc-
trine. For this purpose,                 we use Park and Choi’s (1988)                    J(p, q) and G(p, q)
tests.     The null of difference                stationary        around the linear time trend is re-
jected when the J(I; q) statistic is smaller than the critical values tabulated
in Park and Choi (1988 ).6 We also report Park and Choi’s                                       (1988)       G(I, q)
test for the stationarity                of those series around the linear time trend (trend
stationarity).            According       to Park and Choi (1988),                G( 1, q) converges          in dis-
tribution     to a Xz(q – 1) random variable under the null of trend stationarity.
We reject the null when G(I, q) test statistic is larger than critical values.7
Table 1 displays test results for the trend property of bilateral real exchange
rate.
         For qj and q~ between                    Taiwan and U. S., the J(l, q) tests with q =
2,3,4      cannot         reject     the null of difference               st ationarit y around         the linear
time trend at the 10 % significance                       level. There is evidence against the null
of the trend stationarity                of qj at the 5% significance                 level in terms of G(I, 2)
and G(I, 4) tests. On the other hand, the G(I, q) tests with q = 2,3,4                                         yield
weaker evidence              against the trend stationarit y of q:.
         For q: between              Taiwan and Japan,               J(l, q) tests all reject the null of
difference        stationary.           The     J(l, 3) and J(I, 4) tests even reject it at the

   6 The     J(p,    q)    test does not require the estimation              of the long-run    variance     and has
an advantage        over the Phillips          and Perron’s    Za (Zt ) test and Augmented             Dickey-Fuller
(ADF)      test in that neither          the bandwidth         parameter      nor the order of autoregression
needs to be chosen.           The Monte         Carlo experiments         also show that the    J(p,   q)   test has a
stable size and is not dominated                 by the ADF        test in small samples    in terms of powers.
   7 Kahn and Ogaki (1992) recommend                      small     q when the sample size is small according
to their Monte        Carlo simulations.           Here, we chose g = 2,3 and 4. For estimation                 of the
long-run    variance,       we use Andrews’         (1991)    quadratic    spectral    kernel with the automatic
bandwidth         parameter        estimator    based   on AR(l).

1% significance          level.     When         WPI       is the measure of pt, there is slightly
improved        evidence    for the null of difference stationarit y for                      q:.     The J( 1, 3)
and J(I, 4) tests still reject the null, and only J(I, 2) fails to reject it at
the 10% significance              level.     On the other hand, we did not find significant
evidence        against the null of trend stationarity                  for both       q:    and     qtw    in terms
of the G(17 q) tests. a
        There is conflicting         evidence for the trend property                  of qj between South
Korea and Japan.            We found that the J(I, 2) and J(I, 4) tests cannot reject
the null of difference             stationarity,            But results of the G(I, q) tests with
q = 2,3,4        also support        the null of trend stationarity.                  On the other hand,
there is more consistent              evidence for the difference stationarit y of                          q:.        The
J( 1, q) tests with       q =     2,3,4      all fail to reject the null of difference stationarity
of q: at the 10% significance                   level. Only the G(17 3) test fails to reject the
null of trend stationarity                 for q: at the 10% significance                   level.    Finally, for
q; between        South Korea and U. S., both J(I, q) and G(I, q) tests with q =
2,3,4        provided    significant evidence              for the null of difference                stationarit y.
However,        there is slightly weaker evidence for the difference                            stationarity             of

q:     in terms of the J(1> q) tests.                   onlY the G(172)         and G(l> 3) tests fail to
reject the null of trend stationarity.
        Our empirical           findings      can be summarized               as follows.           First, the bi-
lateral exchange           rates contain          a unit root and linear time trend in South
Korea/Japan,            South Korea/U.S.                and Taiwan/U.        S. cases. And q; and                 q:    be-
tween Taiwan and Japan are stationary                            around a linear time trend,                      These
results are generally             consistent        with the findings           in Corbae            and Ouliaris
(1988) and Fisher and Park (1991) using the data in other countries.                                                 They
test the stationarity             of real exchange            rate based upon the null hypothesis
that nominal exchange                rate and price are cointegrated                  with the normalized
coint egrat ing vector            implied       by equation        (4), and found evidence                      against
the stationarity          of real exchange               rate.   Second,      the measure of               pt     chosen
in testing the trend property                   of real exchange            rate does not matter for the
long-run        deviation    of PPP for pt. Recently,                  based upon the data in other
count ries, Kim (1990) and Kakkar and Ogaki (1993) found more favorable
evidence        for the long-run           PPP when WPI is used as the measure of                               pt     than
when CPI is used. They argued that a large weight given to the non-traded

   8 We report the ADF test in Table 3 because it was widely used in the literature.
None of the ADF  tests reject the null of difference stationary for both q; and q: in the
Taiwan/J       apan and Taiwan/U           .S. cases.    In the following    discussion,     we only present            the
J(p,   and G(p, q) test results when there is no conflicting
        q)                                                                      evidence     between        these tests
and the ADF test.

goods     in CPI could be the reason that the long-run                          PPP     doctrine     based
upon CPI did not receive much empirical support.

Testing    foT    the trend property          of    private    consumption

        Given the trend property of real exchange rate presented above, private
consumption          in different countries are required to exhibit trends in order to
account for the long-run movement                     of real exchange rate under the station-
arity restriction.       Table 2 presents test results for the trend property                        of zt,
.zt, it and ;t, Here Zt and Zt are the home country’s                          real private consump-
tion expenditures        on goods (durables,             semi-durables        and non-durables)        and
services, respectively,         while it and ~t are the foreign country’s                  counterparts
of Zt and Zt, respectively,
        First, for both Zt and Zt in Taiwan,                     the null of difference        stationary
around      the linear time trend cannot                     be rejected     at the 107o significance
level in terms of J(I, q) tests with q = 2,3,4,                        and the G(I, g) tests with
q   =   2,3,4    all significantly        reject the null of trend stationarity              in favor of
the difference       stationarit y at the 1% significmce                   level. Second,    the null of
difference       stationarity    for both Zt and Zt in South Korea received                         strong
supports        from the J(I, q) tests, and the G(I, q) tests also yield significant
evidence        against the null of the trend st ationarit y for these two series, In
the light of the above results, we assume that both Zt and Zt in South Korea
and Taiwan contain a unit root and linear time trend.
        For the U.S. series of ;t,                 we found      weaker evidence        for the null of
difference       stationary     around        the linear trend.            Even though      the null of
trend stationarity        is rejected       at the 10% significance             level in terms of the
G(I, q) tests with q = 2,3,4,                 both J(l, 2) and J(1,4)            tests reject the null
of difference       stat ionarit y at the 107o significance                level. On the other hand,
there is significant          evidence      for the null of difference           stationarity      for the
U.S. series of it. These results are also confirmed                          by results of the G(l, q)
tests.    For it and ;t in Japan, there is mixed evidence                             for the difference
stationarity.       First, both J(l, 2) and J(I, 3) tests reject the null of difference
stationarity       for it at the 10% significance                 level.    Second,    the J( 1, q) tests
with q = 2, 314 cannot               reject        the null of difference       stationarity       of ;t at
the 10% significance            level.    They are consistent              with results of the G(I, q)
tests in Table 2. Based upon the test results on the trend property                              of ~t, we
assume that it in Japan and U.S. contains a unit root and linear time trend.
Since the G(p, q) test tends to over-reject                      the null when the autoregressive
root is close to one, the above findings can be viewed as conclusive                             evidence
for the trend stationarity               of it in Japan and U.S.


                                                        15
     Recently,        Ogaki and Park (1989) found significant evidence for the null
of the difference stationarity              for the U.S. data on ;t in terms of both J(I,                      q)

test and the Phillips and Perron’s                    Za (Zt ) test, and evidence                against the
trend stationarit y of ;t in terms G( 1, q) tests at the 570 significance                                 level.
They used seasonally             adjusted monthly data on durables, non-durables                            and
services    in National          Income      and Product        Accounts       (NIPA).       The sample
period     is from January         1959 to December             1986. When the shorter sample
period     is used (February           1968 - December             1986),     the null of the trend
stationarity       for it cannot       be rejected.          Given the mixed evidence                    on the
null of difference           stationarity     for the consumption             on durables          and non-
durable,         their findings are generally           consistent       our results.

Testing    for     cross-country      consumption           disparity

     If preference           parameters       and weights used in the construction                        of   pt

are identical        across home country              and foreign        country,    the cross-country
consumption          disparity     must be nonstationary                to account      for the long-run
movement          of real exchange          rate.     For this purpose,         we conduct          the test
for the cointegration            between      private consumption             in different        countries.
If domestic        consumption        and foreign consumption                on traded goods              (non-
traded goods)         are not cointegrated            with the normalized            cointegrating         vec-
tor: (1, – 1), then the cross-country                 consumption         disparity for traded goods
(non-traded         goods)     contains a trend component.
     Here we use the Park’s                  (1992)     H(p, q) statistics       in testing        the coin-
tegrating        relationship.     Park (1992) showed that the H(p, q) statistic                           con-
verges in distribution             to a X2(p – q) random                 variable    under the null of
cointegration.         In particular,        the H(O, 1) statistic          can be used to test the
deterministic        cointegrating        restriction.      According       to the H(p, q) statistics
in Table 3, we found much evidence                       against the cointegration               between       xt
and it (and between               Zt and it) for all possible pairs of home and foreign
countries:        the deterministic          cointegration      restriction      was rejected            by the
H(O, 1) test, while the stochastic                  cointegration        restriction    was rejected           by
the H(I, q) tests with q = 2,3,4                      at the 1% significance            level.     These       re-
sults are consistent             with visual impressions            obtained        in Figure       4.     Both
test results and visual impressions                    all clearly indicated           the cross-country
consumption          disparity     for traded and non-traded                 goods     contains      a trend
component.
      One possibility           for the cross-country          consumption          disparity is that the
intertemporal         elasticity of substitution            rises as an economy          is richer. There
are two approaches             to generate the time-varying               intertemporal          elasticity of


                                                       16
substitution.          First, the time-varying             rate of time preference           (Ot) falls as an
economy        is richer.       Facing the same real interest rate in the world credit
market,      agents wit h lower rate of time preference                         have more intent ives to
postpone           their current consumption               for future consumption.             Hence, lower
time preference           rate induces higher consumption                    growth rate. Second, there
is subsistence          level in consumption.            When the level of consumption                  is near
the subsistence           level, agent’s major concern                is meeting the subsistence             re-
quirement.           The marginal utility of consumption                    shoots off to infinit y, which
discourages          saving. When an economy                 begins to grow, agents become more
willing to substitute            current consumption               for future consumption               so that
the subsistence           requirement          induces an increasing            intertemporal        elasticity
of substitution.           For example,         Lin (1996) emphasized                 the importance     of the
subsistence          level of consumption,           and found that Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan       data provided           evidence      for this implication               for the intertemporal
elasticity         of substitution.     g

Testing      for     Jtationarity      restriction

      Given the difference                  stationarity    of qt, the stationarity            restriction      in
equation           (6) simply    implies that private              consumption           in different     coun-
tries is not cointegrated              with the cointegrating               vector:     H’ and they are the
driving      force for the long run movement                     of   qt.     It is possible    that private
consumption             in different        countries    is cointegrated         with other cointegrat-
ing vectors,           The hypothesis           testing strategy        here is that we conduct              the
cointegration           tests for private consumption                 in different countries         with and
without       the real exchange              rate included.         If the test results fail to reject
the null of cointegration              for the set of variables excluding                  qt, but reject the
null for the set of variables including                    qt, then the long run movements                 of   qt

cannot be driven by private consumption                            in different countries.
       Table 3 reports            the H(O, q) and H(I, q) tests for the null of cointe-
gration      for the four private               consumption         series,     When       Taiwan     (U. S.) is
designated           as the home (foreign)              country,      the H(O, 1) test fails to reject
the null of deterministic              cointegration         for zt, it, zt and 2t, and the H(1, ~)
tests with q = 2,3,4             also provide strong evidence                  for the null of stochastic
cointegration           restriction.        When     Japan is the foreign country,                 the H(O, 1)
test rejects the null of the deterministic                       cointegration          for zt, it, Zt and it

    g Using the Indian villages’ panel data, Atkeson and Ogaki (1991) found that the rate
of time preference is constant across poor and rich households, while the intertemporal
elasticity    of substitution       is higher    for rich households         than it is for poor     households.
However,      as shown in Lin (1996),          the subsistence     requirement    will drastically   change the
estimation         procedure.

at the 107o significance            level.     However,        the H(l,      q) tests with q = 2,3,4,
strongly     favor the stochastic            cointegration        restriction.
        We found       much evidence           against the null of cointegration                    Zt, it,       Zt
and ;f in the South Korea/Japan                        and South Korea/U.              S. cases.     Only the
deterministic        cointegration         restriction       in the South Korea/Japan                case can-
not be rejected         by the H(O, 1) test. There are more than a single source of
non-stationarity            in generating      the long-run        movements           of zt, it,    Zt    and    ~t

here,
        Next, we apply the H(p, q) tests to qt, x~, it, Zt and it, and the results
are given in Table 3. Using both measures of pt, we found little evidence
against the stationary             restrictions        in the Taiwan/Japan              and Taiwan/U.             S.
cases:     neither     the deterministic          cointegration          restriction      was rejected           by
the H(O, 1) test, nor the stochastic                     cointegration        restriction     was rejected
by the H(l,         q) tests with q = 2,3,4.                  Despite     private consumption               series
are cointegrat ed in these two cases, the above finding clearly suggests that
the private        consumption        in different           countries     can account        for the long-
run movements            of real exchange             rate and the private consumption                      series
are cointegrated            with the cointegrating             vector other than II’.           In previous
subsections,         we found       evidence      for the trend stat ionarit y of qt between
Taiwan and Japan and it in Japan and U.S. These results apparently                                               did
not affect the test results for the stationarity                        restriction.
        There is mixed evidence               for the stationarity            restriction     in the South
Korea/Japan           case in terms of         H(p,     q)    tests in Table 3. When                CPI is the
measure of pt, the H(O, 1) test fails to reject the deterministic                             cointegration
for qt, Zt, it,        z~ and tt.         On the other hand, the stochastic                   cointegration
restriction       was rejected       by the H(I, 2) test at the 10% significance                             level.
When       WPI      is the measure of p~, the stationarity                    restriction      was rejected
by the H(O, 1) test but cannot be rejected by H(l,                            q) tests with q = 2,3,4.
For the South Korea/U,               S. case, we found little evidence                    against the sta-
tionarity        restriction:     neither the H(O, 1) test nor the H(ll q) tests with
q   =    2,3,4     reject     the null of cointegration             at the 10% significance                  level.
Even though           cointegration        exists for the four consumption                  series, the dif-
ference stationarity            of qt and the stationarity          restriction together imply that
private consumption              accounts      for the long run movement                  of real exchange
rate.
        When we assume that preference                        parameters      and weights used in the
construction         of pt are identical         across home country               and foreign            country,
the stationarity            restriction     in equation        (7) implies that the cross-country
consumption          disparity account for the long-run movement                           of real exchange

rate. Next we present the H(p, q) test results in Table 3, First, we found sig-
nificant evidence       for the stationarity         restriction    in the Taiwan/Japan             case,
and weaker evidence          for the st ationarit y restriction                in the Taiwan/U.         S.
case: the deterministic         cointegration     restriction      was rejected by the H(O, 1)
test, but the stochastic        cointegration        restriction    cannot be rejected            by the
H(I, q) tests with q = 2,3,4.            Second,       the stochastic          cointegration     restric-
tion cannot      be rejected     by the H(l, q) tests with             q   =     2,3,4     in the South
Korea/Japan       and South Korea/U.S.               cases.

Cointegrating      regression     results

        In addition    to stationarity      restriction,      the model imposes              restrictions
on the sign of coefficients       in the coint egrating regressions.                Even tbough the
cointegrating     relationship      exists between            real exchange        rate and private
consumption       in different countries,       it is necessary to investigate               the sign of
coefficient    estimates as an evaluation            of the performance            of the model.      Ta-
ble 4 reports the cointegrating             regression results using Park’s (1992)                  CCR
procedure,      and Phillips and Hansen’s              (1990)    FM procedure.             As noted by
Ogaki and Park (1989), one remarkable feature of cointegrating                               regressions
is that structural       parameters,        aZ /aZ     and dz /&Z, can be estimated                  con-
sistently     by these procedures        without       the assumption            that regressors      are
econometrically        exogenous.
        When preference        parameters       and weights used in the construction                    of
pt are identical       across home country            and foreign country,               those countries
which experienced         an appreciation        in real exchange          rate have enjoyed           ei-
ther relatively       more rapid growth in private consumption                       of traded goods
or relatively    less rapid growth in private consumption                       of nontraded       goods.
For the South Korea/Japan             and South Korea/U.             S. cases, the cointegrating
regression results in Table 4 clearly indicate that estimates of at 0= and a= 0=
have the theoretically         correct signs, South Korea experienced                      mild real ap-
preciations     against both U.S. donor and Japanese Yen during the sample
period,     and zt – it and z~ – ~t exhibit               clear upward trends in these two
cases. Hence the mild real appreciation                 of Korean Won can be attributed                 to
more rapid growth both in Xt and in Zt for South Korea.                             Note that az /a.
measures the ratio of income elasticities of .zt and Zt in South Korea.                               The
instability     of the ratio across the two cases indicates                     that the model does
not perform       well in this aspect.        On the other hand, we had the theoret-
ically wrong      signs for estimates         of axe= and azOz in the Taiwan/Japan
case.     Unlike the other three real exchange                  rates in Figure 1, the bilateral
real exchange         rate between Taiwan and Japan exhibits                      a downward       trend,


                                                  19
which reflects the depreciation                   of New Taiwan dollars against Japanese Yen.
Facing the continuing               real appreciation            of Japanese Yen, private agents in
Japan are expected              to increase their consumption                           of traded goods                by in-
creasing     the imports            from Taiwan,           and those in Taiwan                      are expected            to
substitute     relatively       cheaper          non-traded           goods for more expensive                         traded
goods.     However,          Taiwan enjoyed             relatively       more rapid growth                     in both Zt
and Zf as clearly displayed                    in Figure 3. As a result, the sign of coefficient
estimates for Zt — i ~ and zt — ;t must change to account                                           for the declining
pattern of bilateral real exchange rate. That is, the substitution                                             effects can-
not be a crucial element in the determination                              of real exchange rate. Finally,
for the Taiwan/U.            S. case, we found that the coefficient                                estimates         of a.~z
have wrong signs for the following                      reason.        Since Taiwan experienced                         a real
appreciation        against U,S, dollars, the model predicts that private agents in
Taiwan enjoy less rapid growth                        in the consumption                  of non-traded                goods,
As displayed        in Figure 3, Taiwan had more rapid growth                                        in Zt. It forces
the sign of az~z estimate to change.
        We had consistent               cointegrating            regression            results in equation                (6).
These results at least make two points clear.                                 First, private consumption
can account         for the long run movement                         of real exchange              rate.       Second,      if
we take the restrictions                on the signs of coefficients                    imposed          by the model
seriously,    it is necessary            to refine the specifications                     of the model                so that
private    consumption           can deliver the reliable effects on the real exchange
rate.

Private      consumption         vs. government                consumption

        An alternative         explanation            of the long run movement                      of real exchange
rate is that of government                     consumption            expenditure         recently            proposed     by
Froot     and Rogoff          (1991).          The channel linking between                         government            con-
sumption       expenditure           and real exchange                rate can be described                     as follows.
When       a larger fraction            of government             consumption                 expenditure             falls on
the non-traded         goods        than does private consumption,                             an increase in gov-
ernment      consumption            increases the real appreciation                           of domestic            currency
against foreign        currency.          Therefore,           those countries            that experienced                real
appreciation        against the foreign currency have enjoyed relatively more rapid
growth     in government             consumption           expenditure,
        Table 5 shows the results of cointegrating                                regressions            of the real ex-
change rate on private consumption                             and government                 consumption              expen-
diture:

             qt =   axezxt      –    ‘Xez?t.      –   a.ezzt      +    &z fizit    +    Tgt    –   ?@t    +    V:,         (8)

in which g~ and ~t are per capita real government                             consumption                  expenditure
in the home country              and foreign country, respectively.                      If government               con-
sumption     expenditure          is assumed        to totally fall on the non-traded                              goods,
then the movement            of the private consumption                      of non-traded                 goods    com-
pletely reflects that of government                consumption              spending.         Hence, we expect
that the coefficient         estimates       of ~ and ~ are insignificant                          from zero once
the private consumption                 of traded and non-traded                   goods       is a regressor in
the cointegrating        regressions,        In general, we expect                 that ~ >0                and ~ >0.
The evidence       in Table 5 indicates that the empirical relationships                                       between
real exchange       rate and private             consumption            are not significantly                  affected
by the presence of government                 consumption              expenditure            in the cointegrat-
ing regressions.       The data show no evidence of the government                                     consumption
effects on real exchange rates. Some of coefficients on government                                           consump-
tion in the home country                and foreign country are not statistically                              different
from zero and are even of the wrong signs.                              The inclusion              of government
consumption   regressors in (8) has little effects on the estimates of aZt9Z,
   .
~Zf?z, azOz and &Zdz. This remains as statistically significant as before,
with the signs for coefficient              estimates unchanged.
       To access the empirical              significance        of cross-country               disparity           in real
government        consumption,           gt – jt,     in the cointegrating                    regression           of (7),
Table 5 also presents the results of the following                            cointegrating                regression:


                qt =   ~zez(~t      –    it) –   azoz(zt    –    it)    +   ~(gt    –   gt)    +    v;’.               (9)


We have similar results for the cross-country                           disparity in government                      con-
sumption        effects on the real exchange                rate as above.               The coefficients               on
domestic    and foreign           private    consumption               become      larger and even more
statistically     significant      when gt — jt is included.                   But the wrong signs for
the estimates of Xt – it and Zt – ;t remain quite severe. Thus, accounting                                             for
government        consumption           does not seem to overturn the result that private
consumption        affects. the long run movement                      of real exchange               rate.


                                   5. Concluding                Remarks

       The empirical evidence suggests that private consumption                                            in the home
and foreign       countries       provide     a significant            component          of the explanation
on the long run movement                  of real exchange              rate in South Korea and Tai-
wan.     Based     upon      the signs of coefficient                  estimates        in the cointegrating
regressions,      it seems that the private consumption                            may not be a reliable
fundamental        that has reliable effects on the real exchange                               rate.


                                                       21
     It is useful to incorporate      the supply-side    elements such as the pro-
ductivity   differentials   in a general equilibrium    model of real exchange   rate
determination,     and explore the trend and cyclical implications     from equilib-
rium relationships     obtained   in the model.   Since fluctuation   in the relative
price of traded goods accounts for a significant fraction of the real exchange
rate movement,      another int cresting topic for future research is to estimate
equation    (5).
