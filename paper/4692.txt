       This paper investigates empirically the possibility that a central bank could adhere to a

macro-oriented monetary policy rule while also providing lender-of-last-resort services to the

financial system. The method considered involves smoothing week-to-week movements of an

interest rate instrument so as to achieve quarterly-avenge intermediate targets for the monetary

base, with these specified so as to keep aggregate nominal spending growing steadily at a

noninflationary rate. Simulations utilizing weekly U.S. data are conducted with a system

consisting of a policy rule for the federal funds rate—one designed to hit monetary base targets

obtained from a quarterly macroeconomic rule--and an empirically-based model of the response

of base growth to funds rate movements. Results for the periods 1974-1979 (Sept.) and 1988-

1991 suggest that such a procedure could succeed in reconciling macroeconomic goals with the

provision of lender-of-last-resort services.

I.   Introduction

     The subject    matter of this session    is   the relationship   between the two

ultimate goals recognized by most central banks, namely, macroeconomic

stability and financial—system stability.1 This is an extremely broad topic

and one that could be approached by various distinct methods of
analysis——evolutionary/historical, welfare theoretic, institutional, etc.

But given my own experience relative to others on the program, it seems most

appropriate for me to narrow the scope of the assignment by focusing

primarily   on one limited but extremely important set      of issues.

     These issues, which are closely interrelated, concern macro—oriented

rules for monetary policy and the central bank's role as a lender of last

resort. Are macro—oriented rules——such as those advocated by KcCallum (1988,

1993), Meltzer (1987), or Taylor (1988, 1993)——inappropriate because of their

neglect of financial market conditions? If so, might these rules be modified

so as to overcome that neglect?         What are the implications concerning

lender—of—last—resort     responsibilities?          Does    acceptance    of   these

responsibilities require the operation of a discount window? Or could they

be satisfied, as suggested by Goodfriend and King (19881, by means of open

market operations that involve smoothing of interest rates?

     As here formulated, the answers to these questions depend to a large

extent upon the accuracy with which it is possible for the central bank to

hit intermediate quarterly targets    for the monetary base by means of an
interest rate instrument while practicing smoothing——i.e.. while avoiding
large week—to—week changes in the interest rate. Consequently, a substantial
portion of the paper is      devoted to an     attempt to measure this accuracy
empirically. As the econometric methods utilized are rather rudimentary, our
results must be regarded as exploratory, rather than definitive, in nature.
But estimation of a fully structural model is inhibited by data limitations


                                        1
  and identification problems, so our first—pass analysis may be difficult to

  improve upon substantially,   in any event, it will provide a starting point

 for further consideration of the issue.

      Organizationally, the analysis begins in Section II with an overview

 discussion of the broad topic of this session, a discussion which serves to

 Justify our attention on the narrower set of issues described above. Section

 III is then devoted to a backgrotmd review of some results relating to

 monetary policy rules, formulated at the quarterly frequency, in which the

 monetary base is treated as a policy instrument.      Section IV develops a

 framework for the study of a system in which quarterly-average base values

 are viewed as targets to be achieved by manipulation at the weekly frequency

 of an interest rate instrument. Basic simulation results pertaining to this

 system are given in Section V while Section VI takes up some alternative

 formulations. Finally. Section VII contains a brief recapitulation.

jJ Monetary Policy Rules for the Lender of Last Resort?

     Before focusing our attention as described above it will be useful to

justify that strategy by reference to the broader topic assigned for this

session: the relationship between the goals of macroeconomic and financial

stability.   The tension between these goals has recently been expressed by

Folkerts-Landau and Garber (1992), writing about the design of the European

Central Barth, in terms of the aphorism1 "A bank or a monetary policy rule?"

More generally, many economists have expressed doubts as to the compatibility

of a strict monetary policy rule——or in any case one featuring a monetary

base instrument-—with central bank acceptance of lender—of—last—resort    (LLR)

responsibilities,2 The achievement of a base path as dictated by the rule

would conflict, according to this position, with the need to supply liquidity

at times of crisis in accordance with the central bank's role as a LLR.




                                      2
         Recent discussions of alternative viewpoints pertaining             to the LU
 role——see e.g., Bordo (1990), Humphrey (1992), and Summers (1991)——have

 identified tour main positions. These are (I) the classical Thornton—Bagehot

doctrine, (ii) a "modern—pragmatic" position that calls (or more lenient

management of the discount window, (iii) the so—called "free banklng

contention that no public LLR is needed, and (iv) a "monetarist" scheme,

developed primarily by Goodtriend and King (1988), that calls (or LLR actions

via open—market operations rather than the discount window.3

       As most readers will know, the classical doctrine developed by Thornton

(1802) and Bagehot (1873) calls for the US to lend aggressively at times of

crisis,4 to any solvent institution providing good collateral, but at a

penalty rate (a concept discussed below). This policy should, moreover, be

publicly known to prevail. A major objective is to support illiquid but

solvent institutions, thereby providing protection for the banking system

rather than for individual banks.5 Actual practice of the Federal Reserve in

recent years has deviated from the Thornton—Bagehot prescription in a number

of ways (Garcia and Plauti, 1988).          Thus the Fed lends only to depository

institutions, rather than to any sound institution, and at rates that

represent subsidies to the borrowers.           It has not spelled out its policies

publicly and has apparently been willing occasionally to lend to insolvent

banks.      Summers (1991) expresses support for this sore lenient mode of

behavior,    expressing the opinion that US       policy   "is probably an   area where

James robin's insight that lit takes a heap of Flarberger triangles to fill an
Okun gap' is relevant,...        This   at least is the modern pragmatic view that
has   worked so far"   (p.   153). To the present author, it     is   surprising that   a

prominent writer would take such a sanguine view of U.S. policy in this
area. 6     Perhaps Summers' argument rests on a presumption- that         the massive

late-1980s expenditures by the FDIC          represented   only transfers, not lost


                                            3
     output.    I would suggest, by contrast, that       the   construction of a useless and

     unoccupied shopping center does not constitute output.              In any   event,   the

     desirability of the modern pragmatic view has implicitly been the topic of an

     enormous volume of analysis.7          it should be more useful for this paper's
     attention to be addressed to other viewpoints,

            Proposals   of the   "free banking" type have, despite the efforts of White
     (1984),   Selgin (1987), Glasner (1989). and Dowd (1989), received little
     support   among monetary economists in general.             Different writers on the
 subject have expressed different criticisms of the proposals. Laidler (1992,

 p.     192), for example, has suggested that "the very nature of banking

 precludes its being simultaneously wu-egulateci and               competitive [because of
 economies of scale in reserve holding),                and that arguments against the
 regulation      of banking based on the      assumption of competition are therefore
 inconsistent"          Summers (1991, p.147) follows Goodhart (1987).       in emphasizing
 that "the true asset value of the
                                                  bank's (non—marketed) loans is always
 subject to uncertainty though their nominal value is fixed" [the latter

 occurring because of the informational
                                                   advantage of borrowers over even the
 lending banic) and that "under these
                                             conditions, it will benefit both bank and
depositor to denominate deposit liabilities also in fixed nominal terms"

 (Goodhart. 1937,        pp. 36—87),      But "the combination ... of the nominal
convertibility guarantee, together with the uncertainty about the true value

of bank assets, leads to the possibility of runs on individual banks and

systemic crIses" (1987, p. 87) thereby requiring the assistance of a US.
Humphrey,      finally, argues that     "occasional shocks such as the threat of war
or    the   failure of a large firm
                                         may trigger moneyholders' desire to switch
from inside to outside
                             money" (1992, p. 573) which can only be supplied under
a fiat—money system by a central bank or US. These criticisms have been

disputed by the proponents of
                                         free banking but, as stated above, most



                                              4
analysts remain unconvinced.
        My own view is that   there    is an especially glaring weakness   in   the case
for    free banking that   has not    been emphasized by   its critics. That    weakness

involves the basic argument of free—banking proponents that competition will
induce profit—seeking bank firms to issue liabilities (bank notes and

deposits) that maintain their purchasing power over time because they are

redeemable in commodities or bundles that are designed to have reasonably

constant value, relative to a comprehensive consumption bundle. But it seems

highly    uncertain that individual banking     firms would in fact choose to offer

that type of   liability under today's conditions. The free banking         literature

is     largely written in a manner that appears to suggest that historical
evidence supports the questionable proposition under discussion, but that

suggestion is (I believe) unwarranted. For the principal historical examples

occurred during the era of commodity money standards, during which banks were

legally    required to keep their bank notes redeemable in the standard

commodity (e.g.. gold or silver coin).8 But the situation is, of course,

crucially different in today's era of fiat money.

       The fourth position mentioned above, that of Goodfriend and King (1988).

would retain central banks and their role as a LLR, but would have LL.R

activities conducted by means of open market actions.                 In particular.

discount window lending would be eliminated and with it the need for most--if

not all——of the central bank's regulatory and supervisory activities.                  The

main   point of the Goodfriend—King argument is that the job        of the LLR    is    to

prevent   systemic breakdown, not to protect individual banks.          But systemic
crises involve sharply increased demands for high—powered money. which can be
satisfied by open—market purchases without discount window loans.               Indeed.

such purchases will be triggered automatically in           regime with interest rate
smoothing, since sharply increased demands for high-powered money would


                                            5
  result in sharply higher interest rates if no central bait response were

  forthcoming.

          A number   of objections to the Gocdfriend—King             analysis have been put
 forth.   Pleltzer (1988). for example, has suggested that it would be
 preferable to retain the discount window but for lending to take place only
 at a penalty rate. "Even a small penalty.., would ensure that the lender of
 last     resort would do no lending except       in   a severe banking      crisis when (or
 if) markets      do not function' (1988, p.     445).       Furthermore,   Meltzer believes
 that regulation       and   supervision would not     be   required for such loans.     And
 his    "reason for insisting on retaining the lender—of—last—resort function             is
 to avoid catastrophes like that of 1931—1933 when the (Fed) refused to lend.

 Having penalty-rate loans (available) as an option means that banks have
 access to base money even if the central bank              repeats   its major error of the
 1930s"      (1988, p. 446).
        In   evaluating this suggestion, it     is important to consider what is meant
by a "penalty rate."           It must presumably not be a rate in excess of the

current market rate because the latter is the rate at which borrowers can
obtain funds.         What )leltzer has in mind, I believe, is a rate that is
somewhat above recent market rates.           An example for the United States might
be the previous week's average for the Federal Funds
                                                     rate plus 2 percentage
points (annualized),

       Under this interpretation it becomes clear                 that the Meltzer and
Goodfriend-King position are, though different, highly compatible.                      For
interest rate smoothing, as prescribed by the latter, would presumably never

permit the Funds rate to rise to a level as much as 2 percentage points (for

example) above the previous week's average.              At some lower value—-its exact
position depending on the precise smoothing rule adopted——the Fed would begin

to supply base money in virtually unlimited quantities. So the penalty rate




                                            6
would never materialize.                Alternatively. )deltzer's proposal would keep the

discount window open, with a penalty                        rate, and      eliminate the practice of

interest      rate    smoothing.        But market rate changes from week to week would

then   be limited by the penalty margin.
       Cagan's      (1988,   p. 256) main objection to the Goodfriend—King proposal is
that   interest      rate pegging       leads    to dynamic instability.'0 His argument does
not adequately distinguish               between interest           rate pegging   and  the use of an
interest     rate     instrument, however, the               latter      being the relevant practice.
And the analysis in HcCalluni (1981. 1986) suggests that there is in fact no

instability or indeterminacy problem in this case if expectations are formed

rationally, provided that the central bank's policy rule for setting the

interest       rate       instrument         reflects        some      concern for       souse   nominal

magnitude——i. e., possesses a nainal anchor. •
                                                                    ii
       Summers (1991) objects to the Coodfriend—King position rather strongly,

presenting three arguments. One of these involves a."reasonably clear lesson

from the (October 29871 crash period.                       It would not have been sufficient for

the Fed to keep the money stock growing steadily.... Their successful action

involved rapid money growth" (1991, p. 149).                          But this point is irrelevant,

since the Goodfriend—King prescription does not call for the Fed to keep

money growth steady.              A more relevant claim of Summers' goes as follows:

"The crucial point here is that driving down the federal funds rate is not

likely to be sufficient to stop prophesies that predict the failure of banks

or securities firms from proving to be self—fulfilling. A more ambitious set

of lender—of—last resort policies would seem to be necessary" (1991, p. 150).

But Summers's "demonstration" in this case is based neither on experience nor

theoretical reasoning, but on a totally imaginary "scenario" that he created

out of thin air and used in several places in this paper.                                There is very

little reason, consequently, to give any weight to this second claim.



                                                        7
         The only substantial argument put forth by Summers, then, is that
  "because   of the relationship—specific capital each has accumulated, reserves
  at one bank are an imperfect substitute for reserves at another. Maintaining
  a given aggregate level of lending is not       sufficient     to avoid the losses
  associated with a financial disturbance" (1991. p. 149).         But this argument
 again seems to miss its target.       The object of LLR policy is not to "avoid

  losses" but to prevent systemic failure. And "maintaining an aggregate level

 of lending" is an inaccurate characterization of        the policy under discussion.
        My conclusion from this review is that convincing refutations of the

 Goodfriend-King position     have not yet been presented.         Accordingly, that
 position    warrants further consideration, since it    offers a possible way for a
 central    bank to provide US insurance against financial system breakdown

 while generating little moral hazard and avoiding the need for an extensive

 regulatory and supervisory role. 12

        There is, however, an important gap in the argument of Goodfriend and

King that remains to be filled.        in particular, their analysis relies upon
the existence of interest rate smoothing but does not provide any evidence

that such smoothing can be practiced without
                                                undermining longer—rim attention
to nominal macroeconomic goals such as the avoidance of inflation.               The

analysis in McCallta (198i) provides theoretical support for the notion that

an
      appropriate behavioral rule might be feasible.       But there remains a need
for a constructive example, with some empirical foundation, of a policy rule
for    manipulation of an interest rate instrument that combines smoothing
behavior——and its    automatic LLR services——with a longer term trajectory that
achieves the objective of macroeconomic stability.           An attempt to provide
such a nile will be presents in Section
                                                   IV,     but first some matters
concerning   macro—orients rules require discussion.




                                         8
III. Policy Rules for Macroeconomic Stability

     In previous studies       I have explored       the. properties in terms of
macroeconomic stabilization——the avoidance of inflation and sharp          cyclical
fluctuations——of a specific, concrete, and operational rule for the conduct

of monetary policy.     (See McCallum 1988, 1990a, 1990b, 1993. )     The objective

of the rule is to generate a time path for nominal aggregate spending that
grows smoothly at a non—inflationary rate, with nominal CNP being the

spending measure used in existing studies. The indication of these studies,
implemented   for the   economies   of   the United States   and Japan, is that the
rule would    perform quite well from a macroeconomic perspective.        It would,

that is, result in a nominal CUP growth paths that are less inflationary and

smoother than those that have prevailed historically.

     An objection that has been raised by some critics of the rule is that it

relies upon the monetary base as an instrument variable.             Actual central

banks strongly prefer, of course, to focus their day—to—day operations on

short—term interest rates, such as the Federal Funds rate in the United

States or the overnight call rate in Japan. This preference arises from a

belief that day—to—day and week—to—week interest rate volatility would be

greatly increased if attempts were made to keep the monetary base (or any

other reserve aggregate) in strict conformity with the values specified by

the policy rule in question.

     But since the rule pertains to quarterly—average values of the base,

there exists the conceptual possibility of achieving these values to a fairly

high degree of accuracy while using an interest rate variable as the control

instrument on a daily or weekly basis.          And obviously this possibility is

closely related to the Goodfriend—King method for providing US            services,
which we discussed in the previous section.           It is conceivable, in other

words, that an interest rate rule could be devised that would provide



                                            9
smoothing behavior        and yet also achieve monetary base targets——now

 intermediate targets—-dictated by a macroeconomic policy rule such as the one

investigated     in my previous studies.      If the design of such a rule could be

achieved, it would then serve the double purpose of Ci) completing the case

for the Goodfriend—Icing scheme for the US function and also (ii) modifying

the case for the macroeconomic policy         rule   given In McCallua (1993) so as to

rely   upon operating procedures more like those employed by the Fed, the Bank
of Japan. and other actual central banks.
       In   Sections IV-VI,   accordingly,    a   rule for weekly adjustments of the
Federal Funds rate will be proposed and investigated using U.S. data.                 That

rule will be designed to hit weekly targets for the monetary base that will

yield quarter—average values for the base that are dictated by the quarterly

macroeconomic rule used in McCallua (1993).             The remainder of this section

will be devoted to an explanation of that rule, some results concerning its

performance in simulations of the U.S. economy, and the generation of

intermediate target values for the monetary base that will be used to

generate weekly targets for the exercise in Sections tV—VT. 13

       The rule used in my previous U.S. studies may be written          as in equation
(1),   where Xt and b1 denote quarter—average values of the log of nominal ClIP

and the log of the monetary base:

CI)         Lb — 0.00739 — (1/16) (x1_1 — b..1 — x_i, + b_,7) + A(x_i —
Here A is a positive policy parameter and Xt           is   the target value of xt.    In

my earlier studies for the United States the x values were taken to increase

each quarter by 0.00739, i.e., to reflect constant growth of nominal GW' at a

rate of 3 percent per year.        This value was chosen to give a time path of

realized x values that would grow at approximately the rate of long—term

annual growth of L!ii ClIP, since that would yield, an average inflation rate

of approximately zero.         The purpose of the three terms on the rule's



                                             10
right—hand side     are as follows.      First, the 0.00739 constant term is a 3

percent     growth rate expressed in quarterly logarithmic units.              Next, the
second term subtracts a magnitude equal          to    the average growth rate of base
velocity over the previous four years.                The purpose of that     term    is to
provide a correction for long—lasting changes in velocity stemming from
regulatory and technological change. A four year average is used                 to   avoid
incorporation of      cyclical movements in velocity.               Cyclical influences,

finally,    are accounted for by the     third   term, which calls for a stimulative
increase in the base growth rate £b when              the     previous quarter's value of
nominal GNP was below its target value.

        To determine whether the macroeconomic policy rule (1) could in fact

keep nominal GNP close to a steady target growth path, given the existence of

random shocks of various types, the researcher needs to conduct simulations

that include such shocks in a system consisting of the rule and an
econometric model that depicts the response of xt to the rule—generated

values of           The fundamental difficulty is that there is no agreed—upon

model-—in    part because the macroeconomics profession has not developed a
satisfactory    model of the short run   dynamic behavior of aggregate supply that

governs    the response of real variables to monetary policy actions, iS Because
of   that problem, my preferred method of investigation has been to determine

whether policy rule Ci) will perform reasonably well in a variety of
different models.       Thus my 1988 study of the U.S. economy included
simulations with two single—equation atheoretic specifications, several

vector autoregression (VAR) systems, and three models that were               intended to
be structural (i.e., policy invariant). These latter models are quite small

in scale but are designed to represent three leading theories of business

cycle    dynamics—-the "real business cycle" (RBC) theory of Kydland                    and

Prescott.    the "monetary misperceptions" theory        of   Lucas and Barro, and a more

Keynesian theory       (PC) patterned on the Phillips curve and price—adjustment

specifications of the Fed's quarterly lIPS model.
    Principal results for the U.S. economy, in counterfactual simulations
pertaining to the period        1954.1—1985.4,   are    summarized    in Table 1.     The

entries in this table are root—mean—square errors (BHSE)——i.e., deviations
(rca    the target path——in simulations with systems including rule (1) and the
                           16
five models indicated.          In each case the simulation begins with initial

conditions prevailing at the start of 1954 and continues with shocks fed into

the system each quarter, these shocks being estimated as residuals from the

equations estimated in the various models. It will be seen that for A values

in the range of 0.1 to above 0.25, the RMSE values are about 0.02            (that   is, 2

percent) with all five models.17 Thus performance is satisfactory in all of

these cases, and distinctly superior to that with A — 0.              Higher values of A

give rise to the possibility of dynamic instrument instability, which occurs

with A —    0.5   in the VAR system (and with A — 1.0 in the other four systems).

Rut with moderate values of A, the rule succeeds in generating paths of Xt

that are noninflationary and, in addition, somewhat smoother than those that

have obtained historically. A plot of Xt and the constant rising target path

of x for the PC model and A a      0.25   is shown in Figure i.18

        Recently I have come to believe that a strong case can be made for

expressing the GNP target in terms of growth rates, rather than levels

corresponding to a single predetermined growth path.                 The main reason is

that,    since   real shocks that affect the economy's natural—rate output level

are highly persistent, it may be undesirable to quickly drive Xt back to the

predetermined x path after shocks have arrived.               Instead, it would seem

preferable to treat past shocks as bygones, which could be accomplished by

adopting X:        X..1 + 0.00739, rather than      a        + 0.00739, as the target

value   for period t. This sort of rebased growth—rate target has been favored

by several economists, including Feldstein and Stock                  (1993).19   And the

suggestion of using rebased growth rate targets merits serious consideration

for two additional reasons. These are that instrument variability should be

reduced      for any given value of A and that       it   should accordingly be possible
to use larger A values, implying stronger feedback, without inducing
instrument instability.
        Consequently, in my study of the        Japanese    economy (HcCallum, 1993), I
conducted several simulations using a modified               version   of rule (1) that
substitutes x for x.             These simulations produced encouraging results.

They suggest, however, that an even •ore attractive rule would be one that

uses a weighted average of x and x, as the target variable. Such a target
                                                                 ..
would seem to provide most of the benefits of Xt without eliminating

entirely the tendency to drive Xt back to a fixed             path.    A large portion of
the   Japanese study was, therefore,    conducted with a target of this type.         The
                                                 .
weights chosen were 0.2 and 0.8 for xt and Xt so the target variable
utilized           •a
             was Xt = 0.2 Xt + 0.8 Xt .         The resulting simulations indicated

that RICE values relative to the xr path suffered very little deterioration

while    performance relative to the x            path was      substantially enhanced,
relative to the case with xt targets.
        Let us then consider performance with our five models of the U.S.
economy when            is used as the target variable.         Summary results for the

simulation period 1954—1985 and A =       0.25    are reported in Table 2.        There it

will be seen that RICE values relative to the                 target are only about 0.01

and that RICE values relative to the             path are not too far from those in

Table 1.        Furthermore, the variability of the Ab instrument is reduced

considerably relative to its magnitude in the simulations of Table 1, in
         .
which xt is the target.




                                           14
        In addition, for three of the models RICE values have been obtained for

 an   updated estimation and      simulation   period   that extends   through 1991.4.
 This updating is of interest and importance because         of recent shifts in base

 demand and because the evidence of Hess, Small, and Brayton           (1993) suggests
 that    the performance of rule Cl) with the x target has deteriorated in

 recent years.       The models utilized are the basic single—equation version

 (because of its simplicity), the VAR system (which because of lags is perhaps

the most difficult to stabili2e), and the Phillips curve model (which is

empirically the most satisfactory of the structural specifications). Summary

results with A values of 0.25 and 0.50 are reported in Table 3, with a plot

of the Phillips curve case (A s       0.5)   shown in Figure 2.     As can readily be

seen, performance relative to the steady x, path deteriorates              noticeably,
relative    to Table 2, with A — 0.25.         The higher value of A yields smaller

RICE values, however, as conjectured above.             Most importantly, we see that

performance relative to the utili2ed target, x? is almost as good as with

the shorter sample period. And since the argument above suggests that the

x.    targets   are the most appropriate of those considered, the Table 3      results
are   quite encouraging.

        We are now finally in a position to proceed with the main business of

this section from the perspective of the present paper. That business is to

generate quarterly time paths for the monetary base that conform to the

macroeconomic policy rule (1), in order to determine whether a funds rate

instrument can be used at the weekly frequency to achieve these base values

at the quarterly frequency. For that purpose, let us adopt the time path of

Ab implied      by the 1954.1 —   1993.4 simulation with A — 0.50 in     the Phillips

curve model. This model has been chosen as the one that is perhaps the most

similar to models used by policy makers while the higher A value has been

chosen since it     is   the more demanding from the perspective of our upcoming

 examination. Values of b for this simulation, which are reported in Table

 4, imply corresponding 6b growth rates that will be used in the next section

 as the basis of intermediate targets specified at the weekly level, with the

 federal funds rate treated as the instrument variable.

 IV. Hitting Base Targets with An Interest Rate Instrument

        The purpose of this section and the next two is to determine whether it

 would be possible to exert sufficiently accurate base control, as suggested

 above1   with an operating procedure that uses   an interest rate instrument and

 involves rate smoothing as a means of providing Liii protection to the

 financial system. Our approach will be to conduct simulations with a system

 that pertains to weekly data for the United States. The system will consist

 of a policy rule that sets weekly values of the federal funds rate, together

with a weekly model of monetary base determination that is intended to

reflect the effects of federal funds rate behavior on realized magnitudes of

the base.           The model will be extremely simple, but should give some

indication of the accuracy with which quarterly base targets can be achieved
while     holding down funds—rates movements, i.e.,      engaging in funds—rate

smoothing.
     The form of policy rule involved will be as follows, with time periods
referring to weeks:
(2)          R. —       = — eEb_1 —

Here a, denotes the funds rate (in annual percentage points) and b denotes

the log of the monetary base, both averaged over the week. The value b: is

the target value of b for week r.        The idea is that values of b would be
derived in practice from quarterly magnitudes specified by a higher—level

policy rule such as those generated by equation (1) of Section III.      For the

purposes of the present exercise, b values will be treated as exogenous and

one objective will be to determine how closely realized b, values track those



                                        18
for b. The magnitude of B determines the tradeoff between feedback response

and smoothing; small        values   imply a high degree of R., smoothing with

relatively little response to b target misses.               The possibility under

consideration is that, for      a range of B     values, feedback responses will be
                                        S
strong enough to keep b close to b while weekly LB., values are nevertheless
small    (say,   always less than 2 percent and typically much less).
        The second ingredient of our system, then, is a model at the weekly
frequency of the response of b to fluctuations in R.,.            In principle, one
would like to utilize a carefully specified and estimated structural model
pertaining to banks' demand for reserves and the public's demand for

currency.     Data non—availability and time constraints have, however, made that

infeasible. What I have done instead is to estimate a weekly univariate ARMA

model for        tb, which should serve to depict with fair accuracy the
autocorrelation structure and variability of movements in the base. A term
reflecting       current—week responses to changes in the funds rate R., is then

added to this relation, with the response coefficient being based partly on

values taken from Federal Reserve literature and partly on empirical

estimates. These estimates are generated from weekly movements in the funds

rates    and non—borrowed     reserves, by means of a procedure that will be
explained below.       First let us consider the univariate dynamic behavior of
b, the log of the base.
        Weekly ARMA models for £b have been estimated for five time periods,
including Jan. 1969-Dec. 1978, Jan. 1974—Sept. 1979, Oct. i979—Sept. 1982,

Jan. 1983—Dec. 1991, and Jan. 1989—Dec. i991. The estimates are presented in

Table    5.      In all five periods an AMa) specification was found to be

reasonably appropriate, but with point estimates that          are fairly different

for     samples before, during, and after the 1579—1982 experience with
"nonborrowed reserves targeting." In addition to the three         AR   terms, it was


                                            19
found that a moving—average term at lag 26 was significant in all five
         20
cases.        My interpretation is that this reflects some type of seasonal

aberration that is present in the data but not in the market relationships

that our AMA model is intended to represent.               This component will.

accordingly, be suppressed in the simulations reported in Section V.        The

same Is true f or a dummy variable pertaining to one observation at the start

of 1991, which will be discussed below.

        Examination of the results in Table 5 suggests that the three later

periods differ markedly from the first two, with negative coefficient

estimates summing to absolute values greater than 1.0 in all post—1979

samples.      Our firstexperiment, accordingly, will be based on one of the
earlier periods.      For the sake of sample—period homogeneity, the second
sample—-with exactly 300 observations——will be utilized.
        To complete our model, that equation is augmented with the term

-0.0O25M, designed to reflect the immediate impact on the base of the

open-market purchase or sale needed to bring about any programmed change in

the funds rate.     The magnitude of the slope coefficient was chosen on the
basis   of three different sources of information.   The first of these is the

rule-of-thumb relationship between borrowing levels and              the funds

rate—discount rate spread that, according to Cook (1989, p. 9) "the Fed has

long used." That rule of thumb is described as $400 million per percentage

point, but I would expect the ratio of borrowed to total reserves to be

related to the interest spread with greater stability. A $400 million change

in borrowed reserves would then amount to approximately a fraction of 0.02 of

total reserves with the latter being about $20 billion at the date (May 1981)

referred to by Cook. But a change in borrowed reserves brought about by an

open    market action would have an effect on the, base of about the same
magnitude in terms of dollars, so the percentage change in the base would be

 much smaller (and of the opposite sign).            Taking 8 as the ratio of base to

 reserves,      the 0.02 fraction in terms of reserves translates into about 0.0025
 in terms of the base. 21
         Our second     source of information is a slope coefficient in a "daily
 reaction function for the open market desk as estimated by Feinman (1993).
 The third column of Feinman's Table 1 suggests that a one percentage point
 excess       of the funds    rate,     over its expected value, would induce the
 open—market desk to supply $1461 million in additional reserves.                     Presuming
 that   the   desk's action is designed to restore the funds             rate   to its expected
 level,    this estimate appears at first to be      considerably larger than that of
 the previous paragraph.          But Feinman's quantity variable refers to the

magnitude of effect on the average value of reserves over a two—week reserve

maintenance period. So his value of $1461 million implies that this would be

 the magnitude of an action taken on the first day of the reserve maintenance

period, with the implied figure being only half as large for an action taken
in   the middle of the two-week period. Taking            this   to be   a "typical" day, we
get a    magnitude of $730    million per    percentage   point to be comparable to the
$400 million of the previous paragraph.            But Feinman's value pertains to a
sample period of Jan. 1988 — Dec. 1990, during which                time the average level
of   reserves was about $39 billion rather than $20 billion. So the fractional

effect would be 0.730/39
                                      0.0187 $billion/percentage point, which agrees

very closely with the 0.02 figure (pertaining to reserves) of the previous
paragraph,

        The third source of information is based on direct estimation of an

equation similar to the one being considered, but in terms of non—borrowed
reserves      rather than the base.       The reason that        we have not attempted to
estimate      this   relat ton with base data, by simply, adding a 8R term to the
ARI4A models of      Table 5, is that   weekly movements in the base are dominated by

 changes in currency or reserve demand rather than actions taken by the open
 market desk.          But an increase in reserve demand would tend           to produce an

 increase in the funds rate, so the estimated slope coefficient would tend to
 be positive rather than negative. With demand changes providing most of the

 movement, the response of concern is not             identified   in the data.     There is

 more reason to believe, however, that                 the relevant response will be
 identified if nonborrowed reserves are used                 instead of the base. And,
 indeed,    least—squares estimation over the period Jan. i974-Sept.              1979 yields

 the   following values (with n denoting the log of nonborrowed reserves):
 (3)          An. = 0.0012 — 0. 5471hn..., - 0. 23i2An..2 — . 2783An..3 — 0. 0190AR.

Thus the estimated slope coefficient is almost exactly equal to the
rule—of—thumb value cited by Cook (1989). in terms of reserve movements. So
division by 8 will         give   almost the same slope coefficient    as mentioned above

for the base.           The three sources of information agree quite closely in
suggesting a response coefficient of about —0.0025.

Here   e6 is the residual from the estimated equation in the second column of
Table 5, so our          simulation will feature shocks each period that reflect
estimates of the shocks that actually occurred over the sample period of Jan.

1974-Sept. 1979.24

       The other ingredient needed for simulation of the system (2) (4) is a

set of values for the weekly targets b.                      These are derived from the

quarterly targets b, generated by policy rule (1), reported in Table 4.                  The

quarterly values of b imply quarter—to-quarter growth rates Ab.                        These
values   have been divided by 13 to yield weekly growth rates b that are

                                                23
constant within each quarter but change at each quarter's end.25 Those tab

rates then imply weekly values of b. The target path so generated for Jan.

1974-Sept. 1979 is plotted in Figure 3.

        Finally, an adjustment needs to be applied to the AR}4A equation's

constant    term.26 The reason is    as follows.   As a   glance at Figure 3 will

reveal,    the base target values      are decreasing, rather than growing, on
average over the years 1974 — 1979.      But the   constant term in the estimated

tab, model in Table S is positive, since the base was actually growing over

the sample period.     In a complete model the average growth rate of the base

would be determined endogenously, but our simplified weekly system does not

include any component that would accomplish such an endogenization. That is,

the system includes no mechanism that would generate a positive relationship

between R, and tab, values at low frequencies——i.e., on average over long

spans of time. Only the short—term negative relationship is included. But

the average value of tab, generated In the simulation needs to match that of

the tab, targets; otherwise the weekly variations cannot possibly be matched.

Consequently, the constant term in the AB)4A model is altered to provide this

match.     In particular, the 0.0025 value reported in Table 5 for the Jan.

1974-Sept. 1979 sample is replaced with the value —0.000208 in the simulation

runs.

V.      Basic Simulation Results
        Let us now consider the outcome of the experiment described in the

previous section.     Some statistical results for four different values of 0,

the policy parameter in rule (2). are given in Table 6.          Before examining

them, however, it may be useful to consult Figure 4, which plots the target

path b (denoted LBTAR) and the simulated path b., (denoted IS) in the case

with 0 c jQQ.     Visual inspection will show that the rule is rather successful

in this simulation in keeping b, close to b, especially when the unusually

         In Table 6, summary statistics are reported for the following values of

 B 50, 100. 150. and 200. In the first row we have root—mean—square (EMS)
 values of the target miss, b - b, over the 300 weeks of the simulation
 period.       Since b, and       b    are natural    logarithms, the EMS value is a measure
 of the  typical error in fractional relative form. The second—column value
 0.00370, for example, can be thought of as slightly above one—third of one

percent.         The second row           indicates      in the same fashion that the nximum
deviation      of   outcome from       target    was Just     over one   percent   with a    —   100, or
nearly     1 i/2 percent with          9 — 50.

        But how much        interest rate variability is entailed? The last two                     rows

give statistics pertaining to M,                      i.e.,   simulated weekly changes in the
funds rate.         Since    )t   Is   measured in (annualized) percentage points, these
statistics      also have     those units.        Thus in coiumn two, we see          that   with   a
100 the EMS change is             about   37 basis points while the largest week—to-week

change     in the 300 week sample is 120 basis points.                      These figures do not
compare too badly with the                actual historical record of          Jan. 1974 — Sept.
1979k    the   actual   EMS value being 0.2i and the largest absolute change being
158 basis points (which occurred between June 26 and                     July 3 of 1974).

        The foregoing results are, I would contend, predominantly favorable to
the suggestion under study, namely, that it would be possible to exert
accurate base control with a procedure that involves smoothing——with its
associated LLR properties——of an interest rate                   instrument. In the simulation
with 0 — 100, for example, the implied degree of base control is highly
accurate and funds rate variability is not excessive.                       In particular, there
are no instances in which the required change in R from the previous week
would exceed 2 percent, the magnitude mentioned in Section II as a plausible

limit reflecting Meltzer's penalty rate or the Goodfriend—King bound under a

 regime with LLR smoothing.

         In this context it may be of interest to determine how much R

 variability would be entailed, in the model at hand, by exact base control.

 An answer can be obtained by replacing equation (2) in our simulation system

 with the condition b s         b
                               and using (4) to determine a time path for R.
 That    exercise indicates that the R?6 value for OR, the one—week change in
the funds rate, would       be 0.998       percent, almost three         times   as large as in
column 2 of Table 6.           The maximum    weekly change furthermore would be 3.64
percent—-again     about three times as large as with rule (2) and B =               100.

        Now   let us turn to our second selected time period for estimation and
simulation     results, namely, Jan. 1988 — Dec.          1991.28 The simulation system is

similar conceptually to the one used above and                  indeed   includes poLicy rule

(2) as before. The target path for b is, however, quite different: it rises

continually (though at varying rates) in contrast to the up—and—down path of

Figure 3.      The relation to be used in place of (4), based on the final column

of Table 5, is as follows:

              hb const.    —
                               0.6225Ab_,    —
(5)                                               0.38194b_2
              — 0. 23848b.., — 0. O025R. +

Here the utilized constant term        is 0.0024,       designed to match    the   sample trend
as explained above for         equation (4),          and the MA(26) term has       again    been

dropped for the simulation.           In   addition,      the   dummy variable mentioned in
Table 5 has been suppressed. This dummy was included in the estimation stage

because the St. Louis Fed's base statistics show a $10 billion increase in

the week of Jan, 2, 1991. which is then reversed in the week of Jan.                  9,    1991.

This spike would appear to reflect a year—end or some other type of
aberrational effect that our model          is   not intended to reflect.

        The same slope coefficient for the effect of hR., on base growth is used

 In (5) as in (4).       That specification has been retained to be conservative

 despite the suggestion of a steeper slope provided by a regression estlmate

 comparable to (3) but for the sample period 1988_1991.29               There are two
 features of equation (5) that need to be mentioned. First, the values of the

 AR coefficients sum     to   —1.257, a somewhat larger negative number than in (4).

 Second, the variability of e5 is——as shown in Table 5——considerably greater

 than for   e4, making   accurate   base control somewhat   more difficult.

      Results   of the simulations are presented in Figure 5 and Table 7.           The

 target path in the former is so different from that in                Figure 4 that
 comparison is difficult.        The statistic values reported in Table 7 verify,

 however, that base control is somewhat less accurate than in the 1974—1979

 regime for a given level of AJtT variability. Thus, a value of 0             50 yields

about the same R}IS value for AR as with 0 — 100 in Table 6, but the RMS

control error for b is 0.0074 instead of 0.0037.            Nevertheless, the results
are still reasonably supportive of the Goodfriend—King proposal. With 0 = 50
or 0 100, the maximum value of AR in the simulations stays below 2.0 and
fairly tight    base control is achieved. The actual sample values of R}45 and
I4AV for an., incidentally,     are 0.18 and 1. 14.30
VI.   Additional Results

      In addition to the basic results reported in the previous section, a few

more have been obtained using variants of the equations of the simulation

system.     The first variant alters the policy rule (2) so as to use the
average value of b: —     b    over the previous two weeks, rather than one week.

as the discrepancy to which the Fed responds. Because of the large negative

value attached to ab...1 in the AMA models (4) and (5). it seems possible

that such a change could reduce R variability without substantially
Impairing the extent of base control.           Results relevant to that possibility

are presented in the top panel (System A) of Table 8, where it can be seen



                                           28
 that there is not much difference for the 1974—1979 period, but that a

noticeable reduction in variability of R occurs in the later (1988—1991)

period,      with 0      100. for example,    the   Ri'S value for £R. is reduced from

0.529   to 0.469 and     the maximum   absolute value from 1.61 to 1.41.
       A second variant to the system involves a change                   in   the slope
coefficient attached to aR           in our model of base determination——equation      (4)
or (5).      It was mentioned above that our estimation of a relation like (3)

for 1988—1991 yielded a larger estimate of the slope than those in             the   three

basic sources of information.           Furthermore, the rule—of—thumb cited by Cook

(1989) pertains only to the slope of the borrowing function and thus does not

include any effect working through money demand——e.g. • any tendency for an

open—market    purchase and reduction in B.,        to increase the quantity of money

demanded. That        neglect   is   perhaps appropriate for a one—week response
coefficient,    but it   might be argued    that it tends to understate    the magnitude

of the response.       In any event our experiment in the middle panel of Table 8

presumes that the slope is —0.005, twice the value used above.

       With 9 — 100, the rule's performance is somewhat better than previously.

especially for the 1988—1991 sample period. But with $ —150, performance is

actually worsened. That outcome is somewhat surprising, since a larger slope

would seem to imply that hb would be more controllable via manipulation of

B.,.   But apparently the system becomes uncomfortably close to suffering from

instrument    instability with the larger feedback coefficient e.

       That problem is mitigated, however, when the averaged discrepancy in the

policy rule of System A is combined with the stronger response coefficient of

System B.      In the resulting System C, the performance measures (given in

panel three of Table 8) are almost uniformly better than those in Tables 6

and 7.   Indeed, with B = 100 they are quite favorable. This finding suggests

that other specifications of the policy rule could be substantially superior

to our equation (2), but a systematic investigation of that possibility will

have to be reserved for future study. The object of the present paper is to

explore the feasibility of a Goodfriend—King type of rule, not to attempt an

optimization analysis.

      The two sample periods utilized in our study were chosen for

reasons——concerning possible regime changes and conformity with previous

studies——that have considerable merit.           Several commentators on the paper

have suggested, however, that the study's value would be greater if the stock

market crash of September 1987 were included in the second sample and

simulation period.    Accordingly, additional results have been obtained with

that period extended so as to include July 1987 — Dec. i99i, rather than Jan.

1988 — Dec. 1991.

      With that extension, the estimated weekly AB}4A model corresponding to

those in Table 5 differs only slightly from the results in the final column.

In particular, the SE value rises only to 0.0038 (from 0.0037) and the Q(36)

statistic actually falls somewhat, to 38.4. With the MA(26) coefficient and

the Jan. 2, 1991 dummy variable again suppressed, and the constant term

obtained as before, the implied base growth model is as follows:

(6)       Ab = 0.0035    -
                             O.6436Ab_1 —   O.4038th2
              —   0. 2lS6àb3 — 0. 0025tR +
Results using the basic policy rule (2) wIth e values of 100 and 150, and
also the three variants introduced in this section, are reported in Table 9.

There it will be seen that inclusion of the October 1987 stock market crash

in the sample and simulation periods does not significantly alter the outcome

of our exercise.      In fact, the results are slightly better than those

reported for 1988—1991 in Tables 7 and 8.          That finding, which is somewhat

VII. Conclusion

      It may be useful to conclude with a summary of the foregoing analysis

and   results.     The argument begins by noting that a central   bank's dual

objectives of macroeconomic and financial stability imply a tension that may

be expressed in terms of the following question: is the adherence to a

macro—oriented rule for monetary policy compatible with satisfaction of a

central barüCs lender—of—last—resort (Lilt) responsibilities? In Section II,

a brief review of alternative views on the Lilt role indicates that a proposal

by Goodfriend and King (1988) might provide a way of reconciling the two

objectives. For the proposal is to have LLR assistance supplied entirely by

open—market operations,       with no discount window lending         but   with

high—frequency smoothing of movements of a money market interest rate.      The

point is that smoothing of day—to-day or week—to-week movements in this

interest rate would automatically trigger open—market purchases whenever a

sharp increase in the demand for high—powered money happened   to occur.    But

such week-to-week smoothing could perhaps be compatible with use of this

interest rate as an instrument for hitting slightly lower—frequency (e.g..

quarterly average) intermediate targets conforming to a monetary policy rule

designed to yield desirable macroeconomic performance.

      The bulk of the present paper constitutes an attempt to expiore this

possibility      quantitatively.    Previous   results   pertaining    to   one

macro—oriented quarterly policy rule for the United States are reviewed and

used to generate weekly intermediate targets for the monetary base. Then (in

Sections IV-VI) an empirically based weekly model of monetary base




                                      32
determination Is developed and simulated together with a federal funds rate

rule that      entails   weekly smoothing.    The base growth model consists of an

estimated ARNA equation        with an additional   term reflecting the response of

the    base to weekly changes in the federal funds rate, with the response
coefficient       based on      three   (compatible!)    sources       of     information.
Counterfactual     weekly simulations, in which the funds rate is adjusted so as

to hit base targets while practicing smoothing, ar. conducted for two sample

periods; Jan. 1974 — Sept.        1979 and Jan. i988 — Dec.    1991.        Residuals from

the AMA model are fed into the simulation runs as estimates of shocks

hitting the system.

       The results of these simulations are predominantly supportive of the

idea    that    the scheme under investigation would be successful.                     In

particular, they suggest that quarterly base targets could be achieved rather

accurately——with         weekly root—mean—square    (Rids)   errors     of about 0.5
percent——while     holding   weekly interest rate changes to less than 2 percentage

points in all weeks and with a RidS average of about 0.5 percentage points.

This last figure naturally reflects somewhat more interest rate variability

than has been experienced in the United States, but the increase is not

dramatic——actual RI€         values for our two sample periods were about 0.2
percentage points with a maximum of almost 1.6.
       It would admittedly be desirable in principle to conduct this type of

exercise with a more elaborate and more nearly structural model of base

determination.      But data limitations and identification problems make the

feasibility of such a study questionable.               In any event, the results

developed here should be useful as an initial quantitative indication of the

workings of a macroeconomic policy rule for the lender of last resort.

 1flere I have described the first goal as "macroeconomic stability" rather

 than "price level stability" since most central banks are evidently concerned

with the mitigation of cyclical fluctuations in economic activity as well as

the avoidance of inflation.      Issues involving the relative weight to be

attached to these two aspects of macroeconomic stability will not be

explicitly considered in this paper.


2See, for example, Summers (1991) and Soloi,s (1982).


3Friedaan (1960) argued much earlier for elimination of the discount window.

His proposal is significantly different from that of Goodfriend and King,

however, since it calls for a system with 100 percent reserves and does not

promote interest rate smoothing.       Other recent arguments for closing the

discount window have been put forth by Kaufman (1991) and Schwartz (1992).

4Since Bagehot's proposal involves a penalty rate, it would appear that one

could replace "at times of crisis" with "at all times." This implication was

not mentioned by Bagehot, however, and has also been ignored by most writers

on the subject.


5For a more complete discussion of Bagehot's position, see Humphrey (1989.

1992).


Store typical, I believe, is the view taken by Nakajima and Taguchi (1993).

7Although their main purpose is to present their own analysis and proposal,

Merton and Bodie (1993) provide a large number of references. A synopsis of

bank failures is provided by Goodtiart and Shoenmaker (1993).

As I have not provided evidence on this point, my statement is actually a

conjecture.    To develop such evidence adequately, would itself consitute a

major study.




                                        38
9Regarding this claim. Humphrey (1992, p. 572) asserts that "Bagehot

undoubtedly      would have concurred" I

10Cagan also      puts forth the argument that the incremental social costs of

maintaining the discount window (and reserve requirements) are low, given

that elimination of deposit insurance and its associated regulatory apparatus

is politically out of the question.

It might be         thought   that   a counterargument involving learning behavior,

rather    than rational expectations, has          recently   been put forth by Howitt
0992). It is my impression, however, that this argument pertains to pegging
rather than use of the interest rate as an instrument.
'2that     the     central bank's role in               providing    daylight overdraft
credit    to the payments system does not fundamentally conflict with the

Goodfriend—King proposal is implied by the analysis             of   Nakajima and Taguchi

(1993, p. 32) who conclude that "if the role of the central bank ..;                   is
limited to settlement risk, ...         [then)   hardly any conflict of interest would

arise between its regulatory responsibility and its monetary objective."

t3Some readers may ask why we do not simply             design an interest rate rule   at

the quarterly frequency to hit the macroeconomic targets, i.e.,               nominal GM'
values.     The answer is      that   the evidence in HcCallum (1990a) and (1993)

suggests that it is much more difficult            to   design an interest rate   rule at
the   quarterly frequency with good macroeconomic properties. Indeed, attempts

to date have been rather unsuccessful.


14The next few pages draw on the discussion in McCallum (i993).

'5For   additional discussion of this point, see McCallum (1988).


160n1y one of the VAR systems considered in McCallum (1988) is included.




                                            39
171t might      be noted for    comparative purposes that the RMSE value for the

actual historical path is       0.771, over 30    times as   large   as the cases with the

rule    and a   moderate   A. A more relevant comparison is the RNSE for the actual
historical path relative to a fitted trend line; that value is 0.0854.
18These results were developed in my 1988 paper. In McCallum (1990a) it was
found that substitution of an           explicit price level target, rather than
nominal Clip, is somewhat less satisfactory since it leads to an increased
likelihood of instrument          instability.     Also, a few       experiments with an
interest rate instrument were attempted. In KcCallua (1990b) the purpose was
to determine whether adherence to rule (1) would have prevented the Great
Depression of the 1930s.               Counterfactual historical simulations for
1923—1941 were conducted with a small model of GNP             determination,   estimated
with quarterly      data for 1922—1941.          The simulation results suggest that

nominal ClIP would have been kept reasonably close to a steady 3 percent

growth path over 1923-1941 if the rule had been in effect, in which case it

seems extremely unlikely that real output and employment would have

collapsed, as they did in fact.


19Such a target would result in a nominal GNP path that has a unit—root

component——indeed, that is close to a random walk with drift.                  But if the

drift magnitude were 0.00739, or whatever is the average rate of output

growth, then expected inflation over any horizon would be zero. Furthermore,

price level variability over practical planning horizons would not be

excessive if the variability of x —        x     were small.


20This term is not included in the third column results of Table 5,
which   pertain to the Oct. 1979—Sept. 1982 period.                  The   reason is that
it enters    much too strongly when included, suggesting a parameter redundancy
situation.

                                            40
 21The argument of this paragraph can be spelled out more explicitly as

 follows. Let 8 = (1/Th)dBRidrs be the parameter that is estimated as 0.02 on

 the basis of the quoted rule of thumb, with BR, 111, NBR, and rs denoting

 borrowed reserves, total reserves, nonborrowed reserves, and the                funds

 rate—discount rate spread. But we presume that the relevant experiment is an

 open—market purchase (sale) that increases (decreases) nonborrowed reserves

 leaving borrowed reserves unaffected.        The estimate of 8 is then interpreted

 as (—1/Th)dNBRjdrs        (—11TR)dTR/drs and therefore as —dlogTR/drs.      But with

 currency assumed not to respond within the week, we have dB/dTR —         I (where B
denote the base) so dlogB/dlogTR = (TRiB)dBidTR = ThIS.             Thus we finally
obtain     dlogB/drs = (dlogB/dlogTR)dlogwjdrs = -e(TRJB) = —0.02/8       —0.0025.

Feinman       (1993) reports a smaller estimated value for the sample period Feb.

i984-Oct.     1987.   But policy behavior during the 1988—1990 period should

be more like that of 1974—1979, since both of these featured        tighter control
of the funds rate.       During i984—i987 the operating procedure was one of the

"borrowed reserves targeting" type.

23This suggestion is related to a major theme of a recent
                                                          paper by ciristiano
and £ichenbaujrj (1992).


24A weakness of our procedure that pertaims to this sample period is as

follows.      Since our simulation exercise presumes that total reserves (not
currency) is the      component of the base that   responds during the week to open
market   actions, we are implicitly assuming that the regime is not one with
lagged reserve requirements (which makes the demand for reserves almost

entirely predetermined), That is of course counterfactual for 1974—1979.




                                         41
 25There is a slight           timing   inconsistency    in my procedure,     since

 quarter—to—quarter     growth rates based on    quarterly averages have been used

 for each week within a quarter.        But that is of virtually no consequence,
given the purpose of the present study——to see if the b path can be matched
by simulated b, values.

26This adjustment provides the reason why the constant term is designated
"const.,"      with no numerical value listed, in equation (4).

270ne   unattractive feature of the results     is that M values are predominantly

negative      over one long portion of the simulation period, and thus lead to
large negative values for the level of R.. But that is arguably an artifact
of the functional form used in (4): if a log—log function had been used
instead,      it would not have been possible to drive R negative.      I have kept

the scsi—log form nevertheless to avoid departing even farther from the Fed's

 rule of thumb" relationship between borrowing and the funds—discount rate

spread.


281n   this   case the initial date was chosen to coincide with that promoted by

Feinman       (1993).    A few readers    have suggested that     the   period   of
"non-borrowed reserves targeting." Oct. 1979 — 1982, would be appropriate for

the study.       My belief is just the opposite; the combination of a reserves

instrument plus a regime with lagged reserve requirements is extremely poorly

suited to monetary control and so would suggest much greater volatility than

would be experienced under a more sensible regime.

29For this period, weekly-average statistics on nonborrowed reserves include

observations only for every other week.           With      denoting the• two—week

change in R, the estimated relation is £n — .0017 — .4812M..2 — . i66SM._4
— .O33AR, with    = 0.314, SE • .017, and no evidence of autocorrelation in
the residuals.



                                          42
30Again we can find how much R variability would be required for exact base

control,   according to our model. The RMS and MM figures are 1.50   and   5.50
for the 1988-1991 internal, considerably larger——as one would expect——than
for   1974—1979.
