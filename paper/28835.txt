                                         ABSTRACT

As countries transition from facing COVID-19 vaccine supply shortfalls to requiring novel
strategies to facilitate vaccination, modern retail chains--often designed and located to target
particular demographic groups--are a potential vaccine delivery vehicle. Using geospatial data,
we quantify the proximity to vaccines created by a U.S. federal program that distributes vaccines
to commercial retail pharmacies. We then quantify the impact of a proposal to provide vaccines at
Dollar General, a low-priced general merchandise retailer. We show that adding Dollar General
to the federal program would substantially decrease the distance to vaccine sites for low-income
and minority U.S. households.

1        Introduction
While the challenge of obtaining adequate supply of vaccines against COVID-19 may per-
sist indefinitely in some locations, the existence of more than a dozen competing vaccines
in production or development suggests that many economies will eventually transition
from vaccine scarcity to vaccine abundance. Attaining herd immunity will require vac-
cinating the vast majority of the population. In a report issued before the COVID-19
pandemic and applicable to vaccines of all types, the World Health Organization (WHO)
Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) examined the causes of "delay in acceptance
or refusal of vaccination despite availability of vaccination services". SAGE endorsed a
"3Cs" model, identifying "complacency, confidence, and convenience" as key impediments
to vaccination (MacDonald et al., 2015). These factors can all potentially play a role in
delaying success of national COVID-19 vaccine campaigns and delay take-up of essential
subsequent booster vaccines.1
        With the transition to vaccine abundance, vaccination sites that maximize throughput--
for example, in terms of doses administered per hour--become less valuable in improving
vaccine coverage than alternative distribution mechanisms that encourage vaccination by
those who face barriers in getting a vaccine ("convenience") or who view vaccination
as either a low or negative priority ("complacency" or "confidence"). In this paper, we
examine the efficacy of distributing vaccinations through large commercial retail chains
using the case study of the U.S., one of the first countries to begin the transition to plen-
tiful COVID-19 vaccine supply. Because modern retail chains are often designed and
located to target particular demographic groups, distributing vaccines through commer-
cial retail partners represents a potential vehicle for providing vaccines conveniently to
demographic groups that might otherwise have low vaccination rates. Specifically, we
examine the U.S. Federal Retail Pharmacy Program (FRPP), a federal program that uses
commercial retail partners as vaccine distribution sites. While these retail store vaccine
sites do not have the throughput capacity of mass vaccine sites, they can improve con-

    "Complacency" refers to a belief that the benefits of vaccine are low. "Confidence" refers to concerns about
the safety of vaccines or vaccination providers. "Convenience" refers to geographic and other difficulties in
finding the available vaccines.

venience by reducing individuals' proximity to vaccines. Furthermore, while evidence
is scant, it has been hypothesized that "the inherent familiarity and comfort" that con-
sumers have with retail pharmacies could combat low vaccine confidence (Beem, 2021).
This partnership between the federal government and retail pharmacies does not have
precedent within the U.S., but it reflects the expanding role of pharmacies in providing
clinical services to patients in recent years, including administration of recommended
vaccines (Cassel, 2018). Studies in several countries suggest that, on net, policies allowing
vaccine administration in pharmacies increase influenza vaccination rates (Spinks et al.,
2020). Recent literature also demonstrates that the closure of a local pharmacy can have
durable impacts on patient medication compliance (Qato et al., 2019), suggesting a role
for distance and familiarity in adherence. This type of broad public-private partnership
for vaccine distribution is also, to our knowledge, novel internationally. For example,
while there are 11,500 community pharmacies in England, they are largely not used for
COVID-19 vaccines. There are only 1,700 total vaccine sites in England (Chakelian, 2021;
NHS, 2021). While the Biden administration has announced that 90% of Americans live
within 5 miles of a vaccine site, the British government has announced that the "vast
majority" of people in England live within 10 miles of a vaccine site (The White House,
2021; NHS, 2021).
   We use geospatial data to characterize the vaccine proximity created by the FRPP and
also to examine the disparate proximity of individuals of different demographic groups to
retail partners. We show that overall proximity to retail partners is slightly higher for high-
income households than for low-income households, a problematic finding, as the latter
group is more likely to face transportation challenges. We then analyze the distributional
implications of potential enhanced retail model. In March 2021, the director of the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the company Dollar General
(DG) confirmed reports that they were exploring a partnership through which COVID-
19 vaccines would be administered in DG retail locations (Dollar General Stores, 2021;
Boomey, 2021).2 DG is a low-cost "dollar store" retailer whose self-described strategy is to
  2
    To our knowledge, the idea for a DG vaccine partnership was first proposed by researchers at the Rural
Health Service Providers Network in West Virginia (Young, 2021).



                                                    3
provide low-priced necessities in a small store footprint, concentrating in areas that other
retailers do not find attractive (Nassauer, 2017). If an agreement were to be reached, such
a partnership would likely not ultimately involve all 16,805 DG locations. Nonetheless,
such a partnership has the potential to greatly increase the scope of the current FRPP.
We use geospatial data to demonstrate that the addition of this retailer and/or its major
dollar store rival to the extant federal retail-based strategy would demonstrably improve
the proximity of low-income households to their closest federal retail vaccine site. The
location strategy of DG--locating in low-income areas with limited access to retail--
creates an opportunity to greatly improve vaccine access, particularly for low-income
households.
        Our findings have more general implications beyond the U.S. As modern retail chains
optimize their product assortments and locations to target particular demographic groups,
our findings suggest that using retail locations to distribute vaccines provides govern-
ments a mechanism to exploit corporate locational strategies to bring vaccines to hard-
to-reach demographic groups. For example, there are similarities between the U.S. dollar
store chains and Oxxo, a retail chain with nearly 17,000 locations in Mexico that offers
convenience store items and cash services for the unbanked (FEMSA, 2019).
        Our paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses our data and methodology. In
Section 3, we estimate the equity impacts of using DG as vaccination locations, In Section
4, we undertake a partial analysis of state vaccine locations. Section 5 concludes.



2        Data and Methodology
Our analysis focuses on US vaccine distribution, where, on a weekly basis, nearly all
available doses are allocated to state governments or directly to participants in the FRPP.3
The CDC describes the FRPP for COVID-19 vaccination as "a collaboration between the
federal government, states and territories, and 21 national pharmacy partners and inde-
pendent pharmacy networks to increase access to COVID-19 vaccination across the U.S."
   A small number are reserved for direct federal vaccination efforts, such as those coordinated by the
    3

Department of Defense or Department of Veterans Affairs.



                                                  4
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). The program is intended to work in
parallel with vaccination sites established and supported at the state level (and using state-
allocated vaccine doses). The program is being implemented and expanded incrementally
based on available vaccine supply and as needs are identified in particular communities,
with select retail pharmacy locations providing COVID-19 vaccine to individuals eligible
for vaccination.4
      We bring together data from several sources. First, we obtain a list by state of FRPP
chains from the Centers for Disease Control (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2021). For each pharmacy partner, in each state, we match these chains by name to the
Historical Business Information Files from ReferenceUSA (Infogroup, 2005-2021), accessed
March 14, 2021. We were unable to match the pharmacy network CPESN, a partner in
eleven states, and MHCN, a partner in four states. From ReferenceUSA, we obtain the
universe of locations of these federal partners.
      It is important to note that not all pharmacy locations for a given chain (and state) are
necessarily providing vaccines. Moreover, some locations may be providing vaccinations
intermittently. This is because the supply of vaccine has been constrained overall at
earlier stages of the program, but also because some retailers--due to freezer constraints,
for example--can only offer a subset of the vaccines authorized for use. Thus, some chains
only offer vaccinations when specific vaccines are available. We nonetheless include all
of the outlets of these chains because the number of locations offering vaccinations is
expected to increase as vaccine supply grows. In March 2021, representatives of these
chains explicitly noted that more of their outlets will provide vaccines as supply increases,
a plan subsequently confirmed by the Biden administration (Barker, 2021; Robbins and
Weiland, 2021; The White House, 2021).
      We further supplement our analysis using vaccine locations found on state COVID-
19 response websites. State vaccine sites are dynamic; we use active vaccine sites as
of the week of March 22, 2021. Therefore, our analysis does not necessarily reflect the
complete buildout of state capacity, although we do include in our analysis announced
locations that did not have appointments available at the time of data collection. Some
  4
      As of April 19, 2021, all individuals in the U.S. age 16 and older were eligible for vaccination.


                                                        5
states also list pharmacies found through the federal partnership program; our analysis is
unaffected by potential duplicates as we select the closest vaccination site to each Census
tract. Additionally, these files may allow us to incorporate Federally Qualified Health
Centers and locations that we cannot match using the ReferenceUSA data.
       We obtain vaccine locations for 21 states that either post a file containing all locations
or present users with an interactive map of locations.5 Figure 4 contains a list of the states
and the corresponding websites we used for data collection.
       In order to examine the implications of a partnership with DG and a hypothetical
partnership with the other large dollar store chain, Dollar Tree, we download all of their
locations from ReferenceUSA. We remove from analysis a small number of headquarters,
distribution centers, and apparent non-retail outlets that are listed in ReferenceUSA.
       We examine the social vulnerability metrics for the Census tracts containing these
outlets and measure distances from the these retail outlets to households. We use the
latitudes and longitudes of the retail outlets provided by ReferenceUSA and map these
to Census data on households. Throughout this analysis, we use Census data at the
Census tract level. There are approximately 74,000 Census tracts in the US, with a target
population of 4,000 per tract. Some tracts were unavailable for processing, leaving us with
73,088 Census tracts. As is common in the literature, we will assume that all households
live at the geographic centroid of the Census tract and calculate the great circle distance
from the Census tract centroids to each of the retail outlets in our database. We use the
minimum-calculated distance for each Census tract to a vaccine location for our analysis.
Because vaccine eligibility was set by individual states until April 2020, many sites require
state residency, and allocations are at the state level, we calculate distances to the closest
same-state retail location; we assume that people located near a state border will not
obtain the vaccine at an out-of-state location.6
   5
     We collect data for AL, AR, CT, GA, IL, KS, MD, ME, MO, MS, ND, NJ, NV, OH, OK, PA, SC, WA,
WI, and WV. First, we download either the PDF, HTML, or JSON found on from each state's COVID-19
response website. We then process the files and extract the addresses. We then geocode each site using
https://geocode.localfocus.nl/. Our analysis includes "success" and "doubt" matches, and excludes "failed"
matches.
   6
     We make an exception for North Dakota, for which we have not found retail outlets of any federal
pharmacy partner that was listed as a partner for North Dakota on the CDC website.




                                                    6
       We also characterize the Census tracts within which the retail outlets are located.7 To
do this, we match each Census tract not only to the Census data provided directly by
the Census, but to the tract-level data on the Social Vulnerability Index 2018 Database
US (SVI) provided by the CDC. SVI is a composite of Census data used to identify
communities that may require the greatest support during, or following, a disaster; it has
been widely adopted by federal and state health officials during COVID-19 as a tool to
design vaccination efforts and to assess their performance with respect to equity (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry,
2021; Hughes, 2021). We are able to match 72,173 SVI tracts to the Census data.
       In our examination of the current composition of the pharmacy partner program, we
find 26,246 retail pharmacy outlets that belong to chains that are designated as pharmacy
partners in the state in which the outlet is located. Only a subset of these outlets are
currently administering vaccinations, but some of these chains could significantly expand
the number of outlets within the chain administering vaccinations as vaccine supply
increases. In matching to Census data, we summarize in Table 1 the proximity of various
segments of the population to the closest within-state outlet of the FRPP. We examine
income groups, racial groups, and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity.8
       Table 1 shows that the fraction of households within 1, 2, or 5 miles of a federal phar-
macy partner. The Biden administration announced a goal of having a vaccination site
located within 5 miles of 90% of American adults by April 19, 2021 and on that date an-
nounced that this goal had been achieved (The White House, 2021). Table 1 demonstrates
that the central role that the retail program plays in achieving widespread distribution is
smaller for low-income households than for high-income households. This is concerning
because low-income households are least likely to have access to transportation infras-

     To characterize race, we divide the total population into one of four racial groups: white (for which
we use the Census categorization "White alone"), Black (for which we use the Census categorization "Black
or African American", AAPI (for which we add the Census categorizations of Asian American, Native
Hawaiian and Pacific Islander), and other races for which we include all other races. We also characterize
the population as "Hispanic" or "non-Hispanic", including the Census categorizations of Hispanic or Latino
and including Hispanic or Latino people of all races.

tructure, internet access required to book a distant appointment, etc. That the majority of
these households are more than a mile from the closest pharmacy partner could indeed
create a barrier to vaccination. The table also shows a large disparity in proximity between
Hispanic and non-Hispanic people. This disparity in proximity is particularly concerning
as COVID-19 vaccination rates for Hispanic people have been shown to be low (Ndugga
et al., 2021). Furthermore, a survey undertaken during March 2021 identified Hispanic
people as disproportionately likely to report that they want a vaccine as soon as possible
but have been unable to receive one (Hamel et al., 2021). This suggests that improving
access could be particularly valuable for this group.
   We obtain addresses for 10,439 vaccination sites on state websites, corresponding to
8,455 unique geographic coordinates. The mean and median number of locations per state
is 403 and 275, respectively. There are a few outliers. The West Virginia file contains only
23 locations because it lists only state-coordinated vaccine clinics. Missouri and Ohio list
over 1,300 locations.
   The number of outlets of the major dollar store chains have more than doubled since
2005. Our data source records 16,805 DG stores as of early 2021 and 15,629 stores of
the Dollar Tree chain (which are branded as Dollar Tree or Family Dollar, following a


                                             8
merger of those two chains in 2015). While dollar stores blanket the continental US,
the coverage of the two major chains is particularly dense in the Southeast area of the
country and are particularly numerous in several of the poorest US states. DG is most
dense per capita in Alabama, Arkansas, and Mississippi, with nearly 20 stores per 100,000
population. There is also substantial density in Kentucky, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South
Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia, where the idea of using DG for vaccinations was
first proposed (Young, 2021). The other major dollar store chain, Dollar Tree, although
similar in terms of overall store counts, is substantially more dispersed geographically. It
is most dense in Louisiana, New Mexico, and West Virginia, with nine to ten stores per
100,000 population. State-by-state data are provided in Figure 5 in the Appendix.
   The rapid expansion of dollar stores in the U.S. has been controversial. One recent
report from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance refers to dollar store chains as "an invasive
species in America's left behind places" (Donahue and Mitchell, 2018). Activists cite
linkages between the variety of food sold at dollar stores and the prevalence of dollar
stores and obesity, although recent research has questioned whether there is a causal link
from dollar stores to obesity directly (Allcott et al., 2019). While a causal link has not
been established, some authors have argued that the influx of dollar stores cause the
exit of traditional supermarkets and grocery stores, creating food deserts, and numerous
localities have instituted regulations to curb dollar store growth (Misra, 2018).
   Whether the growth of dollar stores has negative impacts is beyond the scope of this
research. However, our hypothesis is that the criticisms of dollar stores derive precisely
from their potential advantage in a vaccine distribution program. If dollar stores are
more prevalent in locations proximate to low-income households than are other types of
retailers, then they are uniquely suited to improving vaccine access.
   The Social Vulnerabiity Index (SVI) was created by the Centers for Disease Control to
design and evaluate health and disaster programs. Updated every two years, the measure
is intended to capture "the degree to which a community exhibits certain social conditions,
including high poverty, low percentage of vehicle access, or crowded households may
affect that community's ability to prevent human suffering and financial loss in the event
of disaster. These factors describe a community's social vulnerability" (CDC-ATSDR,


                                              9
2018).
   The SVI is calculated using Census data at the tract level. For each tract, the overall SVI
index (called RPL-THEMES) "ranks the tract on 15 social factors, including unemployment,
minority status, and disability...." (CDC-ATSDR, 2018). The SVI index for a tract is a
measure from zero to one which reports the fraction of tracts that have an overall social
vulnerability less than the tract at issue.
   The stated intent of the SVI is to assist health officials in identifying those communities
that may--as a result of these characteristics--require additional support during a public
health emergency or other hazardous event. It has been used by states and private entities
to calibrate disaster response prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (Flanagan et al., 2018)
and SVI measures have been shown to be correlated with worse COVID-19 outcomes
(Karaye and Horney, 2020). During the ongoing vaccination program, CDC and states
have released data evaluating the relationship between vaccination coverage and social
vulnerability as measured via SVI (Hughes, 2021). The numerical value of SVI for Census
tract i is the fraction of all Census tracts which are less vulnerable than tract i. Thus, higher
values of SVI are more vulnerable, and one tenth of all Census tracts are assigned to each
SVI decile bin.
   Clearly, to improve vaccine access for those least likely to have easy transportation, it is
desirable to have vaccine sites located in high-SVI locations. We examine the distribution
of SVI measures of Census tracts in which pharmacy partners are located. We compare
these to the distribution of SVI measures for DG stores. We also compare these to the
distribution of SVI measures for the other major dollar store chain, Dollar Tree/Family
Dollar.
   In Figure 1, we show the fraction of all pharmacy partners located in each decile bin
of SVI, the fraction of all DG stores located in each decile bin of SVI, and the fraction of all
Dollar Tree stores located in each decile bin of SVI.
   The roughly 26,000 pharmacy partners that we have mapped are nearly evenly dis-
tributed across the SVI deciles. However, the highest SVI decile, composed of the Census
tracts estimated to have the highest social vulnerability, contain the smallest fraction of
the pharmacy partner locations. The figure for DG illustrates why it could be a valuable


                                               10
federal partner in reaching vulnerable communities. DG stores are noticeably underrep-
resented in the lowest SVI Census tracts. Strikingly, the proportion of Dollar Tree Stores

3    Evidence on the retail program and proximity to vaccines
Household income is an important component of SVI. It is well-established that seasonal
flu vaccination rates increase with income (Linn et al., 2010); lower-income households
face numerous barriers to vaccination such as access to scheduling technologies and trans-
portation (Schmid et al., 2017; Press et al., 2021). Vaccine take-up will likely improve with
greater proximity to a vaccination site, especially a vaccination site within walking dis-
tance. Thus, we examine here the proximity to retail pharmacy outlets of low-income
households. Following the Census, we consider low-income households to be house-
holds with less than $35,000 in annual income. We consider the proximity of the current
pharmacy partners to these households, as well as the proximity that would occur if all
DG locations were added as vaccine locations.
    In the continental U.S., 48.9% of low-income households reside within 1 mile of an
outlet of one of the current pharmacy partner chains. This may overestimate access if all
chain outlets will not supply vaccines. Access climbs to 60.5% if the vaccine were offered at
all DG outlets. For comparison, a slightly higher fraction of high-income households (with
income greater than $100,000 are close to a federal pharmacy site than are low-income
households, 49.5%. However, as might be expected by the high average SVI index of
dollar store locations, adding DG as a partner does not increase the fraction of households
located within 1 mile of an outlet as dramatically for high-income households as it does for
low-income households. While adding DG to the vaccine distribution program increases
the share of low-income households within a mile of a partner from 48.9% to 60.5%, for
high-income households the share within a mile of a partner is increased from 49.5% to
54.9% with the addition of DG locations. Similarly, when considering less than 2 mile
proximity and less than 5 mile proximity, a smaller share of low-income households have
proximity to pharmacy partners than do high-income households for each cutoff. Adding
DG reverses this, and a larger fraction of low-income households are within 2 or 5 miles
of a partner when DG is added to the program.
    Adding DG to the FRPP greatly improves overall access to vaccines, but proximity
improvements vary greatly across states. Figure 2-(a) shows, for each state, the share of


                                             12
low-income households located less than 1 mile from a pharmacy partner. On the left
of each bar pair for each state, the current pharmacy partner is shown and on the right
the impact of adding DG is illustrated. In some states, such as Alaska and Hawaii, there
are no DG stores and thus the figure shows no improvement (the two bars are of equal
height). However, in some states, particularly in the South and Midwest, the hypothetical
addition of DG to the pharmacy program dramatically increases the share of low-income
households less than 1 mile from a pharmacy partner. The raw data are included in
Figure 6 in the Appendix.
   Racial and ethic disparities in COVID-19 vaccine distribution have been identified in
the U.S. and other countries with otherwise successful vaccination programs (Paton, 2021;
Rosen et al., 2021). In the U.S., White and Asian individuals have been vaccinated at a rate
greater than their share of the population, of cases, and of deaths. In contrast, Black and
Hispanic individuals had, as of the end of March 2021, been undervaccinated by these
metrics (Ndugga et al., 2021). Improving proximity of vaccine providers to these groups
may help ameliorate such disparities. To explore this, we measure the impact of adding
DG to the FRPP on proximity of vaccination cites to different racial and ethnic subgroups
of the population. These are shown in Table 2.
   A few patterns are notable. First, while we find that a higher share of the Black popu-
lation is within 1 mile of a pharmacy partner than the white population, the improvement
in proximity of adding DG outlets as vaccine sites is particularly large for the Black popu-
lation. Adding DG to the program would improve the fraction of Black individuals within
a mile of a partner site from 53.6% to 66.1%. The improvement in proximity from adding
DG to the program is also disproportionately large for the Hispanic population relative
to the non-Hispanic population. The share of Hispanic people less than a mile from a
partner site is 44.9% without DG and 53.4% with DG.

Summary statistics for FRPP. Table entries denote the share of the total U.S. population
type within the denoted proximity to an in-state pharmacy partner.


   For Black individuals, the overall data again masks substantial heterogeneity across
states. As shown in Figure 2-(b), the improvement to proximity for Black Americans is
particularly pronounced throughout the Southeast and Midwest. Arkansas is one of the
starkest examples. There, the pharmacy partners are within a mile of only 10.0% of Black
people and 11.2% of white people. The addition of DG improves one-mile proximity to
32.3% of whites and 53.6% of Black individuals. The benefit to Black Americans of adding
DG is large in several Midwestern states, including Michigan. The raw data underlying
Figure 2-(b) can be found in the Appendix; we provide a similar table for the Hispanic
population (Figure 8).
   Dollar General and the CDC have confirmed that a vaccine partnership has been
discussed. However, given the high-SVI locations of Dollar Tree, it could be that Dollar
Tree as a vaccine partner would provide even better proximity to vaccines for low-income
households than DG.We examine this question by again measuring the proximity of low-
income households to current pharmacy partners and to Dollar Tree. We found that
60.5% of low-income households in the continental U.S. are less than 1 mile from current
pharmacy partners plus DG while 61.56% of low-income households are less than 1 mile
from current pharmacy partners plus Dollar Tree. Thus, Dollar Tree would provide
slightly higher within 1 mile access to low-income households. Interestingly, this finding



                                              15
is not true for wider distance bands. More low-income households are within 2 or 5
miles from the current pharmacies plus DG than are within 2 or 5 miles from the current
pharmacies plus Dollar Tree.
        The overall findings again mask some cross-state heterogeneity. As Figure 3 in the
Appendix shows, the share of low-income households within a mile of a pharmacy partner
plus hypothetical dollar store partner is, in many states, similar whether the dollar store
partner is DG or Dollar Tree. Dollar Tree's locations are particularly attractive relative to
DG in the West.



4        State Allocations and State Vaccination Sites
We find that dollar stores vaccine sites would substantially expand vaccine proximity for
low-income households, particularly in the South and Southeastern U.S. Thus far, our
analysis has examined only chains that are partners in the FRPP. However, as discussed
above, while some vaccine doses are allocated to this program, doses are also allocated
to states to supply the vaccination sites that states support. The state sites consist of mass
vaccination sites as well as any small pop-up sites organized by the state. While some
states augment the federal program by distributing vaccine to retail pharmacies not part of
the FRPP, others do not. While we have characterized the retail program as novel, and the
federal government's stated purpose for using it is to improve geographic access, without
direct evidence on the state vaccine programs, it is difficult to assess the importance of the
federal retail program (or a proposed partnership with DG) in improving proximity.
        To examine this, we scraped 21 state COVID-19 vaccine websites to find the full
listing of vaccination sites in the state. These listings typically included federal pharmacy
partners and Federally Qualified Health Centers. However, they typically included only
sites that were actively providing vaccinations when we scraped the site. For each of the
states, we match the listings with our current list of FRPP and create a listing of state
sites that excludes federal retail partners.9 Having constructed that set, we then calculate
    9
     The few federal partners that we could not match to RefUSA will not be eliminated from the state site
list by this method.



                                                   16
the distance of households to their closest within-state state vaccination site, using the
methodology described above. It is possible that some states offer vaccines at locations
not listed on their state site, such as temporary pop-up sites. We then examine, for low-
income households, the proximity benefits of adding the FRPP to the roster of vaccine
sites and the potential benefits of adding DG to the set of vaccine sites.
    Table 3 shows the share of low-income households within 1 mile or 5 miles of a state
site, the share within a mile of a pharmacy partner and/or state site, and the share within
a mile of a pharmacy partner, state site, and/or DG. States vary considerably in the extent
to which their vaccine sites provide substantial proximity to low income people. For
example, we find that fewer than 15.2 percent of the low-income population lives within
a mile of a state vaccination site for Georgia, Kansas, Maine, South Carolina, and West
Virginia. For all of these states, adding the locations of federal retail pharmacy partners
share of low-income households living within a mile of a vaccine site (state plus federal
retail partner). For West Virginia, proximity improves from 3.2 percent of low income
households less than a mile from a vaccine site to 23 percent including the federal retail
partners. For the other low-proximity states (Georgia, Kansas, Maine, and South Carolina),
the addition of the federal retail pharmacy partners improves the share of low-income
households within a mile of a partner to at least 30 percent. The proximity benefits of DG
are also not redundant with the state sites; adding DG to the federal program plus state
sites would improve the share of low-income households within a mile of a vaccine site
by more than 14 percentage points in all of the states with initially low proximity except
Maine. T



5    Discussion and Conclusions
In the months since its launch, the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program rapidly transi-
tioned from extremely scarce dose availability and narrow vaccine prioritization guide-
lines to tens of millions of doses available weekly, and open eligibility. Like the U.S.,
other countries that transition to vaccine plenty face considerable work delivering vac-
cines to those yet to be vaccinated, for whom navigating vaccine appointment registration

systems, identifying available vaccine sites, arranging for transportation, or other access
barriers may have thus far been insurmountable obstacles. The need for enhanced efforts
to ensure broad access to vaccines--and correspondingly high vaccine uptake--in low-
income and high-SVI communities remains particularly acute. Even following this initial
vaccination campaign, delivery of booster shots may create a similar logistical challenge.
   We show that using retail pharmacies as vaccination sites, as has been done in the U.S.,
disburses vaccines such that the vast majority of Americans are within 5 miles of a vaccine
site. We show that using Dollar General stores as vaccination sites would offer consid-
erable proximity benefits, particularly for low-income households, Black Americans, and
Hispanic Americans in several regions of the continental U.S.


                                              18
   While retail pharmacies provide proximity benefits, and Dollar General provides prox-
imity benefits especially for low income households, there are drawbacks or challenges
to using retail sites to distribute vaccinations. First, reports suggest substantial dose
wastage in the FRPP, though most of this waste appears to have occurred when Walgreens
and CVS, two federal retail partners were exclusively vaccinating long term care centers
(Pfeiffer, 2021). In addition, although vaccinations take place at retail locations, clearly a
retail pharmacy cannot achieve the throughput per hour of a mass vaccination site. The
use of dollar stores as vaccination sites would require addressing several implementation
and logistical challenges; dollar stores currently lack the facilities and employees trained
to administer vaccines. Nonetheless, dollar stores provide potential advantages, includ-
ing well-positioned locations, familiarity to local residents, available indoor and outdoor
space, and parking lots (in many locations). Some of the $7.5 billion for COVID-19 vac-
cination provided in the recently signed American Rescue Plan could be used for the
vaccine-related equipment and personnel needed for dollar stores to serve as vaccination
sites. While the logistical challenges of dollar store vaccine sites may be formidable, they
may pale in comparison to alternatives. For example, a plan to simply host vaccination
clinics in parking lots would require identifying appropriate spaces, negotiating agree-
ments to use the lots with a large number of parking lot owners, and communicating
the location of these sites with the general public. These challenges are mitigated by
partnering with a single entity that is familiar to the general public.
   If implemented successfully, the administration of vaccines at dollar stores would
not only provide the proximity benefits to improve the equitable rollout of COVID-19
vaccines and subsequent COVID-19 boosters, but it could suggest additional opportu-
nities beyond the current pandemic. Annual influenza vaccination similarly relies on
rapidly delivering vaccines to tens of millions of Americans in a compressed period, often
through the use of temporary large-scale vaccination clinics outside of traditional health
care settings. Reported rates of influenza vaccine administration are lower among low-
income older adults, the age group--as with COVID-19--at the greatest risk of severe
disease-related outcomes (Artiga et al., 2020). Such sites could be similarly variable for a
variety of other health screenings or services, including providing information and signup


                                             19
opportunities for state and federal benefits programs; many such benefit programs are
plagued by incomplete take-up by eligible populations (Wright et al., 2017; Finkelstein
and Notowidigdo, 2019).
   Enhancing proximity to vaccination sites is by no means sufficient to ensuring access,
equity, and high rates of COVID-19 vaccination among low-income and minority commu-
nities or the overall population, whether in the U.S. or in other countries. The potential
addition of advantageously-located retail locations like dollar stores as vaccination sites--
in tandem with the FRPP and state-supported locations--is a promising approach toward
strengthening COVID-19 vaccination programs and increasing their ability to reach all
eligible populations in the months ahead.
