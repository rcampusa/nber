Insurance Contracts when Individuals “Greatly Value” Certainty: Results from a Field Experiment
in Burkina Faso

                                           ABSTRACT

In discussing the paradoxical violation of expected utility theory that now bears his name, Maurice
Allais noted that individuals tend to “greatly value” payoffs that are certain. Allais' observation
would seem to imply that people will undervalue insurance relative to the predictions of expected
utility theory because as conventionally constructed, insurance offers an uncertain benefit in
exchange for a certain cost that certainty-loving individuals will overvalue. Pursuing this logic, we
implemented insurance games with cotton farmers in Burkina Faso. On average, farmer
willingness to pay for insurance increases significantly when a premium rebate framing is used to
render both costs and benefits of insurance uncertain. We show that the impact of the rebate frame
on the willingness to pay for insurance is driven by those farmers who exhibit a well-defined
discontinuous preference for certainty, a concept that we adapt from the u-v model of utility and
measure with a novel behavioral experiment. Given that the potential impacts of insurance for
small scale farmers are high, and yet demand for conventionally framed contracts is often low, the
insights from this paper suggest welfare-enhancing ways of designing insurance for low-income
farmers.

1        Introduction
An abundance of theoretical and empirical evidence identifies uninsured risk as a key factor underlying
the gap between the yields and incomes that small-scale farmers in developing countries actually achieve
and what is profit-maximizing. Risk reduction through insurance would in turn promise to close that
gap and boost small farm incomes, an observation that has motivated recent efforts to design and
promote small farm-friendly index insurance1 contracts (see the reviews in Carter et al. (2017), Jensen
and Barrett (2016), and Miranda and Farrin (2012); De Bock and Darwin Ugarte (2013)). While
the empirical evidence that risk reduction can close the gap is still modest, it consistently shows that
insurance boosts investment at both the intensive and extensive margins.2
        Despite this compelling theoretical logic and empirical evidence, insurance is an unusual commodity
in that it has a certain cost, but an uncertain benefit.3 It is perhaps not surprising that the effectiveness
of insurance projects has often been constrained by low levels of farmer demand explained in part by
farmers’ lack of understanding (see Giné and Yang (2009), Cole et al. (2013), and Vargas Hill and Robles
(2011)). Communicating the idea of insurance to a never before insured population is a non-trivial
exercise. Small farm insurance projects have employed a variety of educational tools to communicate
this core idea of insurance as a commodity with a certain annual premium cost, but an uncertain
benefit that may occur in the future (for example, see the experimental games in Lybbert et al. (2010)).
While communicating this key feature of insurance is necessary to avoid misunderstanding and unhappy
insurance clients,4 this sharp educational juxtaposition of certain costs and uncertain benefits puts a
premium on understanding how individuals make choices when considering tradeoffs between certain
costs and uncertain benefits.
        A number of theoretical studies have used the workhorse expected utility approach to consider the
    1
      In contrast to conventional agricultural insurance that pays indemnities based on farm level loss reports and verifica-
tion, index insurance issues payments based on the level of an index (for example average yields in a locality or rainfall)
that is correlated with but not identical to individual losses. Reliance on an index reduces transactions costs while con-
trolling moral hazard and adverse selection. At the same time, it introduces the prospect of contract failure (or basis
risk), meaning that an individual farmer experiences a loss but is not compensated because the insurance index does not
reveal a loss.
    2
      For example, see the studies by Cai et al. (2015), Elabed and Carter (2017), Karlan et al. (2014), Janzen and Carter
(2018), Jensen et al. (2017) and Mobarak and Rosenzweig (2014). Complementing this work, Emrick et al. (2016) shows
that a risk-reducing agronomic technology (a flood tolerant trait rice) has an impact on farmer investment similar to that
of insurance.
    3
      Indeed, insurance is the one commodity that you buy, but you would prefer to get nothing tangible in return (since
in the presence of deductible, getting an insurance payment means that the individual is worse off than if she had not
qualified for a payment).
    4
      An early agricultural insurance project by the Indian microfinance institution BASIX fell apart after its first year in
which farmers received no indemnity payments as the harvest was good, but felt cheated because they had purchased
something and gotten nothing tangible in return.


                                                             1
demand for index insurance. Given the probability that an index insurance may fail (see footnote 1), the
pattern of demand for index insurance and its interaction with risk aversion is more complex than under
a perfect insurance contract. As Clarke (2011) and Carter et al. (2016) show, demand may evaporate
depending on the pattern of basis risk and its interaction with risk aversion. Mobarak and Rosenzweig
(2013) corroborate this intuition with empirical evidence that demand for rainfall-based index insurance
softens as farmers are further away from the rainfall station on which the index is based.
       While analysis based on conventional expected utility theory offers important insights on the demand
for index insurance, there are rich theoretical and behavioral literatures that question the adequacy of
the expected utility approach as a way to understand behavior in the face of risk and uncertainty. Two
recent contributions, Bryan (2018) and Elabed and Carter (2015), draw on the notion of ambiguity
aversion to study the demand for index insurance by small-scale farmers. The latter paper, for example,
notes that the presence of basis risk means that index insurance presents itself to the farmer as a
compound lottery.5 Drawing on the smooth model of ambiguity aversion, Elabed and Carter (2015)
show that basis risk depresses demand much more sharply than what an expected utility model would
predict.
       In this paper, we take a rather different approach to the problem of muted demand for agricultural
insurance by low wealth farmers who would otherwise seem to benefit from it. We abstract from the
basis risk problem and instead focus on the adequacy of expected utility theory to study demand for
insurance, a good which, as conventionally framed, offers uncertain benefits in exchange for certain costs.
We draw heavily on the insights from Allais (1953) and their subsequent formalization by Andreoni and
Sprenger (2010).
       To explain the paradoxical departures from expected utility theory that bear his name, Allais (1953)
notes that people “greatly value certainty” and depart from the postulates of expected utility theory
(only) when comparing certain with uncertain outcomes. While the Allais paradox has helped motivate a
more general rethinking of behavior under risk, his observations also suggest that emphasizing the certain
cost of the premium versus the uncertain or stochastic benefits of insurance may make such contracts
decidedly unappealing to individuals who greatly value certainty. Motivated by this observation, we
carried out an incentivized willingness to pay for insurance experiment designed to explore if making
the premium also uncertain might enhance demand for insurance.
       In the experiment, farmers, who lived in an area of Burkina Faso where an insurance contract was
available, were randomly offered either a conventional insurance contract (the premium is always paid,
   5
    A first lottery determines whether the individual undergoes a negative shock and a second lottery whether the index
triggers an insurance payment. Basis risk implies that the experience of a negative shock is not perfectly correlated with
an insurance payment.



                                                            2
and indemnities are received only in bad years) or an unconventional premium rebate frame in which
the payment of the premium is uncertain as it is forgiven in bad years.6 While the two contracts were
actuarially identical, differing only in their framing, average willingness to pay for rebate frame was
10% higher. Moreover, the rebate framing pushed average willingness to pay from 150% to 165% of
the actuarially fair price, an important difference given that small farm index insurance contracts are
offered at prices in excess of 150% of the actuarially fair value.
       While this result is inexplicable from a standard expected utility perspective, this paper digs deeper
to see if this behavior reflects something fundamental about certainty preferences. In particular we
build on the u − v model of Nielson (1992), Schmidt (1998) and Diecidue et al. (2004) that gives a
parsimonious way to model behavior when individuals greatly value certainty.
       Based on this model, we implemented a set of incentivized lotteries designed to elicit whether or not
individuals greatly value certainty, exhibiting what Andreoni and Sprenger (2010) call a discontinuous
preference for certainty (or DPC). By comparing individuals’ decisions when choosing between a more
risky and a less risky lottery with their play when choosing between the more risky and a degenerate or
sure thing “lottery,” we identify which individuals greatly value certainty in the sense of Allais (1953).
We find that some 30% of the experimental participants exhibit a DPC. In addition, we find that the
10% average treatment effect of the rebate frame on willingness to pay for insurance is driven by the
preferences of these DPC individuals. In particular, DPC famers’ willingness to pay for insurance rises
from 135% of the actuarially fair price under the standard frame to 176% of the actuarially fair price
when presented with the rebate frame. In contrast, for non-DPC farmers, the impact of the rebate
frame is small (5 percentage points) and statistically insignificant.
       The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the classic Allais paradox
and its relationship to the micrinsurance insurance demand problem. Section 3 describes the insurance
willingness to pay game and the average treatment effects of offering the premium rebate frame. Section
4 then uses the u − v utility framework to formalize Allais’ insights, opening the door to measurement
of a great or discontinuous preference for certainty. Section 5 describes the matched set of lotteries used
to measure individuals’ preference for certainty and then conducts the heterogeneity analysis of the
insurance game based on whether or not individuals have a DPC. Section 6 concludes by summarizing
the potential for the insights of this paper to boost insurance uptake in West Africa and improve the
well-being of small-farm families.
   6
    In the Burkina cotton insurance pilot, the insurance premium is financed for the farmer as part of a loan package and
hence a premium rebate would exempt the farmer from having to pay the premium at all.

2    The Allais Paradox and the Allure of Certainty
In a seminal contribution, Allais (1953) noted that most people routinely violate the predictions of
conventional expected utility theory when comparing choices between two risky outcomes versus choices
between a risky and a certain outcome. Table 1 presents the experiments used by Allais to illustrate
this violation of expected utility theory. He notes that when given the choice between lotteries 1A and
1B, most people will select 1B. From an expected utility perspective, this revealed preference implies

                           0.89u(0) + 0.11u($1m) < 0.90u(0) + 0.10u($5m).                            (1)

After subtracting out the common consequence of 0.89u(0), expression (1) can be rewritten as:

                                 0.11u($1m) < 0.01u(0) + 0.10u($5m).                                 (2)

In other words, for those preferring 1B to 1A, an 11% chance of $1m is valued less than a 10% chance
of $5m and a 1% chance of nothing.

                                     Table 1: The Allais Paradox

                   Experiment 1                                             Experiment 2
        Lottery 1A                Lottery 1B                    Lottery 2A                Lottery 2B
  Pay-offs   Probabilities  Pay-offs   Probabilities      Pay-offs   Probabilities  Pay-offs   Probabilities
     0           89%           0           90%                                         0            1%
 $1 million      11%                                     $1 million      100%      $1 million      89%
                           $5 million      10%                                     $5 million      10%

    And yet despite this preference, Allais notes that when presented with the alternative pair 2A and
2B in Table 1, most people will choose 2A, imply from an expected utility perspective that:

                           1u($1m) > 0.01u(0) + 0.89u($1m) + 0.10u($5m),                             (3)

which after subtracting the common consequence of 0.89u($1M ) can be rewritten as:

                                 0.11u($1m) > 0.01u(0) + 0.10u($5m).                                 (4)

In other words, when confronted with this second set of lotteries, people behave as if an 11% chance of
$1m is valued more than a 10% chance of $5m and a 1% chance of nothing.
    A fundamental difference between the two pairs of lotteries is of course that in lottery 2A, the 11%

                                                   4
chance of $1m is attached to the sure thing of getting $1m. The simple and undeniable allure of $1m
with certainty is part of what makes the Allais paradox convincing as a demonstration of the weakness
of expected utility theory.
    But what might the not so subtle allure of certainty have to do with the demand for insurance? As
discussed in the introduction above, insurance contracts as conventionally structured offer an uncertain
benefit in return for a certain cost. If the bad thing about insurance (its cost) is overvalued by those
who greatly value certainty, then we might anticipate that insurance demand will be less than expected
utility theory predicts. Relatedly, making the cost of insurance uncertain might boost the demand for
insurance by blunting the subjective overvaluation of the premium by individuals who greatly value
certainty. The next section explores this hypothesis with a field experiment implemented with cotton
farmers in the West African country of Burkina Faso.


3     Willingness to Pay for Insurance when Premium Payment is Uncer-
      tain
A standard insurance contract involves a premium paid with certainty and indemnities obtained only
in the bad states of nature. To make the premium payment uncertain, we devised a premium rebate
frame for insurance in which the premium is paid only in good states of the world, while the premium
is rebated in bad states of the world (indemnities were adjusted downward to make the rebate contract
actuarially identical to the standard contract). Under this rebate framing, the payment of the premium
is uncertain, just like the transfer of indemnities. This subtle shift is intended to place the costs and
benefits of insurance on the same psychological plane for individuals who greatly value certainty in the
sense of Allais.
    To explore whether a rebate frame affects insurance demand, we designed and implemented an
incentivized agricultural insurance game that allows measurement of famers’ willingness to pay for
insurance. Randomly allocating participating farmers to either the standard framing or the rebate
frame allows measurement of the impact of the novel rebate frame on willingness to pay for insurance.
The remainder of this section explains the basic experimental procedures and the core results.

3.1    Research Site and Design
Burkina Faso and its landlocked West African neighbors remain heavily dependent on agricultural
production, with cotton being the leading source of export earnings and the source of livelihood for
many rural families (Vitale (2018)). In Burkina, cotton production is organized around village-level,


                                                   5
joint liability borrowing groups called GPCs (Groupes de Producteurs de Coton).7 Building on an earlier
insurance pilot project in neighboring Mali, which showed that low basis risk area yield insurance could
substantially boost cotton production amongst smallholder farmers (see Elabed et al. (2013) and Elabed
and Carter (2017)), cotton insurance was introduced in Burkina Faso on an experimental basis in 2014.8
Given the tepid demand for agricultural insurance found in the studies mentioned above, the willingness
to pay game was designed in an effort to identify contractual alternatives that could ultimately be
implemented and meet with more buoyant farmer demand.
       We ran the insurance games with 56 randomly selected GPCs in the provinces of Tuy and Bale in
the South-West of Burkina-Faso in January and February 2014. Within each GPC, thirteen farmers
were randomly chosen to be part of the base-line survey for the impact evaluation of the experimental
insurance program. After completing the baseline survey, farmers were invited to participate in the
insurance games. Of the 728 farmers invited, 571 accepted the invitation and played the games. Half
of the GPC were randomly selected for the standard insurance contract framing, with the other half
randomized into the novel rebate frame, creating a clustered experimental design.
       The first two columns of Table 2 display the characteristics of those participating farmers allocated
to the standard and the rebate frame. The experiment appears well balanced as the average economic
and social characteristics of participants do not differ between the experimental assignments. Given
that only 78% of invited farmers played the game, we also compare the characteristics of participants
with those who were invited but chose not to participate in the games (note that we have information
on non-participating farmers from the baseline survey for the insurance impact evaluation).9 As can
also be seen in Table 2, along observable dimensions non-participants are on average indistinguishable
from participants except that GPC leadership is overrepresented in the participant group. Given that
insurance decisions are made by GPC as a group, the over-representation of individuals in leadership
positions arguably enhances the relevance of the results for actual insurance demand.
   7
     Since the time of the field work, the GPC were given formal legal status as cooperatives and are now called SCOOPs
(Société Coopérative de Producteurs de Coton).
   8
     Stoeffler et al. (2018) describe this insurance pilot project.
   9
     Nearly all selected individuals (9x%) participated in the baseline survey.

3.2     The Willingness-to-pay Game
The insurance game was set up to closely mimic cotton farmers’ reality so that farmers could easily
understand the mechanics of the game without being distracted by an unfamiliar setting or numbers.
Specifically farmers were told that they had one hectare of land to “cultivate” and that yields would
fluctuate between 1200 kg/hectare in a good year and 600 kg/hectare in a bad year. In keeping with
actual practice, farmers had to borrow 100,000 CFA to cultivate their hectare of cotton and that the
price of cotton was set at 240 CFA per-kilogram, implying a net family farm income (gross revenue less
loan reimbursement) of 188,000 in good years and 44,000 in bad years. Farmers determined their yields
and net family farm incomes in the game by drawing colored balls from a bag which contained 8 orange
balls (representing good yields) and 2 pink balls (representing bad yields). The first two columns of
Table 3 display the basic game parameters.

                        Table 3: Cotton Farming Game with and without Insurance

   Farmers played in groups of approximately 12 individuals and experiments were conducted in the
local languages, Doula and More. After playing training seasons of the cotton game without insurance,
farmers were given a wealth endowment in the form of 50,000 CFA in fictive CFA bills. They were
presented either the standard frame or the premium rebate frame:

   • Standard (Certain Premium) Frame
       You have 50,000 CFA in savings. You must decide whether or not to buy insurance before knowing
       your yield. The insurance price is 20,000 CFA. You pay for the insurance with your savings. In
       case of bad yields, the insurance gives you 50,000 CFA. In case of good yields the insurance pays
       you 0 CFA.

   • Premium Rebate Frame
       You have 50,000 CFA in savings. You must decide whether or not to buy insurance before knowing
       your yield. The insurance price is 20,000 CFA. You pay for the insurance with your savings, BUT

                                                         8
         only in case of good yield. In case of bad yields the insurance gives you 30,000 CFA. In case of
         good yields the insurance pays you 0 CFA.

Under the standard frame, the farmer purchasing insurance immediately handed over to the experi-
menter the 20,000 CFA from his savings. Under the rebate frame, the farmer purchasing insurance
placed the premium in front of himself where it was left it until after the farmer picked a yield ball
to determine the realized state of the world. In a good state of the world, the premium was collected,
otherwise the farmer returned the money to his savings. Note that the actuarially fair price of the
insurance is 10.000 CFA under both frames.
       The second and third columns of Table 3 summarize the contract terms, family farm earnings and
final family wealth under both frames. These figures were presented to farmers in simple tabular form
and farmers played multiple practice rounds to learn how insurance works. Farmers then entered an
incentivized round in which they were told they would be paid their final family wealth from one of the
games for which they made choices.10
       In the incentivized round, farmers chose whether or not to buy insurance (under their respective
framing) at each of eight different premium levels: 40,000, 30,000, 25,000, 20,000, 15,000, 10,000 (the
actuarially fair price), 5000 and 0 CFA. At a premium level of 40,000, no insurance first order stochas-
tically dominates insurance. To help subjects understand the game, they were shown that it made no
sense to buy insurance at the 40,000 premium, but that they might want to consider buying insurance
at the lower premium prices. Visual aids allowed farmers to easily see the outcomes they would face
with and without insurance at each price level.11
       Going down the price list, subjects were asked at what price, if any, would they switch to buying
insurance. The set-up of the game made clear that if they purchased insurance at, say, 15,000, then it
would make sense to also purchase at all lower premiums. Subjects made their switching point decision
privately so as not to influence each other’s decisions. Multiple switching was not allowed. To incentivize
the decisions, farmers were told that one of the seven premium levels (0 to 30,000 CFA) would be chosen
at random and that they would earn real money playing the cotton production game, with our without
insurance, depending on the choice he12 had made for the chosen price level.
  10
      Farmers took part in a total of three activities: the insurance game plus the lotteries explained below. Farmers
were paid at the end of the session a show-up fee and their gains in one, randomly selected, activity. Pay-offs from the
insurance game where divided by 100 to obtain the real gain. Minimum and maximum gains, excluding the show-up fee
of 100 FCFA, were respectively 0 FCFA and 3200 FCFA, with mean earnings of 1792 FCFA. The mean earnings were thus
nearly twice the daily wage for a male laborer in the area (1000 FCFA). In December 2013, the exchange rate was 483
FCFA to the dollar.
   11
      Details on the visual aids and the physical set-up of the game are available from the authors.

3.3        Willingness to Pay Results
The top row of Table 2 reports the average willingness to pay for the insurance contract for the sub-
sample of farmers offered the standard insurance contract and the sub-sample of farmers offered the
premium rebate contract. The framing of the contract matters: the average willingness to pay is 151%
of the actuarially fair price for farmers presented the standard certain premium frame against 166%
for farmers offered the premium rebate frame. Farmers were thus willing to pay about 10% more for a
premium rebate frame than for a standard one, a difference that is significant at the 10% level.
         While this result is intriguing, it is a treatment effect averaged across individuals who likely have
heterogenous preferences, including whether or not they greatly value certainty in the sense of Allais.13
Before exploring this heterogeneity and what it means for willingness to pay for insurance under al-
ternative contract framings, we need first to impose more structure on what it means to greatly value
certainty so that we can test for its presence.


4         Using the u-v Framework to Model the Insurance Rebate Frame
          and a Great Preference for Certainty
Andreoni and Sprenger (2010) explore a variety of theoretical approaches that can in principal account
for violations of expected utility theory that are routinely in observed in behavioral experiments, in-
cluding the Allais Paradox. They note that Allais himself made the following two observations about
the paradox that bears his name:

     1. Expected utility theory is “incompatible with the preference for security in the neighborhood of
           certainty” (Allais (2008)).

     2. “Far from certainty,” individuals act as expected utility maximizers, valuing a gamble by the
           mathematical expectation of its utility outcomes (Allais (1953))

One alternative to expected utility theory that performed well in their behavioral experiments is the
u − v preference model developed by Nielson (1992), Schmidt (1998) and Diecidue et al. (2004). While
standard expected utility theory using the same function (u) to value certain and uncertain outcomes,
the u − v model uses different functions and can be written as:


                                                    v(y) = y α                                                  (5)
    13
    Elabed and Carter (2015), for example, find that 40% of cotton farmers in Mali exhibit compound risk aversion in
their game and valued insurance consistent with expected utility theory.


                                                        10
if y is certain; and,
                                                    u(x) = xα−β                                                     (6)

if x is uncertain, where β ≥ 0 is a measure of the discontinuous preference for certainty. This parsimo-
nious model can account for both the Allais Paradox “in the neighborhood of certainty,” while “far from
certainty” (when, say, comparing two non-degenerate lottery), expected utility theory holds (Allais’
second intuition).14
    Using the u−v approach, we can write the expected subjective value of insurance under the standard
insurance contract as:

                     V s ≡ v(W0 − π) + (1 − pb ) [βu(W1 + yg )] + pb [βu(W1 + yb + I s ] ,

where W0 is the intial savings or wealth endowment, π is the insurance premium, I s is the insurance
indemnity payment and W1 = W0 − π. Note that under the standard frame, the insured pays their
premium with certainty and then enters a lottery for second period payouts. In contrast, we write
expected subjective value of insurance under the rebate frame as:

       V r ≡ (1 − pb ) [u(W0 − π) + βu(W1 + yg )] + pb [u(W0 − π) + βu(W1 + yb + (I r − π) + π)] ,

where I r = I s −π. Under this rebate frame, the individual enters a lottery and depending on its outcome
(good versus bad state of the world), a set of payoffs will occur, with initial uncertainty over whether
the premium will ever be paid.
    For an expected utility maximizer, for whom β = 0 and the functions u and v are identical, the two
frames reduce to the same thing (V s = V r ). For a person who greatly prefers - or has a discontinuous
preference for - certainty with β > 0, V s > V r as:

                        v(W0 − π) < pb u(W0 − π) + (1 − pb )u(W0 − π) = u(W0 − π).

While this u − v approach provides a simple way to understand Burkinabe cotton farmers’ revealed
average preference for the rebate frame, it also suggests a way to identify those individuals whose
preferences are indeed characterized by a discontinuous preference for certainty. One manifestation of
a discontinuous preference for certainty (DPC) is that individuals appear less risk averse when their
decision set includes only stochastic outcomes than when their decision set includes a certain outcome, or
  14
     In the Andreoni and Sprenger (2010) lab experiments, many individuals reveal a strong preference for certainty, and
yet when these same individuals choose between a risky with less risky (but non-degenerate) lotteries, their behavior
appears to be consistent with expected utility theory.


                                                          11
degenerate lottery. This apparent instability in risk aversion occurs because the certain payoff is valued
with the function u, rather than v, alluring individuals towards the certain outcome. This observation
suggests that a simple way to identify individuals exhibiting DPC is to compare elicited degrees of risk
aversion when the choice set includes a certain outcome and when it does not.


5     Measuring Discontinuous Preferences for Certainty and Heteroge-
      nous Impacts of the Premium Rebate Frame
We designed two games that allow us to detect which individuals exhibit a great or discontinuous
preference for certainty. Specifically, we compare individuals’ behavior when they are asked to choose
between two risky lotteries (risky versus less risky game, R-LR) versus their behavior when they are
asked to choose between a risky lottery and a certain outcome (risky versus degenerate game, R-D).
Individuals who appear more risk averse in the R-D game than in the R-LR game are thus exhibiting
behavior consistent with a discontinuous preference for certainty.

5.1      Experimental Procedures to Elicit Discontinuous Preferences for Certainty
As seen in Table 2 above, participant farmers average just under one year of formal schooling, with
attendant modest levels of numeracy and literacy. In an effort to keep things as simple and compre-
hensible as possible for the DPC experiments, we fixed all probabilities at one half and varied payoffs
across lottery pairs. In a similar spirit, the R-LR lottery and R-D lottery games were kept as similar
to each other as possible. While these design decisions sacrificed some precision and generality, they
created a structure that appears to have been well understood by participants. In the experimental
implementation, lotteries were referred to by color (blue and green) and not labelled as risky or less
risky.
    The R-LR lottery game presented farmers with the 8 lottery pairs in Table 4. As we move down the
table from one pair to the next, the low pay-off of the riskier lottery, R, decreases, making this lottery
less and less attractive (all other numbers remain the same across pairs). For lottery pair one, lottery
R stochastically dominates lottery, LR, as it involves larger pay-offs in both states of nature. Starting
with the third pair, farmers face a classic risk-return trade-off as lottery R implies a greater expected
payoff than lottery LR, but also a lower payoff in the bad state of the world.

    After the game was explained and practice rounds played, experimenters had participants choose
between the risky and the less risky lottery for each pair.15 To assist with understanding of the game,
it was made clear that lottery R offered superior returns to lottery LR in pair 1. Farmers then had to
choose between the lotteries for each subsequent pair, indicating at which, if any, pair they would like
to switch from R to LR. Multiple switching was not permitted. Assuming that preferences over risky
outcomes (function u above) can be represented by a constant relative risk aversion utility function, the
farmers’ preferred switch point allows us to bracket their degree of risk aversion, as shown in Table 4.16
    After farmers completed the R-LR choice activity, experimenters presented the risky versus degen-
erate (R-D) lottery pairs shown in Table 5. The risky lottery is unchanged from the R-LR game, while
the less risky lottery has been replaced by a single value that farmers would receive for sure were they
to choose the degenerate lottery. For lottery pairs 3-8, the less risky lottery has been replaced by the
certainty equivalent of the less risky lottery for a person with the degree of risk aversion of a person
who would switch from risky to less risky at that pair. For example, an individual who switched from
R to LR at pair 4, is inferred to have coefficient of constant relative risk aversion between 0.99 and 1.58
(Table 4). Using the midpoint of that range (1.29), we calculate the certainty equivalent of the less
risky lottery as 146,000 CFA. Similar procedures were used to calculate the values of the degenerate
  15
     As in the insurance game, the experiment set up eight boxes, one for each pair of lotteries. Each box contained two
baskets, a blue one for the less risky lottery and a green one for the riskier lottery. A sheet attached to each basket
displayed the payoffs associated with each lottery.
  16                                          1−γ
     The CRRA utility function is: u(x) = x1−γ . This specification implies risk aversion for γ > 0 , risk neutrality for
γ = 0 and risk loving for γ < 0 . When γ = 1, the natural logarithm is used to evaluate risk preferences. There is no
coefficient of risk aversion associated to the first two pairs, since lottery R respectively strictly and weakly dominates
lottery LR.

       As with the R-LR lottery game, participants were asked to pick the pair, if any, at which they
would switch from the risky to the degenerate lottery. For an expected utility maximizer (with CRRA
preferences) we would predict that they would switch at the same lottery pair in the R-LR and the
R-D games. However, an individual with a discontinuous preference for certainty (β > 0 in the u − v
model), would be predicted under the u − v model to switch at an earlier lottery pair. By comparing
play in the two lotteries, we can thus infer which individuals exhibit a great or discontinuous preference
for certainty.18 Note that, as in the R-LR game, in the first two pairs, lottery R dominates lottery D.
Again the first pair was used as an example. While choosing D over R in the second pair may appear
irrational, Gneezy et al. (2006) show that many individuals value risky prospects less than their worst
possible realization.19

5.2      Results of the Games: Eliciting Agents’ Type
Table 6 reports the number and the percentage of farmers switching at each pair of lottery for the two
games. Farmers are relatively evenly distributed over the range of switching points with a concentration
  17
     For lottery pairs 1 and 2, the degree of risk aversion is undefined and the degenerate lottery fixes payouts out the
low payoff from the R-LR lottery. For a individuals who switched at pair 3 in the R-LR lottery, we can only infer that
their degree of CRRA is between 1.58 and infinity. For purposes of calculating the certainty equivalent for this pair, we
assumed a CRRA value of 2.5.
  18
     The 8 pairs of lotteries give a very coarse grid of choices. In the later empirical analysis,
  19
     In their original experience, Gneezy et al. (2006) show that the average willingness to pay for a gift certificate of 50$
was 38$, and the average willingness to pay to participate in a lottery with 1/2 probability to receive a gift certificate
of 50$ and 1/2 probability to receive a gift certificate of 100$ was 28$. In practice, individuals were valuing the risky
prospects less than its worst possible realization. They call it the “uncertainty effect”. Andreoni and Sprenger (2010) show
that DPC can explain the uncertainty effect.


                                                               14
of about two-third of the sample between pair 3 and 5. In both games, more than 50% of farmers switch
before or at pair 5, which suggests that they have very high level of risk aversion with coefficients of
relative risk aversion greater or equal to 0.66.

       The transition matrix in Table 7 allows a closer look at how participants changed their behavior
between the two games. The main diagonal (in bold type) shows those farmers who switched at the same
lottery pair in both the R-LR and R-D games, as expected utility maximizers would be predicted to do.
The lower triangle of the transition matrix is populated by those individuals who switched at an earlier
pair in the R-D game as we would predict for people with a discontinuous preference for certainty. A
total of 29% of all participants switched earlier and are in the lower triangle of the matrix. Note that this
number may be a lower bound of the prevalence of DPC since each switching point is associated with
a range of coefficient of relative risk aversion. Thus even if an individual has the same switching point
in both games, she may be “closer” to the upper bound of the interval (or closer to switching earlier) in
the R-D than in the R-LR game. Conversely, we may also be worried that switching at different pairs
in both games simply reflects minor mistakes in comparing options. To address this later concern we
construct a more conservative estimate of the prevalence of DPC by only classifying as DPC those who
switch at least two pairs earlier in the R-D game than in the R-LR game. With this classification 15%
of farmers exhibit DPC .      20

       It is possible that other, non-expected utility models could account for this observed switching
behavior between the two lottery games. The appendix calculates the sets of parameters that would be
required for cumulative prospect theory (augmented with the assumption of rank dependent utility, a la
  20
    Note that some farmers also behave as if they had a lower level of risk aversion when they play the RD game than when
they play the RR game. In other words they appear to have a strong preferences for uncertainty. We call these farmers
“players”. While we only focus on the distinction between DPC and non-DPC farmers in the main text, in Appendix C1
we split the non-DPC category into players and expected utility maximizers. This does not change our main results and
we find that these two types of agents behave similarly in the WTP games.

Quiggin (1982), and the Prelec (1998) weighting function). While such parameters exist, they suggest
a somewhat implausible explanation of the observed switching behavior as they require individuals to
behave as if their decision weights vary quite substantially from the simple, objective 50-50 probabilities
that were used to structure the game.21

       The upper triangle of the transition matrix is populated by individuals who switched at a later pair
in the R-D game than in the R-LR game. For lack of a better term, we denote these individuals as
‘players’ as they seem averse to picking a (boring) degenerate lottery and hence wanted to play a game
of chance. In the primary heterogeneity analysis of the insurance frame in the next section, we group
these individuals with the expected utility types along the main diagonal, labeling the combined group
as non-DPC types. Finally, note that that 15% of participants (84 individuals) chose pair 2 in the R-D
game and are thus Gneezy-like subjects.22

5.3      Heterogenous Impacts of the Premium Rebate Contract
The average treatment effects of the rebate frame reported in section 3.3 revealed that the rebate frame
increased willingness to pay by about 10%. However, we would expect the rebate frame to have no
impact on the willingness to pay for insurance of an expected utility maximizer and only influence the
willingness to pay of individuals with a discontinuous preference for certainty (see section 4). We explore
  21
     In analysis not reported here, we show that subjects’ observed preference for the rebate framing can also be explained
under cumulative prospect theory if we make sufficiently strong assumptions about the nature of loss aversion. However,
cumulative prospect cannot simply or parsimoniously explain preferences in both the lottery games and the insurance
game. That observation of course does not rule out the triumvirate of cumulative prospect theory, rank-dependent utility
and loss aversion as a potential explanation of observed subject behavior.
  22
     If we include these individuals in the DPC category, our conclusions remain unchanged (results available upon request).

these predictions in this section.
      Table 8 reports the average willingness-to-pay for each frame, for all, DPC and non-DPC agents,
using the basic definition of DPC (columns 2 and 3) and the conservative definition (columns 4 and
5). Under both definitions, DPC farmers are willing to pay at least 30% more when the contract is
presented with the premium rebate frame than when it is presented with the standard frame and this
difference is statistically significant. As would be expected, the willingness to pay for the rebate frame is
even higher using the conservative DPC definition, as the behavior of the conservatively classified DPC
individuals is consistent with a strong DPC (high value of β in the u − v model). In contrast to the
DPC farmers, the willingness of non-DPC farmers to pay for the rebate frame is statistically no different
from their willingness to pay for insurance under the standard, certain premium payment frame.

      To more carefully analyze the effect of the insurance framing and its interaction with player type,
we estimate a Tobit model23 which allows us to control for order effects24 and other covariates. The
main variables of interest are: a binary variable indicating whether the premium rebate frame was
used to present the insurance, a binary variable indicating whether the individual exhibit DPC, and the
interaction of these two variables. We also control for order effects in the lottery games and for individual
characteristics (farmer age, years of schooling, religion, ethnicity, household size, area cultivated).
      Table 9 presents the results of Tobit regressions using the simple definition of DPC (column 1 to 4)
and the conservative definition (column 5 to 8). Columns 1, 2, 5 and 6 report the coefficients of Tobit
regressions with and without controlling for individual characteristics while columns 3, 4, 7 and 8 report

    In the lottery games, the order of the R-LR and R-D games was randomized across experimental sessions. All
individuals played the lottery games first followed by the cotton insurance exercise.

    The results based on the core definition suggest that DPC agents are willing to pay 4565 FCFA
more for an insurance presented with premium rebate frame than with standard frame (column 4).
This represents a 34% increase in the willingness to pay for insurance. In contrast, non-DPC agents are
not willing to pay more when the insurance is presented with this frame.26 The same conclusion obtains
if we use the conservative definition of DPC: agents with DPC are willing to pay 5583 FCFA more for
the premium rebate frame (column 8), which present an increase of 39% in their willingness-to-pay.


6     Conclusions
In recent years the demand for microinsurance has been characterized by a surprisingly low take-up,
despite evidence that when insured, farmers increase investments in, and earn more from, their available
opportunities. While expected utility theory provides some insights into this surprising demand pattern,
  25
     Order effects are significant, with individuals playing the R-LR lottery first exhibiting a higher willingness to pay in
the insurance games the followed the lottery games.
  26
     The results remain unchanged if we distinguish further between players and expected utility agents (results available
upon request).


                                                                           18
behavioral experiments have for decades uncovered a wealth of evidences that people routinely exhibit
behavior that is inconsistent with that theory. Behavioral economics would thus seem to have rich
implications for the design and the demand for insurance, and, yet, to date efforts have been sparse
to develop those implications for agricultural microinsurance (Bryan (2018), Elabed and Carter (2015)
and Petraud (2014) are among the exceptions).
       This paper presents a novel way to understand low micro-insurance take-up using the behavioral
concept of a “great” or discontinuous preference for certainty, as initially articulated by Allais (1953). In
common with most insurance, agricultural microinsurance requires the certain payment of a premium
in return for an uncertain benefit. Intuitively, we might expect farmers who greatly value certainty to
overvalue the negative aspect of insurance (the premium) relative to its uncertain benefits. Confirming
this intuition, cotton farmers in Burkina Faso exhibited on average a 10% higher willingness to pay for
insurance when a random subsample of farmers was presented with an unconventional premium rebate
framing that made payment of the premium uncertain. These magnitude of the estimated average
treatment effects implies that insurance demand would be 16% higher under the rebate framing rather
the standard insurance framing.27
       While inexplicable from an expected utility perspective, this positive average impact of the rebate
frame on insurance demand encourages a closer look at farmer behavior as there is no reason to presume
that all farmers exhibit a great preference for certainty. Encouraged by the experimental findings of
Andreoni and Sprenger (2010) and Andreoni and Sprenger (2012), we adapt the u − v utility framework
first introduced by Nielson (1992) and use it to derive a novel experiment to measure which individuals
exhibit a great or discontinuous preference for certainty. We find that 30% of farmers exhibit a discon-
tinuous preference for certainty, and it is this group of farmers who entirely drive the average treatment
effect of the rebate frame in the insurance games. Tobit estimates of a heterogeneous treatment effects
model reveals that farmers with a measured discontinuous preference for certainty have a 34-39% higher
willingness to pay for insurance when it was offered with the premium rebate frame. This alternative
framing has no significant impact on the willingness to pay of farmers whose behavior is consistent with
expected utility theory.
       It follows that framing the insurance product with uncertainty about the payment of the premium
might induce an increase in the insurance take-up, especially for farmers with DPC preferences. This
increase in the insurance coverage, could then induce an increase in the ex-ante investment decisions of
cotton farmers. Given that Elabed and Carter (2017) find in neighboring Mali that insurance boosts
farmers investment and expected income by some 35%, employing the insights of this paper to boost
  27
    These results assume that the insurance is marked up 100% from its actuarially fair price, a mark-up not out of line
with observed microinsurance contracts.

Appendix Cumulative Prospect Theory and Switching Behavior in the
Lottery Games
Cumulative prospect theory (CPT) has multiple moving parts including a set related to the notion of
a reference point that separates the domain of losses from the domain of gains, and a set related to the
notion of a probability weighting functions that transforms objective probabilities into decision weights.
Given that the games played by our subjects only offer gains, we focus here on insights that might come
from the deviation between decision weights and objective probabilities.28
       Following Khaneman and Tversky (1992) and relying on the commonly employed Prelec (1998)
                                                                               x1−α
weighting function, we assume a CRRA utility function, u(x) =                  1−α    , and that decision weights are
                                              θ
given by the function, π(p) =         e−(−lnp) ,   where p is objective probability weight for risky outcome x
(0 < p ≤ 1) and that θ > 0. Note that π(0) = 0, π(1) = 1 and that the The parameter θ represents the
concavity/convexity of the weighting function. In particular, if θ < 1, the weighting function is inverted
S-shaped, implying individuals overweight small probabilities and underweight large probabilities, as
hypothesized by Khaneman and Tversky (1992).
       Using this machinery, we can ask what combination of α and γ would be consistent with any of the
the observed switching patterns illustrated in Table 7. For example, a subject who switched at pair
4 in both the RLR and RD lotteries could be characterized as having the following two indifference
conditions defined by the two choices:

         
          π(1/2)u(320000) + [1 − π(1/2)]u(60000) = π(1/2)u(240000) + [1 − π(1/2)]u(80000)
                                                                                                                        (7)
                       π(1/2)u(320000) + [1 − π(1/2)]u(60000) = u(139000)

Table 10, whose structure mirrors that of Table 7, reports the combinations of (θ, α) that simultaneously
solve these two conditions for each possible switch combination. The main diagonal is again illustrated
in bold and the lower triangle of the matrix are combinations where the subject switched earlier when
the less risky lottery was replaced by its certainty equivalent as defined by expected utility theory.
  28
    If we were to assume that subjects perceived a rerference point separating losses from gain somewhere in between the
high and the low payoffs of the lotteries, then it is possible to devise configurations of risk and loss aversion that could
explain the observed pattern of switching seen in the RLR and RD lottery exercises.

    As can be seen, from the perspective of cumulative prospect theory, the kind of switching associated
with a discontinuous preference for certainty is associated with a probability weighting function that
assigns a decision weight to the good outcome that is well less than one half (recall that the objective
probability of this outcome was exactly one half). A switch by two points (the criteria used in the
conservative definition of a discrete preference for certainty) implies a decision weight that is roughly
half of the objective probability value. In simplest terms, CPT would account for the observed behavior
of subjects who make choices in the lower triangle of the matrix by ascribing a form of pessimism to
these subjects. Rather than greatly valuing certainty, this CPT perspective suggests that some agents
act as if they greatly undervalue the probability of a favorable 50-50 event.


                                                   25
   While this CPT interpretation is one way to rationalize the behavior observed in the R-LR and R-D
exercises, it is less clear to us how to map a CPT perspective into the insurance rebate frame in order
to understand the striking relationship revealed here between a choice in the lower triangle of Table 7
and a preference for the rebate frame. In contrast, the parsimonious DPC theory offers an integrated
explanation for the observed relationship between play in the two experimental games.
