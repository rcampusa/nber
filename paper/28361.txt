                                          ABSTRACT

We experimentally study individuals' perceptions about and advice to others regarding retirement
savings and annuitization during the pandemic. Many people recommend that others save more
for retirement, but those most affected by the pandemic tell others to save and annuitize less. We
investigate two possible channels for this result and show that the pandemic does not
substantially alter optimism regarding survival probabilities. Hence, we conclude that economic
factors are driving our results. Consequently, some financial ramifications of the COVID-19
outbreak are yet to be revealed, as the pandemic is having longer-term effects on peoples'
willingness to save and annuitize.

       Longevity Perceptions and Saving Decisions during the COVID-19 Outbreak:
                             An Experimental Investigation
                         Abigail Hurwitz, Olivia S. Mitchell and Orly Sade

       The COVID-19 pandemic has wrought not only profound damage to peoples' health

around the world but also to households' finances (Achou et al. 2020, Lusardi et al., 2020, Mitchell

2020). The short-term economic impacts for spending, debt, and unemployment have been recently

examined by numerous researchers and policymakers (e.g., Baker et al. 2020, Hanspal et al, 2020).

There have also been studies of marked changes in peoples' saving patterns and retirement

preparedness. For instance, the TIAA (2020) Financial Resiliency Survey reported that 60% of

Americans believe they are "off track" with their retirement savings, and almost one third

attributed this reality to the COVID-19 pandemic.

       Our paper seeks to understand the potential long-term implications of the pandemic

regarding savings toward retirement. We aim to understand how people think about that by asking

them how they would advise others to behave. We also investigate how these recommendations

differ, depending on their personal experience with the Coronavirus. We use a nationally

representative online survey fielded in mid-2020 to learn about how Americans assess their own

survival probabilities, and we compare these to sex and age life tables for the general population

to determine whether they are optimistic or pessimistic vis a vis the average. Next, we ask

respondents about their chances of getting COVID-19, suffering financially from, or dying from

the virus. We document that those with low income, low financial literacy, and low numeracy

skills perceive themselves to be most vulnerable to the pandemic in terms of health and financial

consequences. Finally, we use experimental vignettes to measure the relation between peoples'

self-assessed vulnerability to the virus and their recommendations to others regarding how much

to save and annuitize.
                                                                                                                      2



         We show that most participants in our survey recommend saving more, consistent with the

recent TIAA (2020) report indicating that two-thirds of their survey participants would like to do

so. Most respondents also recommend that retirees convert part of their retirement savings into

lifetime income annuities. Yet we also discover that those affected financially from COVID-19

are less likely to recommend that others save and annuitize. We also seek to disentangle two

possible mechanisms leading to this result: altered survival probabilities, or altered economic

circumstances. Interestingly, savings recommendations decline as peoples' expected chances rise

of running out of money due to the virus. Nevertheless, their savings recommendations are

unaffected by respondents' reported chances of getting COVID-19 or dying from it. We also show

that they are less likely to recommend annuitization, the higher are their expected chances of

running out of money or dying from the virus. Accordingly, changes in saving and annuitization

recommendations appear to flow from economic losses, rather than changes in life expectancy

perceptions. Our results have important implications for future retirement security, since those

who are currently most financially vulnerable will probably be most negatively affected.

I. Methodology
         We developed, fielded, and analyzed a nationally representative survey of Americans using

the Prolific survey platform age 35-83, for whom we gathered a variety of demographic data, and

to whom we posed hypothetical questions regarding saving behavior and demand for longevity

insurance products. Specifically, building on Brown et al. (2019), Samek et al. (2019), and Hurwitz

et al. (2020), we created two vignettes. 1 About half of our participants (2,542) was randomly

selected to advise a hypothetical single man (woman) age 60 with no children regarding how to

withdraw his (her) retirement savings. The other half (2,550) was asked to advise a hypothetical

 The use of vignettes has a long history in the medical field, and they have of late become increasingly popular in
social science applications.
                                                                                                  3



single man (woman) age 40 with no children regarding whether to increase his (her) retirement

savings. Furthermore, we assessed participants' perceptions of getting COVID-19, suffering from

financial consequences due to the virus, or dying from it. Other questions included measures of

financial literacy and numeracy, time and risk preferences, and self-assessed health. 2

II. Data and Results
        In total, 5,108 U.S residents age 35-83 participated in our Prolific study. 3 Respondents'

mean age was 48.9, and 43.7% were male. Regarding education, 25.5% had some college, and

36% had a bachelor's degree. Over half (58.4%) were married, 21.73% never married, 2.44%

widowed, 14.9% divorced, and 2.2% separated. Of the respondents, 84.9% believed that their

health was good, very good, or excellent. In our sample, median monthly self-reported income was

US$4,900, or about US$58,800 in annual terms; this is close to the median annual household

income of US$61,940 reported by the U.S Census Bureau (2018). 4

A. COVID-19 affects the most vulnerable

        To find out about peoples' exposure to COVID-19, we first ask all respondents to evaluate

how strongly they anticipate being affected by the virus. Our respondents' average probability of

getting the virus is 26.3%, with 19.4% believing they would die from it if infected. They also

estimate a 21.4% probability of running out of money in the next three months, due to the

pandemic.

        We next explore the relation between participants' perceptions about COVID-19 and their

self-reported attitudes and characteristics. These results (detailed in the Appendix) are consistent

with other findings (such as Clark et. al, 2020) and confirm that the most vulnerable respondents

3
  Only 5,092 out of 5,108 participants responded to the vignette question.
4
  Average household monthly income was about US$13,600 (about US$162,000 annually).
                                                                                                                     4



also believe they are more exposed to both financial and health problems due to the pandemic.

Specifically, being older, better-educated, married, in good health, scoring high on financial

literacy and numeracy tests, and having higher income are all significantly associated with a

smaller chance of expecting to run out of money in the next three months due to the virus. By

contrast, those expecting to run short include respondents evincing a strong present preference,

along with those sharing the same household with more people. We also find that peoples' self-

reported chances of getting COVID-19 are significantly lower among men, older respondents,

never marrieds, those in good health and better educated, as well as the more financially and

numerically literate. Finally, those anticipating they are more likely to die from COVID-19 are

older and widowed; conversely, respondents least anticipating that they will die from the virus are

married, in good health, and financially as well as numerically literate. Generally speaking, our

results conform to other evidence regarding the factors associated with greater vulnerability to the

virus (e.g., Shibata 2020). 5

B. COVID-19 and long-term financial decisions

         Next, we explore respondents' views of savings and annuitization during the pandemic and

examine how these assessments are affected by exposure to the virus. A first observation is that

most survey respondents recommend that the vignette individual save more: 30.6% advise the

vignette person to boost savings, and 52. 7% advise the vignette individual to significantly increase

savings. A substantial majority, 74%, also advise the vignette individual to annuitize a portion of

his (her) retirement nest egg.

         Table 1 shows that respondents' exposure to COVID-19 reduces both their savings and

their annuitization recommendations. Specifically, Column (1) indicates that the average marginal

paid attention to the questions and answered reasonably.
                                                                                                                      5



effect of running out of money due to COVID-19 is significantly negatively associated with the

recommendation to save more, by -19.7 % (=-0.108/0.547). A similar negative link is detected in

Column (2) between the same COVID-19 variable and the recommendation to annuitize, by -13%

(=-0.097/0.746). The probability of getting or dying from the virus does not significantly alter

peoples' savings recommendations, but the average marginal effect of peoples' self-reported

chances of dying from Covid-19 reduces annuitization recommendations by -12% (=-0.09/0.746).

Other factors behave as anticipated, with the more financially literate recommending more saving

and more annuitization, other things constant. 6 People who are strongly present-focused are less

likely to advise additional saving or annuitization.

        In Column (3) of Table 1, the dependent variable is an indicator of survival for "optimism"

­ that is the person's reported subjective chance of surviving to a given age (SLE) minus the

objective probability (LE) (as in Hurwitz et al. 2020). Results confirm that people's survival

optimism is not associated with the chances of dying from COVID-19, running out of money due

to the pandemic, or having a greater chance of getting COVID-19. These findings lead us to

conclude that our results in the first two columns of the Table are driven by the virus' anticipated

impacts on peoples' financial and economic status, rather than dramatically altering their own

anticipated longevity.

        Interestingly, our findings also demonstrate that peoples' attributes and perceptions about

the Coronavirus shape their recommendations to others. Specifically, we control on the personal

characteristics of the person asking for advice, and there is no inherent conflict of interest in the

vignettes since those proffering the advice do not benefit from it. Nevertheless, the respondent's

beliefs about the chances of dying from or running out of money due to COVID-19 do influence


6
  All multivariate models also control on demographics (age, sex, education, health, income, # in the household and
race).
                                                                                                   6



recommendations made to the vignette person. This is consistent with Linnainmaa et al.

(forthcoming), indicating that an advisor's own beliefs and preferences drive recommendations

made. Moreover, Foerster et al. (2017) concluded that advisors' characteristics explained twice as

much of the variation in risk taking compared to clients' characteristics.

III.   Conclusions and Implications

       The COVID-19 pandemic is wreaking substantial and immediate damage to health and

wellbeing. This research suggests that the pandemic will also have longer-term effects, altering

peoples' willingness to save for retirement and convert part of their retirement nest eggs into

annuities. Additionally, the pandemic' impacts will be unevenly distributed. Specifically, being

younger, less educated, unmarried, in poor health, scoring low on financial literacy and numeracy

tests, and having lower income, are all significantly associated with a higher anticipated chance of

getting the virus and expecting to run out of money in the next three months due to the virus.

Additional contributors include being present-biased and sharing the same household with more

people. We also find that those who believe they are more likely to run out of money due to

COVID-19 are substantially less likely to recommend saving more and annuitizing. We believe

that this is prompted by the virus' anticipated impacts on peoples' financial and economic status,

rather than dramatically altering peoples' expected longevity. Thus the advice given by the more

vulnerable subjects indicates their own actions during the pandemic, and the negative

consequences of these actions will be revealed in the future.

       Our results have important implications for insurance commissioners and pension

regulators. To date, several countries including Israel, the US, Australia, Chile, and Peru have

permitted people to withdraw lump sums from their retirement plans as part of COVID-19 relief.

Yet such a policy, along with peoples' pandemic-induced loss of interest in saving and

annuitization, is likely to undermine retirement security in the future, and those who are currently

most financially vulnerable will probably be harmed the most.

Note. The dependent variables in the first two columns are indicator variables equal to 1 if the respondent
recommended that the vignette individual significantly boost saving (1) or annuitize (2) (zero else). The dependent
variable in Column 3 is the difference between a respondent's subjective versus objective survival probability.
Explanatory variables include chances of running out of money due to COVID-19, getting the virus, and dying from
it. Also included are controls for age, male, College +, self-reported health good/very good/excellent, financial literacy
score, numeracy score, present preference score, income, the number of people living in household and race; we also
control for marital status, attention to the survey, and the order of questions presented in the survey. For other variable
definitions see Hurwitz et al. (2020). Standard errors in parentheses. (1 = 2,081; 2 = 2,019, 3 = 3,849). *** p <
