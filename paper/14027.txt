                                              ABSTRACT

Many countries appear to have excessively stable big business sectors, in that higher rates of big business
turnover have been correlated with faster economy growth. Public policies that stabilize big business
sectors are sometimes justified as supportive of social objectives. We find no consistent link between
big business stability and public goods provision, egalitarianism, or labor empowerment. While absence
of evidence is not evidence of absence, these findings suggest that other explanations, such as special
interest politics or behavioral biases favoring the status quo also be considered.

Many countries appear to have excessively stable big business sectors, in that higher rates of big

business turnover have been correlated with faster economy growth. Public policies that stabilize

big business sectors are sometimes justified as supportive of social objectives. We find no

consistent link between big business stability and public goods provision, egalitarianism, or labor

empowerment. While absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, these findings suggest that

other explanations, such as special interest politics or behavioral biases favoring the status quo

also be considered.




1.      Introduction

Schumpeter (1912) describes capitalism as a system in continual flux. Observing carriage makers

fall to automakers, traditional steel mills cede markets to the Bessemer process, and cotton mills

quake at the advent of rayon, Schumpeter saw capitalism’s unique forte as harnessing this turmoil

to lift humanity above its millennia-long Malthusian trap.           Creative entrepreneurs build

innovative upstart firms that destroy staid and established firms in an ongoing turmoil

Schumpeter (1942) called creative destruction. The new firms are more productive than the old

ones they displace, so aggregate wealth rises steadily as individual firms and fortunes rise and fall

– often abruptly and unpredictably. A large and rapidly solidifying body of theoretical and

empirical work, surveyed in Aghion and Howitt (1998), now confirms the essential validity of

Schumpeter’s ideas.    Given this, rescuing the losers without undermining the process of creative

destruction itself becomes a critical public policy challenge.

        In a recent study, Fogel et al. (2008) show that economies whose leading businesses die

as new leading firms rise grow faster than economies whose lists of leading firms remain stable.

The key variable in that study is “big business stability” – measured as the fraction of a country’s

largest employers in 1975 that persist to 1996. Persistence is defined variously as remaining in

the top ten list, growing no slower than GDP, retaining in 1996 at least 50%, 25%, or 10% of its

1975 labor force. Using any of these measures, they show that real per capita GDP growth,

                                                  1
economy total factor productivity growth, and aggregate capital accumulation are all significantly

higher in economies with less stable big business sectors.

        This finding suggests that many economies pay for excessively stable big business

sectors with depressed growth. One possibility, alluded to by Fogel et al. (2008) is that some

governments may balance other policy goals against economic growth. This is plausible, for

“man does not live by bread alone”. Indeed, the social objectives of modern societies are often

framed, as by the republican idealists of the French Revolution, in terms like “liberty, fraternity,

and equality!” A high per capita GDP can help with these, but the legitimacy of public policy

goals other than economy growth must be conceded.

        Might a more stable big business sector help a country attain these goals? Toned down

creative destruction makes more predictable each firm’s future revenue streams, the composition

of the big business sector, and the identities of the people in charge. The transactions costs of

collecting tax revenues from a smaller number of larger firms, redistributing income via industrial

policies, and co-opting business into social pacts may all be lower if big businesses are longer

lived players. Big businesses might partake such transactions to maximize long-term profits, or to

assuage their controlling shareholders’ souls or egos. These arguments, developed at greater

length below, are admittedly highly tentative, and counterarguments are easy to generate. But we

seek reasons why many countries’ big business sectors appear excessively stable, so we allocate

the benefit of the doubt to these rationalizations – at least for now.

        To see if this is so, we correlate big business stability with a variety of social

development indicators, controlling for per capita GDP. We find largely insignificant results

throughout, though occasionally big business stability correlates with worse social outcomes.

        We speculate that the countervailing policy benefits might be either more obscure or

tightly focused on narrow interest groups. Alternatively, the well-documented conservative bias

detected elsewhere in behavioral finance may induce suboptimal policy in some countries.

        The article is organized as follows: Section two provides some background to motivate

the assumption that excessive big business stability may indeed be a deliberate public policy goal.

Section three describes the data and section four the results. Section five concludes, entertains

our speculative explanations, and calls for further work.



2.      On Stability

Instances of politicians using public funds to rescue tottering corporate giants are not rare. For

example, when Philipp Holzmann AG disclosed a DM2.4 billion-mark problem in its books, its

banks demanded a comprehensive restructuring.          The Wall Street Journal (Nov. 25, 1999)

describes the subsequent politicking as follows: When the banks rejected Holzmann's DM4.3-

billion restructuring proposal as inadequate, a chorus of German politicians vilified the banks'

unwillingness to “shield a 150 year old German company and save the jobs of Holzmann's 17,000

domestic workers.” German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, after buying the banks' acquiescence

with a federal guarantee on a DM100 million loan and DM150 million in new capital, exulted

“The banks have recognized their economic and social responsibility.”

        Such respect for corporate stability is not confined to European politicians. Business

Week (September 11, 1998) quotes an anonymous prominent businessman explaining that the

Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad “doesn't believe in bankruptcies. He has a moral

objection to them.” The Business Week article added that during the Asian crisis when “the

intensity of business collapses and bank collapses was like tenpins falling every day,” Mr.

Mahathir Mohamad “couldn't stand it. He doesn't believe in bankruptcies.”

        Politicians can protect the stability of established corporate empires in less direct ways

than bailouts. Although Thai Petrochemical Industries was insolvent in 1997, the firm was not

officially declared bankrupt until 2000. According to the Wall Street Journal (February 12,

2001), the CEO, Prachai Leophairatana filed thirteen different lawsuits and a criminal

embezzlement charge against the creditors. Although the creditors have formally fired him, he

                                                 3
continues to occupy the CEO’s office and run the company. The Thai government seems unable

or unwilling to evict him.

        In Africa too, government policies can tilt the playing field to favor old established firms

and undermine upstart innovators.. In the mid 1990s, the government of Zimbabwe invested a

great deal of effort to save the state telephone utility, PTC, from a cell phone company being

organized by Strive Masiyiwa, an entrepreneur.       The story, according to the National Post

(February 26, 2000), is as follows. PTC phone lines served 1.4% of Zimbabweans, and the

hundreds of thousands of people requesting new lines endured waits of up to four years and were

expected to pay large bribes to bureaucrats. When Masiyiwa proposed a joint venture with PTC

to provide cell phone service, he recounts that "They looked at me and said: 'We don't see a future

in it. We certainly aren't going to waste valuable resources on it." When Masiyiwa decided to go

it alone, PTC forbade it on the grounds that the state had a monopoly on telecommunications.

Masiyiwa hired an American lawyer, challenged PTC’s position in court, and won. He then

formed a company, Econet, and with foreign partners built base stations across the country. A

few days before service was to begin, Zimbabwe’s president Robert Mugabe, invoked emergency

presidential powers and made it illegal for a private business to build a cellular network.

Offenders would face two years in jail. Masiyiwa recounts that "Parliament sat through three

sittings to turn [the decree] into law in one day." He returned to the courts, and a judge finally

ordered that a cell phone license be put up for public tender. A string of politically connected

consortia sprung up to bid, and Telecel, a consortium backed by Leo Mugabe, the president’s

nephew and a member of parliament, won the license. Masiyiwa's salvation was an anonymous

civil servant, who leaked documents proving that a corrupt official had docked 20% from

Econet's score on the tender bid. Strive Masiyiwa should have won in the first place. After more

court battles, a cabinet shuffle, and threats of resignation from the late vice-president, Econet

finally got a license to operate. Within a week of its launch, the company had 10,000 subscribers,

and rapidly overtook Telecel and the state-run cell phone company, NetOne. As the situation in


                                                 4
Zimbabwe further deteriorated in the late 1990s, Masiyawa found it prudent to move his base of

operations to South Africa.

          Anecdotal evidence is not proof, but the incidents reviewed above at least justify the

hypothesis that stabilizing a country’s big business sector might be a commonplace public policy

goal, or at least a perceived means to other policy goals, that countervail any slowing of economic

growth.

          How might a stable big business sector aid in the achievement of laudable policy goals

beyond the purely economic ones?



2.1       Liberty

A more stable big business sector might ease governments’ fiscal uncertainty by providing stable

and predictable tax inflows. This might be important in funding health care, education, public

infrastructure, or other public goods that must be built up slowly over time. Some of the costs of

these goods might even be off-loaded to large stable firms. For example, many health care costs

are paid by large firms, not government, in the Unites States and Switzerland. Education costs can

also be paid by employers on occasion, as when firms pay for advanced business degrees for their

managerial staff or for technical skills upgrading for blue collar workers.

          Public goods are a critical, and often overlooked, aspect of development. Amartya Sen

(1999) argues that development should be defined as that which expands human freedom.

Educated people have more options to choose from than illiterates, so better education is an

important component of development. Healthy people have more options than the chronically ill.

People living near roads, ports, and airports have more options than those isolated in impenetrable

wilderness. All of these considerations lead Sen to conclude that governments need to invest

heavily in public goods like education, infrastructure, and healthcare to provide basic necessary

freedoms to their peoples. An overly single minded focus on GDP growth is inadequate.




                                                 5
2.2     Equality

The crux of the matter might be egalitarianism. In public pronouncements explaining decisions

to support large established firms, politicians often take an instrumental perspective – a stable big

businesses sector is not desirable per se, but because it leads to other desirable public policy

outcomes, such as high quality public goods, labor rights, or an egalitarian income distribution.

Such factors apparently moved the German government’s bailout of Philipp Holzmann, which

Finance Minister Hans Eichel justified thus: “the government has a responsibility to step in if a

major German company is about to collapse and cost thousands of people their jobs”.1 A like

motive seems to underlie Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder’s pressing German banks to “save the

jobs” of the 22,000 employees of the bankrupt engineering firm Babcock Borsig AG with a $700

to $800 million bailout.2

        If big business stability, by preserving blue collar jobs, sustains incomes across a wide

segment of the population, while letting innovative upstarts displace them benefits only a handful

of entrepreneurs, egalitarianism might bias government policies against upstarts to protect

established large firms. Governments might have to choose a balance between the rapid growth of

unfettered creative destruction and the equality attainable by slowing that process.



2.3     Fraternity

But public goods might not be the only non-economic goal at issue. Several of the politicians we

cite above proclaim big business stability desirable because it protects workers. The underlying

economics is often obscure, but this linkage may have led the Japanese government to propose a

¥200 billion ($1.90 billion) bailout of Sogo Department Stores, which Asiaweek described as part

of Japan’s long tradition of corporate bailouts designed to minimize “confusion”.3 Asiaweek

continues that, to the bewilderment of senior politicians, the bailout was derailed when “[t]he

public exploded over the use of their tax money to rescue a poorly managed private company.”

        The long-term stability of large Japanese firms is sometimes stressed as economically

advantageous because it promotes implicit labor contracts, workers’ firm-specific human capital

accumulation, and otherwise reduces labor market transactions costs (Aoki, 1988). This logic

might apply to Japan, but if it were more generally valid, these economic advantages should be

evident in faster economy growth, all else equal.

        But a stable big business sector might nonetheless be viewed by some politicians as a

useful tool in the art of nation building. For example, Business Week reports that Malaysian

Prime Minister Mahathir is unapologetic about his government’s policy of selecting a handful of

wealthy businessmen for privileges and assigning them the role of creating jobs, implementing

big projects, and keeping the economy growing. The article quotes Mustapha Mohamed of the

Finance Ministry as saying ''We view Malaysia as a corporation, and the shareholders in the

government are companies.” and that “To the extent you help the bigger guys, the smaller guys

benefit.''4 Some mixture of nation building and the promotion of social cohesion seem evident in

these remarks.

        Such thinking reflects the corporatist tripartite bargaining intrinsic to many European

social democracies (Högfeldt, 2005).       In these countries, representatives of big labor, big

government, and big business periodically got together to map out economic strategies for the

entire country. Such negotiations are obviously easier if the same big businesses are represented

year after year (Roe, 2003).       Innovative and dynamic upstart big businesses may, quite

understandably, fail to adhere to tripartite agreements made by their more sedately run former

competitors. Indeed, staid established firms might even be able to use such bargains to drive

upstarts (Rajan and Zingales, 2003)



3.       Data

Our measures of the stability of each country’s biggest businesses are from Fogel et al. (2008).

They list the biggest employers in each country in the 1975 and 1996, from Dun & Bradstreet's

Principals of International Business. These lists include a wide spectrum of businesses: listed

and unlisted firms, corporations and other businesses, as well as private sector and state

controlled enterprises (SCEs).5 This catholicism evades sample selection problems due to stock

markets, and thus listed firms, being more or less common in some economies. Enterprises not

usually considered “businesses”, such as educational institutions, medical institutions,

membership organizations, government agencies, and the like are excluded, though.

         La Porta et al. (1999), Claessens et al. (2000), Faccio and Lang (2002), and others show

that large businesses outside the US and UK are often members of business groups, not

freestanding firms. Using raw data provided by those researchers, as well as data on controlling

shareholders from Hoover’s online, Worldscope, SDC, Forbes’ annual lists of billionaires,

newspaper archives, case studies, academic research papers, corporate websites, corporate

histories, and business family biographies, Fogel et al. (2008) consolidate group member firms

into business groups. They define a firm as controlled if it is so defined in any of these sources,

or if 20% or more of its stock is voted by a wealthy family, government, trust, or bank.6 The

stability of big business is thus gauged by the continued importance of the largest businesses,

whether groups or freestanding firms, in each country. This avoids problems due to intragroup

asset transfers.    However, consolidating firms into groups leaves countries like Sweden and

5
  We use the term state controlled enterprise (SCE) rather than state owned enterprise (S.O.E.) because the
state may hold a control block without owning the firm outright.
6
  La Porta et al. (1999) shows that 51% is not necessary as a single dominant shareholder can exert
effective control when all other shareholders are small. We use voting rights to assign control, for cash flow
rights and voting rights diverge substantially in some countries because of dual share classes and control
pyramids.
                                                      8
South Africa only a few extremely large businesses. Since even the 15th or 20th biggest business

in such countries is quite small, the stability measures define each country’s big business sector

as its ten largest employers (if there are ties in tenth place, all the ties are included).

        Gauging the stability of a country’s large business sector requires determining whether or

not each leading 1975 business persist to 1996. One obvious approach is to define persist as “still

in the top ten list in 1996”. But a truly vibrant economy might admit new businesses to the top

ten, even as the 1975 top ten prosper. A more suitable definition might thus target 1975 top ten

businesses that grow no slower than GDP to 1996; though this might be inappropriate for an

economy that shrank from 1975 to 1996. Or a firm might persist if it employs no less than 50%,

25%, or 10% of its 1975 workforce in 1996.

        Below, we use a combined definition – a top ten 1975 business persists if it retains top

ten list in 1996 or grow at least as fast as its country’s GDP from 1975 to 1996. Thus, we define

persistence for each 1975 top ten business I as the maximum of δi and ηi, with

              ⎧ 1 if i is in the top ten lists in both 1975 and 1996
[1]      δi = ⎨
              ⎩0 otherwise

and

              ⎧1 if its employment grew no slower than GDP in both 1975 and 1996
[2]      ηi = ⎨
              ⎩0 otherwise

        The country’s equal-weighted stability index is then

                         ∑ max[δ ,η ]

        Using this procedure, Fogel et al. (2008) construct various alternative stability measures

                                                    9
including or excluding financial firms, multinational subsidiaries, and sometime state controlled

enterprises in all possible combinations. Since they find two of these to be representative of the

others, so we focus here on minimally inclusive indexes Ω E and Ω L using the top ten private-

sector nonfinancial domestically controlled businesses only, and maximally inclusive indexes Ω E

and Ω L that also includes sometime state-controlled enterprises, foreign controlled enterprises,

and financial firms as well. Table 1 presents summary statistics for these four measures.

         Our objective is to see if big business stability, shown to correlate with slow growth by

Fogel et al. (2008) might correlate positively with offsetting laudable social outcomes. We

therefore examine a broad spectrum of measures of such outcomes.

         We first consider several measures of public goods provision. These are:



Health

We use three indicators to measure the average level of public health from 1996 to 2000. “Infant

mortality” is the number of infants dying before reaching age one, per one thousand live births.

“Child mortality” is the estimated number of infants dying before reaching age five, per one

thousand live births, assuming the current age-specific mortality rates hold. “Life expectancy” is

the number of years a newborn baby would live holding the current patterns of mortality constant

throughout its life. All three indicators come from the World Development Indicators (WDI)

database online, made available by the World Bank.



Education

Measures of public expenditures on education are collected from WDI for the period of 1996 to

2000. “Public spending on education” consists of current and capital public expenditure on

education and subsidies to private education as a percentage of total GDP. We also obtain data

on “education attainment” from Barro and Lee (2001). This variable indicates the total number of

years of schooling in the adult population aged 25 or older in 1995.

                                                10
Infrastructure

We are interested in four aspects of infrastructure essential to social economic development:

“electricity” is the net production of electric power by power plants, measured in MWh per

capita; “roads” is kilometers of paved roads as a percentage of all roads in the country;

“telecommunication” is fixed and mobile phone line subscribers per one thousand people; and

“internet” is broadband internet access subscribers per one thousand people. All four measures

are taken from WDI and are averaged from 1996 to 2000.



Pollution

We measure “water pollution” by the number of metric tons of organic water pollutant emissions

per day and “air pollution” by the number of metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per capita.

Both measures again come from WDI and take the average values of 1996 to 2000.



Overall Quality of Life

We use the United Nation’s Human Development Index (HDI) to measure the overall quality of

life.   This index is constructed to incorporate three dimension indices capturing nations’

achievements in health, education, and standard of living relative to the best performing country

in each dimension. Specifically, the health dimension index is based on life expectancy at birth,

the education dimension on adult literacy and the gross enrollment of primary, secondary and

tertiary schools combined, and the standard of living dimension on Purchasing Power Parity

adjusted GDP per capita values in U.S. dollars. The technical note of each year’s Human

Development Report contains further details of the index construction and can be accessed at

http://hdr.undp.org. This paper uses the average HDI from 1997 to 2000.




                                               11
        To gauge each economy’s concern for inequality, we consider measures of income

distribution and abject poverty:



Poverty:

We use poverty headcount ratios to measure poverty. Poverty defined using “$1 a day” is the

percentage of the population living on less than $1.08 a day at 1993 prices, adjusted for

Purchasing Power Parity.      Poverty defined using “$2 a day” is similarly defined, with the

benchmark set at $2.15 a day. A value of 2% is assigned to countries whose poverty rate sits

below 2%. Data is averaged between 1996 and 2000 wherever possible, but is missing for 24

countries, 21 of which OECD members, plus Hong Kong, Israel, and Singapore. A value of zero

is assigned to these countries.



Income Inequality:

Gini coefficients, first introduced by the Italian statistician Corrado Gini in 1912, are widely

accepted as a measure of income inequality. To ensure robustness of results, we use two versions

of Gini coefficients, one published by the World Development Indicators (WDI) database, and

the other by the World Income Inequality Database (WIID), detailed in Deininger and Squire

(1996). The WDI data is undated, whereas the WIID data is for 1996 or the closest year

available.



        Finally, we consider measures of the bargaining power of labor.



Unemployment:

We use unemployment rate as a percentage of total labor force to account for the share of the total

labor force that is currently without work but seeking employment. For robustness, we also use




                                                12
unemployment rates by gender, similarly defined. The data is retrieved from the online WDI

database.



Labor Rights:

We use three measures of labor rights, all taken from Botero, et al. (2004). First, “union density”

is the percentage of the total labor force affiliated to labor unions in 1997. Second, “the right to

form unions” is a four-value dummy that assumes a maximum value of 1 if the country's

constitution expressly grants the right to form labor unions. The dummy is set to 0.67 if labor

unions are described as a matter of public policy or public interest, 0.33 if labor unions are

otherwise mentioned in the constitution, and 0 otherwise. Third, “minimum wage” is a dummy

variable that equals 1 if a mandatory minimum wage is either defined by statute, or established by

mandatory collective agreement and made legally binding for most sectors of the economy, and 0

otherwise.



Labor Protection:

We measure the protection of labor afforded by social security laws with indices capturing “old

age, disability, and death benefits”, “sickness and health benefits”, and “unemployment benefits”.

A higher value of the old-age benefits index means higher post-retirement life expectancy, fewer

months of contributions or employment required for normal retirement by law, lower deductions

in the worker's monthly salary to cover these benefits, and larger proportion of the net pre-

retirement salary covered by the pension. A higher value of the sickness benefits index means

fewer months of contributions or employment required to qualify for these benefits by law, lower

deductions in the worker's monthly salary to cover these benefits, shorter waiting period, and

higher percentage of the net salary covered for a two-month sickness spell. The unemployment

benefits index is defined similarly to the sickness benefits index, with a higher value indicating

fewer months of contribution, lower deduction, shorter waiting period, and higher percentage of


                                                13
salary covered for a one-year unemployment spell. All three indices come from Botero, et al.

(2004).



          Each specific variable and its source are described in detail in Table 2. Their summary

statistics are displayed in Table 3.



4.        Findings

Section two outlined three sets of arguments as to why big business stability might be socially

desirable even if it retards economic growth somewhat. First, big business stability might permit

sustained investment in public goods. Second, big business stability might permit stronger labor

rights. Third, big business stability might level income distributions and contribute to a more

egalitarian society.

          In the tables below, we first document simple correlation coefficients of the stability

variables with a set of social outcomes, and then regress the social outcome measures on stability

and per capita GDP. This is because countries with higher per capita GDP are likely to exhibit

better outcomes across a range of development outcomes – economic and social. We wish to test

for big business stability contributing to laudable social outcomes through channels other than

economic prosperity.



4.1       Public Goods

Table 4 considers the possibility that a stable big business sector permits governments to invest

more in public goods. We gauge the quality of a country’s public goods in a variety of ways. Its

health care is reflected in its infant mortality rate, child mortality rate, and overall life expectancy.

Table 4 shows lower infant and child mortality rates as well as greater life expectancies in

countries with more stable maximally inclusive lists, suggesting a possible social offset to laggard

economic growth. But these correlations disappear or switch signs after controlling for per capita

                                                   14
GDP. If anything, countries at a given level of per capita GDP that opt for big private-sector

business stability appear to exhibit both worse health care and slower economic growth.

        A very important social goal is education. Measures of the quality of the countries’

education – mean education attainment and public spending on education – show no correlation

with big business stability after controlling for per capita GDP – though the simple correlations

with the maximally inclusive stability indexes are significant..

        Public infrastructure is also composed of critically important public goods. Electricity

provision, the quality of roads, telecommunication infrastructure, and internet penetration all

exhibit intermittently significant positive simple correlation coefficients with the stability

indexes; but all fade to insignificance after controlling for per capita GDP.

        Another set of high demand public goods pertains to environmental protection, which we

gauge by water pollution and air pollution (in terms of CO2 emissions) statistics. Worse

pollution correlates with more stable big business sectors. The correlations between air pollution

and big business stability significantly weakens after controlling for per capita GDP; however,

water pollution is highly significantly and positively associated with private sector stability even

with per capita GDP as a control variable. Finally, the United Nations assesses the overall quality

of life in each of its member countries. This can be interpreted as an overall measure of the

consumption of private and public goods by the population, for it weights health care and

education against purely economic outcomes like a high per capita GDP. Big business stability is

positively correlated with the human development index, but this correlation evaporates when we

control for per capita GDP.

        If big business stability helps governments direct resources towards public goods, others

than those in Table 4 must be the focus. Insignificance cannot prove the absence of a relation, but

a tie to the quality of public goods is clearly elusive.



4.2     Income equality

                                                   15
If stable big businesses provide employment to those who would otherwise be marginalized, this

may be a public policy outcome worthy for which a few points of GDP growth might well be

sacrificed. Table 5 measures egalitarianism by each country’s GINI coefficient and by the

fraction of the population condemned to live on less than one or two dollars per day.

        More stable big business sectors are actually correlated with worse inequality in the

simple correlation coefficients. If inequality is measured by the fraction of people living on less

than two US dollars per day, the table actually shows worse inequality where big business is more

stable even after controlling for per capita GDP.

        If big business stability seeks to promote egalitarian outcomes, it is remarkably

unsuccessful.



4.3     Labor Power

Table 6 correlates big business stability to the status of labor in the economy. Unemployment –

total, male, and female – is utterly uncorrelated with big business stability. So are labor rights,

for unions are neither more common nor easier to form where big businesses are more stable.

Minimum wages are also not more likely to be mandatory by law; and various benefits for old

age, disability, and death or for illness are no more generous. (Though health benefits are higher

where big businesses are more stable if the visibly extreme observations of Indonesia, Malaysia,

and Sri Lanka are retained.)       Unemployment benefits appear positively correlated with big

business stability in simple correlations, but these are rendered insignificant when per capita GDP

controls are added.

        If big business stability permits a greater voice for organized labor, we cannot detect it.



4.4     Robustness Checks

We conduct residual analysis and robustness checks to ensure that our results are not driven by

outliers or other statistical anomalies.


                                                 16
        Generalized White tests suggest the presence of heteroskedasticity in regressions

involving public health measures, electricity, education attainment, inequality, and labor rights.

We follow White (1980) to deal with this problem by reporting heteroskedasticity-consistent

standard errors for all regressions in the tables, although using Ordinary Least Squared standard

errors does not qualitatively change the results. This exercise indicates wide tails in the social

outcome variables’ distributions, and closer inspection indicates this to mainly affect their right

tails. Substituting versions of these variables winsorized at 5% eliminates this problem, leaving

White's generalized tests indicating no heteroskedasticity, and generates qualitatively similar

results to those shown.

        Our control variable is the average of the logarithm of per capita GDP from 1996 to

2000. Our results do not change if we replace the control by the log of 1990 per capita GDP.

Using the latter avoids possible distortions of GDP figures by the late 1990s economic and

financial crisis in the Asian countries.

        Wherever possible, we also substitute closely related variables for our variables to

confirm robustness. For example, using “government spending on education as a percentage of

government expenditure” yields qualitatively identical results to those using “government

spending on education as a percentage of GDP”. Similarly, using “labor participation rates”

instead of unemployment rates result in qualitatively similar predictions.

        Finally, we produce residual diagnostics such as Cook’s D and student residual and an

“added-variable (AV)” plot (also referred to as a “partial regression plot”) for each regression to

identify unusual or influential observations. The AV plot essentially lets us plot the residuals

from the dependent variable, given the control, against the residuals from the independent

variable of interest (in this paper the stability indexes), given the control. If any observation

seems influential, we rerun the regression without it and check for changes in the signs and

significance of the regression coefficients. For example, South Africa appears to be an outlier in

the “public health” regressions. However, removing it does not change the results qualitatively.


                                                17
The only place where outliers are evident is in the “sickness and health benefits” regression, and

its results with and without the outliers are discussed in the text accordingly.




5.      Conclusions

We undertook this exercise hoping to find evidence that big business stability might correlate

with laudable social outcomes – liberty, equality, and fraternity in the words of the French

revolutionaries. Such non-economic goals are legitimate policy objectives, and if stability in the

large corporate sector contributed to them in any important way, no matter how indirectly,

policies designed to stabilize that sector might be justifiable even if they impede growth by

slowing the process creative destruction.

        Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. This is a first pass analysis only, and

much more work is needed to conclude that no such contribution exists. But if one does exist, it

must be subtle, or well hidden.          General equilibrium interconnections, more complicated

statistical interactions, or any number of complications might be in play. But our inability to find

clear evidence of big business stability contributing to laudable non-economic policy goals

suggests that we might entertain other reasons politicians might value big business stability.

        One possibility is political rent-seeking (Krueger, 1974, 1993). Big businesses might be

well positioned to invest in political favors they can call in when needed7.         If so, big business

stability might well be wholly undesirable condition – inimical to rapid growth and primarily a

result of special interests manipulating the political system. Enhancing the stability of the big

business sector might thus bestow substantial benefits, but on a narrow special interest group –

the insiders of those businesses – not on the economy as a whole.

        Another possibility is that policies aimed at saving or stabilizing large established

7
 A growing empirical literature documents the first-order importance of rent-seeking relationships between
politicians and the business sector in low-income economies. See e.g. Fisman and Svennson (2000) and
Fisman (2002), as well as developed economies, see e.g. Fisman and Di Tella. (2001).

businesses reflect behavioral finance influencing public policy (Shleifer, 2000).    Kahneman and

Twersky (1979) demonstrate that people are loss averse – a loss of a given magnitude has

negative welfare effects that far outweigh the positive effects of an equal sized gain. This gives

rise to a so-called conservative bias in human behavior. If voters irrationally fear losing a current

set of jobs, even though better ones are likely to come along, politicians intent on winning

elections should represent such concerns in public policy decisions – even if this slows growth.

        We wholeheartedly concede the tentative nature of these musings and welcome further

research that might clarify matters. In particular, the role of cognitive biases in explaining

seemingly unjustifiable economic policies merits consideration.
