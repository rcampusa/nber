                     A Competitive Theory of Monopoly Unionism


                                     ABSTRACT




     This paper sets up a microeconomic theory of labor unions. It dis—
cusses their formation and goals, their hierarchical structure, and the
nature   of rent distribution. The theory provides predictions for the

probability that an industry or occupation will be unionized, the proportion

of that industry that will be unionized, and observed wage differentials

within that industry. It discusses the way that those values change in

response to changes in the supply of labor, demand for labor, cost of

organizing the union, and cost of defeating the union. Institutions such

as featherbedding, fringe benefits, and seniority are rationalized in this

framework. The model is consistent with competitive factor and product

markets.

        The last two decades have witneâsed the growth              of   an increasingly

rigorous brand of labor economics. The theories of labor supply, labor

cuality, information in the labor market, and labor contracts have received a

siificant amount              of   attention and   the construction of theories with

microeconomic         foundations has led to a greater understanding of the
phenomena. One             area    for which this has not occurred is the analysis of labor
unions and how they function within the labor market. tbdels of union
behavior treat the union              rather   than the individual in it   as the   basic unit of
observation and suggest some behavior for that entity. This paper will adopt
a    micro-level approach and I will argue that one can go surprisingly far

toward the analysis of union behavior by employing a simple model where

workers and firms are the rational basic unit.

        The goal is to predict which industries, occupations and time periods are

most likely tobe characterized by strong unions and to analyze the behavior

of unions under a           variety of circumstances. A central theme is that           it is

unproductive to            think of the union as having an       objective function.The point

is perhaps best understood by                considering   some puzzles which arise when the

union, rather than its more fundamental elements, is the basic unit of

analysis.          First, most models of union behavior allow a labor market which

does not clear. Some               workers   who would like to work are turned away from

union      jobs.    What happens to those workers? How do they influence the union's

strategy? How can a labor market which does not clear be analyzed? Second,

if   not    all    firms   in an industry are unionized, but union and nonunion firms

sell the same product in an often competitive product market, then firms face

different labor costs. How can they coexist selling the product at the same

price? Third, given the highly hierarchical nature of most unions where
                                              2




seniority    plays a major role, why don't the least priviledged workers within

the union join forces with nonunion workers to undermine the power of the

union? In particular, the young workers could form their own union making

employers and themselves apparently better off while destroying any union

ecuilibrium. Why doesn't this happen more often? Finally, few models (Rosen

l969 s an exception) allow the firm to play an active role. In most, the

labor demand curve is taken as given, and the union selects some wage which is

consistent with maximizing its objective function. There is no allowance by

the union, or the analyses in general, for the possibility that the firm will

react differently to different wage demands except as expressed by labor

demand.

       This paper starts from utility and profit maximization by worker and firm

respectively and builds a model which deals with these issues explicitly.

Labor markets clear in the sense that anyone can enter the industry and claim

a nonunion job, but there are queues for union jobs. The length of the oueue

is the direct result of union and firm behavior and the union takes this into

account when announcing its wage demand. The product market clears as the

firm   pushes ts anti—union activity to the point       where   costs are equalized
across union and nonunion firms. The life—cycle nature of union benefits
provides the young workers with an incentive to remain "true" to the union at
the expense of short run     gain.     Since the young inherit the seniority rights
from   retiring   workers, all workers are better off by this deferred pannent
structure.     Finally, the firm     plays a central role in determining the   outcome

of the    union's efforts and its behavior is taken into account by the

optimiz.ng workers who potentially comprise the union.

       "Union" is defined here as a collection of workers who act       together to
call out   wage   (and later, quantity) demands to    firms.    Firms buy labor from
                                              3




the union at the union wage or, at some cost, fight the union and buy labor in

the competitive "fringe" (which may be much larger than the union sector).

Product markets are competitive, and the equilibrium that emerges is a well-

defined blend of competitive and         monopoly, not unlike the dominant-firm-with-
competitive fringe equilibrium found in the industrial organization

literature. This simple structure yields a stable equilibrium which varies in

unambiguous directions as the relevant observable parameters are altered.

        The major implications ofthe model are:

        1.)   Union and nonunion fizms earn the same profits         so product market

equilibrium   is viable.
        2.) The more elastic is      the supply of labor to an industry or

occupation, the lower is the probability that a union will             exist in   that

industry      or occupation.

        3.) As the demand for labor becomes more convex, the probability that

some   proportion of the labor force will be unionized rises. Contrary to
Marshall's assumption, inelasticity of demand for labor does not imply an
increase in union power manifested by an          increase in the union membership or
wage differential.
       4.) Inelasticity of product demand increases the likelihood that the

industry will be       unionized.
       5.)    As the   cost of   running a union and   enforcing wage demands rises, the
probability that a union exists falls.            &it given   that one does exist, the
union   wage and wage differential increases and the proportion in the union

tends to decrease as costs rise. A corollary is that anti—union legislation

results in a smaller likelihood of a union, and a smaller proportion of union

workers within a unionized industry, but larger union wage and wage

differential. Also, as a corollary, as the attrition rate rises, the
                                                4




occupation is less likely tobe unionized, but will have a higher wage

differential if unionized.

        6.)    Wage demands are set by a centralized "national" union rather than
by the "local" on a firm—by—firm       basis.       In addition, nationals may   play   an
important role in      inter-local   union transfers through strike and pension
funds.
        7.) Union certification becomes less likely as the definition of the
relevant electorate broadens. Further, a broader definition makes workers, as
well    as firms   (although not necessarily union leaders), better of f.
        8.)    Under reasonable circumstances, the observed wage differential

overstates rather than understates the true effect of a union on wage rates

and the overstatement is smallest for industries or occupations where the

proportion of union workers is close to zero or one. In addition, there is no

straightforward connection between wage differentials, proportion in the

union, and union power.

        9.)    "Featherbedding" is both rent maxizing and Pareto timai.

rther,        a union which can select quantity as well as price selects the pre—

union emplonent level.

        10.) Union workers within an industry or occupation will tend to be

older   than the nonunion workers. Further, as the prooion in the union
ncreases, the average age of union          is nonincreasing, the average age
                                          workers

of nonunion workers is nonincreasing, and the difference between the age of
unon     and nonunion workers first increases then decreases with the        proportion
of   unionized workers.

        11.) Union workers take a greater part of their compensation in the form

of fringes than do nonunion workers.

          12.) Although older workers receive greater benefits from the union than

younger workers, young workers have no incentive to break the coalition.

However, in the absence of any initial union set—up costs, once—and—for—all

transfers to the older workers make them more likely to vote for a union than

young workers.

          13.) Union—nonunion wage differentials move countercyclically.

I. The t.del

          Consider an industry comprised of S competitive firms each of which has

a demand for labor given by L = d(W)             where W is the wage rate and L is

the number of workers in the firm. There are R(W) workers in the occupation

or industry. Assume (relaxed below) that R(W) =             R   so that labor is supplied

inelastically to the occupation.1 Also assume that the demand for output is

perfectly elastic so        that   second—order product market effects can be

ignored. The structure is to consider first a one period setting, where

results are easier to obtain and then to prove that these results hold in a

multiperiod context with some modifications.

The   Opportunity Incus:
          Risk neutral workers can band together       to form a "union"    which calls out
a union wage,    .     individual firm faced with the union demand can
either pay W and then choose to hire d(W) workers or at some fixed cost,
 C.   ,     which   varies across firms, can defeat the union and pay wage
hiring d(WN)         workers.       C.   can be thought of as the cost of   employing

enough "union busters" to defeat the union or as contributions to an employee
benefits fund which appease the current work force. Alternatively, if unions

have beneficial effects on productivity as Freeman [1976] and own and bdoff

[1978] have argued,         C,     is the cost of foregone productivity effects of the

union. Let C.            g(C.) with distribution function G(C)        •2     That workers
                                                                       6


 can   impose a cost C. ,                      on a firm endows them with a property right. The

National Labor        Relations                    Act may increase the cost associated with defeating

the union, but even in the absence of this law, workers impose some costs on

firms by disruptive actions and thereby retain some property right.

        Let the firm have                 a standard concave production function. The firms
profit function depends                        upon the price of output, price of capital and wage

rate. Initially assume that demand for the product is perfectly elastic so

that the first two prices are given and invariant across firms. Suppress the

prices of capital and output                            II =    1(W)   .   If   the firm hires union labor, the

firm's profits are lI(W) .                             If      the firm hires nonunion labor, the firm's

profits are II(WN) - C.                        .     The firm chooses to fight the union if



         Tt(w ) <    11(W            —   C.
            U               N   )




or if

         II*(W,
                    WN)             II(WN) -
                                                    rt(Wu)
                                                               > C.


For    any given W, WN combination then G(ll*(wu,                                  WN)) of the firms will find
it    more profitable to be nonunion firms.                                Therefore the demand for labor by

                           WNfl)d(W) and the demand for labor by union
nonunion firms is S[G(rt*[W,

firms is S[1G(TI*[wU,wN)Jd(w) . The market equilibrium condition is that
demand for labor equal the supply of labor:
 s1-G(rI'rw,        WNJ))d(wU) +                    S[G(fl*[w, WN])Jd(wN) =         R   or in   per—firm   notation,



(1)
         [l(ll*[wu,         wN])]d(W) + G(I*[Wu, WNJ)d(W) = P/S


       In this one period setting, the                                P. workers are locked into the industry

so eq. (1) defines the union's "opportunity locus." For any W that the
                                                                  7



union chooses,                a          will result which selects some proportion of the                  firms
as   union firms              consistent         with the condition that supply equals demand. A

higher W affects WN in two ways: First, it                                     increases   the   proportion   of

firms    that fight the union. That there are fewer union firms implies a
greater supply of labor to the nonunion sector, but also that there are a
larger number of nonunion firms which implies a greater demand for labor in
that sector. Second, higher W decreases the number of workers hired by
each of the union firms, sending the spillover into the nonunion sector. As
long    as demand curves                 are downward sloping, the basic shape of the opportunity
locus   will always be as                   shown in fiqure 1. In particular, it has its starting
point at             [We, W3 where                  ,    the   competitive wage, is given by

 d(Wc) = R/S              .       It   is always negatively sloped initially, positively sloped

as              gets large, below                       so that the nonunion wage is inferior to the

pre—existing competitive equilibrium,                          and it asymptotes to        w
       Consider the last statement first. As W goes to                                  infinity,
 G(ff(Wui WN)) goes                    to   1,   i.e.,   all firms      choose to   fight the union. Then

(1) becomes



       d(WN) = PJS



so          =         .       The intuition is clear. If                 the union chooses    such a high wage

that all         firms fight           the union, then all workers and all              firms are in the
nonunion sector so the situation there is identical to the initial competitive
labor market.

       It       is   equally clear that as                     goes to          from   above (no worker or
union will choose Wt < W)                                  goes       to W :   From (1), we      require
                                                                8




                                                         +                             = R/S

                    orrl(*[WWJ)id(W)                     + G(fl*[W    ,W)d(W) = R/S
But    this    is just a convex combination of d(Wc) and d(WN) •                               Since

 d(wc) = R/S          ,   only        =           will       avoid a contradiction.

           The intuition here is also clear. As W. shrinks to                                  ,    union firms

are    demanding no less than their                     competitive    share of labor and extracting

workers       from the nonunion sector in proportion to their numbers. Therefore,
the number          of workers left            in the    nonunion    sector     does not   exceed   the amount
that       these    firms employ in competition and so the wage rate there must be the

competitive one.

           Since          >    W implies that            union firms demand less than their

proportionate share, the spillover of workers to the nonunion sector crust

exceed the number that those firms employ in competition. This means that

       <        throughout. Given that WN= W                          as             approaches W      or
infinity, it must be the case that                                             (CL   opportunity locus) starts
                                                                     CL

is that although more workers are being thrown                                         into   the nonunion sector,

firms are switching from union to nonunion at an even more rapid rate, bidding

up the price of labor there.

An Alternative Derivation of the portunity cus and Product rket

Equilibrium:

        The reader may find artificial the assumption that firms are identical in

all    respects except for the cost of defeating the union. 3it                                             the   "union

busting"        function is easily separated from the firm and the analysis is

unchanged.             Lt        firms           be identical in all respects. T.t there be a group of
S potential             union busters whose alternative use of time is C.                                         g(C.)

         Union and nonunion firms exist in the same industry and there is no

we think of the C. as reflecting different costs of beating the union across

firms this proposition holds. The reason is that the enterpreneu.r or other

scarce factor that is responsible for that firm's being an effective union

buster captures the rent,                          (fl(WN) —   C.)       -            because union firms are

The Indifference Curves:

         A potential union consisting of all R workers takes the opportunity

locus     as given. It can select any                                ,       but   this will imply a particular
 WN .             In    addition, the choice.of                          affects the proportion of workers who

will be employed in the union sector for two reasons. First, it alters the

number           of firms      who   choose to fight the union. Second, it changes the number
of    workers employed by each                    in this section, all workers

a union firm and receive wage        is

(the    number of            union    workers divided by the total labor supply). Every

 [Wui WN pair implies a P .                         However, only     N pairs which lie on

the opportunity locus correspond to feasible P, W, WN combinations.                          (The

probability that a union job is obtained varies by worker characteristic, of

course, and this is the subject of the last half of this paper.)

        Workers are identical and risk—neutral ex ante so each has the same

objective function: maximize expected wealth. If                      it costs   Z per union

worker to administer the union, i.e., to hire the union                    leader,   strike or

enforce demands through other                  methods,   then the workers objective function is

to chose       W,.       so as to solve



                         P(W -     Z) + (1 —

opportunity          locus. Note that this answers the question as to which members

does the union represent. Ex ante, all R workers are represented. Ex

post,     PR workers are union members.'

        This is a straightforward maximizaiton problem, but insight can be gained

by considering it in two stages. We construct the union's (i.e., each

worker's) indifference curves from (5) and select W such that the

indifference curve               is    tangent to the opportunity locus.

        The indifference curve corresponding to any utility (wealth) level K is



(6)      K =                 -   Z) = (1 —
                P(W                          P)WN

Indifference curves are shown in figure 1 They almost always display this

shape. In particular, they start at the 450 line at K +                                          Z   ,   have negative

slope initially, then positive slope, generally have no inflexion points in

the negatively sloped region, one in the positively sloped region and

asymptote to K •                Consider each in turn.

       First, if            =           then (6) says

       P(WN                P)WN

infinity, from (4), P = 0                       ;    all   firms fight the union and union firms demand

no workers.        So from (7),                             WN = K

       The slope of the indifference curve is obtained by differentiating (6)

                    =           gdn*)d(w)d(w)                > 0




       The slope on the 450                 line         is given by


                   d(W )        — Z(- d'(W ) — g(0)d(W                        )2)

(11)

                                     d(W) [1+Zg(0)d(W)]

The nnerator is positive. If Z, g(0) or d(W) is small then the

denominator is positive so the slope of the indifference curve is negative.6
                                              13




       At the other extreme, as W approaches infinity,
                                                   dW
       is K,P=0,d(W)=0 so im— =0.
                                          U          N   IC


       The sense of the U—shaped indifference curve is this: Workers would like

both higher        and higher WN if nothing else were involved. t a higher

 W implies lower P .        Initially,    the value of an increase in W outweighs

the loss associated with a reduction in P so indifference curves are

negatively sloped. As W gets large and P gets small, however, the

benefits to increased W are swamped by the loss resulting from a

decreased P and workers view additional W as a bad, yielding positively

sloped indifference curves.

Equilibrium:

       Define the "critical indifference curve" as the one that yields the same

utility as the competitive equilibrium. Using (7), the critical indifference

curve is the one that has K =            or
                                 W

                W - P(W   - Z)
(12)     WN =       1—P




A union equilibrium exists with certainty if the critical indifference curve

crosses the opportunity locus, since this implies that there exists some

feasible W, W, P combination which yields an expected utility level higher

than the one offered by competition. In figure 2, if IC0 were the critical

indifference curve, then a union equilibrium would exist. It need not exist,

however. If Z were very large, for example, so that it is expensive to run

the union, an equilibrium is unlikely to exist. Although the critical

indifference curve and opportunity locus both asymptote to W,..   ,   the
indifference curve may well lie everywhere above the opportunity locus. In
                                                   14



this    case, workers are better off accepting the competitive wage and not

forming      a    union.




        If a      union equilibrium exists, i.e., if      the   critical indifference curve
intersects         the opportunity       locus, the selection of an optinun union wage is
given    by the first order conditions of (5) that




                    dWN        dWN
             a.
(13)                       ICU            OL
             b.     [1(fl*)]d(w)+G(fl*)d(W) = R/S




Therefore,         given a   G(1!*) distribution, a d(W)        f unction and Z ,    the union
optimum can be obtained. The solution described by (13a,b) is almost always
an interior one, given the shapes of the indifference curves               and opportunity
locus. This implies that an occupation or industry will almost never be

entirely unionized, if         it    is unionized at all. It     always pays to leave    some

of   those    firms   best able   to "beat the union" out of the union      sector, rather
than   choosing a union wage so close to W as to make it unprofitable for

them   to    oppose. This seems to £ it the stylized fact that unions rarely, if

ever, organize all firms            in   an industry.

       Finally, in this one—period context, no difficulty arises with respect to

ex   ante v.      ex post preferences. Although union        workers might wish     to behave

differently once they realize that they have won the lottery, this is not

permitted by the one—period framework. Below, in the rrtultiperiod context,

discrepancies between ex ante and ex post winners and losers are resolved by

assigning workers to the union on an age or seniority basis. The union jobs
                                         15




will always go to the older workers first so that over one's lifetime, each

worker expects to be a loser at some time and a winner at others.

     A key point is that even if ex post losers would like to bid with ex post

winners for the union jobs, they are precluded from doing so. The firm can

entertain these offers as a way to beat the union. As such, it carries with

it cost C,    imposed by union workers, and therefore is already implicitly

accounted for in G(C.) ,   the    distribution of costs of defeating the union.

This model does not permit firms to costlessly accept the labor offer of a

scab. Even in the absence of NLRB rules, it seems reasonable to view the

hiring of scabs as carrying some real costs, perhaps larger to some firms than

others.

A Note on Labor rket Equilibrium:

     The labor market clears in the sense that aggregate supply of labor

equals aggregate demand. Workers prefer the union jobs and in a multiperiod

context (below) queue for them.     3it this market permits workers to enter the

occupation in accordance with their own labor supply optimization and no

artificial supply restrictions are required. The wage in the nonunion sector

adjusts to clear the market which allows free entry.

     Incidentally, herein lies the difference between this model and the

dominant firm construct found in the industrial organization literature (see

Cohen and Cyert (1975) and rlton (1979), for examples). First, dominant

firms, by restricting their supply insure that their own profits are maximized

and second, commodities trade at the same price. In this model, the union

does not have any power over the labor supply function and the wage in the

nonunion sector lie below the union wage. Firms, unlike customers, are not

permitted costlessly to buy from the lowest price sellers of labor.     In the

dominant firm model, C.    is zero for all consumers, and their ability to buy
                                      16




from the lowest priced seller insures that the price of the commodity is the

same across sellers.




II. Extensions and Implications of the del

The Supply of Labor:

     For expositional convenience, we assumed that the supply of labor to the

occupation or industry was perfectly inelastic. In this section we relax that

assumption, allowing the labor force to be responsive to the actions of the

union. An individual considers the expected utility from work in an

occupation and compares it to the alternatives. By definition, if a union

organizes an occupation, it does so because the expected utility of each

member rises. Therefore let R , the number of workers in the occupation be

given by R(K) where K , defined in (6), is the expected utility of entering

the occupation and R'(K) > 0 .   As the expected wage in the occupation rises,

those whose comoarative advantage previously lay elsewhere, are now induced to

acquire the requisite skills for this occupation.

     The main result is that a union is less likely to exist as the supply of

labor becomes more elastic. tchanically, this is because the opportunity

locus shifts downward and the critical indifference curve shifts upward making

an intersection of these curves less likely. The proof of these propositions

is contained in appendix A. The intuition behind it is this: When the supply

of labor is elastic, choosing a higher—than—competitive union wage induces

more workers into the industry. As the result, the wage in the nonunion

sector must fall more in order for nonunion firms to take up this larger

residual labor force. This forces the opportunity locus downward. Similarly,

since the probability that a given worker will obtain a union job is lower the
more workers there are in the industry, a worker requires a higher nonunion

wage for a given union wage to obtain the same level of expected utility.

Thus, the critical indifference curve or the xninimn combination of (W1 wN)

which the worker views as preferable to the competitive wage, W ,      rises,
making a union equilibrium less likely.

     At the extreme, the supply of labor to the occupation could be perfectly

elastic. This requires a particular kind of homogeneity in ability so that no

workers are relatively better at some occupations than others. Under these

circumstances, no union equilibriu exists because raising the expected wage

above W brings about an infinite sized labor force so that the probability

of obtaining a union job falls to zero and all workers prefer the competitive

wage. To the extent that the union can restrict entry into the occupation, it

gives some inelasticity to the labor supply curve and we are back to the case

just analyzed.

     This may be the difference between unions organized along craft

(occupational) lines and those organized along industrial lines. To the

extent that the long run supply of labor to an occupation is more inelastic

than to an industry, unions are more likely to be successful in crafts. As

long as it is easier for an individual to switch from industry i to j       than

it is for him to switch from occupation k to h , the proposition holds.

Heterogeneity in talents across occupations makes this feasible, even for long

run labor supply. Historically, craft unions were organized before industrial

unions and there is some evidence (see Lewis (1963), Rees (1962)) that the

former have been more successful than the latter.

The Demand for Labor:

     Let us begin this section on a negative note: Although there are a

number of statements that can be made about how the demand for labor affects
                                          18




union behavior, excluded from that set is the traditional (a la arshall,

Pigou, Hicks) and intuitive claim that unions have more power and are more

likely to be successful the more inelastic is the demand for labor. The

reason is quite simple. Although it is true that a given wage increase

displaces a smaller number of union workers the more inelastic is the demand

for labor, a given number of displaced workers drives down the nonunion wage

by more, the more inelastic is the demand for labor. These spillovers must be

absorbed by a nonunion sector finn with that same inelastic labor demand,

implying that the wage rate in nonunion jobs must fall by more. This reduces

the expected wage at the same time that the inelasticity increases it via

higher union wages. The net effect is ambiguous, but in some cases, the

effects are exactly offsetting so that inelasticity of labor demand does not

affect the equilibrum.

        Surprisingly, what is crucial is convexity of the demand curve. As the

demand for labor becomes more convex, a given increase in the union wage

results in a smaller displacement of workers. Also,            as   the demand for labor

becomes more convex, a   given   displacement   of   workers into    the nonunion sector
reduces wages by a smaller   amount there. As the result, the opportunity locus

shifts upward, i.e., for a given union wage, a higher nonunion wage is

available. similarly, since the probability of obtaining a union job rises

with the convexity of the labor demand curve,        workers   are as well off as

before with a lower nonunion wage. Thus the critical indifference curve

shifts down, i.e., at a given union wage, a lower nonunion wage is

acceptable. th of these forces increase the probability of obtaining a

union   equilibrium.7 The proof of this proposition is contained in the last
section of appendix 2.
                                         19




     n increase in the demand for labor can have almost any effect depending

upon the shape of the new demand curve relative to the old. However, in the

simple case where demand curves are linear and the increase takes the form of

a parallel shift, there will be no effect on the probability of obtaining a

union equilibrimi nor on the union—nonunion wage differential. The formal

proof is contained in the first part of appendix 2. This suggests that

business cycle variations in union behavior and results are not caused by

difference in the demand for labor per se. Findings such as those by Freeman

(1980), doff (1979), and Blau and Kahn (1980) that union employment is more

procyclic than nonunion employment must rely on inter-industry or

interoccupational differences in product cyclical sensitivity for their

explanation.8

Demand for Product:

     These results suggests that the analyses of b.rshall, Ricks, and Pigou

are based on an inappropriate assumption. They argued that the more inelastic

is the demand for labor, the more likely it is that unions raise wage. They

proceed to discuss the conditions under which the demand for labor will be

more inelastic. In the last section, we showed that the premise on which

their analysis is based may be false. Yet, one of rshall's implications,

that union power increases with the inelasticity of product demand, holds.

This is not because of the relationship between inelasticity of product and

labor demands, but because of the relationship between ine1asticiy of product

demand and convexity of labor demand.

     The more inelastic is product demand, the more convex is the relevant

labor demand curve. To see this, consider a firm which produces with labor

plus one manager. In competitive equilibrin, the output price, P         ,   is
                                                                      QO
defined by the minimim   of   the presumably U-shaped average cost curve which
                                              20


depends, in turn, upon the wage rate. If D(PQ) is the market demand for
product, output Q =        f(L)    given manager present, then equilibrium is the

vector IL, W, PQ SI          which solves the following system:



       (S)L = R               (Demand for labor equals supply of labor)

       Sf(L)                 (Supply of product equals demand for product)
                  D(PQ)
      W =                    (First hires labor to set VMP    equal   to wage)
               Pf'(L)
                frN[Average Cost (W, fixed cost, f(L))]

                              (firms earn zero profits).

       Starting at equilibrium shown in figure 2 by EWE, R/SI ,          let   the union

raise the wage rate to W. If all else were the same, the firm reduces labor

demand to lo            But the increase in the wage to W shifts the average cost

curve upward. If all firms were unionized, this would raise the equilibrium

price of output, PQ .             But even if all firms are not unionized, this must

happen. Since this move raises the value of a "union buster," the salary of

the manager in the nonunion firm is bid up to the point where the minimum of

the   average cost in the nonunion firm equals that in the union firm. (Because
this is a fixed cost to the nonunion firm,         output   there will rise while the
higher   marginal cost induces output to fall in the union firm.) When PQ

rises to its new level, the demand for labor shifts from d(W) to d(W) so

each union firm employs l.           rather than 10 of labor. Similarly, nonunion

firms employ 12 of labor and WN is the solution to equation (1). The

relevant demand for labor curve is then AB for union firms and BC for

nonunion firms which adds convexity to the demand for labor. Further, the

more inelastic is the demand for output, the larger is the increase in price

      which makes the labor demand even more convex. But as argued above,
                                                          41



increased       convexity increases the              likelihood      of a union ecuilibri so less

elastic      product demand rests in a higher probability of a union.
The Costs of Operating the Union:
       :t has already             been   noted that as the cost of nning the union and
er.forcing wage demands, z , rises, the likelihood of a union equilibrium
diminishes. Here it is shown that if a union ecuilibrium does exist, the
observed       union wage and           wage differential will be larger when operating costs
are higher. in addition, the proportion of workers in union jobs tends to
fall as operating costs rise.

as z         rises.     There will be fewer union workers, but each union worker will
earn a higher union wage                   to   ccmoensate   for   the   higher      costs   of administering
the union.           (See appendix 3 for the formal discussion.)

       e can also imagine varying the costs of opposing the union. Fbr
example, laws      which make it        more difficult     to defeat the union would shift the

 G(C.)     distribution rightward. alternatively, if the                shape of the G(C)
distribution      does not change, pro-union legislation can be thought of as

lowering Z , the cost of organization. Now for a lower level of expenditures

by   workers on union organization, the same distribution of costs of defeating
the union prevails. The            implication is straightforward: Pro—union

legislation, by      reducing       Z   for a given      distribution of C.     ,    increases       the

probability of obtaining a union equilibrium, increases the proportion in the

union,   and lowers the union wage and wage differential. This is analogous to
the situation in monopolistic product markets where cost saving technology
which lowers the marginal cost function increases                the   firm's output           and

profits,      but results    in   a decrease   in   price. It carries    with       it   the   somewhat
paradoxical result that prounion legislation reduces the distortion in

unionized      industries.
       To the extent that Z is lower in occupations or industries in which
finn    is relatively large, unions are more likely to exist there.
       size

However, if a union ecuilibrium does exist in a small firm industry, other
things   equal, the wage differential will be larger and               the   proportion

unionized smaller in this industry. The empirical implication is that the

probability     of there being any union workers in an            industry and the proportion

of   the work force holding union jobs rises with finn size.                  However,         among at
least partially unionized industries, the union-nonunion wage differential
varies inversely with average firm size.
Nationals and Locals:

       The discussion has been in the context of a union selecting a wage for

the entire industry or occupation. Thus, bargaining takes place at the
                                                    23



"national" level where "national" is defined as the market over which workers

are perfect substitutes. Now consider another possibility. Start with a

competitive industry and allow each firm's R,/S workers to vote separately on

whether or not that firm        should       be unionized and then to select the union

wage. The result is that locals do not maxirrLize                      workers'   expected wealth so

that wage setting should occur at the national level. This implication is not

new, but the usual reason for it relies on the relationship between bargaining

power and union worker solidarity. This is not what is operating here.

Because one local union's behavior affects market price and the aggregate

probability that a worker obtains a union job in a way different from that

perceived by the local, an inferior solution results. Fzther, it is novel

that the local sometimes establishes a wage rate that is too low rather than

too high.

     This section also lays the groundwork f or considering behavior by workers

in a union firm versus that by those in nonunion firms.                            such it is worthy

of some detail.

     Consider a wage WN                 The workers in an individual firm or local

union, unlike the national, take this as given and assume that they cannot

influence it. Also, the probability of being in a union that is relevant for

workers in firm i is


        -         0    if   fl*(w ,
                                U
                                      wC )   > C.

                  d(W )/d(W )         if fl*(W ,    W       )   < C.
                     U     N                  U         C


That is, if           is sufficiently high so that firm i opts to defeat the

union (say, by bribing the vote counter), then the probability of obtaining

the union wage is zero.        If the firm accepts the union, then the work force of
                                                              24




that   finn will     be reduced from d(Wc) tO                      d(Wu) workers so [d(Wu)3/td(Wc))
will   retain their        jobs while the rest are forced into the nonunion sector.

       The ecuation for the local union's indifference curve is then


          -       K-P(W —Z)

          WN=

                     WN

lies below that for the national. Thus, a local union might form even if the

competitive situation is better for all workers. Since all locals are ex ante

alike, these unions will learn of their mistakes at best ex post. Whether

they decertify the union, render it impotent or persist in long run myopic

behavior is not clear and is a standard prisoner's dilemma problem. As such,

the NLRB rules which allows the choice of union status by workers in elections
generally held or. a per fi basis, results in too much unionization in the

sense    that it     does not maximize worker's wealth. cause the workers n each
firu do not take their effects on the market                           into account, they are too
inclined toward unions.

        This suggests the implication that the wider the defir.tion of the voting

population,     the more      likely   is   the     unit to recoize               market effects and

therefore theless likely is the establishment of a union. So an NLP.B policy
wnch broaoened the oopulaton over whc t e_d certfcaton elect_ons,
wouid make workers, as well as fias (although not necessarily union leaders),
better off because it alters the rsoner's dilemma nature of the payoff
structure.
        Even if a union equilibriuxa does yield                    a higher expected wealth level

than    the competitive labor market, it is obvious that the Nash ecuilibrium
when locals choose               will deviate from the elibrium obtained                           when   a

national sets             .   Since    each local takes                      as given and cares about

national's       equilibrium were given in (13a) above.       Therefore, the      equilibrium
will   differ except in        the rare case when the   national's optimum   is   located at

the minimum        point   on the opportunity locus.

       It   is   interesting to note that the local's choice of W , and             W in
ecuilibrium, is not always above the national's W equilibrium. Consider

figure 3.        Suppose that the national's equilibrium were at A .           Each local

would try     to   go to B which is unobtainable of course, and the equilibrium

would be at C wtere

                                              =0, and

                                        Local

are on the opportunity locus. In this case W would be higher if locals set
wages than if nationals set wages. Alternatively, if the national's
equilibrium were at D , locals             would   like to go to E ,   and equilibrium

would result at F with         lower than the           national's choice of         •     The

reason for the difference is the following:             Local unions do not take into

account     the effect that their actions have on the nonunion wage by driving
workers and fis into the nonunion sector. At A , the effect of raising
   is to lower the nonunion wage so that by ignoring it, locals set too high
a wage. At D , the effect of raising W is to raise the nonunion wage so
ignoring this causes locals to set too low a wage.
       Locals, because they ignore spillovers, choose a          wage rate which does not

maximize    the expected wealth of workers in the entire occupation. Although
any one local may be better off as the result of all unions             behaving

myopically,      the rest are sufficiently worse off to reduce average wealth.
This suggests that a national union which sets the            optimal industry wage could

make all workers better off ex ante.            Therefore wage setting should be done at
the national level. (Recall          that "national" is used loosely here. It            refers
                                       27



to the relevant labor market defined by the pooi over which workers are

perfect substitutes.)

      To the extent that some locals may   lose   relative to others by this

arrangement, it may be necessary to couple this with transfers from one local

to another. A centralized strike or pension fund, for example, which doles

out benefits in accordance with some prearranged formula, might be such a

transfer mechanism.

Threat fect and the asurement of Union Power:

      Researchers have worried that the observed union differential may

understate the true effect of the union on wage rates because nonunion firms,

in attempting to discourage their workers from becoming unionized, pay more

than the competitive wage.10 As the result of the spillovers into the

nonunion sector, however, it is kno that the effect may well go on the other

way. Novel is that the understatement or overstatement of the true

differential bears a particular relationship to the proport±on in the union.

      Let us continue to think of C as being resources spent to hire a union

buster or bribe a vote counter. Consider figure 1. At any given wage rate,

      the true amount by which unions raise wages is                -      , measured as the
vertical distance between the 45° line and the horizontal line at W .                  The

observed wage differential, however, is W —       WN
                                                            or the vertical distance

between the 45° line and the opportunity locus. Since CL is everywhere

below W , the observed differential overstates rather than understates the
true effect of the union on wage rates. This is because the effect of a union

is to depress the nonunion wage. Farther, since the difference between

and       shrinks as W approaches either               or       ,       the overstatement of
the true effect is smallest when the proportion of the workers in the union is

close to zero or to one.
                                                28



        crucial here, of course, is the assumption that C does not become part

of the observed wage. Thinking of C as salary to a union buster, a bribe

for an official or even "bribes" to workers as long as these take non-

pecuniary wage forms, is consistant with this. However, the standard "threat

effect" approach views C as wages paid to nonunion workers to keep them

from joining a union. It is clear, however, that even if C1 were

reinterpreted as wages paid to discourage unions, for some firms, W — W

would overstate the effect of the union, and the average WV              WN might also
exceed WV -

        Let   us ask a more fundamental cuestion. If the model in this paper is a

reasonable description of equilibrii in a unionized industry, what can we

infer from looking at the wage dferential and its relationship to other

variables, especially the uroportion unionized? At the risk of restating a

point made by Rosen (1974) in another context, consider the following. The

observed WV W pair is the outcome of solving the unions optimt problem.

As one moves from left to right along a given opportunity locus, W —

rises    and P falls yet union "power" in the sense of opportunities stays the

same.

        Suppose that all unions faced the same opportunity locus and differed

only on z , the costs of running a union. Recall that as Z rises, the

optimal W rises and P falls. So occupations for which the costs of

running a union are     high     will have high wage differentials and few union

workers. From the low P , some might infer that the union is not powerful.

From the high W —       WN   ,   others   might infer that it has a great deal of

power. In fact, in some sense "power" is the same across occupations because

the opportunity locus is unchanged. In another sense, the high Z occupation

is less powerful since its costs are higher and expected wealth is lower so
                                        29



that union power and proportion in the union are negatively related. Finally,

a regression of     -        on P will yield a negative coefficient! If the
                        WN

opportunity locus shifts as well across occupations, then the interpretation

of the relationship between W -         and the proportion in the union is even

more confused. This is not to imply that studies such as the classic by Lewis

(1963) or that by Rosen (1970) on wage differentials tell nothing. They

describe empirical regularities which models like this one should be able to

explain. 8t inferences drawn with respect to union power on the basis of

such studies, might usefully be reexamined in light of such thinking.11

Quantity strictions and Price Discrimination:

     In this seciton, we allow the union to select from a richer strategy

set. Above, it was assumed that the union as monopolist could choose only the

wage, W .    However the dead weight loss which results can be eliminated and

additional rent can be captured by the union if we allow price discrimination

or if we allow the union to set quantity as well as price by offering all—or

nothing contracts. This is illustrated in figure 4.

     A monopolistic union can extract more rent than it can by simply charging

the monopoly price, say        and allowing the firm to hire 1' =
                                                                    d(Wu)
workers. The union can extract up to triangle ABC in an infinite number of

ways. One is to offer the firm an all-or-nothing contract to employ PJS

workers (the competitive number) at wage W each (where area F equals area

DEE). Alternatively, the union could require that the unionized firm pay

lump sum to the union equal to area ABC. The wage rate is then free to settle

to the competitive level WC , and firms voluntarily hire P/S workers. This

lump sum payment is then redistributed to workers who end up earnings       as

the result. The lump sum is payment to workers may take the form of fringe

benefits which are paid to workers, but are invariant with respect to number
                                         30



of hours worked. The finding by Freeman '1978), that union workers receive a

higher proportion, and therefore higher absolute amount, of compensation as

fringes can be explained as part of an optimal rent extracting policy.

     The advantage of the two—part wage scheme is that since the marginal wage

is free to adjust, transitory changes in supply of and demand for labor are

dealt with efficiently. The ni.mtber of workers employed adapts automatically

to the new competitive equilibrium. The all—or—nothing contract requires

explicit changes in the number of workers by the union. Adjustments made by

the union are more efficient if most supply or demand changes are known by the

union better than the firm. If not, the two-part wage which allows the firm

to select the number of workers is superior. This point, best articulated by

Hall and Lilien (1979), should be coupled with another: To the extent that

the lump sum transfer to the union involves the union as a intermediary,

workers may prefer to avoid the possibility of skimming by the union leader

through payments which come directly to workers. In a world of perfect

information with respect to changes in supply and demand, this would tip the

balance in favor of all—or—nothing offers. Since calling out a marginal wage

necessarily implies a quantity, we conduct the following discussion in terms

of the all—or-nothing offer.

     It is obvious that if the firm is held captive so that it faces no

alternative seller of labor, then the unions rent extracting optimum implies

setting L = R/S and wage = WL        .   However, in th 3 paper, we allow the

firm to defeat the union at some cost         and thereby purchase labor from the

nonunion firm at wage WN .     The union takes into account that higher

extraction of rent implies fewer union firms from which to extract. Also

since there is some probability that workers will end up in nonunion jobs, it

might be preferable to select a union employment level above P/S and a union
                                                       31



wage above        w,.,       but below wU       so that the wage in   the   nonunion sector, as

well as the       union sector, is above W .               (If the union     firms use more than

R/S     workers then fewer than R/S                 workers are left for     nonunion fims so the

market clearing wage exceeds the competitive wage.)

        As is proved in appendix 4, the optirrum strategy fo the union remains to

set L = PS               .     This implies that when a union organizes a firm, it will

attempt to require the                firm to   keep the size, although not necessarily the

identity, of the labor force constant at its previous level, not pushing for

higher employment but not "trading off" lower employment for higher wages. It

will appear, therefore, that the relevant membership is that set of workers

currently employed by the newly unionized firm even though this is exactly the

number of union              jobs   that would have been selected if all choices were made ex

ante.     Further, a union that can set wage and quantity                   brings about an

efficient      allocation           of labor across sectors, (although not across industries

or occupations).

        Firms, of course, faced with paying a wage W >                  W     prefer to hire fewer

than     R/S   workers if given the choice since the firm is off its demand

curve.     This    has the appearance of "featherbedding," a requirement that                 firms
hire    more labor than they freely choose. Yet this featherbeding is efficient

in two respects. First, it provides that a Pareto optimum is reached since

the competitive number of workers are employed. Second, there is no "buy out"

offer that the firm can make o the union to eliminate featherbedding which is

acceptable to the union since featherbedding is an optimal rent extracting

strategy.

        Cnce we allow for quantity strategies by the union, the ambiguity in

demand curve comparative statics (discussed on p. 18) disappears. Contrary to

Marshall's and Hick's assumption, it                 turns out that   elasticity of demand
                                              32



affects neither the probability of obtairing a union               in an   occupation nor the

union wage if a union does exist. The intuition is this:

           Given   that the union fixes quantity at         = R/S   ,   the nonunion quantity
is    necessarily       R/S from   (1) so that WN     W .     FOr any   given wage w     that

the   union calls out, the benefit from not being unionized is then (R/S)(Wu -

W0)
       .    The cost of being nonu.nionized is C1.N either benefit nor cost are a

funciton of the demand for labor. Therefore, the proportion of firms which

resist the union is invariant with respect to the demand for labor as is the

probability of observing a union in a given occupation. Similarly, since the

union      fixes the amount   of   labor hired at FJS   ,   the   probability of obtaining a
union job does not vary with the demand for labor. As such, the choice of the
optummi union wage        does not depend upon the elasticity of demand for labor
The formal proofs are contarea ii appendix 5

deDate        The factor that usually preverts a monopolist from price

dscr_mnatng, resale of the product, does -lot seem to be important in this

context        ait both price discrimination and all—or-nothing offers give firms

an incentive to change their scales of ooeration FOr example, a union which

required l equal to 1 1/2 times the quantlty of labor tnat the firm would

elect to purchase at price W might be thwarted. The firm simply would

i'crease all other factors of production to 1 1/2 times the initial amount

In oth. words, lump sum requirements provide incentives for mergers.

Additionally, legal restrictions, bargaining considerations, and market

conditions may make it difficult for the union to set quantity as well as

price        The resolution of this issue must oe an empirical one

III. An     Overlapping—Generation del

     The analysis has been a static one where all workers were assumed to be

identical. Yet the essence of a great deal of union activity centers on

worker differences and how different preferences within the union are juggled

to come out with a stable, long term, relationship. Among the most important

sources of different preferences within the union are those related to the

lifecycle. Old and young workers may have very different ideas about what the

union should do and one wonders, for example, why such a situation does not

result in one group forming its own     union in competition with the other. This
section proves that the multi—generational feature does not change the way in

which a union behaves with respect to those issues discussed in previous

sections.

     What is essential about lifecycle differences within a union can be

captured by a simple overlapping generation model. Assume      that   workers live

two periods. There are Y young persons born into the occupation each period

so that R B    2Y   is the total labor supply. All workers are equally

productive.

     Recall that P is the proportion of workers who obtain union jobs.

Before, allocation of jobs was assumed to be random. 3t in a two generation

context the way in which jobs are assigned makes a great deal of difference.

Suppose that all young workers had first claim to union jobs.         If P is less
than one, there will be some old workers without union jobs. They have an

incentive to negotiate with the union employer, offering labor services at a

wage which exceeds the nonunion wage, but is less than the union wage. The

union may or may not successfully defeat such attempts at "scabbing" by older

workers, but the presence of such incentives clearly raises the costs of

operating the union, z    , and   makes a union equilibrium less likely.
                                         34



      Reverse the situation. Let old workers have first claim to union jobs

 and the scenario is altered dramatically. Young workers, who care only about

 expected lifetime wealth, behave no differently. They remain loyal to the

 union, even as nonunion workers, because their entry into union jobs can be

made contingent upon their non—disruptive behavior. Old workers, however,

have no incentive to undermine the union since they are the individuals who

reap the current benefits of such a scheme. As the result, no individual's ex

ante lifetime wealth is reduced by a strict seniority rule for admission to

the union, and the costs of operating the union are reduced, which results in

a higher expected lifetime wealth for all workers. Thus, union workers will

tend to be older than nonunion workers. Further, if there were retired

workers present in the model, they too might desire to work occasionally and

their offers of labor at less than W to union firms would also adversely

affect expected wealth. However, if these workers can be punished for this

anti—union behavior, all workers can be made better off ex ante. Pensions may

play an important role here. To the extent that old workers receive large

pensions which are controlled at least in part by the union, scabbing can be

punished by the discontinuation of pension benefits. (A union may    not   be able

to stop pension payments to workers, but its ability to raise the uncertainty

of receiving those payments has a similar, though somewhat weaker effect.)

This provides another reason why union workers should receive a greater part

of their lifetime compensation in the form of pensions that nonunion

workers.12 Mincer (1981) also suggests that pensions are a way to capture

rents and lessen the adverse affects of the hours reduction.

     "Featherbedding" too can be rationalized along these same lines. Even

featherbedding which involves inefficiency and is inferior to lump sum

payoff s,   has the advantage that the "bought out" individual's payment is tied
                                            35



to the UfljOfltS continued success. A bought out worker would otherwise have an

incentive to undermine the union after his payoff was received.

     A word on the mechanics of this market is useful. Here, young workers

play a role even though they may not be in the union. Young workers'

cooperation is necessary, yet they appear as nonunion workers in this

market. In some situations, workers in nonunion firms may be in the union

explicitly. This is extremely conon in the building trades. A worker may

have his union card, but is assigned to union jobs in an order often related

to seniority. If he does not obtain a union job on a given day, he may work

in a nonunion job at a lower wage, but obviously cannot offer his services to

the union employer. His willingness to do this rests on his knowledge that

someday he will be the more senior worker and will receive W

     In other situations, the young worker actually is outside the union,

waiting for his union card. During this period, he works nonunion jobs. Yet

even this worker prefers that the occupation is unionized, because his

lifetime wealth is higher as a result. irther, his cooperation is necessary

in order for the union to be successful in pressing its demands.

     All of this implies that the probability of being in a union job will be

positively related to age in the following manner; If P0 is the probability

that an old worker will be in a union and P.r,        is the probability that a young

worker will be in a union, then

Since Y = R/2           ,   this    can be rewritten as

Except when        P= 1             P >   ?    so that average age of union      workers   will be

higher   than that for nonunion workers. In                   this   simple framework, if            is


the average age of all old workers and                         is    the average age of young

workers (where old and young refer                    to their priority    levels for union jobs,

all being the same within the class), then the average age of union                         workers,

         can   be   obtained. Since there are                (P) (R) union workers,        (P0) (Y) old

        These simple formulas yield a number of testable empirical

implications. First substituting (19) and (20) into (21), (21) can be written

as


                           P
         a.        A =                   =        if P < 1/2

Similarly, (22) can be rewritten as




                       —        (1-2P)A0                A
             a.        AN = 2(1—P)                +                 P < 1/2

Differentiating (23) with respect to P yields:




         a.                =    0        if P < 1/2

Similarly, differentiating (24) yields




                 AN       AY -A 0

 (26)

          b.     ---=0 if P1/2




        The sense of (25) and (26) is this: If P <                        1/2   ,   then   no young workers

are in the union and some old workers are forced to work in the nonunion

sector. Rai.sing P simply brings more old workers into the union, but does

not change the average age there since all union workers were and remain

old. Therefore A/P =                 0       when P < 1/2         .   The nonunion pool has all of the

young    workers plus some of the old. As P rises, old                           workers are drawn    from
the nonunion sector into the union                     sector,    leaving a larger proportion of

young workers left in the nonunion jobs and thereby lowering AN .                                 Therefore
 aN/3p     <0
        Alternatively, if P ) 1/2                 ,    all   old workers, some young ones as well,

are in the union. An increase in P brings more young workers into the union

thereby   lowering         .    At the same time fewer workers remain in the nonunion

sector, but they remain as before, only young workers. Therefore AN does

not change.

     This yields an empirically testable implication. A regression of

so that an increase in the average age of the relevant labor pool will

increase the average age of both union and nonunion workers. However, for a

given P , an increase in A0 and A which is neutral in the sense that it

leaves A3-A unchange will also leave A_AN unchanged. This follows

directly from (27). These relationships are also empirically verifiable in

the sense that they give definite predictions on the relationship between the

age structure of an occupation and the age structure between union and

nonunion workers within that occupation.14

Attrition

     Some occupations are characterized by a. more fickle labor force than

others. Occupations with high turnover or attrition rates present additional

difficulties for the prospective union. First, such movement makes it more

difficult   to   keep   tabs on   which workers "paid their dues" when young by

accepting a nonunion job without         attempting to bargain away   a union job from a

more senior worker. This factor by itself raises Z ,          the costs of operating
a union. As such, it will reduce the likelihood of a union ecuilibrium, but

will raise the wage differential and lower the proportion of union workers in

those occupations where a union equilibrium is obtained. This suggest that

occupations such as secretaries and farm workers where mobility into and out

of the labor force or between geographical regions is high are less likely to

be unionized. It also suggests that in 'nigh attrition occupations where

unions are formed, e. g., the California farm workers, only a small proportion

of workers will be employed by unionized firms and the union—nonunion wage

differential will be large.

     Additionally, increased attrition, to the extent that it reflects ex          ante
known individual differences, makes a union equilibrium less likely even if it

does not affect Z .        The reason is that an individual who plans to leave the

This      is a stronger condition that the one relevant for those who plan to
remain in the occupation for their entire lifetimes.                               That   condition is

it s       easy to see that (29) is sufficient for                     (30),     but that (30) can    hold

when (29) does not, so that            young      workers who plan to leave the occupation are
more      likely to oppose the certification of a union.15 ther, attrition of
workárs between period one and              two    increases P for a. given labor force,
P.        This makes the stayers even more anxious                 for       a union   ecuilibrit. since

NLR3 rules         give each worker one and only one vote, strong differences in
lifetime plans        across   workers reduces the probability of accuring a union
ecuilibri.
          A corolla_ of the previous discussion                   is   that      old workers   will   prefer
unons before young workers do               as    long as their          seniorzv is graathered.

It is easy to show that (30), the condition for the young to favor a union, is

a sufficient condition for (31).16

The Relationship tween the Mlti-Period bdel and the ie—Period tbdel

Results:

        The link between the overlapping generation model and the simple period

model is    this:        Young workers in the multiperiod world will behave exactly

like    single period wealth maximizers. Their "critical indifference curves"
and their view of the opportunity locus is identical to that of individuals
who live only a single period.17 However, old workers may prefer a union
equilibriimt      even when single period workers prefer the competitive equilibrium

because
            P0
                    P    .    This   also implies a preference by old workers              for   a union

wage    which deviates from          the   solutions   obtained in the one-period model.

        This poses      no problem    under a number of circumstances. The                most

straightforward          resolution    relies on the fact that the median voter is a young
worker.18        Although all young workers are not formal members of t1e union,

their explicit          or implicit acquiescence is              necessary for the maintenance of a

union   ecuilibrium. Old workers would like to ignore the nonunion young
workers in selecting W ,              but   their   persistence in       following that strategy is

not   viable   because       young workers have an incentive to undermine such a union
and   replace it with a lifetime wealth             maximizing        one. In fact, the young
could pay old workers enough to induce the old workers to follow the broader
lifetime   wealth       maximizing policy. Entry fees and contributions by                  the

current union workers to the already retired workers' pension fund might be

reinterpreted as a transfer of this sort.

       Since   young workers behave the same                as   workers who live   for only a single
period, and since a young worker is the marginal                      worker,   the solution, which
                                          43



reflects   the preference of the young worker, is identical to that in the

single period world. Therefore, all results of that section hold.

Age Earnings Profiles:

     Given the way that the union is structured so that young     workers   are less

likely to be unionized than are old workers, there is a natural tendency for

wages to grow over the lifecycle as workers move from nonunion to union

jobs. This is true even if productivity does not grow over the lifecycle.

     re important, is that within a union firm, age—earnings profiles will

be flatter than   they   are in nonunion firms. The reason is that unions, in

order to maintain stability, want the old rather than young workers to receive

the benefits of the union. ait in most industries and occupations, the firm,

rather    than the union, hires workers. A way by which the union can discourage

the finn from hiring young workers is to overprice them relative to more

experienced workers. This will provide the firm with incentives to hire the

workers into the union firm which the union would have selected. Thus, the

union can implicitly control hiring and the compensation of the firms' work

force simply by calling out the appropriate wages.

     A corollary is that if age and skill are positively correlated, higher

quality    labor will be found in union   firms. Union firms, faced with flatter

age—earnings voluntarily select the older highly skilled workers, because they
are underpriced relative to the younger, less skilled workers. An alternative

is provided by Mincer (1981) who cites evidence that less on—the-job training

occurs in union firms. There is no obvious theoretical reason why this should

be the case.

     Incidentally, if the bimodal age distribution is replaced by a continuous

one, nothing is altered fundamentally but P is reinterpreted as the

proportion of one's life spent in the union. Incentives remain intact and all
                                            44



conclusions still follow. ( course, the formulas for the average ages of

workers in union and   nonunion   jobs would require alteration.)

Countercyclical Variations in wage Differentials:

     Lewis reports that union     workers   do relatively better during cyclical

downturns. The age—based incentive mechanism provides an explanation. Since

incentive compatibility requires that old workers in unions receive benefits

relative to young, we expect that seniority will be more important in

determining layoff priority in union firms. As such, the average age of union

workers relative to nonunion workers should rise during cyclical downturns and

since age—earnings profiles are positively sloped, wage differentials will

increase. This is easily tested by examining the way in which AU_AN moves

over the business cycle. Also, controlling for age should eliminate most of

the couritercyclical wage differential movement.

2:   Proof that a parallel shift in demand affects neither the probability

of a union equilibrium nor the wage differential selected.

         It is sufficient to show that the opportunity locus and relevant

indifference curves are displaced along a 450 ray. If so, all solutions

will move in proportion to the new competitive wage.

         Consider d(W) > d(W)             such that d'(W)=d'(W)=dT V W .                    Define   W
such that d(Wc)R/S and                                  .   Then, if WU,WN are pairs on the
new opportunity locus, a parallel shift of that locus requires that

NWN+ if
         The equation for the opportunity locus (eq. (1)) implies that at




(A2.l)           {l_G(fl(WU,WN))]d(WU)+G(ll(WU,WN))d(WN)R/S
             =   [l_G(iI* (WN+i,W)       ]d(Wu+A)+G(Tr* (WU+,)d(WN)
Conjecture that

         TT*(ww) =      1*(W+W)
Then (A2.l) implies that

         d(WN) = d(WN)

or

         d(Wc) + (dT)(WN_Wc) = d(Wc) + (d)(WN — Wc)

Since d(Wc) =
                   d(Wc)    ,   d'   =   d'   ,   and         —       =     ,   this   implies that

WNWN+               But if
                                WNWN+ when W=W+ , thensince
d(Wu +      ) = d(Wu)      and d(WN +             ) = d(WN)       ,   TI (Wu ,WN) =    TI
                                                                                            (W+ ,WN+)
so G=G and the sufficient condition is verified. Therefore a parallel

shift in the opportunity locus occurs.

So   the critical indifference curve is displaced along the 43° line. This

implies that the probability of obtaining a. union equ.i.librium                                                          does   not

vary when linear demand.                              for       labor shifts out parallel.

         Finally, the equilibrium wage differential                                                      does not change because
the   slope of the                 new indifference curves at                                  the   new opportunity locus
exactly        equals the slope of the old indifference curves at the old oppor-

Proof that the more convex the demand curve, the more likely is a union

equilibrium to exist:

         The formal proposition: Suppose a convex demand curve, d(W) ,                            is
tangent to a linear demand curve                          d(W)   at the competitive equilibrium

[R/S,Wc]. If a union equilibrium exists for d(W) , then it exists for

d(W) although the converse is not true.

         First, the opportunity locus for d(W) lies above that for d(W)

(except at                 =              To see this, assume the opposite. Then for every given
                               W0).

(A2.4)
                      [l_G(EWU,WN)))d(WU)+G(ll(WU,WN))d(WN)

                                   =   R/s =    [l_G(rr*(wU,WN))Jd(wU)(n*(wU,WN))d(WN)


But if
             WN
                  >            , then      d(WN) < d(WN) < d(WN)           and

then                                                       therefore

         G(T (WU,WN))d(WN) > G(Ti (WU,WN))d(WN)

This,    along with (A2.4),                 implies that

         [l_G(fl*(W,WN))]d(WU) < {l_GCT*(WU,WN))]d(WU)

or   that     1   <   G    —   G       which is a contradiction since 0             G,G   1

Also, the critical                  indifference curve for           (W) lies below that for d(W):

Assume   the opposite,                   WN >   WN
                                                     .   Then from   Al,   P < P.   But d(W)>d(Wu)
and WN >
              WN
                          implies that (l-G)<(l—G) or G >                    G   which implies WN <   WN

which    is a contradiction.

 3:    As the cost of running              the   union rises, the probability of obtaining

it    is smaller than dW so                  dP tends to be negative.      Thus, an increase

in    operating costs lowers the likelihood of a union equilibrium, but
if one does exist, raises tre optimal union wage, wage differential,                       and

tends    to lower      the proportion in the. union.

4: Proof that a union which can choose price and quantity sets quantity ecual

to PJS (even though this affects the wage in the nonunion sector and the

probability of being beaten by the firm) and this results in                                   =




Define l and l as the labor per firm in                         the union and nonunion sector.

Then the firm, presented with wage—quantity demand (Wu ,                                     compares the

profits associated with it against that of (WN, 1N                                 If this difference is

smaller than      the firm fights (and defeats) the union. The profit

5: Proof that more inelastic demand changes neither the probability of a
union or       the nonunion wage where unions cna select price and quantity.



Consider two labor demand curves, d(W) and d(W) such that d(Wc) =
          = R/S      but    Id'     < Id' I   as shown. Given that            =    =
 d(W0)
   =       (see appendix 4), the opportunity locus is a                   horizontal line at
   =       .    Therefore,        to show that the probability of a union does not change

when going from d(W) to d(W) it is sufficient to show that the indifference

curves do not shift:

        The equations of a indifference curve producing utility level K given

demand for labor d(W) and d(W) ,                     respectively   are




                            K_P(W_Z)
               a.    WN =
                                  (1—P)
(A5.1)

           P =      S(1-(II))R/S           1-(fl)
where      and
           P =      1(It)


Since l              = R/S ,        fl    (defined   in appendix 4) is (R/S)(WUWN) so that

(A5.la,b) becomes

Substitution     of (A5.2a) into (A5.2b) yields WN =        WN
                                                                 so   indifference curves
are   identical.

Corollary: Since indifference curves and opportunity locus are invariant with

respect to d(W), d(W) ,         it follows that       optimal W is    the   same in both

cases.

      1The relevant supply of labor is that pool over which employers view

workers as perfect substitutes in production. This is narrower than Ross's

 (1948) "orbit of coercive comparison," or Dunlop's (1944) "wage contours."

           is simplifying, but inessential, to assume that        g(C) does not
depend upon W - W            directly. Workers might strive harder for the union
       -
           W   ,   or   more exactly the expected utility gain, is larger. It is

assumed that G(C) is known, by all, but the particular             C is known only
to the firm.

     3mis   subsumes all bargaining problems. Thus, Reder's (1952) notions of

fairness and Steven's (1958) early description of bargaining, as well as more

modern bargaining models (Farber (1978), Crawford (1979), Atherton (1973)) are

implied.

     4Johnson and Miezkowski (1970) and Diewert (1974) offer alterntive two—

sector models of unionism. There, the union wage is exogenous and the purpose

is to trace various wage choices through the rest of the economy in a general

equilibrium framework. This model is interested in the way in which

spillovers affect the choice of a union        wage.
     5This is a major break with the literature in that most of what has gone

before, attempts to limit       the   relevant population to some subset of   P. •   For
example, Reder (1959) focuses on "present members." But present at what point

in time? How does the union ever get started under these assumptions? Also,

Dertouzos and Pencavel estimate a wage and employment relationship using data
                                                 2



 from   the International Typographical Union. This is not equivalent to my

 indifference curve, however, because it abstracts from spillover effects of

       on        and changes in the opportunity locus over time.

        6Even in the pathological case where         g(0), Z ,        and    d(Wu) are
 sufficiently large so that the indifference curve is initially positive, it

will rapidly become negative because when              =        + Z

        7Stiglitz (1980) obtains a similar result in a different context.                 He

shows that convexity affects whether a random taxation scheme dominates a

nonrandom one.

        81n this context, Epple, Hotz and Zelenitz (1980) formalize the argument

that in high variance demand industries, the union performs a risk pooling

function which reduces the necessity of formal layoffs. The union acts as the

hiring hail and assigns workers accordingly. Fluctuation in an individual

firm's demand does not result in a "layoff," as the result.

        9There are additional second—order effects. There is no guarantee that

the reduction in output by union firms plus the increase in output by nonunion

firms will yield the net reduction in total output required as we move up the

product  demand curve. This will require a change in S                 ,    the number of firms
in the industry.
       10Rosen    (1969)   treats this issues.
       11Recent   work by Mincer (1981) makes a similar point, but exploits a

different mechanism. Mincer points out that altering the probability of

obtaining a job in the union sector affects the expected return to queuing for

jobs in that sector and affects spillovers to the nonunion sector. Depending
                                                          3




 upon the nature of these spillovers, the observed wage differential may

 overstate the true effect of unions. He, too, concludes that there is no

 straightforward relationship between wage differentials and power. The main

 difference between his approach and this one is that in this model queuing for

 union jobs is done while holding a nonunion job so there is never any

 unemployment. Mincer's queuing takes place while the worker is unemployed.

        12See    Freemen (1978) for evidence in support of this prediction.

        13This assumes that            A0 -    A     does not vary across occupations.

        141n principle, there could be a larger number of age groups than two,

 and one extreme specification would allow a group for each age level, say

measured in years, so that                 A0 and A           would be replaced by A18, A19...A65.
       15Proof:

                                                              + WN(l -
                                   W < (Wu -            Z)P                    P)
implies that

                                                              +                -
                                2Wc < (Wu -         Z)2P          WN(2)(1          P)
Since (W - Z) > WN the convex combination
       -   Z) A + WN(l —   A)     increases in A .                Since
 (W                                                                                + P0 > 2P
it follows that 2Wc < (Wu —                         +               -          < (W —
                                           z)2P         WN(2)(1           P)             Z)(P     +
                                                                                                      P)
             —
 +
     WN((1       P)   + (1 —
                                P0)}   ,    so (29) is sufficient for (30).

       16Proof:

Equation (30) is

                  2Wc < (Wu —      Z)(P1 + P0) + W(l -                    P)   +    (1 — P0)]

This implies

                                           +
                  W < (Wu -      Z)(P          Po)/2 + WNf(1          —
                                                                          P)    + (1 —
                                                                                         P0)]/2
The r.h.s. is a convex combination of (W - Z),                             WN with (W - Z) > WN
Now since

                                   P0 '            , P0       (P0 ÷
                                           4




therefore

                                                                     >

so (30) is sufficient for (31).



     17Proof:

Young vote for the union if (30) holds, i.e., if



                       2Wc < (Wu_Z)(Py + Po)+WN[(l_Py)+(1_Po))



substituting in (19) and (20) this can be rewritten as




                             2Wc < (Wu_Z)(2P)+WNC2(1_P)]
or

                                    < (wU_z)P+wN(1_P)



which is the condition for a single—period lived worker to prefer the union

equilibrium (derivable from equation (12)).

equilibrium in a median voter world.
