COVID-19 Disruptions Disproportionately Affect Female Academics

                                          ABSTRACT

The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent countermeasures, such as school
closures, the shift to working from home, and social distancing are disrupting economic activity
around the world. As with other major economic shocks, there are winners and losers, leading to
increased inequality across certain groups. In this project, we investigate the effects of COVID-19
disruptions on the gender gap in academia. We administer a global survey to a broad range of
academics across various disciplines to collect nuanced data on the respondents' circumstances,
such as a spouse's employment, the number and ages of children, and time use. We find that
female academics, particularly those who have children, report a disproportionate reduction in
time dedicated to research relative to what comparable men and women without children
experience. Both men and women report substantial increases in childcare and housework
burdens, but women experienced significantly larger increases than men did.

    The underrepresentation of women in academia is well-established. Prior to the COVID-19
pandemic, women represented only about one-third of all full professors in the US and an even
smaller proportion in Canada and Europe. Moreover, women published fewer articles, received
fewer grants and citations, and were less likely to be granted tenure or promoted than men (Catalyst
2020; Hechtman et al. 2018; Holman et al. 2018; Huang et al. 2020). There exists considerable
heterogeneity by discipline, with women representing a mere 15 percent of authors in mathematics,
physics, and computer science (Huang et al. 2020). Some of these gaps may be explained by
differential family responsibilities: academic women bear a disproportionate burden of childcare
and suffer a so-called "motherhood penalty" (Ceci et al. 2014; Cheng 2020).
    The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent countermeasures such as school closures
are likely to exacerbate these gaps. For example, Squazzoni et al. (2020) find that the gender gap
in submissions to Elsevier journals is widening, with the deficit particularly pronounced among
women who have reached more advanced stages of their careers. Amano-Patiño et al. (2020) focus
on economics working paper series, and show that women are being left out of COVID-19-related
research, with the largest gender gap among mid-career economists.
    What can explain the disproportionate productivity slowdown among female scholars since the
onset of the pandemic? Alon et al. (2020) predict that the short-term increase in gender inequality
would be due to the disproportionate childcare burden falling upon women amid school and
daycare closures. To test this hypothesis, we analyze new survey evidence pertaining to the use of
time by academic researchers before and after the disruptions caused by COVID-19. 1 Although
we find that all respondents with children experienced reduced research hours since the onset of
the pandemic, female academics with children--especially those with young children--were
disadvantaged to a significantly greater extent. We find that research as well as self-care (sleep
and other activities) have been crowded out by a significant increase in time spent on childcare
and other housework.




1
 To the best of our knowledge, Myers et al. (2020) is the only other study to quantify the short-term effects of increased
childcare burdens on female scientists, finding patterns that are consistent with our findings. Our sample is larger and
more globally representative, including responses from outside of the US and Europe.
                                       I. The Survey of Academics

    We sent a survey via email to approximately 900,000 individuals who had published at least one
academic article in the past five years. The distribution window, including two follow-up
reminders, ran from May 27, 2020 to July 21, 2020, yielding a total of 27,991 responses. Detailed
information about the survey is provided in the online appendix.
    The main survey question of interest asked the respondents to estimate, both before and after the
start of the COVID-19 disruptions, the average number of hours in a given workday they spent on
research, all other job-related activities, childcare, commuting to and from work, housework, sleep,
and all other activities (which would presumably include hobbies, exercise, entertainment, and
other non-work activities). Our main explanatory variables are gender and the number and ages of
child dependents, but we also collected information on other life circumstances such as the
presence of elderly dependents, marital status, and partner employment and time allocation.
Respondents also reported the years of attaining their PhDs, their research areas, academic ranks,
resources required for research success (such as equipment or access to human subjects), and basic
demographics. Finally, we asked about changes in research funding and institutional-level changes
in promotion policies since the onset of the pandemic.

                                    III. Data and Pre-COVID Trends

    Before we present the main results of our survey, we describe our sample and pre-pandemic
trends. We focus on respondents with doctoral degrees who self-identified as either male or female
and whose time-use answers for add up to 24 hours per day. A total of 19,905 respondents satisfied
these criteria: 11,901 men and 8,004 women. 2
    Figure 1 shows that, on a typical workday prior to the spread of COVID-19, female academics
spent about 30 minutes less time on research and 20 minutes more time on other job-related
activities than men did. Women also spent about 40 more minutes per day on childcare and 10
more minutes on other household activities. Women also reported spending 43 minutes less time
than men on other non-work activities. Finally, there were no meaningful gender differences in
pre-COVID commuting or sleep times.

we use a sample of tenure-track (or equivalent) faculty only (see the online appendix).

                                        II. Empirical Framework

  We use a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the effects of COVID-19 disruptions on
how academics allocate their time on a typical workday. Equation (1) captures changes in time use
for female academics relative to parallel changes for male academics:

(1)                                    =  +  +  ,

where i indexes individual respondents. The  variables represent the difference in
hours spent on a given activity pre- and post-COVID-19 (a negative value signifies a drop in
hours since the pandemic).  is an indicator of a respondent's being female. Our
hypothesis is that the coefficient, , is negative for research, sleep, and other activities, and
positive for childcare and other housework.
  Equation (2), our main specification, further decomposes the effects of the pandemic by the
number of dependent children who live with a respondent:
(2)      =  + 1  +  2 + [ × ] 12 +   +  +  .

 is a vector of indicators for the number of child dependents in the care of respondent i with
possible values of 0, 1, 2, and 3 or more, while  ×  is a vector of interaction terms
representing the relationship between a respondent's gender and the number of children in her
family. The vector  is a set of respondent characteristics that includes year-of-PhD fixed effects.
In our robustness checks, we expand  to include other controls, such as indicators of race and
ethnicity, an indicator of STEM research area, and an indicator of being located in the European
Economic Area. Finally,  represent fixed effects for the date on which a respondent completed
the survey. Our hypothesis is that the coefficients 2 and 12 will both be negative for research
time use, indicating a negative productivity shock on respondents with children that is more
pronounced for women. We also estimate heterogeneous effects of COVID-19 disruptions on
female academics by the age of a youngest child by additionally including in Equation (2) a vector
of interaction terms that capture the relationship between a respondent's gender and the age of the
youngest child in the respondent's household.

         IV. Results: The Effects of COVID-19 on Gender Differences in Time Use

The pandemic reduced daily work hours by about one hour per day relative to the pre-pandemic
9.1-hour average, with time spent on research driving the vast majority of the reduction (time spent
on other job-related activities decreased by 3 minutes on average). This is consistent with the
notion that teaching and service duties are more difficult to cut back on than research, making it
more likely that the latter is pushed aside when overall work time becomes more limited. Time
spent commuting fell by an hour, while time spent on childcare and housework increased by one
hour a day and by 45 minutes a day, respectively. On average, sleep and other activities remained
unchanged.
  Figure 2 decomposes the overall impact of COVID-19 disruptions by gender, plotting  (the
estimated effects on males) and  +  (the estimated effects on females) from Equation (1) for
each of our time-use outcomes.




                                                  5
               FIGURE 2. CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS SPENT ON EACH ACTIVITY BY GENDER
            Note: Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals using robust standard errors.


  The results document a disproportionate decline in research time among female academics
relative to research time among male academics. There are no differential effects by gender on
other job-related activities. The larger drop in research time among women is mirrored by a
disproportionate increase in time spent on childcare and other housework. We also find that women
are spending slightly less time on other non-work activities than they did prior to the pandemic,
while men are spending slightly more time on such activities. On the other hand, men, but not
women, are sleeping more than they did prior to the pandemic, although the magnitudes of these
effects are small.
  Next, we decompose the gendered effects of the pandemic on research time by the number of
children in a household (Equation (2)). On average, childless men report spending 25 fewer
minutes on research post-COVID disruptions, and there is no significant difference along this
dimension between childless women and childless men (Figure 3).
              FIGURE 3. CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS SPENT ON RESEARCH BY GENDER AND
                                         NUMBER OF CHILDREN
               Note: Estimates from OLS regressions with interactions for gender and number
               of children indicators. Controls include PhD-year and date-of-survey-completion
               fixed effects. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals using robust standard
               errors.




  Figure 3 further demonstrates that having a child is correlated with a significantly larger post-
pandemic reduction in research time for both genders, but the effects are doubled for female
academics. Overall, women with children lose about an hour of research time per day more than
childless men do. Men with children lose 30 minutes of research time more than men with no
children. Importantly, the widening of the male­female research time gap is driven by the presence
of at least one child in a family: we do not observe any significant additional declines in research
time as the number of children increases, regardless of gender.
  When we look at the effects of the pandemic by reference to the age of the youngest child
(controlling for the total number of children), we observe that the most severe disruptions occur in
families in which the youngest child is under 7 years of age (Figure 4).




                                                        7
                FIGURE 4. CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF     HOURS SPENT ON RESEARCH BY GENDER
                AND AGE OF YOUNGEST CHILD

                Note: Estimates from OLS regressions with interactions for gender and age of
                youngest child indicators. Controls include PhD-year and date-of-survey-
                completion fixed effects, number of children indicators and their interactions
                with gender. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals using robust standard
                errors.


In the online appendix, we show that the largest relative drop in research time occurs for women
with children under 1 year of age (nearly 2 hours per day). We also confirm that the results are
robust to the inclusion of other controls and to decomposing the sample by research field.

V. Discussion

  Our time-use survey suggests that the short-term adverse productivity effects of the pandemic
fall disproportionately on female academics with children. The widest gender gaps emerged for
those with young children.
  It is likely that our results underestimate lost research time among academics with children. First,
we suspect that the most overburdened individuals would be less likely to respond to our survey,
which means that they may be underrepresented in our data. Second, parents supervising children
at home may engage simultaneously in childcare and research activities, making them less
productive in both.
  It is also important to recognize that a decrease in the time faculty spend on research does not
necessarily translate into a proportionate decline in productivity. Researchers may have sought to
increase work efficiency to counteract the time limitations created by the pandemic. In future work,
we plan to connect publication records of respondents (including working papers) to their survey
responses to assess the effects on research output.
  It is also worth noting that neither time use nor productivity impacts allow us to evaluate the
detrimental effects of the pandemic on overall welfare. Even if female researchers do not end up
with fewer publications because they manage to make up for lost time by working more intensely
or by successfully navigating the double-duty burden of childcare and research, the outcome may
not be welfare-neutral because the researchers may experience adverse mental health effects as a
result. Assessing the differential effects of the pandemic on academics' overall well-being is an
important direction for future research.
  In light of the disruptions caused by the pandemic, many colleges and universities responded by
either automatically extending tenure clocks and reappointment decisions by one year or by
instituting a no-questions-asked policy, whereby any faculty member could apply for an extension.
Such a universal approach may, however, further exacerbate gender gaps, as has been shown to
occur with universal parental leave policies (Antecol, Bedard, and Stearns 2018). Whether more
flexible or targeted approaches are feasible or would produce more equitable outcomes remains an
open question.

The initial invitation to complete our survey was distributed between the dates of May 27 and
June 9, 2020, via email to anyone who:
         o   authored/co-authored a research article in an academic journal published by one of four major academic publishers
             (Cambridge University Press, Elsevier, Oxford University Press, or Wiley) or in the journals Science, PNAS, or PLOS ONE
             since 2015

         o   had a publicly available email address listed on the journal's website. In cases where an email was not listed, we searched
             for an older contact email associated with the author, going as far back as 2000.

         o   self-identified as "active researcher with a doctorate degree in an academic appointment at a college, university, government
             agency, think tank, or other research institution" (screening at consent)



The initial recruitment effort comprised of a total of 916,731 unique email addresses. The first
set of reminders were distributed starting June 17th, and the final reminder were distributed
starting July 8th. Reminders were not sent to those who already completed the survey or to
anyone who unsubscribed or otherwise explicitly requested to be removed from the distribution
list.

Potential respondents were first asked if they reside inside the European Economic Area (EEA).
Those responding "Yes" were directed to a consent form with a GDPR addendum; the rest were
directed to the regular consent form (see below).

  KEY INFORMATION

  Thank you for your participation in this research study. If you decide to participate in our survey,
you will answer a series of questions. We estimate that this survey will take less than 10 minutes
to complete.

  The purpose of this research is to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting time use
among academic researchers.

  Participation in research is completely voluntary. It is your choice whether or not to participate
in this research. If you choose to participate, you may change your mind and quit the study at any
time. The risks of this research are minimal and you may decline to answer any questions you do
not want to answer.

  Upon completion, you will be entered to win one of 10 Amazon gift cards of $100 value. The
lottery will be held after the survey closes and winners will be notified by email within 8 weeks of
survey competition. If you choose not to participate in the study but want to enter the lottery, you
may do so by entering your name and email when prompted.

  Your responses will be kept strictly confidential and no data that can be used to identify you will
be made publicly available. The email address you provide will never be shared with anyone
outside of the research team and will not be used to contact you after you complete the survey
except to notify you about prize winnings. However, individuals from our organizations who
oversee research may access your data during audits or other monitoring activities. As with all
research, there is a change that confidentiality could be compromised; however, we are taking
precautions to minimize this risk. To minimize these risks access to response data will be restricted
to members of the research team with approved data security protocols in place, and identifiable
data will only be stored as approved by our institutions. We may link your responses to external
publicly available information including publication records. If identifiers are removed from your
identifiable information, the information could be used to answer additional research questions or
shared with other investigators without your additional consent.

                                            C. Additional Analysis

Figures C1 and C2 repeats the number-of-children and age-of-youngest-child analyses for
academics whose research is in STEM fields (Agricultural and animal sciences, Biological
sciences, Chemistry, Computer Science, Earth and planetary sciences, Economics/finance,
Engineering, Environmental science, Epidemiology, Materials science, Mathematics, Medicine
and health, Neuroscience, Physics, Statistics).

Figure C3 replicates the analysis using developmental age ranges instead of uniform age bins and
the full survey sample.

Note: Estimates from OLS regressions with interactions for gender and age of youngest child indicators. Controls
include PhD year and date of survey completion FE, # children indicators and their interactions with gender. Bars
represent 95% confidence intervals using robust SE.
Tables C1 and C2 estimate the effects of gender and presence of children in the family on all time
use variables (in hours per day), controlling for a rich set of demographic characteristics. Note
that the main adverse effects on research time use for women with children are robust to the
inclusion of controls. We also note that respondents in the EEA are less likely to have lost research
time relative to non-EEA respondents, and are less likely to see increases in time spent on childcare
and other household duties post-COVID. On the other hand, STEM researchers are more
negatively impacted by the pandemic than non-STEM researchers, seeing larger decreases in
research time.
