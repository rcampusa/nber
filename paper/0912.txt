                  Optimal Control of the Money Supply



                               ABSTRACT



     Using optimal control theory and a vector autoregressive

representation of the relationship between money and interest

rates, one can derive a feedback control procedure which defines

the best possible tradeoff between interest rate volatility and

money supply fluctuations and which could be used to reduce both

from their current levels.

1. INTRODUCTION

           The debate over the proper conduct of monetary policy has intensi-

fied in recent years as the Federal Reserve has focused its attention on

reducing inflation by controlling the rate of growth of the money supply.

Although most observers give the Federal Reserve credit for reducing the trend

growth of money, n.ny have criticized it for having increased the short run

variability of money    growth rates and the volatility of interest rates. The
Federal Reserve is currently searching for procedures which will guarantee

control over the trend growth of money, while at the same time reducing the

short run fluctuations in both money and interest rates.        This paper uses

optinl control theory and a time series representation for money and interest

rates to derive a feedback control procedure which defines the best possible

tradeoff between interest rate volatility and money supply fluctuations and

which could be used to reduce both from their current levels. The organi—

zation of the paper is as follows:       section 2 reviews the control theory

framework, section 3 describes the use of a time series model to represent the

dynamic   behavior of the system, section 1   presents the application to short—

run control of the money supply, and a final section addresses the key issue

of structural   stability.

2. OPTIMAL CONTROL THEORY

            Optimal   Control   Theory is a well developed set of mathmetical tools

used primarily by engineers to solve problems involving a dynamical system

which responds to exosenous inputs.        These same tools are used here to gene-

rate    a rule for targeting interest rates in order to balance optimally the
competing goals of controlling the supply of money and reducing the volatility
of interest rates.
            In its usual form, optimal linear control theory specifies an algo—

ritbm    for setting one or more inputs in order to minimize a quadratic loss

function.     This result, and other cited below, can be found in any standard
control theory text, such as Kwakernak and Sivan (1972) or Chow (1976). The

key elements in the optimal control problem are as follows:

       The State: A vector of variables which contains all relevant information
       concerning the current state of the system.      In particular, the State
       vector includes all variables which enter the loss function directly, and
       all other variables which help to predict their values.

       The Laws of Motion: A difference equation which determines the state at
       time t as a function of the previous state, a vector of inputs called the
       control, and a disturbance vector. The dynamical system with its assoc-
       iated laws of motion is often referred to as "the plant."

       The Control: A vector of inputs which can be set by the controller in
       order to affect the future course of the state.

       The Loss Function: A function specifying the criterion to be optimized in
       the setting of the control. Often the loss function includes a target or
       path of desired values for one or more components of the state.

            Two   types   of control are differentiated by whether or not the con-

trol responds to the current state of the system. If the control is preset,

the control is referred to as "open loop." If the control is adjusted each

period in order to respond to the current state, then the system is said to be

operating under "feedback control."           Feedback control loops have several

desirable properties relative to open ioop control.          A feedback controller

compensates for disturbances, allowing the control to be much more
                                        —3—


effective.      Futhermore, an unstable system can be stabilized by feedback

control, a characteristic which cannot be obtained by open loop control.

Finally, the effect of system parameter variation can be greatly reduced by

continually updating the contol. This is of particular importance in the case

of economic systems for which there is likely to be paramenter variation and a

high degree of parameter uncertainty.

             The control design is generally based on the following sequence of

events. At time t—l the state vector determines everything that is needed to

predict the future course of the system.      The controller observes this state

and determines the optimal setting for the control which will impinge on the

system at time t.      The state of the system at time t is a function of the

state at time t—l, the control at time t, and a disturbance vector which

occurs at time t. A diagramatic representation makes this clear.

             Finding the optimal setting of the control, given the laws of motion
of the     system and a particular lOSS function is generally a very difficult
problem.     However, for the particular case of a system whose laws of motion

are linear and for which the loss function is quadratic, the problem has been

solved. Under mild regularity conditions, a computational procedure known as

"iterating on a matrix Riccati equation,'t leads to the optimal linear control

rule.     While   the   optimal control rule which solves the linear, quadratic

problem may not be optimal relative to a more general foruilation of the

problem, in practice it is likely to be the best solution available.

            The textbook application of control theory to monetary policy

assumes that the Fed can control either money or interest rates

perfect1r.'         The question at issue is which variable the Fed should con-

trol, and how it should set that variable so as to achieve a full employment,

stable price path for the econoxrr.         This standard application is not the

problem which we are addressing. We bring it up here to illustrate a typical

application of control theory and to contrast the framework adopted here with

the usual approach.

           The focus of this paper is more narrow than the usual textbook

application in that no attent is made to derive an optimal monetary policy.

It is assumed here that the money target path is known. However, rather than

taking as given the ability of the Fed to hit its money supply target, this

paper investigates the Fed's short run problem of attempting to control the
money supply. For the purpose of this paper, the monetary target in a given

week is that week's value for the level of N—i which is on a long run trend

growth path adopted by the Fed. The Fed is assumed to use open market opera-

tions to try to keep M—1 as close to the trend as feasible, on average. The

open market operations, b,r increasing       or decreasing the supply of reserves,
cause   the federal funds   rate   to go down   or   up, respectively. These movements

in the federal funds rate will cause banks and other economic agents to adjust

their portfolios, leading to predictable movements in          the   stock of money. We

do not attempt to model the open market operations directly, instead, we focus

on the levels of the federal funds rate which emerge each week and their

effects on subsequent movements in money.             In the control procedure modeled

here the Fed receives, at the end of the week, the latest figures for M—l

(data for the week ending two weeks earlier), and decides on a new desired

level for the funds rate for the following week. Other procedures and timing

relationships could easily be modeled in a similar manner. In particular, we

will later discuss, in turn, the applicability of this procedure to a funds

rate target, in which the Fed can basically set its targeted funds rate, and

to a reserves target, in which the Fed supplies reserves consistent with its

chosen funds rate, but does not offset shocks which may cause significant

deviations within a given week. A diagram of the short—run control appli-

cation is shown below.

           It   is assumed that the Fed knows the dynamic response pattern of

money and interest rates and uses this knowledge to set the funds rate so that

the money supply will stay near its target path. In the next section we will

address the question of estimating the necessary response patterns. Because

the money supply is subject to random disturbances, the best the Fed can do is

to cause the expected value of money to be on target each week. However, in

order to achieve this level of accuracy with respect to money, the Fed might

have to ke large changes in the funds rate each week. The required changes

might easily increase over time, leading to explosive oscillations in interest

rates.    This is the instrument instability problem suggested by Holbrook

(1912).   In fact, the Fed does not try to bring the expected value of the

money supply onto its target path each week. Rather, it is assumed to recog-

nize a short—run tradeoff between reducing expected deviations of money from

its target path and reducing fluctuations in interest rates.     In order to

investigate the nature of that tradeoff we specify a loss function which has

terms penalizing both money supply deviations from target and volatility of

interest rates. These two objectives are assumed to capture the most impor-

tant tradeoff in the current Fed operating procedures.     However, the lOSS

function could easily be generalized to include additional goals. It might be

desirable, for example, to avoid large interventions in the nrket, in which

case one could include a term representing a cost associated with the size of

the control itself.

          Optimal control is most often expressed in the context of a first

order difference equation in the state vector.     Let x(t) be an nxl state

vector, u(t) be the control, and w(t) be an nxl vector of disturbances. The

laws of motion of the system are given by

          x(t) = A     x(t—l) + B u(t) + w(t)                            (1)
                                     —7—


where A is an nxn matrix and B is an nxl vector. In order to fit the monetary

control problem into this framework, x(t) includes current and lagged values

of M—l, m(t), the federal funds rate, r(t), possibly other informational

variables, and a monetary target, M*(t). u(t) is the Fed controlled shock to

the funds rate. The matrix A includes two or more rows of estimated coeffic—

lents which define how M—l, the funds rate, and possibly other variables

evolve through time.   All but one of the other rows of A identify as their

values in the previous state lags of m, r, and possibly other variables. The

final row defines the target money supply path.

          The quadratic loss function is written as


          L E{5[(M(t+s) — M*(t+s))2 + kl(t+_t+s_kfl2                      (2)



where M*(t) is the desired path for M—l.      The cost associated with money

deviations from target is balanced with interest rate volatility, measured as

a weighted sum of expected squared changes in the federal funds rate over

time.   Different relative costs associated with deviations from the money

target path and interest rate volatility can be represented by different

values of A.   More terms in the sum measuring interest rate volatility, that

is larger values of q, will lead to a smoother funds rate path. For example,

a high A, with q equal to one will avoid whipsawing the market——large move-

ments in the funds rate in a given week——while still allowing significant

movements over a period of time as short as say two or three months. A q of

ten or twelve, on the other hand, would damp considerably these longer swings

as well, leaving only very smooth changes in the funds rate over time. This

form for the loss function is only one of many possibilities. It was chosen

primarily because of its simplicity; the higher is q, the more it will respond

to, that is penalize, low frequency variations in interest rates. A more
                                     —8—

sophisticated loss function in the linear—quadratic class could be constructed

by n.king loss proportional to the square of particular linear combinations of

expected future interest rates, the linear combinations being chosen specific—

ally to respond to certain bands of frequencies of interest rate movements.

          The loss function in (2) also includes a discount factor 8, which

allows the lOSS function to give relatively less weight to future losses than

to current losses.    For the purposes of this paper there is no reason to

discount future losses, and the discount factor is taken to be 1.    Although

the expected loss is not finite when the discount factor is 1, there is a well

defined feedback rule which is the limit as 8 goes to 1 of rules associated

with 8's less than 1 which do generate finite expected losses.    In fact, it

may be not particularly desirable to have a finite expected loss; this

requires a discount factor less than 1, which is ropic in the sense that in a

steady state the average stream of losses will be larger than need be. This

occurs because the feedback rule does not look far enough ahead. For example,

if movements in interest rates affect money with a lag, and if we heavily

discount future losses, then we will be very reluctant to move interest rates

in any given period and our average loss each period will become very large

since money will deviate far from its target.

         Given the environment described in (1) and the loss function (2),

optinl control theory answers the following question, "What is the linear

feedback rule for choosing u(t) which, on the basis of current information,

minimizes the expected future loss?" The solution is a feedback matrix, F,

and a rule

         u(t) =   F x(t—1)                                                (3)
                                    —9—


which determines u(t) as a linear function of the past state and is optimal in

the sense that this choice of F generates a smaller expected loss than any

other choice.

3.    TIME SERIES ANALYSIS

            A critical element in optiml control theory is knowledge of the

dynamic   behavior of the system.        Time series analysis, in particular the
application of vector autoregression techniques, provides a reliable estimate
of   the laws of motion   of the money market.

           A special problem is encountered when optimal control theory is

applied to economic systems. A key element in the optimal control framework,

knowledge of the laws of motion of the system is either missing completely, or

known only with a large degree of uncertainty. Engineering texts on optimal

control spend little time considering this problem because it is usually

assumed that the response functions can be measured directly to whatever

degree of accuracy is needed. In economic systems it          is   impossible to perform

controlled experiments in order to measure response functions.                 Instead,

economists have come to rely on the laws of motion linbedded in econometric

models.

            Unfortunately,   econometric models have generated a rather poor

record with respect to forecasting the response of the econonr to changes in

policy. For example, when a key econometric relationship, the Phillips curve,

was identified in the 1960's many economists?! claimed it could be used as the

basis for attempting to trade off higher inflation for lower unemployment.

After a decade of high inflation along with high unemployment, few would

suggest such an approach today. The rational expectations critique of stand-

ard econometric models provides a reasonable explanation of why those models

failed, and many economists have developed a cautious, if not skeptical,

attitude toward the use of control theory based on this approach.




           &'See, for example, Tobin's (1972) AEA presidential address.
                                         — 11   —


            At   the same time that this dissatisfaction with traditional econo-

metric models has been emerging, a number of economists including Christopher

Sims, Thomas Sargent, and staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis

have been developing alternative time series methods of forecasting economic

variables .F     Not all economists would feel comfortable applying these models

to the control framework, but a recent strong defense of a time series

approach to policy analysis is given by Sims (1982).            He argues that the

normal business of policy formation is properly thought of as choice of shocks

to the policy behavior equation, and he goes on to suggest the use of a vector

autoregressive representation as the context in which this choice ought to be

made.

            We follow Sims advice here and construct a vector autoregression

with M—1, the federal funds rate and other variables in order to represent the

laws of motion of the money market.        In constructing this representation, we

have kept as a primaiy goal the desire to optimally forecast the movements of

M—l. For this reason we have paid particular attention to a statistic measur-

ing the out—of—sasrple forecasting performance of different models. We have

also followed the Bayesian procedures suggested by Litterman (1981) for fore-

casting with vector autoregressions.

           In searching through a variety of different variables, looking for

those which help to predict weekly movements in seasonally adjusted M—l, the

federal funds rate clearly stood out as the most important. This was followed

at a considerable distance by the level of Commercial and Industrial Loans,

the Standard and Poors Index of 500 stocks, Nonborrowed Reserves, Borrowed

Reserves, and Total Reserves. The Business Week Index, a conosite measure of

real    activity published by McGraw Hill, showed no explanatory power. Measures

of stock market volume and the Discount rate did not help either.                  These

results are based on experiments using systems with different sets of vari-

ables to forecast M—1.         All systems were estimated using the same Bayesian

prior, which is described in detail below. The results of some of these tests

are given in Table 1 and displayed in Figures 1 and 2.

of   the estimated time series model is the response function      of   M—1 to shocks

in the federal funds     rate.   It is this response upon which policy is based.

Fortunately for our purposes, this response is relatively strong, stable

across time periods, and insensitive to different specifications of the vector

autoregressive    representation. The response function we will use in corxputing
an optimal control policy is shown below in Figures 3,       )4,   5,   as   estimated
under    a variety of alternative specifications.   Notice how little variation

there is in the shape of this response in the different systems. Also notice

how long lived is the response of money to the funds rate shock. Significant

decreases in the money stock continue to occur two months after the initial

shock.

            Not   only did the federal funds rate significantly improve the
prediction of M—1, but it also explains a dramatically larger share of the
variation of M—1 than any of the other variables considered. In the sets of
three variable systems in Table 1, the percentage of the one—year—ahead fore-
cast variance explained by innovations in the funds rate varied between 19        and

73 percent.  The largest share received by any of the other variables con-
sidered was 1 percent, and in several cases it was less than 1 percent. In
Figure 6 we show the response functions of money in a five variable system

which    adds commercial and industrial loans, borrowed reserves and nonborrowed
reserves   to M—l and the funds rate. Notice how much larger is the      response of
money to the funds rate than to any of the other variables. Based on these

results we have proceeded with a bivariate autoregression using only M—1 and

the federal funds rate. All of the subsequent analysis could be generalized

to include other variables in the state vector, but the results would probably

not be iaterially affected.

dynamcial structure of a control exercise is a departure of this investigation
from the standard econometric approach. Estimation of a structural model was

rejected here because it would have greatly increased the cost and complexity

of the exercise, and it probably would not lead to improved estimates.     In

fact, as stressed by Sims (1980), the usual identifying restrictions are

likely to be false, and their application would probably lead to misspecifi—

cation and therefore bias in the estimation of the crucial response

ftnction. Given the strength of the evidence in the data, as seen in the lack

of sensitivity to alternative specifications, the results from using a reason-

able structural model would presumably be similar to those obtained here.

However, the risks of biasing results from imposing false restrictions and

inappropriate specification of rnamic structures appear to far outweigh the

expected benefit from a possible reduction in the variance of the estimates.

Evenif it would not improve the estimates, one might prefer a structural
model if it would be more likely to remain valid in the face of
interventions.    Unfortunately, construction of such an invariant structural

model is likely to be a difficult task. Moreover, the degree of inadequacy of
the time series representation is not obvious. This issue is addressed at
length   in the final section of this paper.

14   IMPROVING SHORT—RUM CONTROL OF THE MONEY SUPPLY

          Current Fed operating procedures do not apply     optimal control tech-
niques, even though the Fed appears to be trying to solve a problem of the
type which optimal control theory is designed to handle. Therefore, the
solution obtained by current procedures is likely to be suboptimal.         It is
possible, in fact, to estimate the tradeoff frontier which measures the
obtainable    combinations of interest rate volatility and expected deviations

from monetary targets, and therefore, to measure the degree to which a change

to an optimal control policy would likely improve operating characteristics.

The tradeoffs which emerge suggest that the Federal Reserve could achieve a

considerable smoothing of interest rates with little or no loss in terms of

money supply control. There does not, however, appear to be iaich room for

reducing the average size of money deviations from target.         Moreover, such

reductions would require large fluctuations in interest rates.

             In order to discuss these tradeoffs, it is first necessary to moti-

vate the model of short run monetary control suggested here.            There are

obvious differences between the earlier discussion of this model, in which the

funds rate is the control, and the usual discussion of current Fed operating

procedures, which stress reserve targets. Those differences, however, may be

more apparent than real. Under current Fed policy there is an implicit role

for the funds rate, and that role is the same as the one which it plays in the

optimal control procedure. The main differences between current policy and

the one suggested here is not the role of the funds rate, but rather that

under current procedures the Fed does not minimize a loss function and does

not optimally take into   account   the important lags in the response function of

M—l to shocks in the funds rate.         Evidence of this behavior, and the sub—

optimal control it implies, is given below.
                                            —i6—


             This interpretation of current Fed policy is based on the descrip-

tions of operating procedures published in recent issues of the Federal

Reserve Bank       of   New York (FRBNY) Quarterly Review, and the February 1981 Board

of Governors Staff Study, "New Monetary Control Procedures." The following

succinct summary by Richard G. Davis appeared in the Summer 1979 review in an

article, "Broad Credit Measures as Targets for Monetary Policy."

       Fundamentally, there are two basic tactical approaches the Federal Reserve
       can use to attempt to control the behavior of the money supply or any
       other financial variable. One of these would be to attempt to project the
       path of bank reserves (or the monetary base) that seems most likely to be
       associated with the desired path of the aggregate. The success of this
       approach depends, in turn, on the stability and predictability of the
       'n.iltiplier'      relationship between reserves and the aggregate in
       question.   Even in the case of monetary definitions involving only cur-
       rency and commercial bank deposits, there are significant problems with
       regard to the stability and predictability of the relevant niiltipliers.
       An alternative tactical approach open to the Federal Reserve in seeking to
       control the behavior of financial aggregates involves attempting to esti-
       mated the volume of the aggregate the public will want to hold under given
       conditions of aggregate demand and interest rates, then seeking to
       influence short—term money market rates accordingly. This approach also
       poses very real problems even in the case of a monetary aggregate because
       of difficulties in estimating what the public's demand for money will be
       under given conditions.

             Shortly after this was written the Fed announced that it would

change operating procedures from the second alternative, the funds targeting

approach, to the first alternative, the reserves targeting approach.                There

are certainly important differences        in these two approaches, 'out   in one   impor-
tant respect       they are similar.      The similarity is that in both cases the

control    variable     which directly affects the money supply is the federal funds

rate.     That this is true is not always obvious from Federal Reserve System

descriptions, for instance, the one above.           However, careful reading of the

following passage from a staff report published as, "Monetary Policy and Open

Market Operations in 1980," in the Summer 1981 FRBNY Quarterly Review makes

this    clear.

   As   the Desk worked to achieve the average nonborrowed reserve path,
   borrowing at the discount window and money market rates tended to adjust
   whenever money growth deviated from the Committee's short—term aggregate
   objectives. flien money growth was above these objectives, for example, as
    in the autumn of 1980, banks demand for total reserves exceeded the
   nonborrowed reserve path by more than the initial borrowing assumption.
   Hence, with the Desk supplying nonborrowed reserves in line with the path,
   interest rates tended to move higher as banks were forced to seek greater
   access to the discount window to meet their reserve requirements. These
   resulting changes in money market rates under the reserve approach, in
   turn, worked to encourage banks and the public to make the portfolio
    changes needed to return money growth in time back in line with the
   Committee's objectives.

             On occasion, as seemed appropriate, the nonborrowed reserve path
   was modified relative to the total reserve path in order to accelerate the
   adjustment process.   These changes were intended to encourage an even
    sharper response in borrowing, and hence in reserve availability and
    interest   rates, to monetary deviations so that the pressures for restoring
   money growth in line with the Committee's objectives were intensified.
          Notice   that the logic of the following description of the casual

chain between the Fed's nonborrowed reserve target and the money supply gives

a crucial role to the funds rate. The funds rate is never mentioned, but at a

given discount rate, the funds rate is closely tied to the level of bor—

rowings. The description is from another FRBNY Quarterly Review article, "The

Monetary Base as an intermediate Target for Monetary Policy," by Richard G.

Davis in the Winter 1979/80 issue.

         In the short—run context, a critical point is that member bank excess
         reserves tend to average close to frictional minima over a period of
         weeks and to show little systematic sensitivity to interest rate
         movements. Consequently, movements in the total reserve component of
         the base tend largely to mirror movements in required reserves. And
         in the short period of a few weeks between FOMC meetings, required
         reserve movements tend to be only marginally responsive to the volume
         of nonborrowed reserves supplied. The volume of reserves supplied
         through open market operations, in the short run, mainly affects the
         extent to which member banks are forced to meet their reserve
         requirements through borrowings at the discount window. The effect
         on total reserves, nonborrowed plus borrowings, and on the total
         monetary base appears to be quite small over these short periods.

          Clearly,   then, whether the focus is directly on the funds rate, or
on reserve targets, the fundamental link between the open market operations
                                       — 18   —




and their affect on the money supply is through their affect on the funds

rate.

           Moreover, the Open Market Committee and the Desk recognize that

there is a fundamental tradeoff between the rapidity of reduction of short—run

deviations in money and volatility of interest rates. Quoting again from the

report in the Summer 1981 FRBI'TY Quarterly Review:

    [The Committee] tried to take into account lags in the effects of changes
    in financial market conditions on money growth.             A more aggressive
    approach to setting short-term monetary targets——say, one that attempted
    close month—to—month control——risked the possibility of whipsawing the
    markets and ultimately destablizing money growth and interest rates over a
    longer period.

           A recent staff study, Tinsley, von zur Muehlen, Trepeta, and Fries

(1981), addressed the question of whether there exists

    "...a well—behaved tradeoff between the volatility of deviations of M—1A
    from long—run targets and volatility of short—term interest rates under
    current and alternative operating procedures that may be exploited by
    short—run monetary policy?"

           The Tinsley, et al., study         involved simulations   of the Board's

monthly money market model. Although their conclusions are similar to those

reached here, their approach differs in that they did not adopt an explicit

control theoretic framework, nor did they try to model the week—to—week

dynamics of the money market.

           The   optimal control approach to monetary control outlined above is
an attempt to formalize the Fed's operating procedures and the implicit loss
function   which trades off short—run control for interest rate smoothness.

Applying time series techniques to the estimation of the laws of motion of the

M—l, federal funds process formalizes the Committee's attention to the lags

inherent in the system.     Because the Committee is, in effect, attempting to

solve the same problem, but without the benefit of optimal control theory and

time series analysis, its solution is likely to be suboptimal.
                                     — 19   —


           Although it may at first appear to be a funds rate targeting pro-
 cedure, the control approach suggested here should not be thought of as either

 a funds rate or a reserves targeting procedure. As is stressed above, both of

 these operating procedures affect the level of the money supply through the

 funds rate. The feedback rule defined here is thus a necessary ingredient for

 either operating procedure to function optimally.       As explained below,
according to the model presented here the use of a funds targeting procedure

is likely to reduce the losses incurred using an optimal control approach.

Nevertheless, there are several reasons why the Fed might want to implement a

control policy under a reserves targeting procedure, at least initially.

First of all, if the Fed were obviously pegging the funds rate, it might

become politically impossible for the Fed to set the rate at the levels deter-

mined to be optimal according to the control rule. Secondly, switching back

to funds rate targeting procedure would be an obvious change in policy. The

more smoothly a feedback rule such as this is implemented, the more likely it

is that the money market will respond as it has in the past. This stability

in response is a key issue which is discussed below. Another argument against

switching back to a funds rate targeting approach is that it might send just

the wrong signal concerning the Fed's intentions to control the money

supply. Any possible signal that it has lost the ability or the desire to

control the supply of money could raise inflation expectations, and conse-

quently the level of interest rates. The operation of the feedback rule under

a reserves targeting procedure would not be that nuich different from current

procedures. Today, the FOMC picks target ranges for the funds rate and money

growth rates, which the Board and the Desk translate into reserve path

targets.   Under an optimal control approach, the Board and the Desk could

compute reserve targets on a week—by—week basis, consistent with the funds
                                       — 20   —




rate    given by the feedback rule. As long as the Fed is willing to cause the

federal funds rate to move as needed to control the money supply, the differ-

ence between a funds and a reserves targeting procedure is not sharp. A class

of possible rules can be defined in terms of the frequency with which the

reserves target is adjusted.      The funds and reserves target procedures dis-

cussed here are two possible points in this class. In the limit as a reserves

target is adjusted more and more often to reach a desired level for the funds

rate, it becomes a funds targeting procedure.

            The time series model that drives the analysis to follow is a bivar—

late autoregressive representation for M—l and the funds rate. Twelve lags of

each   variable and a constant term are   included in each equation. The model is

estimated    using   weekly data from 1976:1 through 1982:12.     The estimation

procedure is Theil's (1971) mixed estimation procedure, applied equation 'by

equation,    that is, ordinary least squares with the data sets augmented to

include a set of observations representing a Bayesian prior of the type

described    by Litterman (1981). A schematic representation of this prior is

given below.

            The estimation was carried out using the Regression Analysis   of   Time

Series program of Doan and Litterman (1981). Using their notation, the prior

is a Symmetric Random     Walk with parameter 1. (each variable in each equation
is    treated symmetrically, the coefficient on the own first   lag has a mean of

1.,    all other coefficients have a mean of o.),   and the lag decay is harmonic

with parameter 2. (the prior for the coefficient on lag j is centered around

0. with a standard error i/j2 times the standard error on the first lag). The

overall tightness is .5 (the standard deviation of the prior distribution for

the first lag of the dependent variable is .5)      The prior standard deviations

of other than the dependent variable in each equation are scaled by the

standard error of univariate equations in order to take account of the

different units of the variables. The prior was chosen based on an informal

search over the parameters of the prior for those which led to the best out—

of—sample forecasts.

          The coefficient estimates from this procedure can be viewed as an

approximation of the posterior mean using this prior.       These estimates are

given in Table 2.      It is not very enlightening to analyze the autoregressive

representation directly, however, so we also present the moving average, or

impulse response function, representation in Figure 7.

The equation of motion is given by:

            x(t) = A x(t—1) +           B   u(t) +   w(t)
where       u(t)     F x(t—l)

defines the control. The control, u(t), is a scalar variable defined as a

linear combination of the previous state vector by the feedback vector F. The

vector F is generated by the solution of the matrix Riccati equation. B is a

vector of zeros with a one as the 13th element, corresponding to the element

r(t) in the state vector. Th vector w(t) has zeros everywhere except in its

first and 13th elements, which are white noise error terms with covariance

matrix equal to the estimated covariance matrix of the residuals from the

post—October 1979 data. This covariance matrix is as follows:

where g is the targeted growth rate of moner (on a week to week basis). The

a(i,j) are the coefficients from the time series model described above which

determines m(t) and r(t) as a function of the lagged state.

          This control model corresponds to a world in which the Fed at the

beginning of the week picks a shock, u(t), which it does not modify as the

week progresses.   It is designed to model a reserves targeting procedure in

which the level of nonborrowed reserves to supply during the week is chosen so

as to cause an optimal movement in the funds rate. Because there are unfore-

seen shocks during the week, given by w(t), the funds rate has a stochastic

element which is not under the Fed's control.

          In order to model a funds rate targeting procedure, the state vector

is augmented to include the next disturbance to the funds rate equation. The

A matrix is augumented by a column which is zeros except for a one in the 13th

row, corresponding to the funds rate equation.    This inclusion is a device

which allows the feedback rule to respond to the disturbance during the week

in which it occurs. Responding to the disturbance is a way to model an oper-

ating procedure in which the funds rate is targeted each week and reserves are

supplied or demanded by the Fed as necessary to keep the rate within a narrow

band.   In this approach the only difference between a reserves targeting

procedure and a funds rate targeting procedure is that under the funds rate

procedure the Fed can respond to the disturbance, whereas under the reserve

procedure it cannot. Thus, using this approach implies that there will always

be more noise under a reserves targeting procedure.

         To this point, no mention has been made of the fact that the money

supply is not observed contemporaneously with the funds rate. For the purpose

of optimal control, there is an important separation of' the problem of setting

a control from the problem of observing the current state. For a statement of
                                          —26--


this result, see Bertsekas (1976).             The implication of this result is that

when one or more of the most recent observations of money are not available,

the optimal strateg,r is to form the best linear prediction of these values of

money, and then to proceed as if they had been observed. In practice, depend-

ing on the day   of   the week, the lag between the observation of the funds     rate
and M—l varies between 7 and 12 business days. We model this as a two—week

lag in the weekly data.       Thus, we proceed in two steps.        First we form the

optimal linear forecast of the most recent two weeks of money data, then we

proceed as above. The forecasting exercise is conditional on the two advanced

observations on the funds rate. The optimal linear forecasting procedure in

this case is described in Example 13.5 of Doan and Litterman (1981).              The

astute reader will have realized that the conditional forecast depends on the

reduced form, which is a function of the feedback control rule; but the feed-

back control rule itself is a function of the conditional forecast.             Thus,

using this forimilation with two unobserved values of money in the state vec-

tor, the problem of finding the optimal control rule requires a simultaneous

solution with the problem of generating a conditional forecast. Actually, the

problem is not all that serious. The method described below has worked quite

well with a minimum additional computing expense.

          The solution procedure is a simple iteration. The reduced form in

the first step is derived by solving the matrix Riccati equation for a feed-

back control vector, F, and plugging it into the state equation.


          x(t) = (A—BF)     x(t-1•) +   w(t)
The conditional forecast of x(t—l) given a subvector of x(t—1) can be written

as


          x(t—l)      G x(t—1)                                                  (5)

where G is a matrix which has zeros in the columns corresponding to the
                                              — 27 —



unobserved components of x(t—l). Given G, the new reduced form, that is the

reduced form for step two is


              x(t) =   (A—BFG)        x(t—l) +   w(t)                               (6)

This reduced form implies a new G, and so on. Note that each iteration adds
two lags to the state vector.             Thus, in principle, the reduced form has an

infinite autoregressive representation.                 In practice, within the relevant

range of A's iterating between these two equations quickly leads to conver-

gence of G and the reduced form transition matrix, (A—BFG). Notice that this

iterative procedure does not require repeated solution of the matrix Riccati

equation, which determines F.              We illustrate the reduced form response of

moneyand the funds rate to an innovation in money in Fiires 8 through 13 for
funds rate and reserve targeting procedures and several values of A and q.
The response of the funds rate could be viewed as a Fed reaction function
under   an optimal control approach.

              Several points should be noticed with respect to these graphs.

First, there is a two week lag in the response of interest rates to the money

innovation.      This is due     to    the delay in the observation of the money inno-.

vation. Because of the differences in the definitions of the loss functions,

the values of A are not comparable between loss functions with different

values of q.      For q=12 and the funds targeting procedure graphs representing

several values of A are displayed. As A gets larger more weight is given to

smoothing interest rates; this causes a smaller interest rate response and a

longer delay in returning money to the target path.                  The main difference

between responses when q=l and q=12 is that in the latter case responses are

more   of a   discrete nature. When longer run          smoothing is desired, he response
to a given shock is to move the funds rate to a new level at which it is
expected to stay, rather than the more gradual increase which is generated
when only week—to—week changes are penalized.

            The shocks have been orthogonalized so that the shock we are calling

a money innovation includes the component of interest rate innovations which

are    correlated with mon innovations. A comparison of the response patterns
for q=12, X=2, between the funds     rate   and reserves targeting procedures shows
that   the difference between them is that under a funds rate target there is a

contemporaneous offsetting of the funds rate movement associated with the

money innovation. That offsetting response represents the degree to which all

contemporaneous movements in the funds rate are offset; the controller does

not yet recognize the movement as a money innovation.         In fact, because the

funds rate movement is equally likely to represent a funds rate innovation

which lowers the expected money path, in the second week the funds rate is

brought essentially back to, or even below, its previous path.           It is not

until the third week, when the money disturbance is seen by the controller,

and recognized for what it is, that the reaction to it begins.

            Once the optirra.l feedback rule has been calculated, taking into

account the lagged observation of money, the probability laws of the control-.

led system are determined and thus we can calculate measures of expected

interest rate volatility and money supply deviations. We can, that is, calcu-

late the set of points, associated with different values of X and q, which

represent the best possible solutions to the problem of minimizing both money

supply deviations and interest rate volatility.           The tradeoff can be more

easily understood by visualizing the costs associated with the 1976 to present

period. These costs are illustrated in Figures 114 and 15.         In the first, we

show    the money deviations from target. This target does not attempt to repre-
sent    actual Fed policy, but rather is estimated as a long run trend. This

assumes the Fed was always basically hitting its long run targets, which

presumably    understates the true    situation, particularly prior to October—

1979.     For our purposes, which focus on short—run control, this is an adequate

approximation.    In fact, the target is estimated as the quadratic trend in the

logged M—l data, and the implied slowly declining growth rates, which are also

shown in the figure, are quite consistent with the stated Federal Reserve

intentions. Finally, in the plot showing the deviations from target we also

show   dotted lines at plus and minus the post-.October—1919 root mean square
deviation.    The size of this mean square deviation is the measure of monetary

control which enters the loss function.

             In the next figure we show the federal funds rate path along with

two plots illustrating how interest rate volatility is measured in the loss

function. One plot shows week—to—week changes in the funds rate, with dotted

lines at plus and minus the post—October—l979    root mean square change. This
mean square change enters the loss function when q=l.      In the other plot we

show the square root of the average of squared changes from each of the twelve

previous weeks.      This value squared is the measure which enters the loss

function when q=l2.       A dotted line shows its post—October—l979 average

value. Notice that while they both have units of basis points, the leveTh of

these measures of loss for q=l and q=12 are not comparable.

             Having now defined the appropriate measures of loss, we are able to

present the optin.l tradeoff as a curve in a graph with root mean square money

supply deviations on the vertical axis and root mean square changes in

interest rates (or root of averages of twelve squared changes, for q=12) on

the horizontal axis. Two curves are shown 'in Figures 16 and lT, one for the

model of a funds targeting procedure and one for the model of a reserves

targeting procedure. The size of the shocks is based on the post—October—1979

experience.      Notice that lowering the average money deviation from target

below about )..5 billion, which is close to the actual post—October-l979 level,

begins to require very large increases in interest rate volatility.

           An interesting question is the following:      where does the current

policy, represented in this model by the time series representation with no

control applied, leave us in this space? We can answer this question, but     the
curve described above, which represents an average expected performance in a

steady state, is not the best point of departure. The problem is that the

deviations from target of the uncontrolled money path accumulate over time so

that there is no finite steady state expected money deviation. This aspect of

the time series representation for current policy is not a characteristic

about which we should be overly concerned. First of all, the relatively short

segment of weekly data on which it is based does not contain much information

about the long run    properties   of the system. In the second place, the random

walk prior pulls the estimates toward a nonstationary representation.       It is

possible, however, to make a useful performance coirarison in this space

between the optimally controlled systems and the uncontrolled system.        This

can be accomplished by generating a kind of psuedo history as described below.

           The vector autoregressive representation generates a set of one—

step—ahead forecast errors, or shocks, for the period over which it is esti-

mated. These shocks can be used to answer the question of how much better

could the Fed have done in the past, had it been following an optimal control

policy.    First, we need to define a target path for the 1976 to present

period. Since we are focusing on short—run control, we will take as the long—

                                                                        Given the

target, and taking the initial values at the beginning of 1976 as given, for

any   particular   values of X and q we can generate the paths the state variables

would have taken if:

           (a) the state had evolved according to the vector autoregressive

           representation,
           (b) an optimal control policy had been in force, and
                                         — 31   —




          (c)   the same set of shocks had hit the system.

          The results of this type of experiment using different values of X

and q, lead to pseudo histories and tradeoff curves representing what would

have occurred under different loss functions and an optimal control

strate.    These tradeoff curves can be usefully compared with the actual
performance over the same period. This is done in Figures 18 and 19 for the
post-.October-1979   period.

          Four results stand out from this comparison.

                1)   With a loss function that focuses on high frequency vola-

                     tility (i.e.    q=1), there is not rruch   loss   associated with

                     the current policy relative to      an optimal reserve targeting
                     procedure.
                2) Second, there is very little possible improvement, under
                     either    procedure, in reducing short run money deviations

                     from target without incurring large increases in interest

                     rate volatility.

                3) Third, there is a large gain possible with respect to reduc-

                     ing high frequency interest rate volatility by moving to a

                     funds rate   targeting procedure.
                i)   Finally, with respect to a loss function that focuses on

                     smoothing both high and low frequency movements in interest

                     rates (i.e. q12), there is a large gain possible through

                     optimal control of interest rates for either a reserve or a

                     funds rate targeting procedure.

           Another interesting comparison can be made 1y looking directly at

the pseudo histories themselves. These are shown for several values of X and

q in Figures 20 to 25.          Notice that comparing the actual movements in the

funds rate with the movements generated by any of the optimal control
                                     — 32   —


procedures   suggests that the Fed often responds to money deviations with too
much of a delay, and then to react for too long of a period, leading to
signficant overshooting of its M—l targets.     Furthermore, a conarison with
the   history generated with q equal to 12 and X=2 suggests that a considerable

degree of smoothing of the funds rate could have been achieved with no adverse

effect on monetary control.

           In   practice, what the optimal           control   procedure gives the policy—

maker each week is a suggestion for where the funds rate should be in the

following week and a set of forecasts for values of the state variables condi-

tional   on the value of the funds rate. Examples of this type of output are
given below   in   Figures 26,   27, and   28.   Shown are actual values up the current

time period, the projected paths of the variables if no control is applied,

and the projected paths if the optimal control is applied this period.

 5. EVIDENCE O1' STRUCTURAL STABILITY

            There is no guarantee that changes in the operating procedures of

 the Fed would leave unaffected the important dynamics of the money market on

 which this procedure depends.        There is evidence which suggests that the

 impact   would not be large. Moreover, there are reasons to think a structural
 model of   the link between the funds rate and the money supply could be con-

 structed in which that response would not be sensitive to the kinds of inter—

 ventions we have been considering.

            A key assumption of the above exercise is that the dynamics of the

money market variables would not change too much as a result of the adoption

of an optimal control rule.        Whether this is likely to be true is a key

question, it is, after all, the focus of the rational expectations criticism

of traditional econometric exercises of this type. According to the rational

expectations argument, changes in the policy rule of the government will lead

to changes in the actions of agents in the econon and the new dynamic

behavior of the econon is likely to be far different from before.         For a

forceful exposition of this viewpoint, see Lucas (1976).

            The standard answer to the above question is that the dynamic

behavior of the econonr can be modeled structurally, and equations such as a

consumption    function, a money demand function, and so on, represent behavior
of   agents which will not change when the equation representing the policy rule

is changed.     However, if   it is recognized that agents' behavior depend cru-

cially on     expectations   of the future, which in turn depend on government
policy, then unless expectations have been explicitly modeled, this defense
breaks down.     Since a time series representation is the reduced form implied
by a structural model, the dynamics of the time series representation are
subject to the Lucas critique.

          In   a draft of his forthcoming Brookings paper, Sims challenges the

relevance of the Lucas critique, for policy choices of the type being

considered here. Because it is a key issue, we quote at length.

          The normai business of policy formation is properly thought of as
          choice of shocks to the policy behavior equation, or equivalently as
          choice of values for policy variables, or again equivalently as
          implementation of an unchanged policy rule. It is an analytically
          nontrivial problem, given that the structure of the economy is
          subject to continual uncertain drift and that those with actual
          influence on policy are engaged in a complicated dynamic game with
          many players. It is fully as important as the problem of choice of
          policy rule. Though choice of rule has permanent consequences, while
          choice of the current level of policy variables has more short—lived
          consequences, choice of current levels is repeated very often, while
          choice of rule must occur rarely. The cost of using a poor method
          for making the choice are therefore of comparable magnitude.
          Finally, statistical methods probably have more to contribute to
          policy choices which do not involve rule changes. This may seem to
          conflict with the recent flowering of econometric literature
          connected with rational expectations. But while choice of policy
          rule requires sophisticated probabilities modeling, and while
           econometric estimation of parameters structural under changes in rule
           is an intellectual challenge, it remains true that rule changes must
           be rare events. To make statistics yield conclusions about the effects
           of rule changes requires laying the data over a dense, inevitably
           controversial scaffold of a priori theorizing. Since
           choices of shocks to policy equations have occured very often, the
           data can be expected to speak more directly about their consequences.

                  Interesting and important as it may be to develop methods
          for optimally choosing policy rules in the face of the Lucas
          critique, it is a mistake to suppose that this should be the
          exclusive, or even the main focus of quantitatively oriented
          macroeconometric research. The normal business of making projections
          of the likely effects of various choices for the paths of policy
          variables is neither internally inconsistent, nor analytically
          trivial, nor inconsequential.

          With respect to the money market, we are in the fortunate circum-

 stance   of having one bit of empirical evidence which may be of help in resol-
ving this issue. In       October 1979 the   Federal Reserve made   a change in opera-

 ting procedures which arguably was a more striking change than would be the

 adoption of the optimal control techniques proposed here. If the dynamics of

 the system were not affected too much by that change, then there is good

 reason to hope that they would not be too sensitive to the change proposed
                                                  — 36 —



 here.      Unfortunately, testing for structural change can be a tricir propo—
 sition.        For example, it is obvious from the data that something changed in

 October 1979.            The standard errors of innovations in M—l and the funds       rate
 are many times larger after that date.                    For our purpose, the question of
 interest, however, is whether there is evidence that the response function of

 M—l to a shock in the funds             rate   changed. On this question, the evidence is
 comfortably unclear.             Based on visual inspection of the response functions

 presented above, and a statistical test described here, there is no reason to

 believe that the response of money changed significantly when the operating

procedures of the Fed were changed. This test is as follows:                 one—step—ahead
 forecasts of money were made separately based on the data before and after the

change. The forecasts were made out—of—sample, in a sense to be made precise

below. If there was a significant change in structure, then making forecasts

based on using the full sample should lead to larger errors in both sub—

samples.        ifl   fact,   using 12 lags, the forecasts of money in the first half of

the sample improved only marginally after dropping the second half, and the

forecasts in the second half actually improved using estimates based on the

full     sample.        Using two lags, the forecasts based on the full sample were

better in each subsample than the forecasts based on the subsample alone. The

out—of—sample nature of the test is that for each period, the forecast of

money for that period is based on an estimator using all observations in the

relevant sample except that period's observation. The reason for this proce—

dure is that if the test is done in—sample, then the subsample estimates               n.zst

fit   better.         One version of   the   standard Chow test for structural stability is

based on the asymptotic distribution of the size of this in—sample improve-
ment. See, for example, Sims (1980). Asymptotically, our test will have the
same distribution. The fact that there is little or no improvement in the two
subsamples means that the change in structure, if it occurred at all, was not
large.

           An important element in any argument of why the response of money to

the funds rate would not be likely to change under a change in operating

procedures should be based on an understanding of that response. Banks play a

kr role in the reaction of money to changes in the funds rate. That role is

described in a recent paper, "A Critique of the Federal Reserve's New

Operating Procedure" by Robert D. Laurent of the Federal Reserve Bank of

Chicago.

    The money supply process is the means by which the monetary authority
    affects the purchase and sale of assets by banks and thereby the creation
    and destruction of deposits.            It may be thought of as a two—step
    process.      The first step is
                                  the action of the Fed. The second step is the
    reaction of     the banks to the Fed's actions. The linchpin of the money
    supply process is the federal funds market. The federal funds market both
    resisters the actions of the Fed by setting the price of reserve credit
    and transmits its influence to every bank. The individual
                                                           the
                                                              bank's response
                                                               public is what
    in terms of buying assets from, or selling assets to individual   bank, it
     determines the change in deposits and money. To the
     is the federal funds rate and not reserves which determines how it changes
     its asset holdings and its impact on the aggregate level of deposits. The
     individual bank neither knows nor cares about the aggregate level of
     reserves in the banking system. Indeed, it can be argued that even its
     own level of reserves does not determine whether a bank buys or
                                                                           sells
     assets, creating or destroying deposits. Of course, a bank must        have
                                                                       obtain or
     enough reserves to  meet reserve requirements, but it can always
     dispose of reserves in the federal funds market. For example, even a bank
     deficient in reserves might still make loans and thereby increase deposits
                                                                              It
     if the rate on loans were high relative to the federal funds rate.
     would offset its loss of reserves resulting from the  increase  in loans by
     buying even more funds than otherwise in the    federal funds  market.  The
                                                                        not upon
     bank's response depends entirely upon what appears profitable,
                                      —38—


     the   circumstances of the bank's  reserve position.   The effect of the
     federal funds rate on individual banks and the aggregate level of deposits
     is clear. Other things equal, the higher (lower) the federal funds rate,
     the lower (higher) will be the level of deposits. To an individual bank,
     the federal funds market can be either a source of, or an outlet for,
     funds.   A bank compares the federal funds rate to the rates on assets
     available from the public.   The lower the federal funds rate, the more
     attractive these other assets look. With a low federal funds rate, banks
     respond by increasing their holdings of assets obtained from the public,
     creating deposits and covering any reserve losses with federal funds
     purchases.  Conversely, a high federal funds rate means that banks will
     reduce their holdings of assets obtained from the
                                                          public, destroying
     deposits, and take the reserves acquired and sell them in the federal
    funds market....A bank actually compares (after adjusting for risk differ-
    ential and transaction costs) the rate on an asset of' a given maturity
    with the expected rate on one day federal funds rolled over for the same
    maturity.   Thus, equilibrium is not necessarily where the rate on bank
    assest equals the federal funds rate.      Policy affects the money stock
    through  the impact of the current federal funds rate expected future
    federal funds rates. The greater is the impact of a on movement in the
    current federal funds rate on expected future funds rates, the greater is
    the impact on  money.

           If this understanding of the response is correct, then money should
continue   to react in essentially the same way it has in the past in response

to a given movement in the funds rate. If any difference can be expected, it

is likely to be that the response will become larger and quicker because given

movements in the funds rate will carry more information about future movements

in the funds rate than at present, particularly if people understand and

believe the Fed's linear feedback rule. Such a change in structure would have

the beneficial effect of causing the tradeoff curves defined above to shift

down and toward the left. To make this arment precise would require a model

of the equilibrium structure which would result from interaction of a Fed

policy rule of the sort suggested here and banks' optimizing behavior subJect

to some costs of adjustment. Such an investigation would appear to be a good

topic for future research.

CONCLUSION

             This application of optimal control theory and time series analysis

has identified    an important tradeoff between degrees of     short-run monetary

control and    interest rate volatility. Two principal conclusions emerge:



    1) Application of optimal control         theory would likely improve Federal
      Reserve     operating procedures, and

    2) Interest rate volatility can be reduced considerably from current

      levels without adversely affecting the degree of monetary control

      achieved.
