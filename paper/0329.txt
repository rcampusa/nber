                                  Summary

          MONEY STOCK REVISIONS AND UNANTICIPATED MONEY GROWTH

                     Robert J. Barro and Zvi Hercowitz


     An important "empirical regularity" is the strong positive effect of money

shocks on output and employment. One strand of business cycle theory relates

this finding to temporary confusions between absolute and relative price

changes. These models predict positive output effects of unperceived monetary

movements, but the quantitative importance of unperceived shifts in nominal

aggregates is subject to question. Another strand of theory, based on long-term

nominal contracts and analogous price-setting institutions, generates output

effects from unanticipated, but not necessarily contemporaneously unperceived,

money shocks. However, the real effects of unpredicted, but contemporaneously

understood, monetary changes are not obviously consistent with efficient

institutional arrangements. The present paper provides some empirical evidence

on the two types of theories by analyzing the output effects associated with

revisions in the money stock data, where the revisions are interpreted as

components of unperceived monetary movements. The revisions turn out to

have no significant explanatory power for output. Previous findings that

innovations from an estimated money growth equation have a significant output

effect remain intact when the revisions are included as separate explanatory

variables. Overall, the study provides a small amount of evidence against

the special role of unperceived, as opposed to unanticipated, money movements

as a determinant of business fluctuations.

                                                   Revised March 1979




     Business cycle theories of the sort constructed by Friedman

(1968), Phelps (1970), Lucas (1972, 1973, 1975), and   Barro   (1976,

1978b) assume that individuals can be temporarily confused between

absolute and relative price changes. Monetary surprises have transitory

real effects in these models because these disturbatices are temporarily

misperceived as real shocks. The dependence of these theories on un-

perceived movements in nominal variables may be a shortcoming. In

particular, if more rapid observation of general price indices or money

stock measures would substantially lessen the amplitude of business

cycles, then it is surprising that this mOre rapid observation does

not take place through a combination of individual information-gathering

efforts and improved government reporting. One counter-argument is

that individual fortunes may be much more dependent on relative price

and income changes than on general business fluctuations. In this

circumstance it may not pay for individuals to spend a great deal of

effort in assessing contemporaneous movements in global variables ex-

cept to assist in gaining a clearer view o local changes.

     Another argument is that, for example, the existing money stock

data provide conceptually inappropriate measures of the pertinent

underlying "nominal't disturbances. This view seems to underlie the

approach of Sargent and Sims (1977), who model the business cycle as

being generated by inherently unobservable shocks. However, this

approach does not account for the apparently strong explanatory power
                                —2—




of monetary shocks--as measured from standard money stock

definitions--for the business cycle, as reported, for example,

in Barro (1977a, 1978a).

     A different theoretical argument is that purely nominal shocks

influence real behavior not because these shocks are contemporaneously

unperceived, but rather because these shocks were unpredictable

at earlier dates. The imposition of unanticipated, but not

necessarily contemporaneously unperceived, money movements on an

economy with long-term nominal contracts is viewed as a source

of business fluctuations in models constructed by Gray (1976) and

Fischer (1977), among others. These models have the strength of

relying on unpredictable money movements--which can plausibly be

assumed to be of substantial magnitude--rather than on unperceived

monetary changes. The shortcoming of these theories, as discussed

in Barro (1977b), is that the real effects of unpredicted, but

contemporaneously perceived, monetary changes are not obviously

consistent with efficient contractual arrangements

     The empirical analysis in Barro (1977a, 1978a) reports

substantial effects on unemployment and output of discrepancies

between actual money growth and the growth that could have been

predicted from a set of explanatory variables. These results are

consistent with either the unperceived money or unpredicted money

models (with predictions generated one year earlier) and do not

discriminate between these two varieties of business cycle theories.
                                   —3-.




Therefore, a comparison of these theories--which have some differences

in terms of policy implications--requires some additional empirical

evidence.

     One part of monetary surprises that seems classifiable as

temporarily unperceived is the amount that corresponds to revisions

in the published data. Further, these changes--even measured in

terms of growth rate effects, rather than as changes in the

measured levels of the money stock (which sometimes apply equally

to past dates)-—are occasionally substantial, amounting to as much

as 1-2% of Ml on an annual average basis. However, the average

magnitude of the revisions, in terms of growth rate discrepancies,

turns out to be only about .OOLL on an annual average basis from

l98 to 1975.

     The objective in the present paper is to test whether

Ytunanticipated money growth,t'   as   measured in the research cited

above, has explanatory value for unemployment and output because

it proxies for unperceived money growth, as measured by the

data revisions. However, this test cannot fully discriminate be-

tween the unperceived versus unpredicted monetary-effects models,

since a one-to-one identification of unperceived money growth with

the data revisions does not seem reasonable. To preview the

results, it turns out that the measures of unperceived money growth

based on the data revisions have no siificant explanatory value

for unemployment and outut.

Measure of Data Revisions

    Regular revisions of the money stock data published by the Federal

Reserve involve refinements (benchmark adjustments) to estimates of deposits

and vault cash at nQm-member banks. Changes in seasonal adjustment

factors are not considered in the present analysis, which deals

only with annual average data. Some other revisions involve shifts

in concepts--for example, the change in October 1960 to include

in the money stock the demand deposits that are dte to mutual

savings banks and foreign banks--or shifts in procedures, such as

the change in October 1969 that eliminated the (incorrect) sub-

traction of cash items in the process of collection at foreign

branches of U.S. banks. Another important change was the shift

in October 1960 to daily average figures, as applied ex post to

data starting in 1947.

     Definitional changes that produce a shift in the overall level

of the measured money stock seem unlikely to have significant

real effects, especially since estimates of different concepts of

money could already have been generated prior to the revisions.

In order to filter out this type of effect, we base our analysis

on monetary growth rates. Our basic series is the growth rate that

could have been calculated from the annual average of the first

reports of money for each month (which appeared with a one- to

two morth lag over the sample period), relative to the annual

average of money applicable to dates 12 months previous. That is,
                                    —5—




for year t, the first reports on Ml for each month are averaged

to obtain the contemporaneously perceived level, tMt, where the

first time subscript denotes the date at which estimates are made

to apply to the date indicated by the second subscript. The

values for each month in the preceding year--as reported at the

time of the first report for each corresponding month this year--

are averaged to obtain M_i. The annual average perceived money

growth rate is then calculated as tDMt

     The perceived money growth rate is compared with the estimate

of money growth that is available later based on "final" revised

figures, DMt E             i' to obtain the contemporaneous
                 1o(M/M
measurement error,        DM. -           The time series over the post-
                                  tDM.
World War II period for                                and    are
                               tMt_i, M,
contained in table 1. The notes to the table provide some detail

on sources and on the nature of the principal data revisions. The

largest values for    since 19471 appearin 1960 (.010), 1969 (.017),

and 1973 (.010). The average value from 1948 to 1G75 is pcsitive--

.0025--and the average magnitude is .0038.

     We have also considered an alternative concept of measurement

error for money growth rates denoted        (table 1, col. 10) that

comprises only the benchmark adjustments to the money stock. For

example, this concept eliminates the effect of the conceptual and

procedural changes in 1960 and 1969 that implied large "revisions"

for those years. With only benchmark changes considered, the average
                                             —6—




revision in money growth        rates    is close to zero and the average

absolute value is .0013--only about                one-third   of the broader

revision concept. The largest magnitude values are now 1973

(.010), 1972 (.007) and 1970 (—.003). Values greater than                   .001

apply   to only 6 of the years from 197 to :975.

       The aim of this investigation is to assess the explanatory

power for unemployment        and   output of unperceived money growth,

as measured by    or e, in comparison with that of "unanticipated"
money growth, DMP.tI as measured previously and also tabulated in
table 1.       The   sample average value of DMR is close to zero by
construction, arid the average          magnitude from 19'48       to 1975 is
.0109--about three times that of                     The   correlation between DMR

and      from 19L#8 to 1975 is negligible__+.01__although that of DMR

with the benchmark revisions, c, is +0.38.

are   sho'm in table 2. The forms of the equations parallel
previous research (Barro, l977a, 1978a).                   The contemporaneous and

two annual      lag values of unanticipated money growth DMR, as measured

before,2 have substantial ex1anatory value for the unemployment

rate    (table    2,   line 1) arid   real   GNP (line u.).3

        With   the DMR var      les    excluded     from the e'uaior., the


 contempOraneOus        and two annua- ag vaues of 1unperceived!t money

 growth,        or ', have nsiznifican: effects (lines 2, 3, 5, ).

A test that the set of variables, (c C1                     C_2), is   jointly

insignificant, given the inclusion of the set, (DMR , DMR                    ,   DMR   ),
yields   the statistic,              =   1.5   for the unemployment rate equation,

and F7 =       l.L   for output (5% critical values =         3.2).    For the case

of the c' variables, the corresponding F-values are l. and 2.5.

The exclusion of the set of DMR variables, given the inclusion of

the      or c variables, can be decisively rejected, with F-values

ranging from 6 to 2L.. The overall conclusions are, first, the measures

of unperceived money growth based on the data revisions add nothing

to the explanation of unemployment and output, and second, the measure

of unanticipated money growth (DMR) does not have explanatory power be-

cause of a proxying for the unperceived money growth measures.



Relation of Initial and Final Money Stock Data

      We have briefly considered the possibility that the initially

published money stock figures are not efficient predictions for the

?Ifinal?! data. An estimated equation over 1950-75 yields



(1) DMt -               = .002 + .23
                                           (tDMt_1
                            (.001) (.3)

            2                              A
           R    =    .02,   D—W =   1.3,   a    .005,




where      is the standard-error-of-estimate, standard errors of the

coefficient estimates are shown in parentheses, and DMt_i is the
                                       —8—




value for money growth from date t-2 to t-1, as perceived at date t

(table 1, col. 9). The measurement error for last year as perceived

currently, (tDMi -        _iDMt_i),   does not have significant explanatory

value for this year's error. Although the constant in eq. (1)

differs significantly from zero, the addition of a constant to the

c-values would not alter the above analysis of monetary effects on

economic activity. The variable, tDMt_l, and monetary variables

referring to earlier dates are also insignificant in equations with

(DM
      -   tDMt) as   the dependent :variable.

      The Durbin-Watson Statistic for equation (1), 1.3, indicates

significant positive serial correlation in the residuals-- in

particular, the final residual for date t-l, (DMi -

does have significant explanatory value for the current error,

(DMt -    DMt).   However, last year's residual, which depends on

DMi, is not observable at date t.



Conclusions
      The principal conclusion is that the discrepancy between initial

and final reports on money growth rates has no explanatory power

for unemployment and output. A possible interpretation is that

unanticipated money growth, as measured in earlier studies, has

strong explanatory power because it reflects unpredicted monetary

movements, rather than unperceived money growth, per se.1 This

interpretation    is disturbing   because the strongest   theoretical
                                   —9—




arguments for real monetary effects depend on confusions between

relative and absolute price changes, which require the underlying

money shocks to be temporarily unperceived. However, because of a

time lag in the initial monetary reports and    the   possibility that

nominal shifts are   not   effectively perceived as soon as they are

reported,   the present evidence cannot fully discriminate between

the unperceived versus unpredicted monetary-effects models.

           series on initial and final money stock reports begins

with 1947 because of the changes instituted in the October 1960

Federal Reserve Bulletin, which were not applied ex post to data

before 1947. "Final" money reports are not yet available for 1976-77,

but the main revisions for 1975 and earlier years have probably

already occurred.

has been updated to include 1977 data.

      3A minimum wage rate variable, used in the unemployment equation

in the 1977a paper (p. 107), has been omitted. This variable turns

out   to be insignificant for samples that exclude the l946-48 years.

      Another suggestion is that measurement errors in the money

stock have not had much significance for the business cycle.      There-


fore, improvements in reporting procedures, such as more frequent

sampling of non-member banks (or the information gains yielded by

an increase in Federal Reserve membership), would not have important

 implications for the behavior of unemployment and output.

Notes to Table 1:

    The basic data are three different monthly series of Ml, obtained

from the Federal Reserve Bulletin from January 1945 to March 1978.

The first series consists of first reports on Ml, made a month or

two after the date to which the figures correspond. The second is

the money stock as published 12 months after the first report. These

figures include, therefore, the revisions made to the Ml measures

during these one-year periods. The third series consists of the

"final" figures for Ml--that is, they include all the revisions

through March 1978.

     The annual averages of the three series appear in Table 1, where

tMt in column 1 is the first reported money stock, t+lMt in column 2

is the one reported one year later, and Mt in Column 3 is the final

measure of Ml.*

            log(M/M1) in column 4 measures the annual average

growth rate of the money stock as it could be computed during year t

with the data published up to that time. DMt    1og(M/M1) in
column 5 is the growth rate of M1 based on the "final" reports for



      Before October 1960 the monthly reports referred only to
the last Wednesday of each month. The annual averages in columns 1
and 2 for this period were approximated by averaging these figures.

      The other figures are: column 7p
                                               DM, the estimated value
of DM from an equation of the form in Barro (1978a, p.SSl)

updated to include 1977 data.

      Column 8, DMRt       DM. - DMt.

      Column 9, t+lDMt                             where t+iM_1 is the

annual average of Ml as reported with a two-year lag. A lagged

value of t+1DMt is used in equation (1) of the text.

      Column 10, the discrepancy between DM and tDMt with only

benchmark revisions to the money stock data considered.

      The revisions made to the reported money stock are of four

types: a) Benchmark adjustments, b) Revisions concerning "cash

items in the process of collection" and Federal Reserve float,

c) Changes in coverage and d) Updating of seasonal adjustment

factors. The last type is not considered in the present analysis

of annual average data.



Benchmark adjustments;

      Daily data on demand deposits and vault cash held at member

banks are reported to the Federal Reserve for the purpose of

computing required reserves. Since similar data are not available

for non-member banks, their deposits and vault cash are estimated

by the Federal Reserve based on call reports made twice a year,

or since 1973 four times a year, and from current data from member
                                 -3-


banks. These adjustments were made regularly during the entire

period of the sample. By their nature, these revisions affect only

the current growth rate without changing past levels of Ml.

    The largest benchmark revisions correspond to February 1973--

an increase in the reported money stock for 1972 by $1.6 billion,

or 0.7 per cent; and to February 1974--an increase in the reported

Ml figure for June-October 1973 by 2,5 billion, or 1.0 per cent.

A large downward adjustment was made in December 1970, which produced

a decrease in the reported Ml figure for June-October 1970 by about

$1 billion. However, this revision was obscured by an even larger

upward "cash items" adjustment. See below.



"Cash items in process of collection" and Federal Reserve float

adjustments;

     Until the clearing of checks is completed, the amounts

involved appear as demand deposits in the books of two banks at

the same time. Double-counting is avoided by subtracting these

items and the Federal Reserve float* from gross demand deposits.

However, the "cash items" reported by banks contain amounts that

should not be subtracted from demand deposits--for example, checks

credited to the account of a commercial bank. The large revisions


     *
      The Federal Reserve float is the credit that member banks
have received for checks forwarded to a Federal Reserve Bank for
collection, before the collection has been accomplished. The
float was first subtracted from the reported Ml figures with the
October 1960 revisions.
                                            -4-



made in October 1969 and December 1970 were aimed at correcting

downward biases in measurement of Ml because of excessive "cash

items" deductions. The-February 1973 revision involved a similar

bias in the Federal Reserve float.

     In the late 1960's the accelerating amount of Eurodollar

borrowings and repayments inflated the "cash items." Before

July 1969 "cash items" at foreign branches of U.S. banks were

subtracted from the domestic bank demand deposits for the

purposes of determining reserves and money stocks.* The October

1969 revision corrects this bias in the reported money stock.

Since these "cash items" were rapidly increasing, the correction

implied that Ml was growing in 1968 and 1969 much faster than had

been reported previously.

     The similar revision of December 1970 involved the clearing

of checks of some increasingly active financial corporations.**

This revision implied an even faster reported growth rate of Ml for

1969 and a higher rate for 1970 than reported initially. This change

was partially offset by the large downward benchmark adjustment in

1970, as mentioned above.



      These "cash items" corresponded mainly to repayments of
Eurodollar borrowings made by U.S. banks to their own foreign
branches. See the    Federal Reserve Bulletin, October 1969 and
December 1970.

Changes in coverage:

     Deposits held by foreign and mutual savings banks were added

to the Ml measure in the October 1960 revision. In August 1962

foreign balances held at Federal Reserve banks, including those due

to foreign governments, central banks and international institutions

were added to the Ml measure. (The appropriateness of these changes

can be debated, but the aiounts involved are small). In December

1970, deposits held in U.S. agencies of foreign banks and in

internationally-oriented agencies of U.S. banks were added to Ml.

     These extensions of coverage did not materially affect the

measured growth rates of M1.
