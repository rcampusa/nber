                                            ABSTRACT

Prior literature has documented a positive association between income and cognitive function at older
ages, however, the extent to which this association represents causal effects is unknown. In this study,
we use an exogenous change in Social Security income due to amendments to the Social Security Act
in the 1970s to identify the causal impact of Social Security income on cognitive function of elderly
individuals. We find that higher benefits led to significant improvements in cognitive function and
that these improvements in cognition were clinically meaningful. Our results suggest that interventions
even at advanced ages can slow the rate of decline in cognitive function.

I. INTRODUCTION

       Given population aging, there is considerable interest in understanding the determinants

of cognitive function at older ages and in identifying policies that could potentially prevent or

delay cognitive impairment. While some cognitive decline is normal with aging, more severe

declines often lead to the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or dementia. Alzheimer’s disease

(AD) is a progressive brain condition that affects memory, language and reasoning, and can

seriously impair an individual’s ability to carry out daily activities. In addition, AD and related

dementias (ADRD) impose a significant financial burden on patients, caregivers and public

programs such as Medicare and Medicaid (Ayyagari, Salm, and Sloan 2007; Langa et al. 2001;

Taylor et al. 2001; Hurd et al. 2013). Aggregate health care payments for persons with AD,

estimated to be $226 billion in 2015, are expected to grow over the next few years due to the

aging of the baby boom generation (Alzheimer's Association Report 2015).

       Although the causes of ADRD are not well understood, there is growing evidence that

modifiable factors, such as education (Maurer 2010; Banks and Mazzonna 2012), retirement age

(Rohwedder and Willis 2010; Bonsang, Adam, and Perelman 2012) and childhood environment

(Case and Paxson 2009), influence the risk of cognitive impairment and ADRD. Building upon

this literature, in this study, we evaluate the impact of income on cognitive function at older

ages. In particular, we focus on Social Security income, which can be modified by amendments

to the Social Security Act. Indeed, given concerns about the financial sustainability of the Social

Security program, several changes are being considered by policymakers, including increasing

minimum benefits for low-wage workers and using the chained CPI to index benefits, which

would lower annual increases for recipients. Furthermore, the focus on Social Security income



                                                  3
provides important information on the extent to which interventions at advanced ages can

prevent cognitive impairment.

       Although a large literature has evaluated the impact of income on a wide range of health

outcomes (Lindahl 2005; Frijters, Haisken-DeNew, and Shields 2005; Evans and Moore 2011),

in general there is not a consensus on the causal impact of income on health (Smith 1999).

Further, to the best of our knowledge, no prior study has evaluated the causal impact of income

on cognition at older ages in the U.S. The only evidence on causal effects comes from a study

based in Mexico that showed that an income supplement program targeted towards the poor

elderly led to improvements in measures of episodic memory (Aguila et al., 2015). However,

given the considerable differences between the two countries, it is not clear that these effects

would generalize to the U.S. Income may affect cognition via several pathways, including lower

financial strain or better access to health care, which have been shown to be positively related to

cognition. Higher income reduces financial strain, resulting in lower stress and fewer depressive

symptoms (e.g. Mendes de Leon, Rapp, and Kasl (1994)). Several studies have documented the

detrimental effects of stress on cognitive functioning at older ages (Andel et al. 2012; Johansson

et al. 2010) and depressive symptoms are strongly correlated with cognitive decline (van den

Kommer et al. 2013). Both chronic stress and depression are associated with elevated levels of

corticosteroids, which may lead to hippocampal changes that affect memory and

neurodegenerative processes (Korczyn and Halperin 2009).

       Individuals with greater income typically have more access to health care. Even among

Medicare beneficiaries, income is correlated with more coverage through the purchase of

supplemental Medigap coverage (Ettner 1997; Fang, Keane, and Silverman 2008). Greater

access to health care services can affect neurocognitive health directly by resulting in earlier



                                                  4
detection of mild cognitive impairment (Valcour et al. 2000), thereby enabling treatment that

may delay progression to AD (Petersen et al. 2005). Greater access may also affect cognition

indirectly via better management of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and diabetes,

which are associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline (Daviglus et al. 2010).

       On the other hand, higher income may lead to earlier retirement, which is negatively

related to cognition. French (2005) and van der Klaauw and Wolpin (2008) find that higher

Social Security income reduces labor supply and leads to early retirement. Snyder and Evans

(2006) document that reductions in Social Security benefit levels led to increases in labor force

participation for persons older than 65 years. There is strong evidence that being engaged in

work is protective of cognitive impairment and that early retirement leads to faster declines in

cognition (Rohwedder and Willis 2010; Bonsang, Adam, and Perelman 2012; Mazzonna and

Peracchi 2012). Therefore, early retirement or reduced work may offset the other beneficial

pathways through which higher income affects cognition. Thus, the net effect of income on

cognition is theoretically ambiguous.

       Prior research on the relationship between income and cognitive function finds that

higher income is associated with better cognitive function (Cagney and Lauderdale 2002; Lee et

al. 2010; Lee et al. 2006); however, any observed association may represent spurious correlation

due to unmeasured confounders that are correlated with both income and cognition. For example,

persons employed in complex jobs typically earn higher wages and at the same time job

complexity is associated with better cognition (Finkel et al. 2009). In addition, childhood

environment has been shown to impact both labor market earnings (Almond and Currie 2011)

and old-age cognition (Case and Paxson 2009).




                                                 5
        This project examines the relationship between income and cognition by determining

whether changes in income causally impact cognitive functioning and by uncovering any

heterogeneity in this relationship. Specifically, we assess the impact of exogenous changes to

Social Security income due to amendments to the Social Security Act in 1972 and 1977,

commonly referred to as the “Social Security Notch”. Prior to 1972, Social Security payments

were not indexed for inflation and instead benefits had been periodically increased by Congress.

In 1972, the Social Security Act was amended to provide an annual automatic cost-of-living

adjustment for benefits. However, the formula used to index benefits was flawed leading to a

faster increase in benefits relative to inflation (referred to as “double indexation”), so that

workers born after 1910 received an unintended windfall gain. This error was corrected by

Congress in 1977 leading to a reduction in benefits for those born in 1917 or later. To avoid

abrupt changes for those close to retirement, a five-year transition period was implemented

during which benefits were gradually reduced based on a special transition formula. For persons

born in 1922 or later, benefits are calculated using the new formula implemented in 1977. These

changes resulted in different cohorts receiving different benefits for the same work history.

Moreover, due to grandfathering provisions, these policy changes resulted in permanent changes

in the Social Security benefits received by these cohorts.3 Previous research has examined the

benefits notch to determine the impact of Social Security income on prescription drug use

(Moran and Simon 2006), weight (Cawley, Moran, and Simon 2010), mental health (Golberstein

2015), mortality (Snyder and Evans 2006), labor supply (Krueger and Pischke 1992), living

arrangements (Engelhardt, Gruber, and Perry 2005) and utilization of long term care services

(Goda, Golberstein, and Grabowski 2011).

        Using data from the Study of Assets and Health Dynamics among the Oldest Old

(AHEAD), we compare the cognitive outcomes of persons in nearby cohorts with differing

Social Security income due to the 1977 amendments. Our estimates suggest that increases in

income affect multiple dimensions of cognition. Specifically, a thousand dollar permanent

increase in annual Social Security income leads to a 2.2% improvement in working memory,

measured by the serial 7 score, and a 1.1% improvement in knowledge, language and orientation,

measured by the mental status score. There is also a 1.4% improvement in overall cognition,

measured by the total cognition score; however this estimate is only significant at the 10% level.

Overall, this paper provides the first evidence from the U.S. on the causal impact of income,

particularly Social Security income, on cognition among the elderly.



II. METHODS

        We first estimate the association between Social Security income and cognition using

ordinary least squares (OLS):



                                                                              (Equation 1)



where                represents a measure of cognition, as described below, for individual in

household . The key explanatory variable in equation (1) is Social Security income at the

household level (‘            ’). X represents a vector of individual and household

characteristics,  is a stochastic error term, and  represents the parameters to be estimated.

        As mentioned above, a key concern with evaluating the relationship between income and

cognition is that unobserved factors may be correlated with both Social Security income and


                                                  7
cognitive function leading to a spurious correlation between the two variables. Further, causality

may run in the reverse direction with health influencing income, although this is less likely in the

case of Social Security income. Thus, the estimate     from equation (1) may not identify the

causal impact of Social Security income. To address the endogeneity of income, we estimate an

instrumental variable (IV) model using the following specification:



                                                                             (Equation 2)

                                                                             (Equation 3)



The instrumental variable (          is a binary indicator that takes the value one for households

whose primary beneficiary was born during 1915-1917 and zero for households whose primary

beneficiary was born in any other year between 1901 and 1930.                 represents predicted

Social Security income obtained from the first stage (equation 2).

       The IV model represented by equations (2) and (3) identifies the causal impact of Social

Security income on health under two key assumptions. The first assumption is that the

instrument is a strong predictor of Social Security income. Prior studies have documented that

the birth years 1915-17 represent the peak of the benefits notch and the largest deviation of

Social Security income from the trend throughout the period between 1901 and 1930. Therefore,

a binary variable defining the 1915-17 cohorts provides the strongest instrument and enables the

interpretation of the impact of an increase in Social Security income (Goda, Golberstein, and

Grabowski 2011; Cawley, Moran, and Simon 2010; Moran and Simon 2006). We also assess the

strength of the instrument in our sample based on the first stage Kleibergen-Paap rk Wald F-

statistic (Staiger and Stock 1997; Stock and Yogo 2005).


                                                 8
       The second key assumption is that the instrument should not be correlated with cognitive

health except via its effect on income (exclusion restriction). In the case of our application, it is

plausible that, conditional on age, being born during 1915 to 1917 should not be correlated with

cognition relative to other adjacent cohorts except due to the notch related differences in Social

Security benefits. Although this assumption is not testable, we provide evidence consistent with

this assumption by showing that Social Security income, as affected by being born during 1915

to 1917, is conditionally uncorrelated with other individual characteristics that are associated

with income but determined prior to the receipt of Social Security payments, specifically, height

and education. All regressions cluster the standard errors at the year of birth level to account for

correlations within birth cohorts.

       The IV model described above identifies the impact of the Social Security income at the

conditional mean. However, it is plausible that income has heterogeneous effects at different

parts of the distribution of cognition. For example, the largest impact of additional Social

Security income may accrue to individuals in the upper tail of the conditional distribution of

cognition since these individuals are more efficiently able to translate additional resources into

improvements in health. Alternatively, the largest impact of additional Social Security income

may accrue to individuals in the lower tail of the conditional distribution of cognition. Therefore,

to examine the heterogeneity of the impact of Social Security income, we estimate instrumental

variable quantile regression (IVQR) (Chernozhukov and Hansen 2006, Kwak 2010). We

estimate this regression for a continuous measure of cognition, specifically, the total cognition

score described below. To examine heterogeneity throughout the conditional distribution, we

focus on the 0.10, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 0.90 quantiles.




                                                   9
III. DATA

       To determine the influence of Social Security income on cognition using the estimation

strategy described above, it is necessary to combine measures of cognition with Social Security

income for the cohorts of individuals affected by the Social Security benefits notch and of

surrounding cohorts. Thus, we use data from the Study of Assets and Health Dynamics among

the Oldest Old (AHEAD), which is a longitudinal survey of persons born before 1924 and their

spouses, regardless of age. Respondents were first interviewed in 1993 and then re-interviewed

in 1995. Initially conducted as a separate study, the AHEAD was merged with the Health and

Retirement Study (HRS) in 1998.

       The AHEAD includes detailed measures that are designed to capture various dimensions

of cognition: knowledge, reasoning, orientation, calculation, and language. Specifically, the

measures that we use are (1) serial 7, (2) word recall, (3) mental status, and (4) total cognition

score. The AHEAD measures were derived from well-validated scales such as the Mini-Mental

State Examination and the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status and were adapted so that

they could be administered in a large population study (Herzog and Wallace 1997). They have

been shown to have satisfactory psychometric properties and construct validity (Herzog and

Wallace 1997).

       Serial 7 measures working memory and is based on a task in which respondents are asked

to subtract 7 from 100 and to continue subtracting 7 from each subsequent number for a total of

five times. The score, ranging from 0 to 5, is the count of correct subtractions across the five

trials, with each subtraction being assessed independently.

       Word recall, a measure of episodic memory, is based on a list of 10 nouns read to the

respondent who is then asked to recall as many words as possible in any order (immediate word



                                                 10
recall). After approximately 5 minutes, during which time respondents are asked other survey

questions, they are asked to repeat the task (delayed word recall). The score is the count of the

number of words that were correctly recalled from both times and ranges from 0 to 20.

       Mental status is based on various tests designed to measure knowledge, language and

orientation, and sums the scores for serial 7, backwards counting from 20, object naming, date

naming and president/vice-president naming. Respondents are asked to count backwards as

quickly as possible beginning with the number 20. Answers are coded 0 for incorrect, 1 for

correct on the second try and 2 for correct on the first try. In addition, respondents are asked to

report the month, day, year and day of the week during their interview, and to name the object

they would “usually use to cut paper” and “the kind of prickly plant that grows in the desert”.

Each answer is coded 1 for a correct response and 0 for an incorrect one. New-interviewees and

re-interviewees aged 65 years or older are also asked to name the current President and Vice

President of the United States. Answers are coded 1 for getting each last name right and 0

otherwise. The mental status score ranges from 0 to 15, with a higher value representing better

cognition.

       Total Cognition Score, an overall measure of cognition, sums the mental status and word

recall scores, and imputes values for missing observations (Fisher et al. 2012; Ofstedal, Fisher,

and Herzog 2005). This measure ranges from 0 to 35, with a higher value representing better

cognition.

       While the continuous measures of cognition are informative, changes in the rate of

dementia and related clinical outcomes are of particular interest. Therefore, we follow Crimmins

et al. (2011) and Hsu and Willis (2013) in classifying individuals as normal, cognitively impaired

but not demented (CIND), or demented. This classification is based on a 27 point score



                                                 11
composed of the word recall, serial 7, and backwards counting tests. The 27-point score was

developed by Langa, Kabeto, and Weir (2010) to identify dementia and CIND using data from

the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).4 Scores between 12 and 27 are classified as normal,

between 7 and 11 as CIND, and between 0 and 6 as demented. In addition, we follow Herzog

and Wallace (1997) in classifying individuals as cognitively impaired if they score 8 or less on

the total cognition score.

        An advantage of using the Herzog-Wallace classification is that it allows us to account

for proxy respondents. The cognitive tests in the AHEAD are only administered to self-

respondents. Proxy respondents are interviewed when the primary respondent is not available for

any reason. Poor health, in particular poor cognitive health, may be a reason for the

unavailability of the main respondent. This implies that persons with severe cognitive

impairment will likely be underrepresented in our sample, potentially leading to biased estimates

if we exclude proxies. However, proxies report on seven symptoms of the main respondent that

can be used to assess cognitive impairment (Jorm 1994; Jorm, Scott, and Jacomb 1989). These

seven symptoms, referred to as the Jorm scale, include ratings (excellent to poor) of the sample

person’s memory, judgment, and organization ability, and reports of whether the sample person

gets lost in familiar environments, wanders off and does not return, can be left alone for an hour

or so, or hallucinates. A rating of poor memory, judgment or organization is categorized as a

Jorm symptom as is an indication that the respondent gets lost, wanders off, hallucinates or

cannot be left alone. Persons with two or more Jorm symptoms are classified as cognitively

4
 HRS, the sister survey of the AHEAD, began in 1992 and was merged with the AHEAD in 1998. The HRS
contains similar measures of cognitive function as the ones we use in this study. Crimmins et al. (2011) compare the
normal, CIND, and demented classifications in the HRS data to diagnostic information from the Aging,
Demographics and Memory Study (ADAMS). ADAMS surveyed a random subsample of the HRS sample and
performed detailed neuropsychological and clinical assessment of cognitive function. The authors find that this
measure correctly predicts 74% of the diagnoses from the ADAMS exams. About 52.18% of persons classified as
demented in ADAMS are correctly classified as demented in HRS. However, 12.81% of CIND in ADAMS are
classified as demented in HRS and 1.44% of Normal are classified as demented in HRS.

                                                        12
impaired.5 We use a binary indicator for cognitive impairment that is one if a person scores less

than or equal to 8 on the total cognition score or if a proxy reports two or more Jorm symptoms

for that person. The indicator is zero if the individual scores more than 8 on the total cognition

score or if the proxy reports fewer than 2 symptoms.

         The key explanatory variable is self-reported household income from Social Security

retirement, spouse or widow benefits. This variable is measured in 1993 dollars. In addition, all

regressions include a basic set of covariates – own age and gender, the primary beneficiary’s age,

race and ethnicity, census region of residence, a binary indicator for residing in an MSA and

indicators for the type of household – male head- married or male head – single (female head –

never married forms the reference category).

         The instrument is a binary variable indicating whether an individual received greater

Social Security benefits due to the 1972 and 1977 amendments to the Social Security Act. As

described above, this variable is defined as one for households whose primary beneficiary was

born during 1915-1917 and zero for households whose primary beneficiary was born in any other

year. To construct this instrument, we first determine the primary Social Security beneficiary for

each household, following the methodology used by prior studies on the Social Security notch

(Goda, Golberstein, and Grabowski 2011; Moran and Simon 2006; Cawley, Moran, and Simon

2010). The instrumental variable is then created based on the primary beneficiary’s year of birth.

Since the majority of married women in this population were affected by the 1977 amendments

via their husband’s earnings (Snyder and Evans 2006), the year of birth of the male member is

used to create the instrument in the case of two member households. For households with no

male members in which the respondent is a never-married female, we use her year of birth.

5
 A similar approach has also been used for the classification developed by Langa, Kabeto and Weir (2010).
However, that approach is based on interviewer assessment of cognitive limitations, which is not available in the
AHEAD survey.

                                                         13
         Prior research using the Social Security notch assumes that the former or deceased spouse

is the primary Social Security beneficiary in households with no male members in which the

female respondent is widowed or divorced and imputes the female member’s year of birth.

Engelhardt, Gruber, and Perry (2005) estimate that the median difference in spousal ages for this

population is three years. Thus, the primary beneficiary’s birth year for widowed or divorced

females is commonly calculated by subtracting three years from the female member’s year of

birth (e.g., Moran and Simon 2006). However, recent work by Stephens and Unayama (2015)

shows that IV estimates of the impact of Social Security income using the notch are biased

upwards by 20 to 30 percent using Current Population Survey data because age is imputed. As a

result, in contrast to the previous literature, we exclude widowed and divorced females from our

main analysis sample to minimize bias from imputed data.6

         Following previous studies on the Social Security benefits notch (Krueger and Pischke

1992; Moran and Simon 2006; Cawley, Moran, and Simon 2010; Goda, Golberstein, and

Grabowski 2011), we restrict our analysis to households whose primary Social Security

beneficiary was born between 1901 and 1930. In addition to the birth year restrictions and the

exclusion of widowed and divorced females, we exclude households that report a Social Security

income of less than $100 per month and observations with missing or incomplete data on any

analysis variable. Using the 1993 wave, these restrictions yield an analysis sample of 4139




6
  Consistent with the conclusions of Stephens and Unayama (2015), we find that the IV estimates are larger when
we include widowed and divorced females and impute the primary beneficiary’s birth year. For example, the IV
estimate for total cognition score is 0.783 with a standard error of 0.232 and a sample size of 6099 when we
construct the instrument for widowed and divorced females as her year of birth minus three. Alternatively, we
predict the age difference of spouses based on birth year, race/ethnicity, education, and nationality for this sample as
1.27 years. When we construct the instrument for widowed and divorced females as her year of birth minus 1.27,
the IV estimate for total cognition score is 0.739 with a standard error of 0.391 and a sample size of 6099. Overall,
we conclude that excluding widowed and divorced females with imputed values of the primary beneficiary’s birth
year minimizes bias in the IV estimates.

between 1915 and 1917.

       Figure 1 presents the histograms for each outcome variable. There is considerable

variation in each measure of cognition. In the case of serial 7, about 38% of the sample obtains a

perfect score while about 7% gets every answer wrong. On the word recall test, the majority of

individuals (75%) get at least 50% of the answers wrong. About 26% of the sample obtains a

perfect score on the mental status measure. The distribution of the total cognition score is slightly

left skewed, with about 27% of the sample obtaining a score of 17 or lower. Figure 2 presents the

histogram for the 27-point score used to classify individuals as normal, CIND or demented. The

majority (66%) of the sample are in the normal range of cognitive function. About 25% are

cognitively impaired but not demented and about 9% are demented.

       Table 1 presents summary statistics for the analysis sample of the cognition measures,

Social Security income, and covariates that are used in the methodology described above. The

average annual Social Security income for the sample is over $12 thousand, which is about 42%

of total household income, and the average age of respondents is 75 years old. Table 1 also

presents summary statistics separately for households whose primary Social Security beneficiary

was born during 1915-1917 and the other comparison cohorts. Social Security income is, on

average, about $1,200 higher in 1993 dollars for the 1915-1917 cohort compared to the other

birth cohorts. Additionally, individuals affected by the Social Security notch have better

cognitive function across all measures, even though these respondents are older.




IV. RESULTS



                                                 15
       Table 2 displays the estimates of the correlation between Social Security income and

cognitive function using OLS models. Across all four measures of cognition there is a strong

positive relationship between income and cognition. A $1000 increase in annual income is

associated with a 0.04 higher serial 7 score (a 1.04% increase relative to the sample mean), 0.06

higher word recall (0.8%), a 0.07 higher mental status score (0.5%), and a 0.13 higher total

cognition score (0.6%). As discussed above, these estimates do not represent causal effects due

to unobserved factors and reverse causality.

       In Table 3, we present results from the IV models that account for the endogeneity of

Social Security income. Column (1) presents the first stage equation results, while columns (2)

through (5) present the second stage results for each of the cognition measures. The first stage

results show that the IV is strongly correlated with Social Security income and the first stage F-

statistic is 16.19. Annual Social Security income (in 1993 dollars) is $1,160 higher for

individuals born between 1915 and 1917 compared to other cohorts, which is similar to the

unconditional difference in mean values for these groups of cohorts shown in Table 1. After

accounting for the endogeneity of income, we find a statistically significant, positive impact on

the serial 7 and mental status measures. Relative to the sample mean, there is a 2.2% increase in

the serial 7 score, and 1.1% increase in the mental status score. We also find a 2% increase in the

word recall score and a 1.4% increase in the total cognition score. The estimate for the total

cognition score is statistically significant at the 10% level and the coefficient for the word recall

score is imprecisely estimated. The IV models identify a larger effect than the OLS models,

which may be due to attrition bias in the OLS estimates from measurement error in self-reported

Social Security income. It is also plausible that unobserved factors are correlated with Social

Security income and cognition in ways that bias OLS estimates downwards. For example, prior



                                                 16
studies have shown that Social Security benefits crowd out private savings (Feldstein 1974;

Feldstein and Pellechio 1979; Attanasio and Brugiavini 2003), leading to a negative correlation

between Social Security income and wealth, which is omitted from the OLS model. To the extent

that wealth is positively correlated with cognition this would lead to a downward bias of the OLS

estimates.

        Next, we assess the extent to which the identified improvements in cognitive function

represent clinically meaningful changes. In Table 4, we present results from IV models using

normal, CIND and demented cognitive function as the dependent variables. We find a 1.4

percentage point increase in the proportion of individuals exhibiting normal cognitive function

and a 0.5 percentage point increase in the proportion of individuals classified as CIND, however,

these estimates are not statistically significant. We also find a statistically significant decline in

the rates of demented individuals by 1.9 percentage points. Relative to the sample mean, this

represents a 21% drop in the rates of demented individuals. In Table 5, we present results from

the IV models using the Herzog-Wallace indicator for cognitive impairment as the dependent

variable. The first two columns present results for the main sample excluding proxy respondents.

The analysis presented in the last two columns includes 202 proxy respondents. In both samples,

we find a significant decrease in the number of individuals that are cognitively impaired of

approximately 1 percentage point. Thus, higher Social Security benefits due to the notch changes

resulted in clinically relevant improvements in cognitive function.

        In Table 6, we explore heterogeneous effects by educational attainment. Specifically, we

estimate separate regressions for households whose primary beneficiary has less than a high

school education and for households whose primary beneficiary has a high school degree or

higher education. Heterogeneity by education is important for two reasons. First, the 1977



                                                  17
amendments also increased the covered earnings maximum used to calculate the “average

indexed monthly earnings” (AIME) which summarizes up to 35 years of a worker’s indexed

earnings and is used to determine benefits. As a result of this change, the notch had a larger

effect on persons with less than a high school education (Goda, Golberstein, and Grabowski

2011). As shown in Table 6, consistent with prior literature, we find that the instrument is

stronger for low education households. Among individuals with less than a high school degree,

individuals born between 1915 and 1917 received $1,734 more in Social Security income

annually (in 1993 dollars) than individuals born in other cohorts. For individuals with a high

school degree and more education, the instrument is less predictive of Social Security income.

Secondly, education has been shown to improve cognitive function (Banks and Mazzonna 2012)

and it is plausible that Social Security benefits differentially affect low versus high education

households. Although the estimates are imprecise when we stratify the sample by education, for

individuals with less than a high school degree, except for word recall, the results presented in

Table 6 consistently show that Social Security income improves cognition. A $1000 increase in

Social Security income increases mental status by 0.16 points and this estimate is statistically

significant at the 10% level. Further, although imprecise, the results suggest that the impact of

income on cognition does vary by education. For serial 7 and mental status, we find a larger

impact of Social Security income for households whose primary beneficiary has less than a high

school degree. We also find a larger decline in the rate of demented and the rate of cognitive

impairment for low education households. For households whose primary beneficiary is a high

school graduate, the effect of Social Security income is larger than the effect for low education

households in the case of word recall and total cognition.




                                                 18
        Table 7 presents results from the IVQR models for the total cognition score. The point

estimate is constant for the bottom half of the conditional cognition distribution, but increases at

higher quantiles, which suggests that relative differences in cognition increase sharply with

income. At the 10th quantile, a $1000 increase in Social Security income leads to a 0.2 unit

increase in the total cognition score, while at the 90th quantile a similar amount of income results

in a 1.3 increase in the total cognition score. Only the estimate at the 90th quantile is statistically

significant at the 5% level. These results suggest that individuals with better cognition benefit

more from increases in Social Security income.

        One concern with our identification strategy is that it relies on cohort differences in

income and there may be other unobserved factors that correlate with the notch changes and

cognition. To assess the potential for such biases in our estimates, we perform several robustness

checks (Table 8). First, we estimate the IV models excluding individuals who were born in 1918

or 1919 (Column 1). These individuals were exposed to the 1918 influenza pandemic, which has

been shown to affect long-term outcomes for these cohorts (Almond 2006). By excluding these

cohorts, we are able to assess the extent to which the better cognitive function of the 1915-1917

cohorts is driven by the changes due to the notch and not due to adverse consequences of the

influenza pandemic. Overall, our results are robust to excluding the 1918 and 1919 cohorts and,

in fact, are more precisely estimated, which supports our inference that the main results in Table

3 can be attributed to income changes due to the Social Security notch. We further assess the

sensitivity of our results to cohort differences by restricting the sample to a progressively smaller

range of birth years. Column 2 restricts the sample to households whose primary beneficiary was




                                                  19
born between 1902 and 1928, column 3 to households born between 1903 and 1927 and so on.7

Overall, the results are robust to smaller ranges of birth years.

           Finally, we assess the impact of the notch related changes on height and educational

attainment (Table 9). These regressions serve as placebo or falsification tests and allow us to

evaluate whether the IV estimates could be attributable to unobserved cohort differences that are

correlated with the notch changes. Both height and education are well known to differ by cohort

and they are also strongly correlated with income and cognition (Case and Paxson 2008; Banks

and Mazzonna 2012). However, they should not be affected by the 1977 amendments since those

changes only impacted retirement income. Consistent with this notion, we do not find any

significant effect of the Social Security notch on height or education. Overall, these results

suggest that the identified impact of income on cognition cannot be attributed to cohort

differences.



V. CONCLUSION

           In this paper, we examine the relationship between income and cognition. We focus on

Social Security income, which is an important source of income for the elderly and is modifiable

through public policy. Our study contributes to the literature by providing the first evidence on

the causal impact of Social Security income in the U.S. on cognition using exogenous variation

in Social Security benefits due to the Social Security notch. We find robust evidence that higher

Social Security income improves multiple dimensions of cognitive function among the elderly.

Specifically, a thousand dollar permanent increase in annual Social Security income leads to a

2.2% improvement in working memory, a 1.1% improvement in knowledge, language and

orientation, and a 1.4% improvement in overall cognition. Further, these changes represent

    Using a narrower range of birth years than 1905-1925 resulted in a singular X matrix.

                                                           20
clinically meaningful improvements in cognitive function. A thousand dollar permanent increase

in annual Social Security leads to a 1.9 percentage point reduction in the likelihood of being

classified as demented and a 1 percentage point decline in the likelihood of being classified as

cognitively impaired.

       Our findings have important implications for aging populations. Much of the evidence on

the determinants of cognitive function has focused on factors that cannot be easily modified (e.g.

genes) or on early life interventions (e.g. education). In contrast, our focus on Social Security

income suggests that interventions even late in life can significantly improve cognition. An

important piece of evidence in support of late-life interventions comes from the literature on the

link between retirement and cognition. Studies by Rohwedder and Willis (2010) and Bonsang,

Adam and Perelman (2012) have shown that retirement leads to declines in cognitive function.

Thus, our results suggest that permanent increases in income during retirement can partially

offset the decline in cognition due to retirement.

       The findings of our study also have important implications for public policy. As

discussed above, several proposals aiming to improve the financial sustainability of the Social

Security program are under consideration by U.S. policymakers. These proposals range from

reducing benefits to future recipients (e.g. using the chained CPI to index benefits) to increasing

benefits for certain targeted groups (e.g. raising minimum Social Security benefits). Our findings

suggest that increases in benefits could lead to significant improvements in neurocognitive

health. In addition to the direct impact on population health, increases in Social Security benefits

could potentially be offset by reduced health care expenditures by the Medicaid or Medicare

program, since cognitive impairments are often associated with significant health care spending.

During a period of renewed policy discussion around changes to entitlement programs for the



                                                 21
elderly, it is important to understand whether changes to Social Security might influence the

health and well-being of the elderly.

Annual Social Security income is measured in 1000s in 1993 dollars. Mean cognition represents
the means for observations between 0 and the 10th percentile, above the 10th and up to the 25th
percentile, above the 25th and up to the 50th percentile, above the 50th and up to the 75th
percentile, and above the 75th and up to the 90th percentile. Since the 50th and 75th quantile
regressions did not converge, these regressions are estimated at the 50.5th and 74.5th quantile.
