Comprehensive versus Selective Schooling in England in Wales: What Do We Know?

                                            ABSTRACT

British secondary schools moved from a system of extensive and early selection and tracking in
secondary schools to one with comprehensive schools during the 1960s and 70s. Before the reform,
students would take an exam at age eleven, which determined whether they would attend an
academically oriented grammar school or a lower level secondary school. The reform proceeded at
an uneven pace in different areas, so that both secondary school systems coexist during the 1960s
and 70s. The British transition therefore provides an excellent laboratory for the study of the impact
of a comprehensive versus a selective school system on student achievement. Previous studies
analyzing this transition have typically used a value-added methodology: they compare outcomes
for students passing through either type of school controlling for achievement levels at the time of
entering secondary education. While this seems like a reasonable research design, we demonstrate
that it is unlikely to successfully eliminate selection effects in who attends what type of school. Very
similar results are obtained by looking at the effect of secondary school environment on achievement
at age 11 and controlling for age 7 achievement. Since children only enter secondary school at age
11, these effects are likely due to selection bias. Careful choice of treatment and control areas, and
using political control of the county as an instrument for early implementation of the comprehensive
regime do not solve this problem.

Introduction

National school systems differ widely in the amount of ability tracking of students they provide
in secondary school. Some systems (e.g. the US) are based on comprehensive schools, where
students of all abilities attend the same school, although there is typically some tracking within
schools. Other systems (e.g. Germany) channel students at an early age into different types of
schools based on academic ability. British schools moved from a system of extensive tracking to
one with comprehensive schools in the 1960s and 70s. The British experience is interesting,
because it involved a major and well defined change in terms of the ability grouping of
secondary school students. Hence, it offers potentially very promising research designs in order
to assess the impact of the secondary school regime on student achievement. It is unsurprising
that numerous studies in the education and economics of education literatures analyze the British
experience.

In the traditional British school system, students were tracked into either an academically
selective grammar school at age 11, or they would attend a secondary modern school, which was
academically less demanding. Starting in the 1950s, there was dissatisfaction with selection at
the local level, and some local authorities began to experiment with comprehensive schools. In
1965, the central government asked the Local Education Authorities (LEAs) to draw up plans to
switch to a comprehensive system. The implementation proceeded slowly, with faster growing,
more Labour leaning LEAs moving to comprehensive schools more quickly, while those without
expanding numbers of students, and more Conservative leaning Authorities implemented the
change more slowly. In fact, there are still a number of LEAs to date which provide grammar
schools as an option.

Much of the research on comprehensive education in Britain uses the National Child
Development Study (NCDS), a panel which tracks members of the 1958 birth cohort. The
sample members entered secondary school in 1969, at a time when some LEAs in Britain had
started to provide comprehensive schools already, while others continued to offer the traditional
selective schools. Hence, the comparisons using the NCDS are essentially cross-sectional.
While Kerckhoff et al. (1996) claim that comprehensive areas differ little from selective areas,
we find that comprehensive areas are systematically poorer, and have students with lower
previous achievement. A raw comparison of students attending comprehensive and selective


                                                 1
schools is therefore not possible. Most previous studies rely on some form of a value added
specification, where student performance at age 16 is a function of student performance at age
11, the secondary school environment, and possibly other control variables.

This seems an entirely reasonably research design, particularly since the NCDS offers a large set
of controls on student ability and family background. We demonstrate in this paper that this
methodology is nevertheless unlikely to be completely successful in removing the selection bias
between comprehensive and selective school students. The NCDS provides test scores at ages 7,
11, and 16. It is therefore possible to run an analogous specification for student performance at
age 11 on student performance at age 7, and the secondary school environment. Since students
at age 11 have not started attending secondary school yet, the secondary school environment
should have no influence on age 11 outcomes if the specification successfully removes the
selection bias. This exercise is therefore a falsification test for the value added specification.

OLS value added specifications tend to lead to a small negative average effect of comprehensive
schooling compared to selective schooling in our sample. We demonstrate that effects of a
similar size or larger are obtained when using age 11 test scores as outcomes. This suggests that
the methodology is unable to remove the selection bias between students attending different
schools. A more interesting finding of the previous literature (particularly Kerkhoff et al., 1996)
may be that comprehensive schools tend to be equalizing, in that they lower the performance of
the most able students, and raise the performance of the least able. We show that this result is
also likely due to selection bias.

We also demonstrate that various approaches to improve on the methodology used previously are
not more successful. Most studies on this question compare students attending comprehensive
and selective schools. Since many LEAs were in the middle of comprehensive reorganization in
the 1970s, these schools often coexisted within the same LEA. A better use of the policy
variation, possibly removing some of the selection, is the comparison of LEAs which are either
purely comprehensive or purely selective in 1969, when the NCDS cohort enters secondary
school. We show that this does not help in removing the selection bias. Another approach is the
use of instrumental variables (IV) for comprehensive reorganization (see, for example, Galinda-
Rueda and Vignoles, 2004). Political control of the county is a good predictor of early



                                                  2
reorganization, and conditional on county socio demographic characteristics is a plausible
instrument. We show that the IV strategy similarly fails.

At a theoretical level, there are good arguments for selection as well as for comprehensive
education. The main argument for selection or tracking is presumably that it is much easier to
teach lower variance classes. Since teachers can focus on the ability level of particular groups of
students, students of all ability levels might benefit from selection. One argument against
selection is that there might be positive peer effects from the most able students. By tracking
these students into separate classrooms, the most able students may benefit from being with each
other. However, the lower ability ranges loose from not having this peer group around. We
know very little about the different impact of peer group effects on different types of students
empirically, so it is difficult to judge a priori whether this leads to lower or higher average
performance in a selective system.

Another argument, particularly against early selection as in post-war Britain, is that eventual
ability levels are difficult to predict at an age as early as 10 or 11. Moreover, secondary selection
is based on a single exam, clearly a noisy mechanism. This may result in some kids ending up in
the wrong track. This suggests that particularly middle ability kids may loose in the British style
selective system. Since there are arguments going either way, the issue eventually is an
empirical one.

The findings in the empirical literature about selection differ widely. Many researchers looking
at the British secondary reorganization conclude that the evidence does not support claims to the
superiority of either system (see, for example, Crook, Power, and Whitty, 1999). On the other
hand, there are also studies which find more pronounced effects going one way or the other.
Jesson (2000) uses data from the 1990s on those LEAs which still remain selective. Also using a
value added approach, he argues that comprehensive LEAs systematically outperform selective
LEAs in Britain. Based on the findings from the NCDS, these results are equally suspect. We
conclude that little can be learned from the existing literature on the British reorganization on the
performance of comprehensive versus selective schools.

Two recent papers by Hansushek and Wößmann (2006) and Waldinger (2006) apply an approach
roughly similar to ours to educational inequality across countries. Both papers investigate


                                                  3
whether inequality in educational outcomes is related to the amount of secondary school tracking
and selection across countries. These papers apply a differences-in-differences approach
comparing outcomes between secondary and primary schooling. Hanushek and Wößmann find
evidence that tracking raises educational inequality, while Waldinger does not. However,
Waldinger shows that the Hanushek and Wößmann results are not very robust to alternative
sample and variable specifications.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section briefly describes the
institutional background of British secondary education, and the history of comprehensive
reorganization. Section 3 discusses the empirical framework, and the approaches used in some
of the existing literature. The following section describes the data and key variables. Results are
discussed in section 5, and the final section concludes.




Secondary Education in Britain1

After World War II, secondary education was provided mainly in grammar and secondary
modern schools. The 11+ exam, taken at the age of 10 or 11, determined whether a student was
allowed to attend the selective and academically oriented grammar school. About 25 percent of
students would attend grammars, with the remainder attending less challenging secondary
modern schools. While this was the consensus model, education policy making in Britain was
always rather decentralized, with the local educational authorities (LEAs) being the main
administrative units, which retained a lot of decision making power about the exact make-up of
the local school system. The 1944 Education Act only prescribed separate secondary schools
and a transfer at age 11 leaving open the possibility for LEAs to experiment with other schemes,
including comprehensive schools. Early drives for the establishment of comprehensives at the
local level were typically, although not exclusively, in Labour dominated urban areas, like
London, Bristol, and Coventry.

The existing consensus about secondary schooling at the national level also began to crack in the
1950s. There was growing unease about the selection process using the 11+ examination, which

    This section draws heavily on the descriptions in Kerkhoff et al. (1996) and Griffith (1971).


                                                             4
determined the admission to grammar schools. Moreover, it became obvious that there were
other alternatives to a selective system than large comprehensive schools serving all children age
11 to 18 at once. The Leicestershire LEA, for example, began to experiment with abandoning
the 11+ and creating a comprehensive school up to age 14.

By the early 1960s, many, if not most, LEAs were working on reorganization plans, which were
trying to end the traditional selective system, or were challenging it in one way or another.
While Labour led LEAs played a leading role in this development, the trend cut across party
lines, with some Conservative authorities being among the most fervent advocates to ending
selection. As a response, the 1964 Education Act passed by the Conservative government
abandoned the principle of school transfer at age 11.

Only in 1963 had the Labour Party fully embraced the comprehensive principle at the national
level and called for the end of selection at their party conference. When Labour came to power
in 1964, its goal was to accelerate the existing trend for comprehensive reorganization, which
was well underway at the local level. However, there was a great diversity of views on how this
reorganization should be achieved. Rather than compelling LEAs on a particular system of
comprehensive schooling, the government issued Circular 10/65 in July 1965, requesting local
authorities to submit detailed plans on how to establish comprehensives. The circular itself
suggested no fewer than six different models of comprehensive reorganization. The middle
school model, pioneered in Leicestershire, often turned out to be popular with Conservatives,
because it allowed them to retain the grammar schools as the upper schools (an example is the
Leeds LEA). Nevertheless, in practice, most comprehensive schools eventually became 11 – 16
or 11 – 18 schools.

By the mid-1960s, secondary education in England and Wales was rather diverse. In some
LEAs, comprehensive reorganization had been well under way for years. The majority were
drawing up plans to respond to the central government’s request in some way or another. A
small number of LEAs resisted the call by the central government completely. This diversity
was not limited to the LEAs but often extended to divisions and districts within the LEAs.
Overall, the period from 1965 to 1974 was one where new comprehensive schools were
established in most parts of the country, and the fraction of students served by these schools
increased dramatically. In 1965, there were still only 262 comprehensive schools in England and

                                                 5
Wales. By 1974 this number had grown to 2,677, and these were attended by 62 percent of
secondary students in LEA maintained schools (see Figure 1).

One of the key issues of contention during this period was less the establishment of
comprehensive schools, as the closing of existing grammar schools, some of which had a long
tradition. As a result, new comprehensive schools often coexisted with the traditional grammar
schools in many places, hence perpetuating selection despite reorganization. There was also
great variety in the form the new comprehensive schools took. Some were purpose built, others
were amalgamated out of existing schools, often on different physical sites. Some served pupils
until they reached the university entrance exams at age 18 (A-levels), while others ended at 16
and students who wanted to stay in school longer were served by separate so called sixth form
colleges.

The pace of reorganization was very different in different places as well. When the
Conservatives won the national elections in 1970, Education Secretary Margaret Thatcher
effectively rescinded circular 10/65. But this change in national policy was unable to stem the
existing tide, and, in fact, more comprehensives were opened under Mrs. Thatcher’s helm at the
Education Department than under any of her predecessors or successors. Nevertheless, while the
change in the government did not reverse the longer-term trend, the comprehensive movement
never regained the same thrust it had during the 1960s. Comprehensive reorganization, while
concentrated in the 1960s and 70s, does continue into the 1990s (see Figure 1). A few LEAs still
maintain grammar schools, and the political discussion about the merits of selection continue in
Britain until this day.

This investigation, like many previous ones, focuses on England and Wales, which went through
the protracted transformation process just described. Scotland transformed to a comprehensive
system more quickly, and without much local discretion. Nevertheless, Scotland is not
particularly useful as a comparison group because it has a very different educational system from
England and Wales with its own school leaving exams and university system (undergraduate
degrees taking 4 years compared to 3 in England). Northern Ireland kept the selective system
during this period but it is not included in the NCDS, and also differs sufficiently from the rest of
the UK to make a comparison difficult.

Methodological Considerations and Comparison with the Previous Literature

The goal of the investigation is to determine how a student or set of students who were educated
in a comprehensive school would have fared, had they been part of the selective system instead.
Beyond the impact of the secondary system on the average outcomes on students, we might be
interested in the distributional aspects of the policy change: for example, do high ability or low
ability students benefit more from one system or the other. The main challenge in the evaluation
of these questions is that participation in comprehensive schooling may be correlated with the
ability or family background of the student.

Suppose that outcomes for a student at age 16 are given by the following linear relationship

y16i = α 16 + β 16 C i + γ 16 Ai + δ 16 Fi + λ16 S i + ε 16 i                                        (1)


where y16i is the test score at age 16, Ci is an indicator for a student attending a comprehensive
school, and Ai, Fi and Si, are the student’s ability, family background, and primary school inputs,
respectively. The coefficient β16 measures the impact of comprehensive schooling on student
achievement and is the parameter of interest. γ16, δ16, and λ16 are the loadings on ability, family
background, and primary school inputs for age 16 achievement. These effects may be different
from the loadings for outcomes at other ages. ε16 is a random term, due to the fact that test
scores measure actual student achievement only with error, to account for differences in
secondary school inputs other than comprehensive schooling etc. A similar relationship to (1)
holds for student achievement at age 11:

y11i = α11 + γ 11 Ai + δ 11 Fi + λ11Si + ε11i                                                        (2)


and Ci does not enter in this case.

The key challenge in estimating the relationship in (1) is that complete information particularly
on ability but possibly also on the relevant family background and school input variables is not
available. In order to overcome this data deficiency, researchers have turned to “value added
models.” Instead of trying to estimate (1) directly, these models estimate




                                                                7
y16i = α + βC i + ρy11i + η16 i                                                                               (3)


In order to compare (3) to the earlier equations (1) and (2), multiply (2) by ρ and subtract it from
both sides of (1). This yields:

y16i = α o + β16 Ci + ρy11i + (γ 16 − ργ 11 ) Ai + (δ 16 − ρδ 11 ) Fi + (λ16 − ρλ11 ) S i + ε 16 i − ρε 11i   (4)


It is obvious from (4) that the value added model implies the restriction γ16 = ργ11 and analogous
ones for the other parameters (see Todd and Wolpin, 2003, for a more detailed discussion of the
restrictions inherent in the value added model). These are stringent restrictions: they say, for
example, that the effect of ability has a reduced impact on student achievement at age 16
compared to age 11 (assuming that ρ < 1), and this reduction is the same as the reduction in the
impact of primary school inputs.

One way to address this problem is to let the lagged test score proxy ability (which is typically
most difficult to observe), and to include additional controls for family background and primary
school inputs in (3), so that the augmented value added model now takes the form:

y16i = α ′ + β ′C i + ρy11i + δFi + λS i + η16′ i                                                             (5)


This is a model which is frequently estimated in the literature, e.g. it is the specification adopted
by Kerkhoff et al. (1996).

If the restrictions leading to the value added specification (3) are true, then the coefficients δ and
λ in (5) should be zero. Estimating (5) and testing this restriction is therefore effectively a test of
the narrower value added model (suggested, for example, by Todd and Wolpin, 2003). Maybe
more importantly, even if δ and λ are non-zero in (5), if the estimates of β from (3) and β’ from
(5) are very similar, this is an indicator that the remaining family background factors and primary
school inputs are largely orthogonal to the comprehensive school assignment, conditional on the
lagged test score. This would generally raise the researcher’s confidence that other potentially
omitted factors are also orthogonal to the comprehensive school treatment. We will therefore
look at this implication in our data below.




                                                             8
Looking at (4) makes clear that measurement error in age 11 test scores will be part of the error
term of that equation. If Ci is correlated with true age 11 achievement, then measurement in the
test scores will invariably bias the estimate of β, the coefficient of interest. We will be able to
explore this issue because multiple test scores are available on the NCDS. Hence it is possible to
instrument one test score with an alternative score.

Return to student achievement at age 11 as described in equation (2). If we want to estimate this
equation, we face the same problem that particularly ability is not available. However, the
NCDS also contains age 7 test scores so that we can estimate:

y11i = α ′′ + ρ ′′y 7 i + η11′′ i                                                                     (6)


or possibly (6) augmented by family background factors and pre-primary inputs. Notice from
the discussion above that the value added model essentially implies a stationary student
achievement process. If equation (3) is valid for age 16 achievement, then equation (6) ought to
be valid for age 11 achievement. Moreover, the coefficients ρ and ρ” ought to be the same
(except for the fact that there is only a four year gap between 7 and 11, while there is a five year
gap between 11 and 16).

Most important for our investigation, including the indicator Ci in (6) serves as a specification
test. To the degree that the secondary school environment does not affect outcomes at age 11, it
should have a zero coefficient if (6) is correctly specified. If comprehensive schooling matters
for age 11 test scores, then this implies that equation (6) is misspecified. Given the close
analogies between equations (6) and (3), this most likely implies that (3) or (5) are misspecified
as well.

The studies by Kerkhoff et al. (1996) and Galinda-Rueda and Vignoles (2005) both focus on
comparing students attending comprehensive schools with students attending selective schools.
However, as we argued above, comprehensive and selective schools coexisted in the majority of
LEAs at the time the NCDS cohort entered secondary schools. The bulk of the identification
will therefore come from these mixed LEAs. But if grammar schools coexist alongside
comprehensive schools in the LEA it is unclear whether the comprehensive schools will really
have an intake which is representative of all students or whether the grammar schools will keep


                                                  9
cream skimming the best students. The comprehensive schools would effectively just be
relabeled secondary modern schools in this case. This approach also makes no direct use of the
policy variation introduced by the British transition to comprehensive education.2

As an alternative, we also compare students in LEAs which are purely selective with those in
LEAs which are purely comprehensive in 1969. This approach is not without problems either,
because LEAs which switched to the comprehensive system early enough for the 1969 entering
cohort tend to be systematically poorer and have lower ability students. Nevertheless, there are
two advantages to this approach. The first is that only these pure LEAs truly compare a
comprehensive and a selective regime. Comprehensive schools in mixed LEAs may have a very
different composition because of the cream skimming effect. The second advantage is that the
control strategy in equations (3) or (5) is more believable when only the between LEA variation
is being used. Whether a student attended, say, a comprehensive or a grammar school within an
LEA is a question of individual school choice. The controls therefore need to reflect all the
factors relevant to that individual choice. While this is a tall order, across LEAs we only need to
control for the fact that the average characteristics of students in comprehensive and selective
LEAs differ. Measurement error and omitted variables are therefore likely to be of much less
consequence.

A different approach is to estimate versions of equations (3) or (5) by instrumental variables.
Galinda-Rueda and Vignoles (2005) present estimates where they use political control in the
county as an instrument for comprehensive school attendance. The discussion above suggested
that this might be a valid instrument, conditional on county socio-demographic characteristics.
The validity of the IV approach can similarly be checked by estimating the age 11 model. Since
the instrument is an LEA level variable, we implement this approach only in the LEA level
analysis.




2
 Kerkhoff et al. (1996) acknowledge this problem, and also compare only LEAs which are either purely selective or
purely comprehensive. However, they downplay this approach because it results in relatively small sample sizes.

Data and Variables

Our main data source is the National Child Development Study (NCDS). The survey includes
everyone born between March 3 and 9, 1958. After a parental survey at birth, there were follow-
ups at ages 7, 11, 16, 23, 33, and 41. The original survey included 17,414 births. However, the
study has had significant attrition, and by the time of the fifth wave at age 33, information is only
available for 11,407 sample members. Extensive information on the life course of each
individual is available, including interviews with the sample member, parents, teachers, health
professionals, and results on aptitude and medical tests, as well as on official school leaving
exams (O-levels and A-levels). Our sample includes all individuals in England and Wales, on
whom there is information from the schools in the age 7, 11, and 16 surveys.

We make no attempt to replicate the exact results in any specific previous study. Sample and
variable definitions are therefore idiosyncratic to this analysis. A variety of achievement tests
were given to the NCDS sample members at ages 7, 11, and 16. Each test is scored on its own
scale. In order to make results easier to read, we have converted all test scores to a 0 – 100 scale.
The key outcome measure we analyze is the math test score at age 16. The same reading test
was given to the sample members at ages 11 and 16, and the test was not really appropriate at
age 16. As a consequence, we concentrate on the math test results at 16. A variety of other
outcomes would be available (like O-level and A-level participation and results, post-secondary
schooling, etc.). However, test score outcomes have featured prominently in the previous
literature. They also most easily allow the comparison with age 11 outcomes.

In order to classify LEAs as either comprehensive or selective, we relied on data on school
attendance by LEA from Education Statistics for the years 1967, 1971, and 1974, and on
descriptions of secondary reorganization plans in Comprehensive Schools Committee (1967) and
Benn (1971). The NCDS distinguishes 164 LEAs in 1969. According to our classification there
are 26 comprehensive and 29 selective LEAs with observations in the sample, while 109 LEAs
are not used. A list is given in appendix table 3.

We supplemented the NCDS data with some area characteristics from the 1971 Census, which
we merged with the 1969 residential LEA of the sample member. In addition, we collected data
for the political composition of the county or county borough, which we use as instrumental


                                                 11
variables. Local political control in Britain is organized in a number of counties. Some cities are
administered independently of the counties (these are called county boroughs). The LEAs
outside Greater London in 1969 coincided either with a county or county borough. We collected
information on the outcomes of local elections in 1961 from the newspaper The Times and
supplemented it with information from the Municipal Yearbook (1962). The Times typically also
reported which party held control of the county council, which is the variable we use. Where
this information is missing, and one party held the majority of the seats, we assigned control to
that party. There are a few counties and county boroughs, which were established between 1961
and 1969. In these cases, we used political control in the main predecessor area in 1961.




Empirical Results

Table 1 shows regressions of the math test score at age 16 on a dummy variable whether the
student attends a comprehensive school. Different specifications add different sets of control
variables, which are described in Appendix table 1. Column (1) shows the raw difference
between comprehensive school students and those attending selective schools, either grammars
or secondary moderns. Comprehensive students score 7.7 points lower on average. This is about
a third of the student level standard deviation of the math score, which is 22.4, so that the raw
difference is not insubstantial.

Of course, the raw difference probably reflects mostly the fact that comprehensive schools in the
sample had a different intake than selective schools. Hence, column (2) presents a value added
specification like equation (3) by adding the math test score at age 11, when students entered
secondary school. The comprehensive coefficient now changes to -2.2, only about a third the
original difference. Nevertheless, this specification still indicates that comprehensive school
students score worse than students in selective schools.

The remaining columns in the table probe whether this estimate might reflect the causal effect of
comprehensive education using the standard technique of adding additional covariates. In
column (3), we add four other age 11 test scores (a reading, verbal, non-verbal, and a design
copy score). Adding these additional scores changes the result relatively little to about -2.1.



                                                 12
Column (4) introduces demographic and family background variables, making this an augmented
value added specification as in equation (5). The set of background variables is roughly similar
to the ones used in Kerkhoff et al. (1996) (we use dummies for gender, more than two siblings,
twins, no mother figure, no father figure, and four dummies for father’s occupation). The
estimate in column (4) changes relatively little compared to column (3). Finally, using almost 50
covariates about the family, primary school experience, and county characteristics in the last
column yields a coefficient of -1.5.3 While this is closer to zero, it is still not very different from
the estimate in column (2).

The test of the narrow value added specification suggested by Todd and Wolpin (2003) amounts
to an F-test on the background variables in columns (4) and (5). The F-statistics are 27.9 and
11.9 respectively. Both are highly significant with p-values well below the 0.1 percent level.
This means that the narrow value added specification is clearly rejected. On the other hand, the
comprehensive school coefficient changes little as these covariates are added, suggesting that the
background variables are more or less uncorrelated with the student attending a comprehensive
school, conditional on the lagged test scores. Hence, it seems unlikely that other variables could
be found which would change the estimate if added to the last specification. This would suggest
that a coefficient in the order -2.0 or -1.5 actually reflects the causal effect of the comprehensive
experience. An effect of this size, about 0.07 to 0.09 standard deviations of the math test score,
is not huge but could well be of a plausible magnitude for a policy like comprehensive schooling.

Table 2 probes this conclusion by repeating the same exercise, but using the math test score at 11
as the dependent variable, and test scores at age 7 as the controls. The raw difference between
selective and comprehensive school students in age 11 math scores in column (1) is 8.4, about
the same magnitude as for the age 16 scores. Adding the age 7 math score lowers the difference
only to 6.0. This may be due to the fact that the age 7 math score is not as good a predictor of
age 11 performance, as the age 11 score is of age 16 performance. It is indeed the case that the
raw correlation of age 16 and age 11 scores is much higher than that of age 11 and age 7 scores,
0.77 compared to 0.56. This may not be surprising, since children are just learning basic
arithmetic at age 7, so the age 7 score is a more noisy measure of actual ability to do math at 11.

3
 This results in a smaller sample because of missing values in some of the covariates. The change in the
comprehensive coefficient from column (4) to (5) is entirely due to the additional covariates, not the change in the
sample.


                                                         13
Hence, it is not surprising that adding additional test scores for reading and drawing in column
(3) makes more of a difference. The coefficient is -4.9 now. Similarly, the comprehensive-
selective difference falls to 4.0 when the Kerkhoff et al. (1996) type background variables are
added, and to 3.3 when a large set of about 40 background controls are added. The covariates
are also highly significant again. These results probably all reflect that age 11 performance is
more difficult to predict than performance at age 16. If we were to look at results like those in
table 2, and wanted to draw a causal inference, we would be much more cautious because the
results are more sensitive to the set of included controls.

But more importantly, the results in table 2 suggest that the value added specification, controlling
for lagged test scores and background characteristics, is not a panacea in this context. If the
strategy worked well in purging the regressions of any selection, we would expect the
comprehensive school coefficient to be zero, at least in column (5). However, this coefficient is
actually twice as large in absolute value as the corresponding coefficient in table 1. If this result
is likely to reflect selection bias, then we should be equally worried about the results in table 1.

There are various possibilities why we might expect a negative effect in table 2. One is that
attending a comprehensive school in the future actually affected students during their primary
school experience. Primary schools in selective areas would spend much time preparing children
for the 11+ examination. Hence, it might not be surprising that students who eventually went to
selective schools did much better on an age 11 exam than those going on to comprehensive
schools. While there is certainly some truth to this explanation, we doubt that it can provide
much comfort. It is unlikely that the primary school experience has twice as large an impact on
student achievement than actually attending a comprehensive school, although it is of course
possible.

Secondly, many of the comprehensive school students in this sample actually attended mixed
LEAs. In many of those LEAs it might not have been clear during the primary years whether the
child would eventually attend a selective or comprehensive school. Hence, comprehensive
school students might have obtained the same exam preparation during their primary years. In
order to examine this issue, we start from the specification in column (4) and limit the sample to
LEAs that were neither clearly comprehensive nor clearly selective. Depending on how stringent
this selection is done, we obtain coefficients between -4.4 and -3.8, very similar to the coefficient

                                                 14
in column (4). This may still not be the best comparison, because rural counties might have been
mixed, but this reflects mostly differences between districts rather than mixing in the local areas.
Hence, a better test is to limit the sample also to urban areas, where comprehensive and selective
schools most likely coexisted in mixed areas. The range of coefficients is now -4.4 to -1.6, with
the latter number referring to the most stringent sample selection. Unfortunately, the sample
sizes for this exercise are also small, and the standard errors also reach a size of 1.5. But even
the most conservative estimate of -1.6 is still of the same magnitude as those in table 1.4 So
there is little reason to believe that the table 1 estimates do not simply reflect selection bias.

A further possibility for the larger differences found for comprehensive students in table 2 is the
larger degree of measurement error in age 7 test scores. Since the lagged math test score seems
to be the most important control variable, and adding other test scores has only a minor impact,
we return to the specification with only the lagged math test score (but we now add the small set
of background covariates). On the other hand, contemporaneous test scores are rather highly
correlated (for example, the age 11 math test score has a raw correlation of 0.74 with the age 11
reading test score). Hence, we instrument the math test score either with the reading test score,
or with all the other available test scores.

Results from this exercise are shown in table 3. Columns (1) and (4) show the OLS estimates.
Columns (2) and (5) show the IV estimates, instrumenting the lagged math test score by the
lagged reading test score. The coefficient on the lagged test score increases in each case but by a
much larger amount in case of the regressions for the age 11 scores. In fact, the IV coefficient
on the lagged test score is above 1 in column (5). At the same time, the coefficient on
comprehensive schools drops in absolute value by about a third. This indicates that
measurement error in the lagged scores might indeed be a problem, and this accounts for some of
the estimated negative effects of the comprehensive experience. But again, this does not
eliminate the negative estimates for the age 11 scores. Similar results are obtained in columns
(3) and (6) using all the other lagged scores as instruments.

These results indicate that measurement error in lagged test scores is indeed important, and that it
likely leads to bias in the coefficients of interest. Nevertheless, measurement error also is not the


4
    These results are robust to the type of adjustment we make for measurement error in table 3 below.


                                                           15
explanation to the puzzle, since we still find strongly negative effects for age 11 scores. This
means that selection remains a plausible and maybe even likely explanation for these findings,
and hence sheds doubt on the age 16 results as well.

So far, we have only investigated the average effects of the comprehensive school experience.
Much interest in the literature (e.g. Kerkhoff et al., 1996 and Galindo-Rueda and Vignoles, 2004)
has focused on the distributional effects, however. Table 4 turns our attention to this issue. Like
in Kerkhoff et al. (1996), we introduce an interaction between attending a comprehensive school
and lagged ability. We summarize ability in this case by the average of the math, reading,
verbal, and non-verbal test scores at age 11, and by the average of the math, reading, and
drawing score at age 7. The ability measures are also on a scale of 0 – 100.

Like the previous authors, we find a strong interaction effect in column (1) for the age 16 results.
While the main effect of attending a comprehensive school is positive, the interaction is negative.
A hypothetical student at the 10th percentile of ability (with a score of 24.6) would score about 1
point higher in math at age 16 after attending comprehensive school. Contrast this with a student
at the 90th ability percentile (scoring 75.8), who would score about 4 points lower after attending
a comprehensive school. This result suggested to the previous authors that comprehensive
schools are good for weaker students while selective schools are good for the better students.
This is plausible, since the best students would be attending grammar schools in the selective
system.

This conclusion is again tempered by the results in column (2), where we repeat the exercise
with age 11 math scores. The basic result is the same, but the point estimates suggest an even
steeper ability gradient. Hence, the ability interaction may also simply be due to selection
effects. It suggests that comprehensives may have a more compressed intake in terms of abilities
than selective schools. This could be because different types of schools attract different types of
students, or because the areas switching to comprehensive schools earlier were more
homogeneous.

Of course, using covariates to fully control for the selection in what type of secondary school a
student attends is a tall order. So it may not be so surprising that this exercise fails. A more
promising approach is to only use the variation at the LEA level by comparing LEAs which were


                                                 16
solidly comprehensive or solidly selective for the NCDS students. This exploits the policy
variation of the British experience more directly. Furthermore, controlling for differences in
student characteristics at the LEA level should be much easier than at the student level. Hence,
we repeat the same type of results for our subsample of LEAs, which we classified into one of
these two categories.

Table 5 displays the results. The raw difference between students in comprehensive and
selective LEAs is 5.8 points. This is smaller than the raw difference between all comprehensive
and selective students. Nevertheless, it is large compared to the variation in test scores between
LEAs, which is 9.1 using all LEAs. Adding control variables in column (2) again lowers the
coefficient to about -1.5, very similar to the finding in table 1 based on comprehensive school
attendance. Furthermore, the interactions with lagged ability in column (3) also suggest similar
distribution effects as in table 4, but these effects are now somewhat smaller in magnitude. Not
surprisingly, the results are also less precise in this much smaller sample. Are the LEA level
results likely more reliable? The results for the math score at age 11 suggest the opposite. These
results are also very close to those in tables 2 and 4. Hence, this strategy is not really any more
convincing than the previous one either.

Finally, we follow the suggestion in Galindo-Rueda and Vignoles (2005) and use political
composition of the county as an instrument for comprehensive status. Our instrument,
conservative control of the county or borough in 1961, predicts comprehensive status very well.
The t-statistic on the instrument in the first stage corresponding to column (1) in table 6 is 32.4.
The IV estimate of the comprehensive effect is -2.6, slightly more negative than the OLS
estimate in column (2) of table 5. We also repeat the specifications interacting ability with
comprehensive status in column (2). In this case, we use the interaction of ability and
conservative control as an instrument for the interaction term. Again, the results are roughly
similar to the OLS results. Moreover, columns (3) and (4) show that we also obtain comparable
results for the age 11 test scores yet again. The instrumental variables strategy also does not
seem to be able to remove the selection bias successfully.

Conclusion

We have argued in this paper that the experience in England and Wales provides potentially a
useful experiment to study the impact of comprehensive versus selective schooling. Much of the
research on this issue has adopted popular value added specifications for test score outcomes of
affected and unaffected students. We have argued that a useful specification test for these types
of models is to apply them to students during their primary school years by using age 11 test
scores at the dependent variable, and controlling for age 7 test scores. As long as students do not
fare differently in primary school, depending on whether they end up in a comprehensive or a
selective school in the secondary system, these regressions should show a zero comprehensive
effect if all selection is successfully controlled.

Our results indicate the opposite. Throughout the analysis, we have found rather similar patterns
of results for the age 16 test scores and for the age 11 test scores. We conclude from this that it
is prudent to be cautious about interpreting the age 16 results causally. As long as the age 11
results reflect selection bias, this may also be the case for the age 16 results.

Of course, it is possible to argue that our age 11 results are biased, while the age 16
specifications have removed all selection effects successfully. There are various arguments to
make this case, like the fact that age 7 controls are poorer predictors of age 11 outcomes, the fact
that primary school teaching may differ depending on whether the students are going to take the
11+ exam, etc. We have tried to show that none of these are likely to fully explain the age 11
results.

Nevertheless we agree that it is a possibility that the age 16 results are right and the age 11
results are wrong. However, identification always requires a leap of faith. We are typically
willing to make this leap of faith when a research design seem particularly plausible (as in an
experiment) or when we have prior knowledge or additional evidence that a particular
identification strategy is likely to remove the selection bias successfully. In this case, we have
presented evidence to the contrary: that there is a good case to be made that selection bias exists
in the estimates comparing students in comprehensive and selective schools. Our case does not
have to be ironclad to make us worried about the interpretations in the previous literature.




                                                      18
Our worry also extends to studies which do not use the NCDS. Similar value added
specifications have been applied to other data in order to answer this question (for example
Jesson, 2000 using more recent data). While we have not explicitly demonstrated potential
problems with these estimates, we would remain cautious in drawing strong conclusions from a
research design that essentially mirrors that adopted by the studies analyzing the NCDS data.
We conclude that we probably do not know very much about the effect of comprehensive
schooling in Britain, or elsewhere for that matter.
