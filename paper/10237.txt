                                            ABSTRACT

In modern knowledge driven economies, firms are increasingly aware that individual and collective

knowledge is a major factor of economic performance. The larger the firms and the stronger their

connection with technology intensive industries, the more are they likely to set up knowledge

management (KM) policies, such as promoting a culture of information and knowledge sharing (C),

motivating employees and executives to remain with the firm (R), forging alliances and partnerships

for knowledge acquisition (A), implementing written knowledge management rules (W). The French

1998-2000 Community Innovation Survey (CIS3) has surveyed the use of these four knowledge

management policies for a representative sample of manufacturing firms. The micro econometric

analysis of the survey tends to confirm that knowledge management indeed contributes significantly

to firm innovative performance and to its productivity. The impacts of adoption of the four surveyed

KM practices on firm innovative and productivity performance are not completely accounted by firm

size, industry, research & development (R&D) efforts or other factors, but persist to a sizeable extent

after controlling for all these factors.

    INTRODUCTION



    In the knowledge driven economy, firms are becoming more and more aware of the

fact that knowledge is a resource requiring explicit and specific management policies and

practices to be acquired, processed and exploited efficiently.2 Among other objectives, the

role of knowledge management (KM) policies and practices is to foster all types of firm

innovation, whether process or product oriented or mainly organizational, and to improve

firm productivity and its medium and long term competitive advantage. 3



    As part of the pilot project initiated by OECD and Statistics Canada to study firm KM

behavior, SESSI, the statistical Agency of the French ministry of manufacturing industries,

has introduced a set of four new questions, specifically relating to important and relatively

well-defined KM policies, in the French Third Community Innovation Survey (CIS3).4

They respectively concern the existence in the firm of a written policy (W) of knowledge

management, of a culture (C) of knowledge sharing, of a policy of retention (R) of

employees and executives, and of alliances (A) and partnerships for knowledge acquisition

(see Box 1 in the Appendix).

                                                                                           3
    In the first section of our exploratory study, we document the diffusion of these four

KM policies among French manufacturing firms in 2000, and that of three other related

practices (also surveyed in CIS3). In the second section we provide evidence on the

complementarity of KM policies, in the sense that firms tend to adopt them jointly, and we

introduce an indicator of intensity of knowledge management (KMI). In the next two

sections we make an attempt to assess the impacts of implementing KM policies on firm

performance, controlling for a number of other factors, and investigate their

complementarity also in the sense that their impacts are cumulative. In the fourth section

we consider four indicators of firm innovative performance, the propensity and intensity in

innovating and in patenting on products, while in the fifth we look similarly at firm

productivity. We briefly conclude in the last section.




I- DIFFUSION OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT



    An increasing concern…



    Several reasons explain the increasing concern of firms for knowledge management.

Firms have to deal with a more complex world because of rapidly changing technologies.

Information and communication technologies (ICT) are ubiquitous, creating new needs and

requiring appropriate organizational structures, facilitating the automation of some tasks

and the outsourcing of others, supporting technological watch and improving access to



                                                                                         4
external knowledge. Firms have to react faster to keep their competitive edge and to be able

to build on all or part of their past experience. They are more and more aware of the fact

that their competencies largely rely on individuals and on tacit knowledge special to the

company. They are worried about the loss of skills caused by the mobility of their

personnel and are striving to motivate their employees and executives to remain within the

company, improving their career and remuneration prospects, setting up training courses

and encouraging professionalism. Firms are also aware that they cannot maintain and

develop their knowledge by relying only on internal forces. They have to form alliances

and partnerships with other firms, competitors as well as suppliers and clients, to acquire

new knowledge and expertise.



    …leading to the adoption of knowledge management practices, …



    Over the past years, firms have adopted different knowledge management practices. In

2000, in manufacturing industries, nearly one out of two have implemented at least one of

the four KM policies identified in the French CIS3 questionnaire (see Chart 1). More

precisely, 28% of manufacturing firms with 20 employees or more declared that they have

a culture to promote knowledge sharing (C), and almost as many (27%) that they set up an

incentive policy to keep employees and executives in the firm (R). Likewise, 23% of them

forged alliances or partnerships for knowledge acquisition (A), and significantly less (17%)

put into practice a written knowledge management policy (W).




                                                                                          5
    …especially in large firms…



    The diffusion of KM policies is much more widespread in large than in small firms

(see Chart 1). Setting up a special organization is much less critical, and more costly, in

smaller firms where information circulates more easily and informal procedures can be

efficient. In the larger firms, on the other hand, identifying the experts (the knowledge

holders) within the company is essential vis-à-vis other employees and working with

outside experts is an important asset. In 2000, almost four out of five (80%) of the firms

with 2,000 employees or more declared they had a knowledge sharing culture (C) or

alliances for knowledge acquisition (A), while only one out of five (20%) of those with 20

to 49 employees said so. Likewise, adopting a written knowledge management policy (W)

is much more frequent in the large firms: one out of two (50%) of the firms with 2,000

employees or more had one, and merely one out of ten (10%) among the smaller firms.



                                      CHART 1 about HERE



    By contrast to large firms, small firms are likely to be more dependent on the expertise

and know how of a few number of their employees, and much more concerned if they

leave. That is possibly why the adoption of a policy to retain employees in the firm (R),

even if much less common in the smaller firms than in the larger ones, is somewhat more

frequent relative to the adoption of the three other policies.




                                                                                          6
    …and in technology intensive industries.



    KM policies are also particularly widespread in the high and medium-high tech

industries, such as the pharmaceutical industry, aeronautic and space construction or

electronic component manufacturing (see Chart 2). In these industries, 40% to 45% of the

firms have implemented policies to foster knowledge sharing (C), to retain employees (R),

or to establish partnerships to acquire knowledge (A), and about 25% have adopted a

knowledge written policy (W). The diffusion of KM policies is about half less prevalent in

the low tech industries such as clothing and leather, publishing, printing and reproduction,

or home equipment.



                                    CHART 2 about HERE




    Knowledge management policies are more frequent in firms implementing new

management methods…



    From 1998 to 2000, in the manufacturing industries, one firm out of five has

implemented new methods of management in the broad sense, that is, with respect to other

corporate functions, rather than just knowledge management. A good example is the

development of project-based management practices that altered existing work relations

within companies, and led to the progress of corporate cross-departmental culture.

Unsurprisingly, knowledge management is more widespread in firms that have adopted



                                                                                          7
such new management methods (see Table 1). Among these firms three out of four (76%)

have also implemented at least one of the four KM practices, while among firms that have

not adopted new management methods, this is the case of less than two out of five (37%).



    …in firms making R&D investments, innovating and patenting…



    Knowledge management is also prevalent among firms investing in research &

development (R&D), innovating and patenting. In 2000, 30% of French manufacturing

firms with 20 employees or more have invested in R&D, and 20% have patents on products

protecting part of their output, while from 1998 to 2000 about 35% have generated

innovations on products or processes. The diffusion among these firms of all four KM

practices is at least double than for the non innovating or non R&D doing firms and at least

60% higher than for the non patenting firms (see Table 1).



                                     TABLE 1 about HERE



    …and in innovating firms that use the Internet and ICT to acquire and share

information.



    As part of their strategy to foster innovation, firms make specific efforts to gain better

information on technologies, products and materials, as well as about their customers,

suppliers and competitors. They find such information from a wide range of sources: from

universities and public or private research laboratories, in technical and economic



                                                                                            8
databases, in professional journals and conferences, trade fairs and exhibitions. Indeed,

40% of innovating firms state that they use the Internet to acquire information for their

innovating activities, 35% that they take advantage of ICT resources to share such

information between employees, and 25% that they do both. Among this last group of

firms, about 60% have a knowledge sharing culture (C) and 40% a written knowledge

management policy (W), that is twice as many as for all manufacturing firms (see Table 1).




II- COMPLEMENTARITY OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES



    Firms tend to adopt knowledge management practices jointly, …



    Looking at the occurrence of joint adoption of two among the four KM policies shows

that firms view them as complementary and suggests that the basic reasons of their

adoption are similar. Firms that implement one KM policy are much more likely to adopt a

second one than firms which have not implemented the first one (see Chart 3 and Table A2

in the Appendix). For instance, three out of five firms, among the 28% which have a

knowledge sharing culture (C), also implement an incentive policy to keep employees (R);

one out of two also develop partnerships to acquire knowledge (A), and about one out of

two have also a written knowledge management policy (W). On the other hand, among the

72% of firms declaring they did not have a culture of knowledge sharing, only one out of

eight set up partnerships for knowledge acquisition (A) or implement an incentive policy




                                                                                         9
for employees’ retention(R), and fewer than one out of sixteen have a written knowledge

policy (W).



                                     CHART 3 about HERE



    The complementarity of knowledge management practices is reflected in the high

correlations, ranging from 0.30 to 0.50, which we find between the binary indicators of

adoption of the four KM policies (see Table A3 in the Appendix). It is also confirmed by the

fact such correlations remain high when we try to control for various factors of adoption.

The partial correlations between the four KM policies indicators, conditional on size and

industry of the firms, and other control variables (i.e., the ones we also take into account in

sections III and IV when investigating the impacts of KM practices on innovation and

productivity) are still in the range of 0.15 to 0.40 (see Table A3 in the Appendix).



    …which suggests the definition of a knowledge management intensity indicator.



    The easiest way to take into account the complementarity of the different KM practices

is to define a KM intensity indicator (KMI) as being simply the number of adopted

practices. This indicator is thus equal to zero for a firm if the firm implements none of the

four KM policies, and respectively to one, two, three or four, if it adopts at least one

practice, two, three, or all four. It can be shown that KMI roughly corresponds to the first

component in a principal factor analysis (or multiple correspondence analysis) of the

correlation matrix (or the contingency table) of the four KM policies binary indicators. As



                                                                                            10
expected from the pattern of adoption of each individual practice, KM intensity increases

strongly with the size of the firm as well as with the industry technology intensiveness (see

Chart 4). It is about 2.7 in firms with 2,000 employees or more as against 0.7 in firms with

20 to 49 employees. Likewise, it averages about 1.6 in high-tech industries and about 0.7 in

low-tech intensity industries.



                                     CHART 4 about HERE




    III- KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT AND INNOVATION



    Simple descriptive statistics show that the diffusion of KM practices is far from being

complete among innovating firms or firms with patents, although much more advanced

than among non innovating and non patenting firms (see Table 1). It thus makes sense to

try to estimate the specific impact of adoption of KM practices on firm innovative

performance, controlling for other (observed) factors and firm characteristics.



    To assess firm innovative performance, we can use four variables from CIS3. The first

two are the “propensity to innovate” and the (product) “innovation intensity”, that is the

binary indicator of whether the firm “has introduced during the period 1998-2000 any new

or significantly improved products”, and if yes “the share of turnover from these new or

significantly improved products in the overall turnover of the firm in 2000”. The other two

variables, defined in an analogous way, are the “propensity to patent” and the “patent



                                                                                          11
intensity”, that is the binary indicator of whether the firm “has any valid product patent at

the end of 2000” and if yes “the share of turnover protected by patents in the overall

turnover of the firm in 2000”. The average propensities to innovate and to patent are

respectively about 35% and 20%, while the average innovation intensity is about 15% for

the innovating firms and the average patent intensity about 30% for the firms with patents

(see Table A4 in the Appendix).



    The fact that the innovation and patent intensity variables can only be known for the

innovating and patenting firms is a very likely source of selectivity, which would result in

biased estimates if we were to estimate the intensity relations separately from the

propensity relations. Thus instead of simply considering independent (or seemingly

unrelated) regressions to estimate the impact of knowledge management on the innovative

performance variables, we consider jointly the propensity and intensity relations within the

framework of a generalized tobit model. The tobit model allows to correct for selectivity

biases in the intensity relation (or outcome equation) by specifying explicitly its linkage

with the propensity relation (or selection equation), both through the correlation of the

unobserved error terms in the two equations and through the sets of explanatory variables in

these equations (i.e., the KM variables and the control variables).5


5
  In tobit models the selection equation is also specified as a probit (or normit) equation,
which is more appropriate for a binary dependent variable, and the outcome equation as a
linear regression, and it is assumed that the errors in these two equations are normally
distributed (with correlation rho). Since the observed innovation and patent intensity
variables are share variables, we use in fact as the dependent variable in the outcome
equation their logit transformation [i.e., z = log(y/(1-y))], so that the distribution of the
“logit-shares” be (approximately) consistent with the assumed normal distribution (and
limited to the 0 to 1 interval). We estimate the tobit model by the method of maximum



                                                                                          12
    As control variables in the propensity and intensity equations of our tobit model

specification, we use all the available variables in CIS3 which we thought relevant: the firm

size (i.e., by means of seven binary indicators, or six in addition to the constant) and

industry (i.e., by means of fourteen binary indicators, or thirteen in addition to the

constant), R&D intensity for R&D doing firms, and three other binary indicators for

belonging to a group, for using new management methods, and for not doing R&D. We can

also introduce in the innovation and patent intensity equations another binary indicator to

control for the acquisition and sharing of information using the Internet and other ICT

tools.6 The mean and standard deviations, and more precise definitions of the control

variables, are given in Table A4 in the Appendix.



    In view of the strong complementarity of KM practices, we consider in fact four

different specifications of the tobit model. In the first and simplest specification, or model

1, we use our KM intensity variable (KMI) as the only KM explanatory variable in the

propensity and intensity equations, thus assuming that the individual impacts of the four

KM practices are both (roughly) equal and linearly cumulative in the two equations. In the

next two specifications, or models 2 and 3, we introduce, instead of KMI, four binary

indicators in the propensity and intensity equations. In model 2, these indicators

respectively correspond to the use of only one, or two, or three, or all four KM practices


likehood, making sure that we reach the absolute maximum(using TSP international
version4.5). For an introduction to tobit models, see for example Greene “Econometric
Analysis” (chapter 22, in the 1993 second edition).




                                                                                           13
(i.e., KMI=1, 2, 3 or 4), thus still implying that the impacts of the four practices are equal

but allowing them to be more or less (non linearly) cumulative. In model 3, they simply

correspond to the separate use of each of the four KM practices (i.e., KMC=1, KMR=1,

KMA=1, KMW=1), thus allowing that the impacts of the four practices be different and

more or less cumulative. In the last and most general specification, model 4, we introduce,

in addition to the four KM practices indicators, all their possible interactions, that is eleven

other binary indicators (i.e., six “2 by 2” interactions such as KMC*KMR=1, four “3 by 3”

interactions   such   as    KMC*KMR*KMA=1,             and    the   “4   by    4”   interaction

KMC*KMR*KMA*KMW=1 which is identical to KMI=4). Clearly model 1 is nested in

the other three models, while models 2 and 3 are also nested in model 4, thus permitting us

to test whether these models provide statistically different pictures: that is whether the four

KM policies appear interchangeable and more or less cumulative, in terms of their impacts

on firm innovative performance.



                           TABLES 2 and 3 and CHART 5 about HERE




    The estimated impacts of the KM indicators (given directly in terms of the marginal

effects on the propensity and on the intensity computed at the sample means, respectively

as a probability in % and as a share in %) are reported in Table 2 for our three first models,

and also represented graphically in Chart 5. For model 1 these impacts are all statistically

  These questions on the Internet and ICT are asked in the French CIS3 only to the
innovating firms.



                                                                                             14
very significant; for models 2 and 3 most of them are also very significant in the innovation

propensity and intensity equations, while only a few are in the patent propensity and

intensity equations.7 Table 2 also reports the (maximum) log-likelihood values for the first

three models, as well as for model 4, from which we can simply compute the log-likelihood

tests of model 1 against models 2, 3 and 4, and of models 2 and 3 against model 4. These

tests are reported in Table 3. They show very clearly that the more parsimonious model 1,

with the KM intensity variable, cannot be statistically rejected against the other three

models, even with a very low critical level of significance. Model 1 can thus be viewed as

the (statistically) preferred model. The marginal effects of all variables, not only KM

intensity but the R&D doing binary indicator, R&D intensity and the other control

variables, are shown for this model in Table A5 in the Appendix.



    Our main results concern the statistical and economic significance of the estimated

impacts of KM intensity. Regardless of their size and industry, of their R&D efforts, of

whether they belong to a group and have implemented new management methods, firms do

tend to innovate and patent more extensively, if they have adopted KM policies. All else

equal, when KM intensity increases by one, the propensity to innovate increases by 4% at

the sample mean, that is from an average probability of 47.1% to 51.1%, and innovation

intensity increases by 1.6% for the innovating firms, from an average share of 15.8% to


7
  We do not report the estimated impacts for model 4, since they are not significant, with
very few exceptions, for the eleven indicators of KM interactions (and practically not
different for the four non-interacted KM indicators from the estimated impacts in model 3).
We thus do not find evidence of complementarity (or substitutability) between the four KM
policies, in the specific sense that if a firm has already adopted one such policy the impact
on its performance of adopting another one would be higher (or weaker).



                                                                                          15
17.4%. Similarly the propensity to patent increases by 1.6%, from an average probability of

32.4% to 34.0%, and patenting intensity increases by 3.1% for the patenting firms, from an

average share of 30.5% to 33.6%.



    These estimated impacts on firm performance of KM policies are quite substantial, and

all the more since they seem cumulative. They are not so huge, however, that one would

have to conclude that they are necessarily wrong (“ils sont trop beaux pour être vrais”), and

that they must be largely overestimated and our model badly misspecified. It is true that all

the usual reasons of econometric misspecification potentially apply: omitted control

variables and unobserved firm characteristics; endogeneity of right hand variables (i.e., of

the KM indicators themselves and of the R&D and other control variables). These problems

may be particularly serious with cross-sectional data as ours. There is not much that we can

do to address them very effectively (and convincingly) at this stage, short of being able to

gather more and better data (and preferably as panel data over a long enough period, or at

least for two cross-sections a few years apart). On the other hand, an extreme degree of

disbelief is not warranted. Even if the adoption of knowledge management has become

fashionable among firms and for a number of them mainly a shibboleth for good

management, one will expect that in average firms will not go through the various costs of

implementing KM policies unless they have some real impacts on their performance.

Anyhow, whether one views our findings with excessive skepticism or one is willing to

give them some causal meaning, even if they are likely to suffer from significant

overestimation, in both cases they remain statistically informative. At the minimum, they

reflect significant underlying positive correlations, conditional on a fair number of relevant



                                                                                           16
factors. Such descriptive correlations could have been negative or statistically not

significant, and they are not.



    As concerns the orders of magnitude of the estimates we find for the control variables,

they look fairly reasonable on the whole, which is comforting (see Table A5). R&D doing

firms innovate and patent much more than non R&D doing firms, and they also tend to

innovate and patent more, the higher their R&D intensity. The estimated impacts of R&D

intensity, however, may seem to be on the low side, although statistically very significant.

A doubling of the average of R&D expenditures to sales ratio, which is of 1.7% for the

innovating firms and of 2% for the patenting firms, would increase innovation intensity by

only 1.2% and patenting intensity by a higher, though still modest, 5.3%. One potential

reason for these low estimates could be that instead of a measure of R&D expenditures

flow we should use a more appropriate measure of R&D capital stock. The estimated

impacts of the implementation of new management methods are statistically very

significant, as well as substantial, being in the range of the impacts found for the adoption

of KM policies (i.e., corresponding roughly to a KM intensity of 2 or 3). Lastly, there is a

clear indication that firms belonging to a group tend to patent more, and a weaker one that

they innovate more, while we find not specific impact of the use of Internet and ICT to

acquire and share information. As could be expected the impact of firm size and industry is

statistically significant and large, particularly so as concerns the impact of size on patent

propensity and intensity.8

    IV- KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTIVITY



    Besides focusing on the innovative performances of the firm, it is of interest to

investigate whether the adoption of knowledge management practices also appears to have

a specific impact, both statistically and economically significant, on labor productivity. To

do so, we use basically the same models than the ones just considered for product

innovation and patents, although with two differences. The first difference is that we can

simply rely on a linear regression specification instead of a generalized tobit. This

regression can be viewed as a simple extended production function (in log form), which is

of current use in econometric studies of R&D productivity.9 The second difference is that

we introduce (log) physical capital per employee as an additional control variable, since

these studies generally confirm that this is the major variable accounting for productivity

differences among firms.10


computed at sample means) are about 7.5% on both the innovation and patent propensities
and about 5.5% on both the innovation and patent intensities, while the differential impacts
between the lowest size group of firms of 20 to 49 employees and the largest size group of
2,000 and more employees are respectively about 10% and 30%, on the innovation and
patent propensities and about 5.5% and 25% on the corresponding intensities.
9
   We have also experimented using innovation or patent intensity (and an indicator for
being innovative or patenting) in the production function production, instead of R&D
intensity (and an indicator for doing R&D). The results are basically the same, with R&D
performing marginally better. For a review of econometric problems encountered in firm
level econometric studies on R&D productivity, in particular that of large discrepancies
between cross-sectional and time-series estimates on panel data, see the survey, still useful
though now incomplete, by Mairesse and Sassenou, 1991.
10
   We had to merge CIS3 with the French Survey of Enterprises in 2000 (“Enquête
Annuelle d’Entreprise 2000”) in order to be able to measure physical capital by the gross



                                                                                          18
                                      CHART 6 about here



    The results of estimation and tests for productivity are reported in the last column of

Tables 2, 3 and A5 and in Chart 6. The tests of the four models, corresponding to the

different ways of entering knowledge management in the productivity equation, tell us a

somewhat different story than for innovation and patenting. Model 3, in which the four KM

policy indicators are included separately, performs slightly better than the others: It is

statistically different from model 1 using our simple measure of KM intensity, but it is not

statistically different from the less parsimonious model 4 with fully interacted KM policy

indicators (while model 2 differs statistically from model 4, not from model 1). It is clear

that the four KM policies do not appear exchangeable anymore and remain only partly

cumulative. All else being equal, labor productivity is higher, and very significantly so, by

about 10% for firms implementing a policy to retain executives and employees (R) than for

firms which do not, and by about 5% for firms promoting a culture of knowledge sharing

(C) than for firms which do not. At the opposite, all else equal, labor productivity is not

statistically different (or barely so) between firms declaring that they have or that they have




book value of fixed assets, and also to measure labor productivity in terms of value added
per employee (rather than total turnover per employee). This is why the “labor productivity
sample” (3419 firms) is smaller by a few firms than the “full sample” (3474 firms) of the
previous sections. Note that using this sample we could have also included physical capital
intensity as an additional control variable in the innovation and patenting equations of
section III. When we do so, however, our results remain basically unchanged; if anything,
the estimated impacts of KM intensity on patenting propensity and intensity are slightly
less significant and lower.



                                                                                            19
not a policy to establish alliances to acquire knowledge (A), and a knowledge written

policy (W).



    The estimated elasticities of the physical capital intensity and of R&D intensity,

though somewhat on the low side, are consistent with what could be expected from

previous productivity studies (see Table A5 in the Appendix). Contrary to what we find for

innovation and patenting, the estimated impact of the implementation of new management

methods on productivity is barely statistically significant and if anything negative.




    V- TO CONCLUDE



    In this exploratory study of the diffusion and impact on firm performance of four

specific knowledge management (KM) policies for a large representative sample of French

manufacturing firms, we have found not very surprising results and more surprising ones

(at least to us), some of them satisfactory, but others puzzling.



    Among the expected results, we substantiate the fact that the diffusion of the four KM

policies is much more advanced in the larger firms and in the technology intensive

industries, and the fact that these practices appear highly complementary, firms tending to

adopt them jointly. Among the less obvious but satisfactory findings, we observe that the

impacts of KM practices on firm performance are in general statistically and economically

significant and more or less cumulative, even controlling for firm size, industry and other



                                                                                        20
important factors such as R&D intensity and physical capital intensity. It is also satisfactory

to find that these estimated impacts are on the high side, but still in the range of values that

one is a priori ready to accept as not implausible.



      Less desirable and somewhat puzzling is the observation that our four specific KM

practices are not only cumulative, but also apparently interchangeable in the case of

innovative performance. In this case the model with KM intensity, simply defined as the

number, varying from zero to four, of KM practices implemented by firms, performs

statistically as well as the one with the four individual KM indicators. An explanation may

be found in the collinearity (or high correlation) of these indicators naturally reflecting the

complementarity of KM practices, but also in the intrinsic crudeness and subjective nature

of such binary survey reported indicators, which is a likely source of measurement errors

(in the form of a misclassification across the yes and no answers). Also rather puzzling is

the finding that the estimated impacts of implementing new management methods in the

broad sense are about as large as the impacts of KM practices on firm innovative

performance, while they are if anything negative on firm productivity, unlike the positive

significant impacts of employees retention and knowledge sharing culture policies (R and

C).




                                                                                             21
      Further studies are of course needed to confirm, better understand and enrich these

exploratory results.11 It is clear that our econometric evidence of a significant impact of

knowledge management on firm performance does not necessarily mean causality, although

such a causal link is not a priori unlikely. It is also clear that our estimates are basically

cross-sectional estimates and as such susceptible to various heterogeneity biases. Although

they are not economically unreasonable, the orders of magnitude of the estimated impacts

we find seem indeed rather high; but, even if they were to be divided by two, or even by

three, they still would remain appreciable.

     In a recent micro econometric study based on information from a specific survey on
“Firm Competencies to Innovate” for French manufacturing, merged with the innovation
data from CIS2 (concerning the period 1994-1996), Galia and Legros find results which
overall seem in accordance with ours.



                                                                                           22

           Knowledge Management in the Third Community Innovation Survey (CIS3)

                                        for French manufacturing



        The Third Community Innovation Survey, which covers the period 1998-2000, was

    conducted in France jointly by INSEE and the Statistical Departments of the three

    Ministries respectively in charge of the manufacturing industries, agriculture, and

    commercial, financial and research and engineering services. It is a mandatory survey. The

    SESSI (Service des Etudes et Statistiques Industrielles) was in charge of surveying some

    5500 manufacturing firms with 20 employees or more. Firms have been chosen randomly,

    using the business register based on legal units and according to the following stratified

    sampling design:

•         all firms over 500 employees

•         1/2 for firms from 100 to 499 employees

•         1/4 for firms from 50 to 99 employees

•         1/8 for firms from 20 to 49 employees



        The rate of response was of 86%, corresponding to an overall coverage of 89% of the

    total turnover for the manufacturing sector in 2000. See below the paragraph on the

    weighting of the results presented in this study.




                                                                                           23
    The four questions on Knowledge Management…



    Four questions directly referring to firm policies and strategies of knowledge

management have been introduced in the French CIS3 for manufacturing industries. These

questions have been chosen as particularly meaningful among the 23 questions on

knowledge management considered in the pilot survey by Statistics Canada (L. Earl and F.

Gault, 2003) They are the following:

    - By the end of 2000, did your firm have a written knowledge management policy? (W)

    - Did it have a culture to promote knowledge sharing? (C)

    - Did it put into practice an incentive policy to retain employees and executives in

firm? (R)

    - Did it forge partnerships or alliances for knowledge acquisition? (A)



    …and three other related ones.



      The French CIS3 for manufacturing industries also includes three other questions

which can be related to the KM policies. They concern the adoption of new management

practices in general and the use of Internet and ICT to acquire and share information for

innovation purposes. They are the following:

    - From 1998 to 2000, did your company implement new managerial methods?

    - Do you use the Internet to acquire information (from the different possible sources,

whether internal or external, private or public) for your innovating activities?




                                                                                       24
    - Do employees use ICT resources (data updates, Intranet, and so on) to share

information from external sources?

    Note that, since the answers to these last two questions on Internet and ICT are

strongly correlated, we pooled them as one binary indicator in our econometric analysis.

Note also that these questions were only asked to the innovating firms (that is, in

accordance to the definitions of the OECD Oslo Manual, firms which have introduced new

or significantly improved products or production processes during the 1998-2000 period).



      Weighting of Results



       The descriptive statistics shown in Charts 1 to 4 and Table 1 in the text, and in

Tables A1 and A2 in the Appendix, are weighted to be representative of the manufacturing

sector (i.e., in order to take into account the differences by size and industry in the sampling

and response rates). However, the descriptive statistics in Table A4 in the Appendix and the

econometric estimates presented in Charts 5 and 6 and Tables 2 and 3 in the text, as well as

in Tables A3 to A5 in the Appendix, are not weighted. We have simply introduced size and

industry indicators in all the estimated econometric models. We have also checked that the

weighted econometric estimates were not meaningfully different from the unweighted ones.

Definitions
The intensity of knowledge management is equal to zero when the firm implements none of
the four KM practices; and to 1, 2, 3 or 4 respectively, when the firm implements at least
one, two, three, or all four.
The classification of industry by technological intensity is mainly based on the average
ratio of R&D to output of the industry at the CITI rev2 level (OECD, 1997). See Table A1,
in the Appendix for some indications about the link between classification of industries by
technological intensity and the NES36 classification.
Lecture: Firms with more than 2,000 employees have a knowledge management intensity
of 2.7; firms belonging to the high-intensive industries have a knowledge management
intensity of 1.6.
Scope: Manufacturing firms with 20 employees or more (excluding the food industry),
weighted results.

The generalized tobit models for innovation (columns 1 and 2) and patents (columns 3 and
4) are estimated by the method of maximum likelihood. The linear regression model for
labor productivity (column 5) is estimated by ordinary least squares (which coincides with
maximum likelihood for the estimated coefficients and practically for their standard errors)
***, **, and * respectively indicate that the estimated coefficients are statistically



                                                                                               35
significant at the 1%, 5% or 10% confidence level. These coefficients are directly given in
the table in terms of the marginal effects computed at the sample means, respectively as a
probability in % for the propensity to innovate and to patent equations, and as a share in %
for the corresponding intensity equations. These estimated coefficients coincide with the
(constant) marginal effects for the productivity equation. Rho is the estimated correlation
coefficient between the error terms of the propensity and intensity equations of the
generalized tobit models
All equations also include 14 industry indicators and 7 firm size indicators and the other
relevant factors as defined in TableA4 in the Appendix. The coefficients (in terms of
marginal effects) of all these other relevant factors are given in the Table A5 in the
Appendix for the Model 1.

Definitions:
This table is based on the NES36 classification, corresponding to 14 different
manufacturing industries. The classification of industry by technological intensity is mainly
based on the average ratio of R&D to output of the industry at the CITI rev2 level (OECD,
1997). An approximate correspondence to the NES114 is possible but not to the NES36, the

To roughly indicate the degree of technological intensity of the 14 NES36 manufacturing
industries, the existence of sub-industry of different technological intensity is noted in
parentheses, where HT, MH, ML and LT stand respectively for High-Tech., Medium High

Definitions: The propensity to innovate variable is measured by the proportion of firms
earning a turnover from new or significantly changed products on the market from 1998 to
2000 (in %).
The propensity to patent variable is measured by the proportion of firms having patented
products in 2000 (in %).
The innovation intensity variable is measured by the logit function of the share ( or “logit-
share”), in the firm’s total turnover in 2000, of the turnover from new or significantly
changed products introduced on the market from 1998 to 2000 (in %).
The patent intensity variable is measured by the by the logit function of the share ( or
“logit-share”), in the firm’s total turnover in 2000, of the patented products sales (in %).
The labor Productivity variable is measured by the logarithm of the firm’s value added to
the total number of employees in 2000 (in K€ per person).
The physical capital intensity variable is measured by the logarithm of the firm’s gross
book value to the total number employees in 2000 (in K€ per person).
The R&D intensity variable is measured by the logarithm of the share of the firm’s R&D
expenditures in the firm’s total turnover in 2000.
The knowledge management intensity variable is measured by the number (from 0 to four)
of knowledge management practices implemented by firms (see definition in chart 3).
The group, new management methods, Internet and ICT for external data sharing use, and
non R&D doing variables are binary 0-1 indicators (respectively equal to 1 if the firms
belong to a group, have adopted new management methods, Internet and ICT for external
data sharing use, or are NOT doing R&D).
The 14 industry and 7 size binary indicators are defined on the base of the classification of
industries shown in Table A1 in the Appendix and of the groupings by total number of
employees used in Chart 1 in the text.
Scope: Manufacturing companies with 20 employees or more (excluding the food
industry), not weighted.
