          EXPORT RESTRAINTS WITH IMPERFECT COMPETITION:     A SELECTIVE SURVEY


                                      ABSTRACT

       This paper is a selective survey of the work on the                  effects

of export restraints        with imperfect competition. Although              there

are a number of excellent surveys of strategic                   trade theory as a

whole.     not much    attention is     paid in these           to the   effects of

export     restraints per se.      The large      and growing        literature in

this     area   is    explicitly game    theoretic        and    contains    a wide

variety of models which         often yield different results.              For this

reason.     the literature in this area          can be difficult to follow.

       This survey provides       a stylized overview of            the area which

serves as a guide to the         work. Short run effects are             contrasted

to long run effects. The short run effects usually studied are on

pricing     behavior. Long      run effects are      multidimensional. These

include effects on quality choice and investment which often work

in the opposite direction to the short run effects.
