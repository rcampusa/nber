Fertility in New York State in the Civil War Era

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes a five percent systematic sample of households from the manuscripts of the New
York State Census of 1865, the first in the United States to ask a question on children ever born. The
sample of seven counties (Allegany, Dutchess, Montgomery, Rensselaer, Steuben, Tompkins, and
Warren) was selected to provide a diversity of locations, settlement dates, and types of agricultural
economy. The parity data indicate a strong decline in marital fertility during the first part of the 19th
Century; little evidence of fertility control within marriage is found for the oldest women in the sample,
but analysis of parity progression ratios indicates that control had emerged by the midpoint of the 19th
Century. Fertility decline was initially most evident in the urban, more economically developed areas,
but eventual levels were equal in the urban and rural parts of the sample. While a marital fertility
transition occurred in 19th Century New York, many couples continued to have quite high levels of
fertility, indicating the difficulty that many couples probably faced in controlling their reproduction.

INTRODUCTION

  The first sustained fertility declines occurred on the European continent and in areas of

overseas European settlement in the 19th century. Most studies of the transitions have

concentrated on the last two or three decades of the nineteenth century, when fertility

commenced its decline in many presently developed nations (Coale and Watkins 1986). There is

also a body of research on the earlier fertility declines in France and in the United States, areas

which innovated in the transition to the small family (van de Walle 1978; Wrigley 1985;

Easterlin 1977; Vinovskis 1981; Smith 1987).

  Interpretations of the general Western fertility transition have varied greatly. Some (Caldwell

1982) have viewed the transition as causally related to the process of social and economic

transformation occurring in Europe, particularly the declining economic utility of children, while

others (Knodel and van de Walle 1979; Lesthaeghe 1983) have argued that the structural changes

were only weakly related to the transition. Rather, they have emphasized such factors as the

diffusion of technical knowledge about fertility control and cultural receptiveness to the idea of

relatively small families.          .

   The U.S. fertility transition of the nineteenth century constitutes an important, although

somewhat unique, part of the general European transition. By 1800, the white population of the

United States apparently had one of the highest fertility rates in the world, certainly in Europe

and North America (Sanderson 1979). During the nineteenth century, a long-term decline in

U.S. fertility occurred, although it was by no means continuously sustained (Tolnay et al. 1982;

Smith 1987). In addition, earlier and more rapid decline was especially characteristic of the New

England and Middle Atlantic states, including New York. Little consensus exists on why the U.

S. fertility transition occurred in the early to middle 19th Century. Hacker (2003) argues that the
                                                  3
fertility transition was only weakly related to changes in marital fertility patterns; rather,

increases in the age at marriage and increasing levels of mortality produced overall declines in

child-woman ratios.

   The present paper will utilize individual and household level data from the manuscripts of

the 1865 New York State census to investigate patterns of fertility in seven counties that

represent the social and economic diversity of the state. Particularly useful are the data on

children ever born (parity), collected for adult women as part of the regular enumeration in June,

1865. This census seems to have been the first regular enumeration in human history to have

asked such a question. (1) The manuscripts also contain information on the name, age, sex, race,

marital status, place of birth, race, and relationship to head of household of each household

member. By using the household data, we match characteristics of wives with their husbands

and study recent childbearing by matching own children records with their mothers.

    Using the children ever born data, we document declining fertility within marriage and the

probable emergence of low to moderate levels of fertility control. In addition, using published

data from the 1865 census on aggregate characteristics of the over 900 towns and cities of the

state, we show how social structural characteristics of communities such as economic levels and

the availability of farmland influenced fertility variations.

RESEARCH ON THE U.S. FERTILITY TRANSITION

   Research on the causes of the U.S. fertility transition has traditionally been somewhat

detached from studies of the European transition, although they involved similar time points and

cultural groups. A central scholarly question has been why the United States had a fertility

transition when it was still predominantly rural. More traditional demographic transition theory

(Mason 1997) has viewed rural conditions as generally incompatible with fertility decline for a
                                                   4
variety of reasons, including the relatively high economic utility of children in agricultural

production and the difficulty of farm women in developing distinctive work roles that would

provide clear alternatives to childbearing.

   In dealing with the causes of the American rural fertility decline, research by economists has

stressed shortages of available farmland as a major factor (Easterlin et al. 1978; Forster and

Tucker 1972; Leet 1976; Schapiro 1982; Yasuba 1962). As the century progressed, farmland

became scarcer and more expensive, especially in the older, longer settled portions of the United

States. Thus, families are hypothesized to have experienced cost increases which led to fertility

restriction. These included difficulties in providing endowments (especially land) to children

when family size was large, and also problems among the younger generation in marshalling

resources to afford marriage. Resulting delayed marriage would have restricted the time in the

reproductive life cycle for childbearing.

   Other research (Leasure 1982) has explained the American fertility decline as a consequence

of the rise of individualism, which allowed families to reject traditional high fertility norms.

Leasure has primarily measured individualism across geographic areas in terms of the proportion

of residents who belonged to Protestant Churches with a strong emphasis on freewill in religious

commitment, especially Congregationalists, Friends, Presbyterians, Unitarians, and

Universalists. Leasure's approach is somewhat similar to that of Lesthaeghe (1983) which

explains the continental European decline in terms of cultural factors such as the secularization

of the society.

   Still other research (Guest 1981; Guest and Tolnay 1983) has attempted to relate the U.S.

transition in the late 1800's more directly to causes that have been discussed in relationship to the

European continental transition. Two factors have been especially emphasized: first, the growing
                                                  5
trend toward urbanization and industrialization, and, second, the growing economic costs of

children through increasing enrollment in school during the teenage years, rather than

employment. Since the growth of U.S. educational systems was not always closely associated

with urbanization or industrialization (Guest and Tolnay 1985), it could exert an independent

influence on fertility in a relatively rural society. In addition, the farm mechanization of the

United States has been viewed as an important social force which reduced the need for

agricultural labor, thus limiting the economic utility of farm children (Guest 1981). Some of this

research (Guest 1981) suggests that the availability of improved farm land affected fertility

through delaying marriage, rather than directly within marriage. In other words, land availability

itself may have had only a weak causal relationship to variations in marital fertility.

   Consistent with this perspective is research (Sundstrom and David 1988) that stresses the

increase in employment opportunities for farm children resulting from the growth of urban areas

and non-agricultural industries. Children lost much of their value to parents because they were

decreasingly willing to wait through adulthood to provide old age support and inherit the farm.

Carter, Ransom, and Sutch (2004) generally agree with this model, but also note that other life

cycle factors such as increasing rates of school attendance made children economically costly for

farm parents. They reject the target-bequest model implied by the land availability hypothesis.

   There are several problems with previous research on the American transition. The vast bulk

of the studies before 1880 are aggregative in nature, typically relying on crude measures of

fertility such as child-women ratios (see Smith 1987). One notable exception to this are the

studies of the northern United States in 1860 using the Bateman-Foust sample by Easterlin

(1976) and Easterlin, Alter, and Condran (1978). The fertility measures were, however, simple

marital child-woman ratios. While aggregative studies are useful, it has generally been
                                                  6
impossible to determine the degree to which fertility was related to broad aspects of the

environment (included in the analysis) as opposed to more immediate household characteristics

which have typically not been included.(2) Some important household predictors might be

social-economic position and economic well-being. In addition, the studies have frequently

considered a limited range of aggregate predictors, typically providing poor coverage of such

characteristics as urbanization- industrialization, and the development of educational systems.

Clearly, the measurement of fertility could also be improved.

NEW YORK STATE IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY

  Data from the federal and state censuses of New York permit some very rough estimates of

crude birth rates for various time points in the early and middle 1800's. Federal data are

available for years ending in 0, while state data are based on years ending in 5. Using the

published sources, we have estimated the ratio of enumerated infant children under 1 per 1,000

total population. These numbers undoubtedly underestimate fertility in the population, due to

inability to adjust directly for high infant mortality and also probable high underenumeration of

children under 1 year of age, but they provide a first approximation to fertility trends.

  The data suggest little linear trend in fertility. The relatively high fertility in the late 1830's

and early 1840's was followed by sharp decline in the late 1840's. Fertility then increased again

in the early 1850's, to be followed by another decline from 1855 to 1865. The estimated infant-

population ratios (children aged 0 per 1,000 population) by year are 1835, 35.5; 1845, 34.5;

1850, 24.3; 1855, 29.6; 1860, 26.7; 1865, 24.3 (Guest, 1990). Certainly, the figures for 1835 and

1845 indicate quite high fertility, especially given the fact that the total births have not been

adjusted upward to account for the (probably) high rate of infant mortality. For the 1850 through

1865 enumerations, it was also possible to calculate more refined rates based on the age of
                                                   7
women in the reproductive years. These measures suggest the same general conclusions as the

cruder infant-woman ratio.

  Some of the fluctuations in fertility may have reflected the importance of foreign migration to

the United States; the immigrants, especially drawn from Ireland and Germany, clearly had

higher fertility than the U.S. natives in the Northeast. In addition, fertility changes from 1860 to

1865 may indicate the influence of the American Civil War, which drew large numbers of

younger men from their local communities. Some portion of the fluctuations was probably due

to changes in accuracy of enumeration of infants and fluctuations in infant mortality (such as that

possibly caused by the cholera epidemic of 1849).

  Fortunately, there are several available studies which use data from the New York state census

to investigate historical fertility patterns. These studies may be divided on the basis of whether

they primarily focus on individual (microdemographic) or aggregate-level social correlates of

fertility. The individual-level studies, of different counties and time periods, share less

agreement on the correlates of fertility variation than the aggregate studies.

   Perhaps the major original analysis of the 1865 census data was Bash's (1955)

microdemographic study of Madison County, in the central Finger Lakes area of the state, which

had originally been settled in the late 1700s and early 1800s by natives of New England. His

study was especially important because he related various household and individual social

characteristics to fertility variation, albeit within one limited geographic area. Predominantly

rural, Madison County was characterized by relatively (although not strikingly) low fertility in

comparison to the rest of the state. Of the "independent" variables considered, foreign birth was

a strong positive predictor of fertility, while white collar workers had somewhat lower fertility

than unskilled workers. Interestingly, farm owners and farm tenants-laborers did not stand out
                                                  8
for especially low or high fertility. While perhaps unanticipated, this finding was reasonable,

given the fact that predominantly agricultural Madison County did not stand out for high overall

fertility within the state. Another good correlate of fertility was the value of the dwelling, with

owners of the cheapest dwellings having the highest fertility.

  Bash also considered the role of farm characteristics in differentiating fertility among the

agricultural population. Neither value of the farm nor value of farm tools and implements was

especially useful for differentiating fertility behavior; interestingly, fertility was highest among

the poorest and richest farms. He did not report data on the relationship between farm size and

land availability, on the one hand, and fertility variations, on the other hand.

  On the whole, then, the data suggest that measures of social status and birthplace were more

useful for understanding fertility than measures of variations in agricultural life. Such results

imply that aspects of social and economic aspirations for themselves or their children may have

been important in understanding New York fertility variation, at least in Madison County. Or,

household roles of men and women may have varied by social status, affecting fertility behavior.

   A somewhat different empirical perspective on fertility variations at the time is provided by

Stern (1987) in his study of Erie County, which includes the large city of Buffalo. He used

child-women ratios (children aged 0-4 divided by reproductive age women) for 1855, rather than

differences in children ever born for 1865. While useful, comparisons of child-women ratios

across groups may suffer from differential infant and early childhood mortality. In contrast to

Bash, Stern finds relatively small fertility differences over urban occupational classes, except for

the low fertility of professionals (Stern 1987, P. 52). Stern did discover that occupational

differences emerged much more clearly by 1900. Similar to Bash, Stern (1987, P. 56)

ascertained that foreign born women had somewhat higher fertility than the natives in 1855.
                                                  9
   Some of Stern's most interesting findings relate to fertility differentials among farm families

in Erie County in 1855. Contrary to the land availability thesis, farmers with small amounts of

unimproved land were not characterized by especially low fertility. For farm owners, most

agricultural characteristics related to their wealth, mechanization, and land availability made

little difference in fertility. However, among tenants, the high fertility of the poorest farmers

stood out (Stern 1987, p. 124), a finding which would seem quite incompatible with the idea that

fertility restriction occurred due to the difficulty of assembling one's or children's land.

  The pioneer aggregate study of historical fertility patterns in New York was conducted by

Bash (1963) who analyzed variation in child-women ratios for townships throughout the state in

1855, 1865, and 1875. Using analysis of variance techniques, he found that population density,

proportion native born, farm land value, and value of home dwellings were all negative

predictors of fertility levels. While he did not especially emphasize the fact, the value of

dwellings stood out as the strongest predictor. The child-women ratios were highly correlated

over the time periods, but the evidence in his study clearly suggested that related factors such as

population density and urbanization were decreasingly important as predictors of variations in

child-women ratios. Indeed, there were few urban-rural differences in fertility in 1875. Bash’s

procedures involved tests for the importance of a quite limited number of community-level

variables. Furthermore, the independent variables were not all considered together as predictors,

to determine their relative power when the other variables were controlled.

  Guest (1990) has also analyzed the aggregate-level correlates of New York fertility for

counties in 1865, using data reported in the state census on parity distributions of native and

foreign-born ever-married women, regardless of age. The probability of having any births and

the probability of advancing from the fifth to the sixth births were the major dependent variables.
                                                  10
These two variables were considered separately because childlessness might be a different

phenomenon than other fertility decisions. Indeed, the geographical distribution of the two

progression ratios was somewhat different. Interestingly, childlessness was especially high in

some of the most rural parts of the state, especially in the central region (such as Madison

County).

   One virtue of Guest's study is the large number of independent variables in the analysis. Not

surprisingly, parity progression ratios across counties were influenced by the female age

structure and the prevalence of early, universal marriage. There were also a large number of

social and economic variables which correlated with both progression ratios, including measures

of economic development, educational orientation, land availability, urbanization and

industrialization, orientation to religion and religious individualism, and the state-national

birthplace origins of the residents. While several variables were correlated with parity

progression ratios, the number of variables with a clear independent influence on fertility was

relatively small. In particular, the value of homes was a striking negative correlate of both

progression ratios. This was true for both native and foreign-born women. In addition, the

importance of school attendance as a positive predictor of childlessness for native women was

clearly evident. A major limitation of Guest’s study was his inability to control directly for the

age structure of the women. Patterns among older women, for instance, might be different from

those among younger women.

   The finding in both aggregate studies about the importance of home value to understanding

fertility variation is quite consistent with previous studies of France and Massachusetts about the

same time (McQuillan 1984; Van de Walle 1978; Vinovskis 1981). In addition, it is consistent

with two non-aggregate studies (Ryan 1981; Stern 1987) which emphasize the relationship of
                                                 11
economic prosperity and materialism in nineteenth century New York to changes in the nature of

families, especially in the business and professional classes. Stern's study of Erie County

(Buffalo) and Ryan's of Oneida County (Utica) argue that growing prosperity was associated

with a breakdown in traditional communal or patriarchal families. Opportunities to achieve

economic prosperity led families to emphasize the acquisition of goods and material possessions

rather than children, and to concentrate their wealth on enhancing the occupational and

educational opportunities of a limited number of children. Large numbers of children simply

contributed little directly to the family economy, and the family's material prosperity was

primarily enhanced by the efforts of the husband in a market-oriented economy.

   From this review of studies, it seems clear that areal variations in New York state fertility in

the mid-1800's probably related most strongly to "modernization" variables, especially

associated with economic development and the importance of educational systems. On the

whole, strong evidence for the direct importance of agricultural systems cannot be clearly

discerned, especially when one focuses on the role of land availability. Indeed, the land

availability arguments are not supported at the individual level either. The studies of individual-

level variation in fertility seem confusing on the major social correlates of low fertility.

SAMPLE AND METHODS

   The present analysis will proceed from a five percent systematic sample of the 1865 census

manuscripts for seven counties: Allegany, Dutchess, Montgomery, Rensselaer, Steuben,

Tompkins, and Warren. These particular counties were selected to represent various regions of

the state with different dates of settlement and varied economies. Some of their characteristics

are shown in Table 1.(3) So, for example, Allegany is located in the far western part of the state,

while Warren is located by the Adirondack mountains in the northeastern portion of the state.
                                                  12
Both Allegany and Warren counties were relatively newly settled (by New York standards), had

a high proportion of adult males as farmers, rather low urbanization, low home values, and lower

fractions of agricultural land improved. In contrast, the longer settled counties of Dutchess,

Montgomery, and Rensselaer had much higher levels of urbanization and lower proportions of

farmers among the adult male population, higher home values, and high proportions of total

agricultural land improved. Dutchess and Rensselaer are located in the Hudson valley and

Montgomery was located somewhat west of them and Albany in the Mohawk valley. On the

whole, Tompkins and close-by Steuben, in the central Finger Lakes region, represent

intermediate cases between the other two groups of counties, although parts of Steuben sit in the

plateau of the Allegany Mountains. The sample contains two urban areas of significant size, the

cities of Troy (with a population of 39,293 persons in 1865) in Rensselaer County and

Poughkeepsie (with 16,073 inhabitants in 1865) in Dutchess County.

  The overall sample contains 16,360 individuals in 3,325 households, representing 4.77 percent

of the 343,150 individuals in these seven counties enumerated in the census of 1865. This is a

bit less than the sampling fraction of five percent because of some missing and illegible

manuscript pages and uninhabited dwellings which were encountered in the sampling procedure.

The sampling procedure was to take every twentieth household in each enumeration district with

a random starting point at the beginning which was different for each county.(4)

                TABLES 1 AND 2 ABOUT HERE

   The context of the fertility decline in the seven counties is given by Table 2. Child-woman

ratios (children aged under 5 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 49) are calculated for the white

population (the total population in 1855 and 1865). They are based on both the published

Federal and state census documents. It is clear that (a) New York State was experiencing a
                                                13
fertility transition in this era, albeit uneven (e.g., the 1850s); (b) fertility ratios were lower in

New York than the average for the nation as a whole; (c) fertility outside New York City was

generally higher than in the city; (d) this difference tended to converge over time; and (e) the

experience of the seven sample counties tracked that of New York outside New York City,

although the decline in the seven counties was a bit more rapid between 1830 and 1875.

  In the subsequent analysis of the relationship between community characteristics and fertility,

the basic geographic unit will be the township (town). As in other Northeastern states, New

York townships have historically been major social and political units, and the 1865 census

reports numerous characteristics for each. In 1865, there were over 900 townships in New York,

and our analysis uses the 192 towns in the seven counties. In addition, the 16 total political

wards of Poughkeepsie and Troy, the two largest places, will be treated as equivalent to

townships.

FERTILITY IN NEW YORK STATE, 1865

  When provided with such data on children ever born, one of the first questions to be asked

concerns average parities by age. Table 3 tabulates average parity by age of women for the total

sample, for the foreign-born population, and for the rural and urban native populations. Parities

are calculated for ever-married women (i.e., currently married, widowed, or divorced). In

general, historical trends in fertility may be inferred by comparing age groups of women over 45,

since the biological ability to bear children is generally quite low after this age.

                     TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE

   A perusal of Table 3 indicates that there was a relatively regular increase of parities with age

among the native born women (including the ever-married), lending confidence to the reliability

of the data. This result also provides important direct confirmation of the fertility decline in the
                                                   14
United States in the first half of the nineteenth century. Among ever-married native-born

women, the declines in average parity were from seven for women aged 75-79 (i.e., born

1786/90 and in their peak childbearing years during the period approximately 1806/1825) down

to 4.6 children per woman aged 45-49 (i.e., born 1816/20 and in their peak childbearing years

during about 1836/1855). Unfortunately, the sample sizes at the oldest ages for these

subsamples are relatively small and thus subject to larger sampling errors. Nonetheless, the

results from analysis of child-woman ratios and other aggregate census tabulations are strongly

supported by these parity data. Doubts about the reality of the decline of fertility among white

American women in the antebellum period can be assuaged by these data.

  The patterns for the foreign born women, disproportionately drawn from Ireland, Germany,

and the United Kingdom, show little regular change in the age groups over 45. There are some

problems of interpretation, because the sample sizes in various age groups are typically quite

small. However, the data are consistent with the general conclusion that the fertility transition

had not begun yet in most of the European countries.

   Especially interesting are the longitudinal differences in fertility among the native born urban

and rural women. There are striking declines in fertility among both groups of women,

indicating a transition in both populations. However, the relationship of urbanization to fertility

changes with the age of the women. Among the women over 45, who have typically completed

their reproductive periods, there is a general tendency for rural fertility to be higher than urban.

However, among the women under 45, there is hardly any relationship between urban residence

and fertility. This is consistent with Bash’s (1963) cross-sectional analysis of child/women

ratios across New York counties between 1855 and 1875. The data thus suggest that the fertility

transition spread from the urban to the rural areas, but the fertility level of the urban women was
                                                 15
still quite high in 1865 (at least by the standards of the 21st Century in the United States).

                                             FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE

   Figure 1 summarizes changes in the nature of reproduction among native-born New York

women, according to the 1865 Census. The horizontal dimension indicates the approximate year

of birth of ever married native born women. We cannot determine the exact year of birth, but we

can approximate it by subtracting age in years from 1865. The state census was taken in the

middle of the year and age (rather than year of birth) was obtained. The four curves indicate,

respectively, the proportion who reported births of at least 1, 3, 5, and 7. If one focuses on the

proportion having at least seven births, the transition was quite dramatic and continuous. Of

women completing their childbearing at the time of the Civil War, only slightly more than 20

percent had as many as seven births, while over 50 percent of women who were born in the late

1700s had this number. The data in regard to having at least five children present a similar

portrait, although the percentage decline is less over the birth cohorts. Clearly, the transition

primarily represented the continuous decline of the very large family.

   One of the major trends of the very late 1800s and the 20th Century was the gradual

emergence of a 2 to 3 child family norm among American women (David and Sanderson 1987a;

Ryder 1969). Consistent with this, our New York data, for an earlier period, show little

indication of a convergence on what might be described as the “modern” American family.

Indeed, Figure 1 actually shows a decline, albeit slight, over the birth cohorts in the proportion

having three children.

   Of special interest are the data on childlessness for women who reported on children ever

born and gave an answer of zero. This pattern may be inferred from Figure 1 for the curve

showing ever-married native women over 45 who had a least one birth. In general, childlessness
                                                  16
over the age cohorts was less than 7 percent (except for the youngest women) and shows no

longitudinal trend. Most likely, these numbers are quite low and indicate little voluntary

childlessness. So, for example, the tabulations of parity from the 1910 Federal census

manuscripts done by the Bureau of the Census reveal, for ever-married white women, 9.6 percent

childless for women aged 45-49 and 7.9 percent for women aged 70-74. This was 11.1 percent

and 9.1 percent, respectively, for women residing in the Middle Atlantic Region (which included

New York) (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1943). The 1911 Census of Marriage and Fertility of

England and Wales revealed that only 5.8 percent of women married in the period 1861-1870

and married at ages 20-24 remained childless. Among the same marriage cohort but married at

ages 25-29, 9.9 percent remained childless (Leridon 1977). Tolnay and Guest (1982) note

percentages childless beyond reproductive ages among women in natural fertility populations of

3 to about 10 percent, depending on marriage age. Such comparisons would indicate that older

ever-married native women in New York State in 1865 were not controlling fertility generally

with voluntary childlessness. A high proportion of women at zero parity at ages above 45

probably experienced biological sterility either themselves or through their spouses.

   It is possible that some of the longitudinal trends in fertility that we have identified were due

to changes in nuptiality, with an increasingly late age at marriage reducing the fecund

reproductive period for couples. Unfortunately, the 1865 census data do not permit investigation

of the changing age at marriage, but the New York State censuses in the middle of the nineteenth

century also preceded the Federal census in eliciting information on marital status. The data

indicate that nuptiality in New York at this point in time was not greatly different from that

found at the end of the nineteenth century. In addition, among all native born women over 40 in

1865, there was essentially no relationship between age and the percentage never marrying.
                                                 17
Generally, populations have a strong positive relationship between late marriage and percentage

never marrying.(5)

  Concerns have been expressed (David and Sanderson 1987a) about using unadjusted

retrospective data on children ever born to study historical changes in fertility across birth

cohorts. Two major problems have been outlined. First, due to differential mortality by parity,

older women may be a selective sample of the women who actually bore children at earlier

points in time. David and Sanderson (1987a) suggest that in populations with low fertility

control, high parity women (due to good health) tend to have high survivorship. They also infer

that in populations with high fertility control the low parity women have higher survivorship

(due to better self-care in regard to health matters).

  In contrast, Shryock and Siegel (1971, 512) reach more cautious conclusions on the basis of

reviewing reports of children ever born by specific age cohorts over several U.S. censuses. They

claim “[t]here is no definite evidence, however, that mortality is selective of the more fertile

women.” Much of David and Sanderson’s argument is based on an analysis of children ever

born reports by cohort in the 1910 and 1940 U.S. censuses, where some discrepancies occur

(U.S. Bureau of the Census 1945). But Shryock and Siegel point out that the questions in the

two censuses were worded differently and the censuses had somewhat different rates of

nonresponse to the questions. Shyrock and Siegel find virtually no trend in children ever born

for birth cohorts of women who could be traced over 20th Century censuses.

  A second potential problem is differential recall by age, so that older women are less likely to

remember births than younger women. This potential problem would have the effect of

understating the differences we have found by age cohort. Much of the concern about this issue

is apparently based on observations of “nonnumerate” societies (Brass and Coale 1968: 91), but
                                                  18
the adult native-born population of New York in the 19th Century was highly literate (although

not necessarily highly educated) as Table 1 shows for the seven counties.

PARITY DISTRIBUTION

  Since the women in the sample report the specific number of children ever born, it is valuable

to use parity progression ratios to inspect patterns of childbearing in New York in the early and

mid-19th Century relative to other populations. The average number of births among a group of

women may obscure interesting information about the distribution of family sizes. Parity

progression ratios measure the probability of having an additional birth (n + 1) once one has

achieved “n” births.

  There should be a natural tendency in any population for the progression ratios to decline

slightly with the parity number, partly because women at high parities are, on average, older than

women at low parities, and thus have lower fecundity. But, in general, parity progression ratios

should show little decline with parity in populations over 45 that do not practice conscious birth

control, primarily because couples make little effort to stop childbearing at any socially

acceptable number before reaching the end of the fertile reproductive period. While high parity

progression ratios are consistent with low fertility control, they do not indicate whether the

children are desired. Survey studies in the last part of the 20th century show, nevertheless, a

clear tendency for American women of high parity to report an unusually high number of births

that were not desired or occurred at the “wrong time” in the parents’ life cycle (Bumpass and

Westoff 1970).

                                        FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE

   Figure 2 shows the pattern of parity progression ratios for two North American populations

that are believed to exert only minimal control over their fertility. One set of ratios is reported
                                                 19
by Eaton and Mayer (1953, Sheps 1965) for the well-known Hutterite population, over the age of

45 in 1950. These women had a median number of 10.4 children and are believed to have

exerted virtually no conscious control over their fertility. The Hutterite parity progression ratios

show only a mild decline with parity. The other set of ratios is based on data for Old Order

Amish women over 45 in 1964 in Holmes County, Ohio. As the authors Cross and McKusick

note (1970, 100), “[d]elayed marriage is the only detectable means of family limitation.” We

have arbitrarily set the progression ratio to the first birth as 1.0 because the data source does not

permit exact calculation, although it is clear from the materials that the ratio is actually slightly

lower. The Amish parity progression ratios are quite similar to the Hutterite pattern but show

slightly more decline, a pattern that may be due primarily to the later age of marriage of women

and to possibly poorer fecundity due to health, but may also indicate some very slight degree of

conscious fertility control.

  Certainly, the oldest New York women should have parity progression ratios that are similar

to the Hutterites and Amish, partly because fertility levels were so high. But, adult men and

women in the Civil War period did not have access to the easy-to-use and effective contraceptive

techniques that have become important in the past few decades. One may presume that a high

degree of sexual self-control was required to guarantee that women would bear not more than

two or three children. Abortion was available, but was not generally sanctioned positively.

Sexual abstinence for long and short periods was undoubtedly practiced, but required great

“moral” restraint. Condoms were available but the materials of construction (such as leather

sheaths) were not conducive to sexual pleasure. There was, however, a substantial literature

related to contraception and abortion, which grew in the antebellum period (Brodie 1994, chs. 5-

6). Just how much of it was accessed by rural and working class people is, however, unclear.
                                                  20
  Two sets of ratios are shown in Figure 2 for native ever-married women in the sample of the

seven New York counties, for women 45-59 in 1865 and women over 60 in 1865. While ratios

could be calculated for more detailed age groups, we have presented these two due to the fact

that the sample sizes became embarrassingly small with more age-specific groups. Women over

60 would have typically borne children at least 20 years earlier, before 1845.

  The pattern for married women over 60 (born approximately before 1805) is strikingly similar

to the Amish pattern, suggesting little (but perhaps some) conscious fertility control. The over-

60 pattern has less overlap with the Hutterites, who almost certainly practiced virtually no

conscious fertility control. Since age at marriage data for these older New York women are

unavailable, we cannot assess its role in the progression ratios. Nevertheless, the singulate mean

age of marriage (Hajnal 1953) among native-born New York women in the reproductive ages

was about 23.6 compared to a reported age of 22.6 for all wives among the Holmes County

Amish (Cross and McKusick 1970). The most plausible conclusion is that these older women

exerted, at best, quite low control over their fertility.

  In contrast, the pattern for New York women 45-59 (born approximately between 1806 and

1820) does suggest clearly the emergence of birth control. They diverge more significantly than

the oldest New York women from the patterns of the low-control Hutterite and Amish

populations. This divergence is small at the lower parities, indicating that almost all women

were still bearing at least some children and that the “modern” family of less than 3 children was

quite unusual. But the divergence is more evident at the highest parities, suggesting that

significant proportions of New York women 45-59 in 1865 were targeting a smaller family size

and trying to control their fertility. Note, nevertheless, that in this sample of New York women

45-59 in 1865, the probability of another birth is still greater than 75 percent at each of the
                                                   21
reported parities, indicating little consensus on a specific family size target and implying

(probably) low overall levels of conscious fertility control. In other words, these New York

women were quite varied, compared to contemporary women, in the levels of reproduction.

While a significant number were making serious efforts to control their fertility, a significant

number were also making few efforts in this direction. In addition, there was little evidence of a

consensus “stopping” point for reproduction.

   Further evidence on the emergence of birth control and restricted family size is evident when

we compare in Figure 2 the New York women 45-59 in 1965 with the New York ever married,

native born women 45-59 who appeared in the 1900 public use sample that was drawn at the

University of Washington (Graham 1980). In 1865, these women were unmarried children or

recently married young adult women. The New York women in the 1900 sample represent all

counties of New York, including the five counties that eventually comprised New York City

(exclusion of these counties made hardly any difference in the patterns).

  While the pattern for the women 45-59 in 1900 (born approximately between 1841 and 1855)

does not form a smooth curve (possibly due to the sample size), it has a peculiar overall shape

that is echoed to some degree by later populations in the figure. In particular, parity progression

ratios decline steeply at the lowest parities, but then tend to level out. This suggests that a

significantly higher share of these New York women were effectively achieving replacement or

below-replacement fertility by the late 1800s, but high proportions of other couples are still

apparently making few efforts in this direction, and continue to have a high probability of

additional births at high parities. One cannot know whether the emergence of extremely small

and moderate sized families was due to changing family size desires, but it is noteworthy, as

others have pointed out (Knodel and van den Walle 1979) that the late two decades of the 1800’s
                                                  22
were marked in European society by the active publicizing of birth control techniques, the

development of the diaphragm, and improved manufacturing of condoms.

  The emerging nature of family formation in the 20th Century is further indicated by Ryder’s

(1969, 102) estimates of parity progression ratios for U.S. white women who were born in 1909

and 1933, years that reflect, respectively, the low fertility that occurred during the great

Depression and the high fertility that occurred in the post-World War II baby boom. In form,

both these curves are similar to that identified for the New York native-born women in the 1900

public use sample. The curves decline steeply at the lowest parities, but then level off or even

increase at the higher parities. Again, the data suggest that American women in these cohorts

were a combination of active controllers and passive controllers. The curve for the 1909 cohort

is very similar in shape to the curve for the older New York native-born women in the 1900

public use sample, but at slightly lower overall levels of fertility. Consistent with our knowledge

of the Baby Boom, the 1933 birth cohort actually has higher probabilities of another birth at the

low parities than the 1909 birth cohort, but the progression probabilities continue to decline at

the higher parities. In other words, as others have pointed out, much of the Baby Boom was due

to the end of 0 and 1 parity women. Very large families continued to decline in importance.

HOME VALUE AND PARITY RATIOS

  Previous research (Bash 1963; Guest 1981) on the New York state fertility transition found

that the aggregate community value of homes was the strongest correlate of geographic

variations in fertility. But, in the case of both studies, housing value was related to aggregate

average fertility differences across all women, regardless of age. To investigate the role of home

value in the fertility transition, we focus on the two age groups of older native-born women,

between 45 and 59 and over 60 in 1865. As we have emphasized, the women over 60 seemed to
                                                 23
show little evidence of parity control while the women 45 to 59 indicated more significant levels,

but still low by the standards of contemporary low fertility populations.

  Figure 3 shows the parity progression ratios when the two age groups of women are further

subdivided into high and low home value groups by the average value of their town. The major

factor influencing the curves in Figure 3 seems to be the birth period of the women. Regardless

of the average value of dwellings, the younger women exerted more parity control than the older

women. This indicates the degree to which fertility control seemed to diffuse across all types of

communities, although the average value of dwellings in 1865 could be considered only a very

crude indicator of the actual living conditions in the towns when women bore their children.

                                         FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE

  Nevertheless, among the women 45-59 in 1865, the average value of housing dwellings makes

a noteworthy difference in the parity progression ratios. At all parities except those indicating

the transition to the first and seventh births, the wealthier communities have a lower probability

of progressing to another birth. Of particular interest is the fact that the two curves largely

parallel each other, indicating a relatively uniform “wealth” effect on whether women have

another child. In other words, women in the wealthier communities show little tendency, relative

to women in the poorer communities, to pick a specific parity as a stopping point for their

reproduction.

  While the differences in parity progression ratios are quite evident, they tend to be small, and

even in the wealthier communities, high proportions of the women “progress” to higher parities.

At all parities in the wealthier communities, over 70 percent of the women at each parity have at

least one more birth. The data again underline the fact that even the most well-to-do

communities must have had wide internal variations in efforts or ability to control births,
                                                  24
especially by the standards of contemporary 21st Century populations.

  The patterns for the oldest women, over 60 (who practiced little parity control), show little

consistent relationship with their town’s home value, which may be partially a reflection of the

often small sample sizes at various parities and the resulting low degree of reliability for the

patterns. There is virtually no overall difference in progression ratios by community wealth

level at the lowest parities. Furthermore, progression ratios are actually higher for the transition

to the third and fourth birth in the well-to-do communities. However, at the highest two parity

levels, the progression ratios tend to be lower in the more wealthy communities. The data,

therefore, imply that community wealth made little overall difference in fertility control before

the transition clearly unfolded, but then emerged as an important predictor once the transition

was well underway.

VARIATIONS IN REPRODUCTIVE PERIOD

  Of particular interest is the question of whether women, across townships, responded in their

fertility behavior to different aspects of the social structural situation in which they lived. One

possibility is that reproductive behavior responded only to the characteristics of the women, their

husbands, and the immediate household. Another possibility is that reproductive behavior was

influenced by the characteristics of the community in which they lived, such as its economic

standards of living, urbanization, and the availability of farmland. An important but unanswered

question in the study of fertility transitions, both historical and contemporary, is whether changes

in reproductive behavior basically follow a model in which individual households change their

calculus about fertility behavior or a model in which broad social changes in the society lead to

collective adaptations (Hirschman and Guest 1990). Previous research on fertility behavior in

the 19th Century has primarily been based on aggregate patterns, rather than a combination of
                                                 25
household level and community characteristics.

  For this final part of the analysis of the microdata, the sample consists of native born wives

between the ages of 30 and 44, who report themselves as married only once and are listed along

with their spouse in the census manuscripts.(6) Since these women are in the later stages of

reproductive fecundity, they have a relatively high probability of making fertility decisions in the

environments where they lived in 1865. For most populations, age differences in fertility are

most evident in the later stages of the reproductive cycle when some couples have achieved their

desired family sizes and try actively to control reproduction, while other couples do not practice

family limitation. Since we are interested in marital fertility, a cut-off of 30 years of age seems

appropriate to investigate fertility during the past four years or so; women who married in their

late 20s would not have the same opportunity to bear children during the previous four years as

other married women. We have also restricted the sample to women who lived outside

Poughkeepsie and Troy, the two largest cities in data set. In the subsequent section, we consider

measures of town agricultural organization, but these were not relevant for cities (or their wards)

as large as these. (7)

  Two dependent variables will be used: first, the number of children ever born that are reported

for the women; second, the number of surviving own children 0-4, as determined by matching

mothers with their children in the census manuscripts. While the number of own children 0-4 is

a useful variable to indicate recency of childbearing, it also may suffer from problems of

reliability. Children 0-4 are only those enumerated at the time of the census; some may not have

lived with their mothers, but more importantly, the substantial mortality rates for young children

at the time (Haines 1977) suggest that many births were probably not captured by this number.

This is especially likely to be a problem in interpreting socio-economic and wealth differences in
                                                 26
childbearing. Households from the lower rungs of the stratification system were likely to

experience disproportionate child mortality, reducing own children 0-4 relative to those who

were ever born.

  Our analysis proceeds by specifying four types of individual/household effects that might

affect fertility behavior. Table 4 shows how these variables are related to fertility in models that

include all the predictors.

                    TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE

  First, a basic demographic model includes the age of the women which will have obvious,

important effects on fertility, due both to declining fecundity with age and to increasing levels of

fertility control among some women as they age. In addition, we have included a dummy

variable in this model to indicate women who reported a husband as serving in the military

during the Civil War, either at the time of the census or previously. It could be argued that the

absence of husbands reduced fertility artificially in various parts of New York State at this time.

However, the importance of this variable should not be overemphasized. Only 8.5 percent of the

706 women in the sample reported a husband in military service. As in most wars, military

service drew heavily from the unmarried men below 30 in age.

  A second model emphasizes the possible importance of socio-economic position of the

husband in fertility variations. We divide the households by the occupation of the husband,

using the occupational coding scheme of the 1950 U.S. Census. White collar includes

professional, managerial, clerical, and sales; skilled blue collar includes skilled manual workers

(craftsmen and foremen). The two other occupational categories are other blue collar workers

(operatives, service and household, and laborer) and agricultural (farming). Not surprisingly, the

modal category is agricultural, but it does not include the majority of the sample. New York was
                                                 27
clearly in transition to an urban-industrial economy. To these categories, we add an “other”

category that includes unclassifiable and non-occupational responses (e.g., student, landlord,

retired, gentleman).

  Unfortunately, the 1865 census does not report data for everyone on levels of schooling

attained. However, for husbands, we can determine whether they could read and write, although

the vast majority of native New Yorkers were literate. Husband's literacy was somewhat

problematic, since it technically only applied to the voting population (males aged 21 and over)

but was often reported for younger males. This variable appears, from the census manuscripts,

to have been collected haphazardly for women.

  A third model emphasizes the role of the family’s socio-economic position in fertility

variation. A crucial indicator is the value of the home (whether owned or not), a variable that

was found to be a powerful correlate of fertility in previous work on New York state fertility by

Guest (1990) and Bash (1963). In addition, we determine the number of female persons,

associated with each family, that are listed in servant roles or as non-employed relatives between

25 and 85, with the obvious expectation that couples with live-in help are probably well off

financially. Of course, servants may also be necessary when the wife has a large number of

children.

  A fourth model posits that variations in fertility reflected the geographic origins of the

households. For both men and women, we can determine whether they were born in one of the

New England states, the part of the United States that probably had the earliest fertility decline

among the major regions. New York State was a major destination for the large westward flow

of migrants from the New England states. In addition, we determine whether the husbands were

born abroad (the sample includes only native born women). This model emphasizes the
                                                 28
importance of historical origins, rather than current situation, in understanding fertility variation.

  Four multiple regression analyses are found in Table 4, two for children ever born (CEB) and

two for own children 0-4. The first regression for each dependent variable includes only the

family and individual-level variables, while the second regression also includes community/town

variables. The regression coefficients are stated in unstandardized form. Most of the

standardized coefficients were quite small (below .10) and are available upon request. The

coefficients in the first equation for each dependent variable changed very little when the

community variables were included in the analysis.

  Two of the variables, husband’s occupation and value of family housing, are coded as multiple

dummy variables. The respective omitted values (not included in the regressions) are husbands

with a non-coded occupational response and non-reported housing value. For these variables,

the regression coefficients for each included response indicate the size of fertility levels above or

below those of the omitted category. As an example, women who are married to white collar

workers have .063 more children ever born than women who are married to those with a non-

coded response, controlling for other variables. Women who are married to craftsmen and

foremen have .571 more children ever born than women who are married to those with a non-

coded response, controlling for other variables. This means that wives of skilled blue collar

workers have about half a child more than wives of white collar workers (.571-.063=.508).

  As measured by levels of statistical significance and standardized coefficients, the most

important predictor of fertility in all equations was the age of the woman. As expected, an older

age was associated with more children ever born but lower recent fertility. Another conceptually

key variable, service in the military, seems to have little influence, especially on lifetime fertility.

Overall, service in the military during the Civil War had little influence on our results.
                                                  29
    While the relationships of the other variables to fertility behavior are generally consistent

with expectations, only one achieves statistical significance, by conventional standards at the .05

level, one-tailed F-test. Households in especially valuable homes have relatively low numbers of

children ever born. The same general pattern is evident in predicting children 0-4, although it is

not statistically significant at the .05-level. In a sense, the lack of statistically significant

coefficients is disappointing since it indicates limited success in identifying strong social

correlates of the fertility transition. But it does point to an important conclusion which is

implicit in our previous analysis, namely, that specific types of women and families differed

greatly at this time in the degree to which they seemed to exert control over their fertility

behavior. Thus there is a very large amount of unobserved heterogeneity.

  Yet, a number of the variables are useful for distinguishing variations in fertility. This is

especially true in regard to children ever born. In predicting children ever born, white collar

occupational status (as opposed to agricultural or blue collar work) is associated with low

fertility. In addition, literacy among men (as opposed to illiteracy), land ownership, and the

presence of female household help are all associated with low fertility.

  The patterns with these variables are generally consistent for predicting children 0-4, but the

relationships are weaker than found for predicting children ever born. The one exception is

husband’s occupation which seems to have hardly any relationship with children 0-4. As noted

earlier, the weaker relationships for children 0-4 may reflect differential infant and childhood

mortality by some of the key predictors. White collar, blue collar, and agricultural workers

probably ended up with about the same number of surviving children, although they differed in

terms of children ever born.

  Variables measuring geographic origins also have some usefulness for distinguishing fertility
                                                   30
levels. The variables are consistent in their patterns, but stronger in relationships for children

ever born. Having a husband of foreign (as opposed to native) birth increases the average

number of children by .86. The New England birth of the mother or father has separate effects

of over .4 children per parent in decreasing children ever born, so that having both New England

born spouses is predicted to decrease children ever born by almost one child.

ROLE OF COMMUNITY

   One of the analytic virtues of the Census of 1865 is the large number of demographic, social,

and economic characteristics that are reported by town. These allow us to test whether the socio-

economic context played an important role in understanding variations in reproductive behavior

beyond those attributable to the husband, wife, and household. Given the availability of data, we

divide possible contextual predictors into the following groups:

  First, we calculate the strength of what Leasure has called “individualist” religious orientation

by measuring, separately, the strength of three numerically strong Protestant groups that might

be identified as especially “individualist” within the New York context at the time, the Baptists,

Methodists, and Universalists. Each emphasized the importance of individual conscience in

being religious. For each group, we calculated the number of reported seats in churches of that

denomination in relationship to the total population of the town. Leasure considered

Congregationalist, Unitarian, and Quaker religious affiliation as individualistic, but the

Unitarians and Quakers were numerically unimportant in New York at this time. Historically,

Congregationalists formed the backbone of a semi-official Puritan Church in Massachusetts that

had tried to restrict the religious and political liberty of competing Protestant and Catholic

groups. At this time (1865), they had an informal alliance with Presbyterians, who were fellow-

Calvinists.
                                                  31
  Second, we consider the nature of the agricultural system, primarily the availability of

inexpensive farmland. Two measures are used: the proportion of all farmland that is

“improved”, according to the state census, and the average value in dollars of an acre of

farmland. Third, we consider the average wealth-holdings in the town, as measured by the

percentage of households that report owning land and the natural logarithm of the average

dwelling value. Fourth, we evaluate the importance of urban development of the town by

measuring the percentage of the 1865 population that lives in urban places, according to the

definition of urban in 1875 as applied to the 1865 population.

  Most of these contextual variables correlated quite poorly with individual level fertility for

native women 30 to 44 years old, with few of the zero-order Pearsonian correlation coefficients

arising above .10. This again reflects the great variation in parity within communities, just as

there was great variation across types of women and families. A problem in selecting the best

community predictors of fertility occurs because of the almost universally low and similar

correlations with fertility variation and the often moderate to high intercorrelations of the

predictors. In such cases, it is well known that relative effects are difficult to assess. For

instance, slight measurement error in one predictor may cause it to “lose out” to other predictors

that are better measured.

  The limited power of the community-level variables is also indicated by inspecting the

adjusted values of R-squared in the equations that include them as opposed to omitting them. In

predicting children ever born, the R-squared increases from .100 to .108, while in regard to own

children the R-squared value actually becomes less, .046 to .042. Thus, the similarity of fertility

levels across New York state communities should be emphasized.

  Especially surprising are the weak partial effects of the urbanization measures and the
                                                  32
indicators of community wealth. The regressions indicated that none of these variables were

close to statistical significance, at the conventional .05 level, one-tailed F-test. This may seem

surprising since parity progression ratios did differ, albeit moderately, between towns with

valuable homes as opposed to less valuable homes for ever-married women 45-59. One

plausible hypothesis is that most parts of New York had become integrated, to some degree, by

1865 into the emerging urban-industrial economy. For instance, the extensive canal system

linked closely the more urban and rural parts of the state.

  The strongest predictor of the community level variables was the proportion of improved

agricultural land which (consistent with the land availability thesis) was a negative correlate of

both measures of fertility. However, the only other predictor (significant at the .10 level for

children ever born) is the value of an acre of farm land; areas of valuable farm land, contrary to

the land availability thesis, actually having higher levels fertility.

                                         FIGURE 4 ABOUT HERE

  While the regression indicates some support for the land availability thesis, conclusions must

be drawn cautiously. Figure 4 shows how the levels of the dependent variables change over

various degrees of improved agricultural land. The impact of improved land seems to be almost

completely at the low levels. At levels of improved land above 50 percent (a situation

characterizing over 75 percent of the towns in the sample, there is no linear trend between the

agricultural variable and the fertility measures. A high proportion of the towns with very low

proportions of improved land were found in Steuben County (partially in the Allegheny

Mountains) and Warren County (located in the Adirondacks). Many of these towns were

geographically isolated and not closely linked to the most “modern” parts of New York at the

time.

DISCUSSION

  Examination of these microdemographic data from the 1865 census of New York State

provides direct confirmation of fertility decline within marriage in early nineteenth century

America, independent of the same trends that are suggested by census child-woman ratios.

These results are more general than those provided by Bash (1955). While our data are primarily

limited to retrospective data from age cohorts, New York native married women in the

reproductive ages in the first part of the 19th Century had high probabilities (over 60 percent) of

bearing at least seven children, while only about 20 percent of the women completing

childbearing at the time of the Civil War had as many as seven children. These estimates may be

affected by selective survivorship by parity, selective recall of older women, and by changes in

the age at marriage, but it seems that the differences are too great to attribute primarily to these

factors.

  Great caution is necessary in interpreting the New York decline as representative of the rest of

the United States at this time. Child-women ratios by state for the entire country suggest that the

lowest levels of fertility in the early to mid-19th century were found in the New England states

especially, but also in the Middle Atlantic States, including New York. Nevertheless, this study

does indicate that marital fertility decline was occurring in the most established and

economically developed parts of the United States well before major declines in most European

countries. The results should alert us to the need for being very cautious in making broad

generalization about fertility decline in the United States, since there were quite varied internal

patterns.

  We should also emphasize the great cultural diversity in fertility within the New York sample.

While we have primarily focused on the native born, patterns of fertility were quite different for
                                                 34
the foreign born who generally came from European countries that had shown little evidence of

declining marital fertility. In 19th century New York, foreign born and native born lived nearby

and shared a common European cultural background, but fertility behavior suggested somewhat

independent family worlds. Even among the native born women, a foreign origin of the husband

related to fertility variation, and couples from New England (with even lower fertility) were

different from other native born couples who had less direct New England roots.

  Even though the evidence supports strongly the idea of a New York marital fertility decline,

the 19th century transition appears to be far different from the spectacular declines reported for

countries such as Japan and Taiwan in the post-World War II period (Feeney 1991; Feeney and

Feng 1993). In these countries, the decline (once begun) occurred dramatically and quickly.

Cohorts of women altered significantly their fertility behavior within one or two decades so that

families of several children virtually disappeared and few women were having more than three

or four children. While there is extensive debate on why countries such as Japan and Taiwan

had such rapid changes, it does appear that the availability of effective, accessible contraception

such as the intrauterine device (IUD) was quite important.

  In 19th century New York, the marital fertility decline saw the gradual emergence of wide

variations in reproductive behavior among women, even in the geographic areas that had the

social and economic conditions that should be most conducive to low fertility. In other words,

the New York fertility decline reflected, to some degree, the emergence of what we know as the

“modern” family where many couples probably made an active effort to control the total number

of children. But significant proportions of couples continued to have quite high fertility by the

contemporary standards of developed countries and rapidly developing countries such as Korea

and Taiwan.
                                                 35
  Our data cannot resolve the issue of why a significant proportion of couples continued to have

such large families. Was it desire for large families, weak availability of effective techniques to

control fertility, or some combination of the two? Certainly, the techniques of fertility control

available to 19th century New York couples were rather primitive by today’s standards, including

abstinence, withdrawal, and crude condoms. Voluntary abortion was undoubtedly practiced, but

legal opposition to it grew during the 19th century.

  The New York patterns in the 19th century do fit fairly nicely into a general portrait of

changing parity distributions in American society. We know that the emergence of a U.S.

“modern” fertility pattern in the 20th century also involved the development of wide variations in

reproductive patterns among American women. In addition, we know from 20th century surveys,

that significant proportions of couples had large numbers of unplanned or unwanted babies while

significant proportions were also quite successful in achieving small family goals. This U.S.

pattern seemed to change in the 1960s with the development of such techniques as the IUD and

the pill that reduced greatly levels of unplanned and unwanted fertility (Westoff 1981). Given

these findings, there seems to be little doubt that the wide variations in parity in New York

reflected, to at least a moderate degree, the wide variations in the practice of fertility control.

  What were the economic and social forces that produced the New York fertility decline, as

suggested by the 1865 data? It would certainly appear that the economic development of the

state, as indexed perhaps by the value of housing, was a key underlying factor. This is supported

by the differences in fertility that we have found among the older women in 1865 between those

living in areas with high home evaluation as opposed to low evaluation. Yet, these differences

by economic status, while real, were often muted by the very large differences in fertility within

type of geographic area. Even among women living in the most economically developed parts of
                                                  36
New York, wide variations in reproductive behavior existed. This has some implications for the

well-known debate about whether fertility transitions in the 19th century reflected adjustment to

social structural conditions or the diffusion of information on how to control births (Knodel and

van de Walle 1979). Our data suggest that social structure was quite important, but there was a

very partial or incomplete response by many couples in the areas that should have been

conducive to fertility decline, perhaps because the means to achieve fertility control were not

very effective.

  Consistent with Bash’s analysis (1963), we have found that the value of housing decreased in

predictive importance among the younger reproductive age women in 1865. Yet, by 1865, New

York had become quite geographically integrated, especially by the building of the Erie Canal

and auxiliary water and rail transportation, and the spirit of a booming capitalist economy may

have penetrated most parts of the state. “Economic development” may have pervaded most parts

of the state, including rural, agricultural areas, but many couples within areas may have lacked

the motivation or techniques to control effectively their fertility.

  The data from the seven county sample in 1865 have a limited potential for further analysis of

the economic and social structural correlates of the New York fertility decline, but previous state

and federal censuses contain extensive published data on age distribution by township that have

a great research potential. These data may be turned into estimates of fertility through child-

women ratios. Given the large number of New York towns, it should be possible to do much

more multivariate analysis of how different types of communities participated in the fertility

decline.

  Unfortunately, the 1865 data do not permit much assessment of how various aspects of

economic development influenced fertility behavior. In particular, the role of educational factors
                                                  37
in understanding the fertility transition is difficult to assess. Literacy was related negatively to

fertility, but only a small proportion of the adult population was illiterate. It is impossible to

determine directly school attendance rates by town, so we cannot assess directly the role of this

factor. One possible indicator of educational influences is occupational differences in fertility;

we have found that white collar families (probably with high educational aspirations for

themselves or their children) had lower fertility than other occupational groups. But

occupational differences were weak, and occupational groups had sizable internal variations in

reproductive behavior, just as geographic areas did.

FOOTNOTES

1. The complete original set of 1865 schedules held by the state were apparently accidentally

destroyed in a fire in Albany in 1911. Many duplicate copies were in the hands of county and

town clerks, however. The principal ones missing are, unfortunately, for New York City

(Lainhart 1992, pp. 85-88). New York state took censuses of the total population in 1814, 1825,

1835, 1845, 1855, 1865, 1875, 1892, 1905 1915, and 1925 (Dubester 1948), but the complete

enumeration by the state of the population began only in 1855.

    The relevant column on the 1865 census manuscript page in regard to children ever born was

headed: "Of how many children the parent?" The instructions to the enumerators stated the

following: "This inquiry is to be made on of adult females and usually of wives or widows. It

should, in all cases, include the number of living children the woman has borne, whether now

living or dead and whether present or absent from the family. These children may perhaps be

themselves the heads of families, and residents of another State, or they may have died in

childhood. The object of the inquiry is to obtain data for determining the natural increase of the

population in this State among the various classes, and it should be taken fully and uniformly to

possess value. Be careful to note in this column the number of children borne by females now

aged, as well as that of those now surrounded by their families. We can thus determine the

relative rate of increase of a former age, for comparison with the present." (New York State,

1867, p. lxvii.)

2. Among other studies dealing with fertility in the United States and which have used micro-

census data for the period prior to 1900, see Stern 1987, Ryan 1981, Mason, Weinstein, and

Laslett 1985, Zunz 1982, Haines 1979, Hareven and Vinovskis 1975.

3. The definition of urban in Table 1 is taken from the New York State Census of 1875 (New
                                                39
York State, 1877, p. 9). Urban areas included (a) all areas designated as cities; (b) all towns

adjacent to cities; and (c) towns containing villages of population over 1,000 population.

5. The Federal census first began collecting information on marital status or duration in 1880,

but few of these women were of marriage age in the first part of the 19th Century. As a

consequence, our knowledge of nuptiality levels and trends throughout the 19th Century is

limited (Monahan 1951). One piece of research to approach this problem is the work of

Sanderson (1979) who applied the Coale-McNeil nuptiality model (Coale 1971) to the American

female population for the period 1800 to 1920 and made estimates of age at marriage. David and

Sanderson (1987b) have developed a statistical technique to estimate the degree of fertility

control in historical populations, but it cannot be applied to our data because marital duration is

not available.

6. Households were taken as the primary enumeration units as defined in the manuscripts of the

census. Families were subunits of households defined as a conjugal unit or the remains of a

conjugal unit (i.e., a husband and wife, a husband and wife with one or more children, a husband

or wife with children). Boarders and lodgers were considered as members of separate families.

Resident servants were considered part of the primary household unless the servant was part of a

resident conjugal unit or the remains of a conjugal unit, in which case they were assigned to a

separate family. Such assignments to family units, as well as the matching of husbands and

wives and mothers and children (necessary to own-children fertility estimation), were made

using such information as name, age, sex, marital status, and relationship to head of household in

the census manuscripts.

7. We also considered various other specifications such as making the dependent variable

children 5-9 and including women of all ages. In general, regardless of the specification, most of
                                                 40
the community-level variables had weak effects on fertility. The strength of individual-level

predictors differed slightly across specifications, but the general pattern of relationships was

quite similar.
