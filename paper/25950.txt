                                          ABSTRACT

This paper studies green bonds, a relatively new instrument in sustainable finance. I first describe
the market for green bonds and characterize the "green bond boom" witnessed in recent years.
Second, using firm-level data on green bonds issued by public companies, I examine companies'
financial and environmental performance following the issuance of green bonds. I find that the
stock market responds positively to the announcement of green bond issues. Moreover, I
document a significant increase in environmental performance, suggesting that green bonds are
effective in improving companies' environmental footprint. These findings are only significant
for green bonds that are certified by independent third parties, suggesting that certification is an
important governance mechanism in the green bond market. I conclude by discussing potential
implications for public policy.

1. Introduction


Green bonds are a recent innovation in sustainable finance. Green bonds are debt instruments (i.e.,

"bonds"), whose proceeds are committed to the financing of low-carbon, climate-friendly projects

(i.e., "green"). Issuers of green bonds include corporations, municipalities, government entities,

and supranational institutions.

         The first green bond was issued by the European Investment Bank (EIB) in 2007 to finance

renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. Since then, green bonds have become

increasingly popular. While the total issuance of green bonds was less than $1 billion in 2008, it

soared to $143 billion in 2018. This trend--which practitioners often refer to as a "green bond

boom" (Morgan Stanley, 2017)--is likely to continue in the years to come. Commentators often

see green bonds as a promising tool to address climate change (e.g., Bloomberg, 2018).

         Despite the growing popularity of green bonds, little is known about their effectiveness.

Do green bonds benefit their issuers? And--importantly--do green bonds lead to improvements

in environmental outcomes? The answers are not obvious, for two main reasons. First, issuers may

engage in greenwashing by claiming that a bond is green (e.g., to cater to environmentally

conscious investors) while it is not. In this vein, several examples of "green bonds that were not

green" have been discussed in the media (e.g., Financial Times, 2015; Climate Bonds Initiative,

2017).

         Second, there is no public regulation of green bonds, and hence the "greenness" of the

bonds is not enforceable.1 Instead, the governance of green bonds is decentralized and shaped by




1
  Exceptions include China and India. The Chinese green bond market is subject to public regulation pursuant to
regulations enacted by the Chinese Central Bank (People's Bank of China) in 2015. Similarly, the Securities and
Exchange Board of India regulated the Indian green bond market in 2016. Both sets of regulations are broadly
consistent with global private governance standards.

                                                      2
private governance. Specifically, to circumvent the lack of enforceability, issuers rely on

certification by independent third parties (e.g., those approved by the Climate Bond Standard

Board). Yet, the criteria vary across certifiers, and the lack of unified standards may undermine

the reliability of certification.2

         The objective of this study is threefold. First, I characterize the market for green bonds

over time, across countries, and across industries, highlighting the rapid development of this

market (i.e., the "boom"). Second, using firm-level data on corporate green bonds issued by public

companies, I examine the effectiveness of green bonds in terms of financial and environmental

performance, and evaluate the role of third-party certification as a private governance regime.

Third, I discuss potential implications for public policy.

         I start by documenting the growing popularity of green bonds. In 2018 alone, the total

issuance of green bonds was $141.3B worldwide. While green bonds only account for a small

fraction of the overall bond market (the issuance of ordinary bonds was $32,341.7B in 2018), a

striking feature of green bonds is their rapid growth in recent years. Indeed, while the issuance of

green bonds was merely $0.8B in 2007, it grew by about 175 times by 2018 (in contrast, the

issuance of ordinary bonds only grew by 1.6 times during the same period). There is considerable

heterogeneity across countries and industries. The leading issuers of green bonds are based in

China, France, and the U.S. In terms of industries, governments are the main issuers, followed by

financials, utilities, industrials, and energy companies. I also document the emergence of a related

asset class--the green "muni" bonds in the U.S. (i.e., green municipality bonds issued by U.S.

states, counties, and cities). The issuance of green muni bonds has grown from $0.6B in 2010 to



2
  More broadly, in a recent article in the Stanford Law Review, Park (2018) notes that "[i]n comparison to public
regulation, private governance is often faster to implement and more responsive to the needs of market participants
but may suffer from a lack of legitimacy, accountability, and consistency and be susceptible to greenwashing" (p. 1).

                                                         3
$4.3B in 2018. New York, California, and Massachusetts are the main issuers.

        I then examine the effectiveness of green bonds by focusing on the subset of green bonds

issued by public companies. The benefit of studying public companies is that detailed firm-level

data are available, which allows me to track the issuers' financial and environmental performance

following the issuance of green bonds. I first conduct an event study that examines the stock market

response to the announcement of green bond issues. I find a significant and positive stock market

reaction. Specifically, in the two-day event window around the announcement, the cumulative

abnormal return (CAR) is 0.67%. This suggests that green bonds are value-enhancing and hence

beneficial to companies.

        About two-thirds of green bonds are certified by independent third parties. When I split the

green bonds depending on whether they are certified or not, I find that the stock market reaction

is only significant for green bonds that are certified. This suggests that certification is an important

governance tool in the green bond market.

        I further examine how the issuance of green bonds affects long-term financial performance

as measured by the return on assets (ROA) and the return on equity (ROE). I find that both ROA

and ROE increase significantly in the long run (i.e., two and more years after the green bond issue),

confirming that green bonds yield tangible benefits to companies. Finally, I examine how green

bonds affect environmental performance. To proxy for environmental performance, I use the

company's CO2 emissions, as well as the environmental rating of Thomson Reuters' ASSET4.3 I

find that, following the issuance of green bonds, companies i) reduce their CO2 emissions and ii)

achieve a higher environmental rating. Again, these findings are only significant for green bonds

that are certified by independent third parties.


3
 ASSET4 provides ratings of companies' environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance based on 250+
key performance indicators. See Thomson Reuters (2019) for a description of this database.

                                                     4
          One important concern with my analysis is that the issuance of green bonds is not random,

and hence unobservables may drive a spurious correlation between the issuance of green bonds

and, e.g., subsequent improvements in environmental performance. For example, it could be that

some companies adopt environment-friendly business practices and, as a result, achieve higher

environmental performance. At the same time, they may issue green bonds (in lieu of ordinary

bonds) as they see an opportunity to cater to ESG (environmental, social, and governance)

investors. To mitigate this and other potential (endogeneity) concerns, I use a matching approach.

Specifically, I match each green bond issuer to another (non-green) bond issuer that is similar

based on observables. While the matching mitigates the possibility that my results are driven by

unobservables, I caveat that it does not fully rule out endogeneity concerns. Doing so would require

an instrument for the issuance of green bonds, yet--given the voluntary nature of green bond

issuance--it is difficult to come up with such an instrument.

          Overall, the results of this study suggest that green bonds contribute to both financial and

environmental performance, but only when they are certified. This suggests that the prevalent

(certification-based) private governance regime is effective at ensuring that the green bond

proceeds are invested into green projects. Naturally, this does not imply that it is the most effective

governance regime. Indeed, various concerns have been raised by practitioners, including i) the

lack of unified standards, ii) the lack of agreement as to what "green" truly means, and iii) the lack

of "tiers" (e.g., a triple A rating for bonds with the largest environmental impact, etc.). In the last

section of this paper, I discuss these considerations as well as potential implications for public

policy.

          This paper contributes to several strands of the literature. First, it adds to the literature that

examines how climate finance can help address climate change and other grand challenges (e.g.,



                                                      5
Buntaine and Pizer, 2015; Kotchen and Costello, 2018; Kotchen and Negri, 2016; Markandya,

Galarrage, Ruebbelke, 2017). Second, it contributes to the literature on impact investing that

studies how financial instruments (such as SRI funds) can contribute to ESG objectives (e.g.,

Barber, Morse, and Yasuda, 2018; Flammer, 2015). Third, it contributes to the nascent literature

that studies green bonds. The bulk of this literature focuses on the asset pricing properties of green

bonds, and typically finds evidence that green bonds trade at a premium compared to plain-vanilla

bonds (e.g., Baker, Bergstresser, Serafeim, and Wurgler, 2018; Zerbib, 2019).

        The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the green bond

market; Section 3 presents the analysis of green bonds issued by public companies; Section 4

discusses the policy implications and offers conclusions.


2. The green bond market

2.1 Data

The bond data are obtained from Bloomberg's fixed income database. Since the green bond market

started in 2007, I extract all bonds issued between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2018. I

restrict the sample to the Bloomberg asset classes "corporate" and "governments".4 This yields a

total of 1,472,199 bonds. To distinguish between green and ordinary bonds, I use Bloomberg's

green bond indicator that reports whether a bond is labelled as green. Out of the 1,472,199 bonds

issued during the sample period, 1,855 are green bonds.

        In addition to corporate and government bonds, Bloomberg also covers a separate asset

class--the municipal bonds (so-called "munis" or "muni bonds") issued by U.S. states, counties,



4
 Bloomberg includes a series of other fixed income securities--such as certificates, loans (tranches), loans (deals),
preferreds, mortgages (mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and structured), and mortgages (generics)--that can be
marked as "green" as well. Since these are not bonds per se, I do not include them in the analysis.

                                                         6
and cities. Bloomberg does not maintain a green bond indicator variable for muni bonds. Instead,

I rely on the variable municipal bond purpose to identify those that qualify as green muni bonds.5

Since green muni bonds appear as of 2010, I extract the muni bond data from January 1, 2010 to

December 31, 2018. This yields 1,224,773 muni bonds, out of which 4,794 are green.

        In the following, I first describe the green bond market (excluding green munis). I then

provide a separate characterization of the market for green muni bonds.

2.2 Green bonds over time

Table 1 provides statistic on the issuance of green bonds on a year-by-year basis. The first column

reports the issuance of green bonds in billions of U.S. dollars (all foreign currencies are converted

in U.S. dollars), while the second column reports the number of green bonds. The pattern is

consistent with the "green bond boom" often noted in the financial press. Over a 10-year period,

the issuance of green bonds soared from $0.8B in 2007 to $143.1B in 2018.

                                     ----- Insert Table 1 about here -----

        The third and fourth columns of Table 1 provide the corresponding statistics for ordinary

bonds.6 The last two columns provide the share of green bonds (both in terms of dollar amount

and number of bonds) relative to the overall bond market. As can be seen, green bonds represent

only a small fraction of the bond market. In 2018, green bonds represent less than 0.5% of the

overall market (the issuance of ordinary bonds was $32,342B, compared to $143.1B for green

bonds). Importantly, the share of green bonds has been growing rapidly. While it was only 0.004%




5
  Specifically, I use the category "green bond." Bloomberg does not provide a more granular characterization of the
use of proceeds.
6
  Throughout this paper, I refer to bonds as "ordinary" if they are not labelled as green in Bloomberg.

                                                        7
in 2007 (in dollar terms), it rose by about 100 times within the next 10 years, reaching an all-time

high of 0.441% in 2018.7

2.2 Green bonds across countries

Table 2 provides summary statistics separately for each country.8 As can be seen, the main issuers

are China ($83.9B), France ($58.1B), and the U.S. ($56.9B). Following the top-three are mainly

European countries, consistent with the view that Europe tends to be "greener" (e.g., Doh and

Guay, 2006; Wall Street Journal, 2017).

                                       ----- Insert Table 2 about here -----

         Figure 1 provides a visualization of the data from Table 2 (Panel A refers to the dollar

amount, while Panel B refers to the number of green bonds). Darker-shaded areas represent higher

issuance amounts and a higher number of green bonds, respectively. The general pattern in line

with the above characterization: China, France, and the U.S. are the main issuers, followed by a

large set of European countries.

                                      ----- Insert Figure 1 about here -----

         Finally, Figure 2 plots the evolution of the green bond market across regions (Panel A

refers again to the dollar amount, while Panel B refers to the number of green bonds). As can be

seen, Europe dominates other regions. The large-scale issuance of green bonds started earlier

(around 2013) and has grown continuously ever since. Also noteworthy is the sharp increase in




7
  The amount of green bond issuance (in dollars) has increased by about 175 times from 2010-2018, while the ratio of
green bond issuance (compared to total bond issuance) has increased by about 100 times. This difference reflects the
fact that the market for ordinary bonds has grown as well during this period.
8
  The countries used to characterize issuers are the countries of domicile (as opposed to the countries of incorporation)
in Bloomberg.

Asia has been a major issuer as of 2016.9

                                      ----- Insert Figure 2 about here -----

2.3 Green bonds across sectors


Table 3 provides a characterization of green bond issuance across sectors. Sectors are defined

according to BICS (Bloomberg Industry Classification Systems) codes. As is shown, governments

(including supranational organizations) are the main issuers ($182.6B), followed by financials

($150.9B), utilities ($86.8B), industrials ($31.4B), and energy companies ($15.4B). The latter

three are emission-intensive sectors.10

                                      ----- Insert Table 3 about here -----

         Relatedly, Figure 3 plots the evolution of green bond issuance across sectors. The general

pattern confirms the prevalence of green bonds among a set of key sectors, with the government

sector being an earlier adopter of green bond financing.

                                      ----- Insert Figure 3 about here -----

2.4 Summary statistics


Table 4 provides summary statistics for several characteristics of green vs. ordinary bonds. As can

be seen, green bonds tend to be larger (the average issuance amount is $264M compared to $242M

for ordinary bonds) and have longer maturity (6.9 years compared to 3.4 years for ordinary bonds).


9
  The 2015 spike in North American issues in Panel B reflects the unusual case of the energy company SolarCity Corp
that issued 130 green bonds in 2015 with a relatively small issuance amount ($5.5M on average). Accordingly, this
spike in the number of green bonds (Panel B) does not appear in terms of the dollar amount of green bond issuance
(Panel A).
10
   It is worth noting the significance of green bonds in the utilities sector. More than 2% of bonds issued by utilities
are green (compared to a ratio of 0.138% across all sectors).

                                                           9
This indicates that green bonds are used to finance large-scale long-term projects, consistent with

the nature of many environmental and energy projects.

                                      ----- Insert Table 4 about here -----

         Also, note that the coupon is on average lower for green bonds (3.3% compared to 3.5%

for ordinary bonds). This difference is harder to interpret due to the many factors that affects the

returns of green bonds. In his analysis of green bond yields, Zerbib (2019) compares the yield to

maturity (YTM) of green bonds versus ordinary bonds that have similar characteristics (maturity,

credit risk, liquidity, etc.). He finds that green bonds have a lower YTM--i.e., investors require a

lower return--although the difference is relatively small. Baker, Bergstresser, Serafeim, and

Wurgler (2018) obtain similar results in their sample of green muni bonds.

         Finally, another interesting feature of green bonds is that they tend to be safer. This can be

inferred from the Bloomberg composite credit rating provided at the bottom of the table.11 As is

shown, 30.3% of green bonds have a triple-A rating (compared to 8.5% for ordinary bonds).

Moreover, no green bond has ever been issued with a rating in the D range.

2.5 Green municipality bonds

In addition to the "government" and "corporate" asset classes, Bloomberg also compiles fixed

income data for a separate asset class: U.S. municipality bonds (often referred to as "munis" or

"muni bonds"). To complete the characterization of the green bond market, I provide below a

description of the market for green munis.




11
  The Bloomberg composite credit rating is a composite of ratings from four rating agencies (DBRS, Fitch, Moody's,
and Standard & Poor's). Note that the large majority of bonds are not rated and hence the rating statistics in Table 4
refer to the subset of bonds with a credit rating. Specifically, 26.9% of the green bonds (499) and 4.2% of the ordinary
bonds (61,583) have a rating. Ratings are less common for smaller bonds and non-U.S. bonds.

                                                          10
2.5.1 Green municipality bonds over time

Table 5 reports statistics on the issuance of green muni bonds over time. As can be seen, the "green

bond boom" is also observed among muni bonds. The dollar amount of green munis has increased

continuously from 2011 to 2017, reaching an all-time high of $11.2B in 2017. In that year, green

muni bonds represent 2.6% of the overall muni bond market (in dollar terms).

                                ----- Insert Table 5 about here -----

2.5.2 Green municipality bonds across U.S. states

Table 6 provides a breakdown by U.S. states. As is shown, the main issuers are New York ($8B),

California ($7.8B), and Massachusetts ($3.1B). Together, these three states account for about 63%

of all green muni bonds (in dollar terms).

                                ----- Insert Table 6 about here -----

       Figure 4 provides a visualization of the data from Table 6. (As above, Panel A refers to the

dollar amount, while Panel B refers to the number of green munis.) Darker-shaded areas represent

higher issuance amounts and a higher number of green munis, respectively. The general pattern is

consistent with the above characterization: New York, California, and Massachusetts are the main

issuers. While a large set of other states issue green munis as well, they do so to a lesser extent.

Note that the pattern in Panel B is very similar to that in Panel A. The main exception is New

Jersey, which has issued a relatively large number of green muni bonds (Panel B) for a relatively

low dollar amount (Panel A).

                               ----- Insert Figure 4 about here -----




                                                 11
2.5.3 Summary statistics

Finally, Table 7 provides summary statistics on the green versus ordinary muni bonds. The

statistics are in line with those provided in Table 4. Compared to ordinary muni bonds, green munis

are on average larger ($6.3M compared to $2.4M), have a longer maturity (11.8 years compared

to 9.5 years), and have a higher credit rating (40.4% of green muni bonds have a triple-A rating,

compared to only 16.6% of the ordinary muni bonds).12

                                    ----- Insert Table 7 about here -----


3. Corporate green bonds' implications for financial and environmental performance

In this section, I focus on green bonds issued by public companies to study how the issuance of

green bonds affect financial and environmental performance. This section is an abbreviated version

of Flammer (2018) who studies how corporate green bonds affect firm-level outcomes.

3.1 Stock market reaction

3.1.1 Methodology

I start by studying how the stock market responds to the announcement of green bond issues. To

conduct this analysis, I use a sample of 217 corporate green bonds issued by public companies.13

An appealing feature of Bloomberg's fixed income database is that it records the announcement

date (in addition to the issue date). From the event study perspective, the announcement date is

the relevant one, since it is the date on which the information is conveyed to the market.

        To perform the event study, I use as event date (i.e., day 0) the announcement date. I then




12
   Note that the Bloomberg composite rating is not available for muni bonds. Instead, Table 7 reports Standard &
Poor's credit ratings.
13
   This sample is described in detail in Flammer (2018).

                                                      12
compute abnormal returns several days before and after the event date. Specifically, for each

company i, I compute abnormal returns (AR) using the market model. (The results are similar if

alternative asset pricing models are used such as the three-factor model of Fama and French, 1993,

or the four-factor model of Carhart, 1997.) The coefficients ai and bi of the market model are

estimated by Ordinary Least Square using 200 trading days starting 20 trading days prior to the

event date. Formally, I estimate the following regression:

                                                                           ,

where rit is the return on the stock of company i on day t; rmt is the daily market return; and eit is

the residual. Daily stock returns rit are obtained from CRSP (for U.S. companies) and the daily

stock file of Compustat Global (for non-U.S. companies). Daily market returns rmt are country-

specific. For the U.S., I use the S&P 500. For all other countries I use the country's leading stock

market index (e.g., the FTSE 100 Index for the U.K.).14

         The estimated return on the stock of company i on day t is then given by:

                                                                       .

         I calculate the abnormal return of company i on day t as follows:

                                                                   .

         Finally, I compute the cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) by summing up abnormal

returns in event time--that is, CAR from t1 to t2 is obtained as:

                                                     ,                         .

3.1.2 Results

Figure 6 plots the average cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) ten days before and after the



14
 The results are similar if instead of using country-specific stock market indices, I compute rmt using the MSCI All-
Country World Equity Index.

announcement of green bond issues. As can be seen, CARs are essentially zero prior to the

announcement, there is a sharp increase around the event date, and the CARs remain high

thereafter. The average CAR in the two-day event window (-1, 0) is 0.67%, which is significant at

conventional statistical levels (t = 2.42). This indicates that green bonds are perceived as value-

enhancing by the stock market.

                                 ----- Insert Figure 6 about here -----

        Note that the results are unlikely to capture a "bond effect" as opposed to a "green bond

effect." Indeed, a common finding in the corporate finance literature is that the stock market does

not respond significantly to the announcement of bond issues, while it responds negatively to the

announcement of equity issues--see, e.g., Eckbo, Masulis, and Norli (2007) and Masulis and

Korwar (1986).

3.1.3 Certification

The previous analysis considered all green bonds of public firms, regardless of whether they are

certified or not by independent third parties.

        To distinguish between certified and non-certified green bonds, I use the certification

information provided in the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) database. This database compiles

information on the certification of each green bond, along with the identity of the third-party

certifier. Common certifiers include Sustainalytics, Vigeo Eiris, Ernst & Young, and CICERO

(Center for International Climate Research). Green bonds can be issued under a variety of

voluntary standards. Two leading standards that verify the integrity of the green bond label are the

Green Bond Principles (GBP) and the Climate Bond Standards (CBS). In a nutshell, the

certification process is split into two phases. In the pre-issuance phase, the certifier verifies that a)

the projects to be financed by the bond proceeds are eligible under the specific certification

                                                   14
standards, and b) the issuer has established internal processes and controls to keep track of how

the bond proceeds are used (which includes the submission of annual reports). In the post-issuance

phase, the certifier verifies that the proceeds have been allocated to green projects in accordance

with the standards.

         Out of the 217 green bonds used in the event study, 147 are certified (68%). In Figure 7, I

repeat the event study separately for certified and non-certified green bonds. While the average

CAR in the two-day event window (-1, 0) is positive in both groups, it is only significant for

certified green bonds. Specifically, the two-day CAR is 0.8% for certified green bonds (t = 2.27),

while it is 0.4% for non-certified green bonds (t = 0.94).15 Overall, these findings suggest that

certification is an important determinant of the effectiveness of green bonds.

3.2 Analysis of long-term financial and environmental performance

3.2.1 Methodology

The 217 green bonds used in the event study correspond to 106 unique firm-year observations

(since companies can issue multiple green bonds in the same year). In the following, I estimate

how the issuance of green bonds affects firm-level outcomes using a difference-in-differences

specification around these 106 "treatments."

         To obtain a control group, I match each treated firm to a control firm from the pool of

public companies. The matching is done in two steps. First, for each treated firm, I restrict the pool

of candidates to firms that issue a regular bond in the same calendar year as the green bond issue--

this criterion ensures that the results capture a "green bond effect" as opposed to a mere "bond


15
  Note that the difference is not significant (p-value = 0.389). Due to the limited sample size, there is little power to
detect cross-sectional differences in statistical terms.

                                                           15
effect." I further restrict the pool of candidates to firms that operate in the same 2-digit SIC industry

and the same country as the treated firm. Second, among the remaining candidates, I select the

nearest neighbor based on a large set of observables prior to the treatment. Specifically, the

matching characteristics are size, Tobin's Q, ROA, leverage, and the company's environmental,

social, and governance ratings. For each characteristic, I consider the variable in the year preceding

the green bond issuance (i.e., at t ­ 1), as well as the pre-trend (i.e., the change from t ­ 2 to t ­ 1).

Accordingly, fourteen matching variables are used. The nearest neighbor is the firm with the

lowest Mahalanobis distance to the treated firm across these fourteen matching characteristics.16

         Using this matched control sample, I estimate the following difference-in-differences

specification:

                                                                                                ,                     (1)

where i indexes companies, t indexes years, c indexes countries, and s indexes 2-digit SIC

industries; y is the outcome variable of interest (e.g., ROA, CO2 emissions); i are firm fixed

effects; ct are country by year fixed effects; st are industry by year fixed effects; Green bond(-2)

is a dummy variable equal to one for green bond issuers two years prior to the green bond issue;

Green bond(-1) is defined analogously; Green bond(0) is a dummy variable equal to one for green

bond issuers in the year that ends before the green bond issue; Green bond(1) is a dummy variable

equal to one for green bond issuers in the year that ends after the green bond issue; Green bond(2+)

is a dummy variable equal to one for green bond issuers two or more years after the green bond

issue.17 Standard errors are clustered at the 2-digit SIC industry level. For each dependent variable,

I plot the full set of coefficients                 along with a 90% confidence interval.

  See Flammer (2018) for details, along with a characterization of the treated and matched control firms.

  The regressions are estimated using all firm-year observations of the treated and matched control firms from 2010-
2017. Note that a broader characterization of the dynamics (i.e., splitting the  = 2+ period into  = 2, 3, 4, etc.) is not

                                                           16
3.2.2 Financial performance

To measure financial performance, I use the return on assets (ROA) and the return on equity

(ROE). Both measures are obtained from Standard & Poor's Compustat.18 ROA is defined as

operating income before depreciation scaled by the book value of total assets; ROE is defined

similarly but using the book value of equity as scaling variable. Both ratios are winsorized at the

1st and 99th percentiles of their empirical distribution.

        The ROA coefficients are plotted in Panel A of Figure 8. As can be seen, i) there is no pre-

trend; ii) the effect is positive but insignificant in the short run (i.e., one year after the green bond

issue), and iii) the effect is positive and significant in the long run (i.e., two and more years after

the green bond issue). In terms of magnitudes, ROA increases by 0.006 in the long run. Since the

mean of ROA is 0.056, this implies that performance increases by about 11%. This indicates that

green bonds yield tangible (long-term) financial benefits to companies. Panel B provides similar

results with respect to ROE.

                                     ----- Insert Figure 8 about here -----

3.2.3 Environmental performance

In Figure 9, I use two measures of environmental performance. The first measure is the

environmental rating from Thomson Reuters' ASSET4. The second measure is the ratio of CO2

emissions (in tons) from ASSET4 divided by the book value of total assets in U.S. dollars. I

winsorize this ratio at the 1st and 99th percentiles of its empirical distribution.

        Panel A plots the coefficients pertaining to the ASSET4 environmental rating. The rating



feasible since most green bonds are issued in the later years of the sample, and hence most issuers have no more than
two post-issue years available.
18
   Compustat North America is used for U.S. and Canadian companies, while Compustat Global is used for all other
companies.

                                                        17
increases significantly in the long run, while there is no evidence for pre-trends. Similarly, Panel

B documents a significant decrease in CO2 emissions following the issuance of green bonds. In

economic terms, the environment rating goes up by 7.3 percentage points in the long run, which

corresponds to an increase by 8.8% (given a mean of 83.4). Similarly, emissions are reduced by

21.6 tons of CO2 per $1M of assets, a reduction by 27.7% (given a mean of 77.9). Overall, these

findings indicate that green bonds are effective--they do yield significant improvements in the

issuers' environmental performance.

                                     ----- Insert Figure 9 about here -----

3.2.4 Certification

In auxiliary regressions, I repeat the previous analysis interacting Green Bond() with dummy

variables that indicate whether the green bond is certified or not by an independent third party. I

find that the long-run effects documented above are large and significant for certified green bonds,

while they are small and insignificant for non-certified green bonds. This echoes the event study

findings, and further highlights the importance of certification in the green bond market.


4. Discussion and conclusion

Climate change likely represents the greatest challenge faced by our and future generations. The

impact of climate change is felt everywhere, and poses an existential threat to ecosystems and

communities around the world. The signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015 marked an important

milestone in the fight against climate change.19 Yet, as the recent U.S. example illustrates--


19
   The Paris meeting (often referred to as COP21) was the 21st annual meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP)
pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Paris Agreement commits
to the following (UNFCCC, 2015): a) holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above
pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels,
recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change; b) increasing the ability to
adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions

                                                         18
President Donald J. Trump announced on June 1, 2017 the U.S.' intention to withdraw from the

Paris Agreement--international treaties face challenges on their own. Importantly, nations cannot

act alone. Addressing climate change requires an enormous amount of funding--the OECD

estimates that $93 trillion in infrastructure investment will be needed in the next fifteen years to

achieve a low-carbon future (OECD, 2017). In comparison, the world's GDP was about $80 trillion

in 2017. This tremendous financing need calls for private solutions in addition to nations' efforts

to address climate change.

        This paper examines one promising instrument: green bonds--i.e., bonds whose proceeds

are committed to the financing of low-carbon, climate-friendly projects. Since their inception in

2007, green bonds have become increasingly popular among private investors, and practitioners

often refer to this evolution as a "green bond boom." This paper describes the evolution of the

green bond market, highlighting the heterogeneity across countries and industry sectors.

Furthermore, it examines the effectiveness of corporate green bonds in terms of both financial and

environmental performance. Using a sample of green bonds issued by public companies, I find

that the stock market responds positively to the announcement of green bond issues, suggesting

that green bonds are value-enhancing. I also find that green bond issuers--compared to a matched

sample of       (non-green) bond issuers--experience long-term improvements in financial

performance (measured by an increase in ROA and ROE) and environmental performance

(measured by a decrease in CO2 emissions and an increase in environmental ratings). Moreover,

these findings are only significant for green bonds that are certified by independent third parties,

suggesting that certification is a key governance mechanism for green bonds. One caveat of this

study is that I do not have an instrument for the issuance of green bonds. That being said, it is


development, in a manner that does not threaten food production; and c) making finance flows consistent with a
pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.

                                                     19
difficult to think about unobservables that would i) not be filtered out by the tight matching used

in the analysis and ii) explain the full set of results presented in this paper (including the differential

outcomes for certified versus non-certified green bonds).

          My results highlight the importance of certification in the green bond market. The fact that

my findings are only significant for certified green bonds suggests that certification is effective as

a private governance regime. Nevertheless, it need not be the most effective governance regime.

While the green bond market is still in its early years, several challenges have been raised by

practitioners. First, the definition of "green" is ambiguous, which complicates the certification.

This is exemplified by the recent case of the Spanish energy company Repsol. In 2017, the Climate

Bond Initiative (CBI) refused to certify Repsol's green bond. Interestingly, CBI (2017)

acknowledged that the bond did aim at reducing emissions ("The goal of the bond is to reduce

GHG emissions from refineries and, yes, the bond will avoid emissions: an estimated 1.2M tonnes

of CO2 annually by 2020"), yet CBI's concern was that Repsol's environmental strategy did not

go far enough to qualify as green ("[...] any investment in making refineries more efficient, as this

bond is aiming to, will likely extend plant operating lifetimes and therefore indirectly increase

emissions over time").

          Second, there are a number of international and national taxonomies addressing green bond

project definitions, including the Green Bond Principles (GBP) and the Climate Bonds Standard

(CBS). However, the lack of universal rules and standardization is a common concern among green

bond investors. As the OECD notes, "[c]onvergence towards commonly accepted definitions will

be essential to maximise the effectiveness, efficiency and integrity of the market" (OECD, 2017,

p. 13).




                                                    20
          Third, the current certification of green bonds is binary in nature (i.e., certified vs. not

certified), whereas green bonds are likely to differ in terms of their environmental impact. A

scheme based on tiered ratings (e.g., a triple A rating for the strongest environmental impact)--

similar to the model used by credit rating agencies--could improve the informativeness of the

certification and help expand the depth of the green bond market.

          Arguably, these challenges are likely to be exacerbated as the market further expands in

the years to come. In this context, voices have been raised advocating for a hybrid governance

regime that combines the benefits of both public and private governance (Park, 2018). Admittedly,

the (current) lack of public governance is likely suboptimal. While private governance is both

flexible and pragmatic, it may lack transparency, legitimacy, and accountability. Those could be

guaranteed by public governance, which can provide a unified basis that enhances the effectiveness

of private governance. More broadly, this discussion illustrates the need for more research that

studies the optimal design of the governance of the green bond market.20

          Several of the challenges that arise in the context of green bonds extend to other

instruments that aim at addressing climate change. In particular, carbon offsets are subject to



20
   Relatedly, the lack of public governance pertaining to the disclosure of non-financial information bears the risk that
it leads to i) a lack of best practices, ii) a lack of standardization of disclosure, and iii) difficulties for financial analysts
and investors to interpret non-financial performance metrics. Also--and perhaps more importantly--the lack of public
governance may lead to a lack of disclosure of non-financial information altogether. This issue arises, for example, in
the context of companies' exposure to climate change risks. In many countries (including the U.S.), the disclosure of
such information is not mandated by law. As a result, many companies do not disclose their exposure to climate change
risks, despite the potential (long-term) financial benefits of mitigating climate-related costs and risks (Cheng, Ioannou,
and Serafeim, 20014; Dhaliwal, Li, Tsang, and Yang, 2011; Sharfman and Fernando, 2008). To compensate for the
absence of government regulation, shareholders increasingly step up and pressure their portfolio companies to disclose
and address climate change risks. Indeed, companies are expected to face a record high of climate-related shareholder
proposals at the upcoming shareholder meetings (Wall Street Journal, 2019). In line with this trend, a recent survey
of institutional investors paints a striking picture: the majority of surveyed investors believe that climate risk reporting
is as important as financial reporting, and one-third believe that climate risk reporting is even more important (Krueger,
Sautner, and Starks, 2018). In a recent study, Fabrizio, Flammer, Toffel, and Viswanathan (2019) highlight that
investors are indeed effective in eliciting greater corporate transparency with respect to firms' climate risk exposure,
thereby contributing to their portfolio companies' governance. A direct implication of their findings is that, in absence
of mandatory disclosure requirements, this greater ability also implies a greater responsibility of investors to be active
owners and engage with the management to elicit the disclosure of climate risks.

                                                               21
similar concerns. Carbon offsetting is the process of compensating for CO2 emissions through

schemes that are designed to make offsetting reductions in emissions from other parts of the

economy. For example, several airlines (such as British Airways, Delta, and Emirates) offer carbon

offset programs. Essentially, passengers have the option to "offset" the emissions generated by

their flight by contributing to a wide variety of offsetting actions--e.g., the replanting of trees in

at-risk areas, the development of wind farms, etc. Such carbon offsets have faced skepticism on

several grounds (e.g., Anderson, 2012; Forbes 2019). One key issue is the lack of transparency

regarding the environmental impact of the offsetting action.21 Third-party certification is a

potential remedy, and certification standards for carbon offsets have started to emerge (such as the

Climate Action Reserve and Green-e Climate). Importantly, the insights gained from the green

bond market might help shape the governance structure of this (and other) instruments in the fight

against climate change.

         Relatedly, some of the lessons learned from the carbon offsets might help inform the policy

discussion pertaining to green bonds. In particular, a key consideration in the context of carbon

offsets is the notion of additionality. For carbon offsets to be effective, the activity that is financed

by the carbon offset (e.g., the planting of trees) needs to be "additional"--if it were to happen

anyway (regardless of the carbon offset), it is not additional.22 To help ensure the additionality of

carbon offsets, the United Nations' Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) has designed a series

of "additionality tests" (see UNFCCC, 2004). For example, one of these tests is the legal and


21
   For example, referring to airlines' carbon offset programs, Forbes (2019) notes that "[b]alancing the carbon emitted
by your airline seat through the planting of several trees in South America does not involve solely the solitary act of
placing the tree in the soil. In order to plant the trees, there are several steps. Firstly, they must be bought from a
supplier, transported to a warehouse before being driven out to a site that needs to be cleared prior to them being
planted--all these actions produce their own share of carbon emissions, which are not always taken into account. If
your offset produces more emissions than if you had done nothing, then it is really not an offset."
22
   For example, if airline passengers buy carbon offsets from entities that would have reduced their emissions anyway
(i.e., even absent the carbon offset), such offsets are not additional. In such cases, airline passengers are merely
subsidizing an activity that would have happened regardless, as opposed to neutralizing their emissions.

                                                         22
regulatory additionality test--if the project is implemented to fulfill formal policies, regulations,

or industry standards, it does not qualify as additional. If the project goes beyond compliance

("regulatory surplus"), than it may qualify.23 Naturally, a similar challenge arises in the context of

green bonds. For green bonds to make a difference, the projects that are financed by the bond

proceeds need to be additional. If companies were to undertake these projects regardless, little is

gained form the "green financing," especially if companies simply refinance their existing

(ordinary) bonds into green bonds, with no effective change in companies' actions. Criteria such

as the CDM additionality tests might be helpful in shaping this dimension of the green bond

market.




23
     Other tests include the investment test, barriers test, and common practice test. See UNFCCC (2004) for details.

                                           Green municipal bonds

This table reports summary statistics for green municipal bonds and ordinary municipal bonds (i.e., municipal bonds
that are not labelled as "green"). Issuance amount is the amount issued (in $M). Maturity is the maturity of the bond
(in years). Coupon is the coupon rate (in %). Coupon type refers to the type of coupon payment. S&P rating refers to
the credit rating of Standard & Poor's. All figures are sample means (and percentages, respectively). The dataset
includes all municipal bonds ("munis") in Bloomberg issued between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2018.
