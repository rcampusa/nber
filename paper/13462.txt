                                              ABSTRACT

The spatial mismatch hypothesis posits that employment decentralization isolated urban blacks from
work opportunities. This paper focuses on one large employer that has remained in the central city
over the twentieth century – the U.S. Postal Service. We find that blacks substitute towards postal
work as other employment opportunities leave the city circa 1960. The response is particularly strong
in segregated areas, where black neighborhoods are clustered near the central business district. Furthermore,
this pattern only holds for non-mail carriers, many of whom work in central processing facilities. More
recently, the relationship between black postal employment and segregation has declined, suggesting
that spatial mismatch has become less important over time.

I. Introduction

        In the early twentieth century, manufacturing plants and related low- and mid-skill level

jobs located near central business districts to take advantage of railroads and other transportation

nodes. Black migrants to urban areas settled in residential enclaves close to these employment

opportunities in this period (Taeuber and Taeuber, 1965; Farley, 1968). After the Second World

War, firms began relocating from central cities to the suburban ring (Glaeser and Kahn, 2001).

While white households could – and did – readily follow jobs to the suburbs, African-Americans

initially faced strong barriers to suburban residence. As a result, segregation became increasingly

synonymous with the residential centralization of black neighborhoods in otherwise

employment-decentralized metropolitan areas. In a famous paper, Kain (1968) argued that this

“spatial mismatch” worsened employment outcomes for African-American labor, thereby

harming the prospects for black economic progress.

        This paper provides a novel test of spatial mismatch. We examine the historical evolution

of racial differences in employment at the United States Postal Service (USPS), an employer

whose large processing and distribution plants remained centralized long after other firms left

downtown areas. Specifically, we investigate whether black postal employment increased as

other job opportunities disappeared from central cities. To control for other forces changing

black employment patterns over this period (such as rising educational attainment), we compare

postal employment in more- and less-segregated metropolitan areas; in segregated areas, black

residents live farther from suburban job openings. We also use white workers as a control group

to adjust for general effects of residential segregation; for example, segregation may lead to the

inefficient duplication of public infrastructure. Our main analysis is thus a triple-difference,

comparing black and white postal employment rates between more- and less- segregated areas

over time.

        Residential segregation was unrelated to the relative odds of black postal employment in

1940 or 1950, when centrally-located jobs were plentiful. In 1960 and 1970, as firms began

relocating to the suburban ring, a large positive correlation between segregation and black postal

employment emerges. After 1970, this relationship weakened but, as recently as 2000, was still

positive and statistically significant. This attenuation is consistent with the changing nature of

residential segregation, which no longer solely occurs between black cities and white suburbs,

but now incorporates black neighborhoods in the suburban ring. Our results suggest that spatial

mismatch was an important force in 1960 and 1970 but became less potent over time as black

households gained access to the suburbs.

        We interpret the time series pattern as evidence that black workers substituted toward

postal employment as jobs disappeared from the central city. We test this proposition further in a

cross-section of metropolitan areas, finding that blacks are more likely to work for the postal

service in areas with decentralized employment. We also exploit a distinction between

occupations in the postal service: mail carriers tend to work throughout the metropolitan area,

while clerks, whose primary task is to process inter-city mail, are concentrated downtown.

Consistent with our emphasis on job access, the relationship between residential segregation and

postal employment is only found for non-mail carriers.

        We also conduct a number of robustness tests to probe the sensitivity of our basic

findings. While we treat non-carrier postal work as a prototypical example of a centrally-located

job, we find a similar relationship between segregation and black employment in other highly

centralized public sector occupations ca. 1970. Our results are robust to changing the sample

parameters (for example, including non-workers); measuring segregation for the central city

alone; including additional city or metropolitan area covariates; and restricting the analysis to

young workers to minimize the selection bias induced by migration across urban areas.

        This paper introduces two innovations to the spatial mismatch literature. Our first

contribution is the emphasis on occupational choice. Previous studies have focused on black

employment or labor force attachment (Ellwood, 1986; Ilhanfeldt and Sjoquist, 1990; Rogers,

1997; Raphael, 1998; Hellerstein, Neumark and McInerney, 2007).1 These measures introduce a

well-recognized omitted variables problem. Within metropolitan areas, residents who are, for

unobservable reasons, less attached to the labor force might sort into neighborhoods that are

farther from job opportunities. One solution to this problem has been to use variation across

metropolitan areas, which minimizes (but does not eliminate) the possibility of sorting

(Ihlanfeldt and Sjoquist, 1989; Weinberg, 2000; Weinberg, 2004). We propose another solution:

identify an outcome that is associated with spatial mismatch but is otherwise unlikely to be

positively correlated with the propensity to live in isolated neighborhoods. We argue that

working for the postal service, a well-paid, civil service job that, for historical reasons, has

remained in downtown areas, is an excellent candidate.

        Our second innovation is an historical perspective. Most studies of spatial mismatch rely

on data for a single cross section or short period of time. By design, these cannot reveal when

spatial mismatch first became a problem or whether the importance of mismatch intensified or

waned over time in response to changes in the ability of blacks to access suburban employment.

We compile data from 1940 to 2000 and, by observing changes in black occupational choices as

employment decentralized, are able to “trace out” an economic history of spatial mismatch.

II. Residential Segregation in Historical Context

        Prevailing wisdom about the likely effect of residential segregation on black economic

outcomes has shifted over the century. In the 1920s and 1930s, scholars argued that residential

segregation provided a protected market for African-American professionals and shop owners

who served an overwhelmingly black clientele (W.E.B. Dubois, 1967 [1899]; E. Franklin

Frazier, 1957; Abram Harris, 1936; Gunnar Myrdal, 1944; Carter Woodson, 1934). After the

wave of urban riots in the 1960s, policymakers and community leaders continued to actively

debate the relative benefits of segregation versus integration (Downs, 1968; Kain and Persky,

1969; Levine, 1972). By contrast, many scholars now blame residential segregation for the

persistence of concentrated pockets of black poverty (Wilson 1987; Massey and Denton, 1993;

Cutler and Glaeser 1997; Collins and Margo 2000).

        The timing of this reversal of opinion broadly coincides with the departure of many large

employers from central cities.2 During the first half of the century, employment remained heavily

concentrated in the central business district, even as population began to disperse to early street

car suburbs and later to bedroom communities accessible by car (Warner, 1978; Jackson, 1985).

Case studies of particular cities suggest that employment decentralization was underway by the

early 1950s (Fogelson, 2001, pp. 381-394).3 The Census Bureau began gathering data on work

locations in 1960. The share of metropolitan area residents who worked in the center city fell

perceptibly over the next decade from 59.3 percent in 1960 to 51.7 percent in 1970. By 2000,

only 42.3 percent of the metropolitan workforce remained in the center city.



2
  In making this point, we are not asserting that center city job loss cum spatial mismatch contributed to the
emergence of “bad ghettos,” only that the two are temporally associated. See Cutler and Glaeser (1997) and Collins
and Margo (2000) for econometric evidence relating segregation to black outcomes.
3
  Baum-Snow (2007) calculates that, in 1950, 64 percent of employment in manufacturing, retail and wholesale
trade, and business/repair services was located in central cities, compared to 61.8 percent in 1960. These sectors
were more concentrated than average, so levels for the whole workforce were slightly lower.

         Before 1970, few African-American households lived in the suburbs, even if they could

afford to do so. Initially, many suburban neighborhoods were covered by restrictive covenants,

which prevented the transfer of property to African-Americans and members of other groups

(Brooks, 2002). Even after the legal enforceability of such covenants was struck down by the

Supreme Court in the late 1940s, black suburbanization was slowed by the intimidation and

violence of white residents and the discriminatory behavior of realtors and financial institutions

(Sugrue, 1996; Ross and Yinger, 2002; Stuart, 2003). Early state-level fair-housing laws were

largely ineffective in combating these tactics (Collins, 2004).

         Blacks began to move to the suburbs in earnest after the passage of federal fair housing

legislation in 1968. While, in 1960, 84.8 of African-Americans in metropolitan areas lived in the

central city, this share fell to 68.1 by 1980.4 As a result, the problem of spatial mismatch was

likely most acute in the 1950s and 1960s, when employment had started to decentralize, but

black households were yet unable to follow.



III. The Location and Racial Composition of Postal Employment

         The US Postal Service has long been one of the nation’s largest civilian employers, and it

is the only employer with separate industry and occupation codes in the federal Census (Bureau

of Labor Statistics, 2007). Virtually all postal jobs are subject to civil service rules requiring

individuals to pass an exam in order to qualify for employment. When a job becomes available,

hiring officers must choose from the three top-scoring candidates (the so-called “Rule of Three”)

subject to some restrictions on veteran status.5


4
  The change may understate the actual extent of black suburbanization if central city boundaries expanded due to
annexation.
5
  Specifically, among the top three candidates veteran status trumps rank. If the top candidate is a veteran, he or she
must be chosen; if the second ranked candidate is a veteran, the third ranked candidate cannot be selected.

                                                           5
Leah Platt Boustan and Robert A. Margo                                                            July 2008


         Figure 1 portrays the share of men employed by the postal service over the century. For

comparison, we also show the share of men who worked in the remainder of the one-digit

industry “public administration.”6 Around one percent of the white male labor force was

employed in the postal service throughout the century. In contrast, black postal employment

increased dramatically from one to 2.5 percent between 1940 and 1970, a rate faster than the

general growth in public employment. The timing of this growth broadly corresponds to black

migration to urban areas and the beginning of employment decentralization.

         From 1970 onward, the odds of postal employment have been falling for all men. This

decline may reflect the introduction of ZIP codes in 1963. The resulting automation of mail

processing allowed substantial substitution of capital for labor. Private sector substitutes for the

postal service (for example, Federal Express and United Parcel Service) and the rise of various

forms of electronic communication, such as email and cellular phones, may have also

contributed to this decline in recent years.

         While blacks are twice as likely as whites to work for than postal service nationwide, in

some cities, this disparity was twice or three times as large. Figure 2 presents the share of black

and whites in the full-time, full-year labor force who were employed at the USPS by

metropolitan area in 1970. The white share fluctuates between one and two percent across the

country. By contrast, in some cities – with San Francisco, Chicago, and Indianapolis most

prominent among them – the share of blacks working for the postal service was as high as 7.5

percent, an extraordinarily large (and, to our knowledge, previously unnoticed) racial disparity.


6
  The “public administration” industry covers public employees whose occupations are considered by the Census
Bureau to be “intrinsic” to the public sector. Thus, for example, public school teachers are classified as working in
educational services rather than public administration because teachers can work for either a public or a private
school. From 1940 onward, the Census uses the “class of worker” variable to identify all public sector employees
regardless of their specific occupation. Appendix Table 1 presents the number of men by race employed in the entire
public sector from 1940-2000, along with the intrinsic public employees depicted in Figure 1. These intrinsic
employees make up 40 percent of the total public sector, and their growth mirrors that of the sector as a whole.

         The over-representation of African-Americans in postal employment may be due to the

retention of mail processing facilities in downtown areas, near black neighborhoods, even as

similar warehousing and wholesale operations moved to the suburbs. The centralization of mail

processing dates from the early twentieth century, when the bulk of intercity mail was

transported by rail.7 At the time, central post offices were built in the heart of the central business

district near the main rail terminal. Intercity mail was collected at this central facility, loaded on

the train, and sorted en route (into cubbyholes) by highly trained railway mail clerks.

         Railway mail waned after the 1920s, a casualty of advances in trucking and air

transportation. The last rail route between New York City and Washington, DC ceased

operations in 1977. Given that population and businesses – that is, the demanders and suppliers

of mail delivery – have moved to the suburbs and that the mail itself no longer travels by rail, it

would seem economically sensible that mail processing and distribution, too, would move out of

the central city. However, the postal authorities face a number of regulatory impediments to the

relocation of their main facilities. As one example, the National Environmental Policy Act

(1969) requires that federal agencies prepare an environmental impact statement, including a

consideration of local job loss, before undertaking any “major federal action,” including the

relocation of a large postal processing plant.8 Local politicians and postal unions also routinely

oppose site relocation.

         As a result, mail processing and distribution has continued apace in central cities. Table 1

presents evidence on the geographic location of postal jobs. The first panel uses place of work


7
 Our discussion of the history of mail processing and distribution is based on United States Postal Service (2003).
8
 The case precedent on postal processing and distribution centers was established in City of Rochester v. U.S. Postal
Service, 541 F.2d967. In the early 1970s, the city of Rochester sued the postal service over its plan to shutter its
downtown facility. The court found that closing the Rochester postal facility constituted a “major federal action,”
and further added that the “environmental impact” of an action must include any socioeconomic consequences – for
example, job loss – that might ensue. Despite these findings, the court ruled against the city on technical grounds,
and the Rochester center was relocated to the suburbs.

data from the 1970 Census to compare the job locations of postal employees with the rest of the

workforce. Around half of the private and (non-postal) public sector employees remained

downtown in that year. Mail carriers were similarly distributed between the city and the suburbs.

By contrast, 71 percent of non-carrier postal employees worked in the city.9 Indeed, nearly one in

five such postal employees worked in the central business district, compared to one in twelve

workers in the private sector.10

         To further document the location of mail processing activities, we mapped the street

addresses of the 237 Processing and Distribution Centers (P&DCs) in the 2007 Postal

Directory.11 The second panel of Table 1 displays characteristics of the neighborhoods in which

these facilities are located.12 Eighty percent are in the central city. The average black population

share in a facility neighborhood is 38 percent, compared with 28 percent in the surrounding

county. Even more striking is the fact that the typical facility is located in a neighborhood that is

physically adjacent to at least one census tract that is majority black. The maximum black

population share for a tract in the typical facility neighborhood is 64 percent.

         Unlike other centrally-located jobs with modest skill requirements, postal work offers

high salaries and good benefits. Gosnell (1935, p. 305) reported that, in the late 1920s, black

postal workers were “among the best livers [on] Chicago’s south side.” This rosy picture is

consistent with nationally representative Census data, which are presented in Appendix Table 2.

In 1940, 14 percent of all blacks earning above the national median worked for the postal


9
  Over two-thirds of non-carrier postal employees are classified as “clerical, n.e.c.”; these include workers at both
retail post offices and at processing and distribution facilities. The other large occupation groups include
postmasters, laborers, janitors, and truck drivers.
10
   Despite overall decentralization, this disparity in job location was still present in 2000. 54 percent of other postal
employees worked in the central city, compared to 38 percent of mail carriers and 42 percent of all private sector
workers.

service.13 The earnings of the average black postal worker placed him in the top five percent of

the black weekly wage distribution and at the 70th percentile of the non-black distribution in that

year. By 2000, the mean black postal worker remained in the top 25 percent of black earners and

above the median for the nation as a whole.



IV. Data, Estimation Strategy and Empirical Results

        We examine the changing relationship between segregation and black postal employment

by pooling Census data from 1940 to 2000 and estimating regressions of the form:



 Postalijt = α j + Σt βt(Black)ijt + Σt γt(Segregationjt) + Σ δt(Blackijt · Segregationjt) + Φt + ΩXijt + εijt   (1)



where i and j index individuals and metropolitan areas, respectively, and t indexes Census year.

Postalijt is an indicator equal to one for postal employees. The coefficients of interest (δt) are year-

specific interactions between a metropolitan area’s level of segregation and an indicator for an

individual’s race. If δt is positive, blacks in segregated areas are more likely to work for the post

office, relative to their white counterparts, in year t. Under the spatial mismatch hypothesis, we

expect δt to be close to zero in 1940 and 1950, before other employment left the city, and to be

positive from 1960 onward as the post office becomes, in many cases, the only good job in

proximity to black neighborhoods. As black households gain increasing access to the suburbs,

the relationship between segregation and postal work may diminish.

        The other controls adjust for the main effects of race, segregation and Census year. In

some specifications, we directly include a decade-specific measure of local residential

13
  Black postal workers had disproportionately high levels of education in 1940. 28.1 percent of black postal workers
had at least some college education, compared to 4.9 percent of the black population as a whole. In part because of
their high wages and educational attainment, black postal workers played an important role in black community life
(Rubio, 2006).

segregation alongside a single metropolitan area fixed effect. In others, we estimate a vector of

time-varying metropolitan area fixed effects, which absorbs the main effect of segregation and

any other correlated local characteristics.14 Standard errors are clustered to allow for correlated

errors at the metropolitan area level.15

         The micro-Census data are taken from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series

(IPUMS) (Ruggles, et al., 2008). We construct a sample of men and women between the ages of

18 and 64 who worked full time for the full year in the non-farm economy.16 Later, we

demonstrate that the results are robust to excluding women or including part-time workers and

the unemployed. We cannot include 1960 in the main analysis because metropolitan areas are not

identified in the micro data in that year; we conduct a comparable state-level analysis below.

         We measure residential segregation using the dissimilarity index, which is defined at the

metropolitan area level as:


                  ½ Σn | [(blackn /blacktotal) – (non-blackn /non-blacktotal)] | .                            (2)


Blacktotal is the number of black residents in the entire metropolitan area, while blackn counts

black residents in a given Census tract (neighborhood).17 The index takes on a value of zero

when each neighborhood mirrors the racial composition of the metropolitan area as a whole and

a value of one in a perfectly segregated SMSA. The dissimilarity index does not explicitly

14
   Year-specific metropolitan area fixed effects will also implicitly control for any boundary changes to the central
city or the metropolitan area over time due to annexation or expansion along the periphery.
15
   We also add a full vector of individual controls (Xij), including a fourth degree polynomial in age, and a series of
dummies equal to one if the individual is female, married, a veteran or foreign born. Educational attainment is
measured as highest grade completed; in 1990 and 2000, we use the IPUMS education recode. We include dummies
for the following categories of completed schooling: 0-8, 9-11, 12, 13-15, and 16 or more years. All personal
characteristics are interacted with the race dummy. The 1950 regression includes only sample line individuals.
16
   Full-time, full-year workers are individuals who work both 40 hours a week and 40 weeks during the year. We
exclude those who are currently enrolled in school, living in group quarters, or in the armed services.
17
   In 1940 and 1950, the index reflects segregation within the central city, while the indices for 1960-2000 are
calculated at the metropolitan area level. For comparison, we construct a city-level segregation index for 1970 (see
Table 8, column 3).

measure black residential centralization. In theory, a segregated city could be divided down the

middle, with blacks living on one side of the central business district and whites living on the

other; however, this scenario is highly at odds with the history of American urban development.

We demonstrate below that black postal employment is also correlated with direct measures of

centralization. Summary statistics for the individual and metropolitan area level variables are

presented in Appendix Table 3.



Empirical Results: IPUMS estimates

        Table 2 reports the coefficients of interest from various specifications of equation 1.

Panel A contains a single metropolitan area fixed effect, which allows us to estimate the main

effect of segregation on postal employment. Panel B instead estimates a separate metropolitan

area fixed effect in each year. In both panels, we find no meaningful relationship between

segregation and the relative probability of black postal employment in 1940 or 1950.18 When

employment opportunities remained in the central city, living in a more segregated metropolitan

area did not encourage blacks to pursue postal work.

        In contrast, by 1970, blacks in segregated area were more likely to be employed in the

postal service. A one standard deviation increase in the metropolitan dissimilarity index is

associated with a 1.4 point increase – or a doubling – in the probability of black postal

employment (= 0.12 · 0.117). The size of this relationship declines from 1970 to 2000, but

remains statistically and economically significant in each year. The magnitude of the coefficient

in 1970 is compatible with what we know about the extent of job loss from the central city

between 1950 and 1970. In 1950, around 60 percent of metropolitan jobs were located in the

18
  In 1940, neighborhood population counts were conducted at both the tract- and the ward-level. Ward level data is
available for 82 metropolitan areas. We find a similar relationship between segregation and postal work when using
ward-level geography (coeff. = 0.011; s.e. = 0.011).

central city; this share fell to 52 percent by 1970 (see footnote 3). In a metropolitan area with

100,000 workers, a decline of this size translates into the loss of 8,000 city positions. If job loss

was proportional to the racial composition of the typical urban workforce, 800 “black” jobs – or

10 percent of the total – would have been lost to the suburbs. In the average city in 1970, 2.5

percent of the black workforce, or 130 black workers in this example, were employed at the

postal service. An increase in residential segregation would result in an additional 130 black

workers at the postal service, or 16 percent of all those whose jobs moved to the suburban ring.

        The number of metropolitan areas that can be identified in the micro data and for which

the data exist to calculate a segregation index varies from 45 in 1940 to 243 in 2000. We are

concerned that changes to the sample composition may contribute to fluctuations in the point

estimates over time. Panel C conducts a parallel analysis for the 45 metropolitan areas that can

be consistently identified in each decade. The basic relationship between segregation and postal

employment is unchanged, but the coefficients are between 15 and 40 percent smaller.

        Given the similarity of the results in the full and reduced samples, we verify that the

relationship between segregation and postal work is not being driven by a few outliers. Figure 3

plots the differential probability of postal employment (black versus white) against residential

segregation in 1970. The postal probabilities are regression-adjusted for the full set of individual

characteristics. The figure suggests that the positive relationship between segregation and black

postal employment is a general phenomenon, rather than being driven by a single city like

Chicago that is both highly segregated and has a large concentration of black postal workers.

        All results thus far have been estimated using a sample of full-time, full-year employees.

The relationship between segregation and black postal employment may be attenuated in a

sample that includes part-time workers and the unemployed. The share of all adults engaged in

Leah Platt Boustan and Robert A. Margo                                               July 2008


postal work can be expressed as {pr(employed) · pr(postal | employed)}. If segregation is

associated with low black employment rates, the first term in this expression will decrease,

potentially obscuring the relationship of interest (Cutler and Glaeser, 1997). Table 3

demonstrates that the relationship between segregation and postal employment is robust to this

concern. The regressions in the first row include all adults. The coefficients are 20 to 25 percent

smaller than for the full-time, full-year sub-sample, but remain significant and large. Reading

down the rows, the table adds incremental employment restrictions to the sample. The

relationship between segregation and postal employment slowly grows to match the preferred

sample in the last row.

        There is a dramatic increase in the relationship between segregation and black postal

employment between 1950 and 1970. One concern is that specific events during the 1960s –

including urban riots, the return of veterans from Vietnam, and a large reorganization of the

postal service late in the decade – could be responsible for this change. Finding a similar

relationship in 1960 would cast doubt on these decade-specific alternatives. Because the 1960

IPUMS does not report metropolitan area of residence, we cannot estimate equation 1 in this

year. However, the 1960 IPUMS does report state of residence. Table 4 pools data from 1940-

2000 and conducts an analogous state-level regression, in which a state’s segregation index is

calculated by weighting the dissimilarity indices of cities in that state by population. As in the

metropolitan area regression, segregation has no effect on black postal employment in 1940 or

1950, but strongly increases the probability of working for the postal service in 1960. In fact, the

coefficients in 1960 and 1970 are not statistically distinguishable from each other and the 1970

coefficient is similar to the estimate in the main metropolitan area level regression (Table 2,




                                                 13
Leah Platt Boustan and Robert A. Margo                                                            July 2008


column 3). As before, the relationship between segregation and black postal employment

attenuates between 1970 and 2000.



Direct Measures of Job Access and Employment Decentralization

         From 1960 to 2000, relative black employment in the postal service was higher in

segregated metropolitan areas, where black residence was likely to be concentrated downtown.

This timing is consistent with our interpretation that centrally-located black workers substituted

toward postal work as other jobs left the central city. In this case, we would expect to find the

same phenomenon in a cross-section of metropolitan areas. Specifically, we should observe more

black postal employment in areas where the majority of employment opportunities are located in

the suburban ring.

         The most comprehensive combination of place of work and place of residence data is

available in the 1980 IPUMS.19 The first panel of Table 5 demonstrates that blacks were more

likely to work for the postal service in areas where employment was decentralized or where

black residence was highly concentrated in the central city in that year. The second column

interacts residential segregation and the share of employment in the central city. We expect

segregation to have a smaller effect on black postal employment in areas in which centrally-

located employment options are plentiful – and, indeed, we find this pattern. To interpret the

magnitude of this interaction, consider the mean metropolitan area in 1980, in which 55 percent

of employees work in the central city. In this case, complete segregation (dissimilarity equal to

one) would have a large positive impact on black postal employment (coeff. = 0.051). Increasing

the share of downtown employment to 71 percent (or one standard deviation) would reduce the

19
  In 1970, either metropolitan area of residence or place of residence within the metropolitan area (city versus
suburb) is identified, but not both. Neither 1990 nor 2000 distinguishes between working in the central business
district from working in the remainder of the central city.

                                                         14
Leah Platt Boustan and Robert A. Margo                                                        July 2008


impact of segregation on black postal employment considerably (coeff. = 0.016). This finding is

consistent with our reading of the time series pattern. Residential segregation only encourages

blacks to substitute towards postal employment when other centrally-located jobs are scarce.

           The second panel of Table 5 examines the relationship between black postal employment

and a direct measure of racial residential centralization. The centralization index measures the

cumulative proportion of blacks relative to whites who live within concentric bands around the

central business district.20 Higher values of the centralization index are significantly associated

with relative black postal employment (column 1). The centralization index, while a more direct

measure of black residential concentration, is highly correlated with the dissimilarity index

(column 2).



Comparing Mail Carriers to Other Postal Employees

           Thus far, our analysis has examined the entire postal workforce. However, within the

postal service, only postal clerks tend to work downtown, while mail carriers are distributed

throughout the metropolitan area (Table 1). If residential segregation limits blacks’ access to

suburban jobs, we should see a stronger relationship between segregation and employment in

non-carrier positions. Furthermore, this pattern should not be specific to the post office – rather,

segregation should increase black employment in any public sector occupation that tends to be

concentrated in central cities.

           Table 6 presents results from seemingly unrelated regressions in which the dependent

variables are indicators for working as a mail carrier, as a non-carrier postal employee, or as a

public employee in an occupation whose members are more/less likely to work in the central

city. We divide occupations in the public sector into those that are above and below median for
20
     See Galster (1984) for a comparison of this index to other measures of centralization.

                                                            15
Leah Platt Boustan and Robert A. Margo                                                             July 2008


the share of workers employed in the central city.21 Bus drivers and subway conductors are the

most centralized occupations, while teachers are among the most decentralized.22

         We present the main coefficient of interest (the interaction between segregation and a

race dummy) for three decades that span the period. In 1940, living in a segregated city does not

increase the probability of a black resident working for the postal service in any capacity. In

contrast, by 1970, segregation becomes positively associated with postal work, but only for the

non-carriers, who tend to work in the central city. The probability of working as a mail carrier, a

job that is evenly distributed between city and suburb, has no meaningful relationship with

segregation in any year. In 1970, other public occupations follow a similar pattern. Segregation

increases the share of African-Americans working in centralized public occupations and

decreases the share working in decentralized occupations. By 2000, the distinction between

centralized and decentralized public occupations disappears.

         Our comparison of occupations within the postal sector rules out alternative explanations

based on general changes to either the postal service or public employment – including the

formal recognition of postal unions by the federal government in the early 1960s or the Civil

Rights movement. There is no reason to believe that these changes should have differentially

affected particular occupations within the public sector.

         Furthermore, the distinction between mail carriers and other postal employees challenges

explanations based on private sector racism. Suppose that a city’s level of residential segregation

were correlated with the propensity of its employers to discriminate on the basis of race.23 In this



21
   The median is calculated by first weighting each occupation by its number of white, metropolitan employees.
22
   In 1970, 67 percent of employees in above-median public occupations worked in the central city. This share is
somewhat lower than postal clerks (71 percent) but provides a reasonable comparison group.
23
   If the correlation between segregation and local racism is a long-standing one, this story would not be consistent
with the lack of a segregation-postal employment relationship in 1940 and 1950. One could imagine, however, that
racism was widespread at mid-century and has been slowest to decline in segregated areas.

case, employers in segregated cities may underpay their black workers, either to satisfy their own

tastes or those of their customers (Becker, 1971). However, the unobserved racism hypothesis

predicts a positive relationship between segregation and all forms of public employment. Instead,

we find that segregation is only correlated with forms of public employment that tend to be

concentrated in the central city.



Additional Robustness Checks

        Tables 7 and 8 provide several additional robustness checks. The results are robust to

reweighting the data; measuring segregation at the city – rather than metropolitan area – level;

separately identifying the effect of initial segregation and changes in segregation; and adding a

series of covariates that are correlated with area segregation. The first column of Table 7

reproduces the coefficient from our preferred specification in 1970. Because we use individual

level data, our regressions are, in effect, weighted by the population size of each metropolitan

area. Results are qualitatively similar if we instead weight each metropolitan area equally

(column 2).

        The dissimilarity index is based on race-specific population counts by Census tract. In

1940 and 1950, the Census Bureau only defined tracts within central cities, while, from 1960

onward, tract data is available in the suburbs as well. This measurement difference could account

for the sharp increase in the relationship between segregation and black postal employment

between 1950 and 1960. For comparison, we calculate a new dissimilarity index for 1970 using

only central city tracts. The city- and metropolitan area-level indices are highly correlated (corr.

= 0.78). However, the relationship between black postal employment and city-level segregation

is only half as large as the baseline estimate (column 3). Black postal employment appears to be



                                                 17
Leah Platt Boustan and Robert A. Margo                                                          July 2008


particularly affected by segregation between the city and its suburbs. We prefer to use the

metropolitan-wide measure when it is available. For an accurate over-time comparison, we

imagine “inflating” the 1940 and 1950 coefficients by the ratio between metropolitan- and city-

level estimates in 1970 (1.857 = 0.117/0.063; Table 7, columns 1 and 3). The resulting

coefficients still imply a doubling of the relationship between segregation and black postal

employment between 1950 and 1960.24

        Higher black postal employment in segregated areas is partially offset with lower postal

employment among non-blacks (Table 2, row 1). Suburbanization – and the associated increase

in residential segregation – may have deterred whites from applying for centrally-located postal

work. The fourth column separates an area’s level of segregation in 1970 into the city’s initial

segregation level in 1940 and changes to that level between 1940 and 1970. Because the growth

of the suburbs was, for the most part, a postwar phenomenon, the initial level of segregation is

less likely to be determined by white suburbanization. We find that both components of

segregation have equally large effects on the probability of black postal employment in 1970,

casting doubt on explanations based on white residential location alone. More likely, with

inelastic labor demand at the post office, blacks in close proximity to postal processing facilities

simply outbid whites for available jobs.

        Segregation is associated with a number of city characteristics that may affect postal

employment. Segregated cities are larger, both in land area and population and, in 1970, had

higher median family income and a lower poverty rate; higher black population share; higher

mobility rates, measured as the share of the population living in the same house in 1965 and

1970; lower January and July temperatures; and fewer workers employed in construction or in


24
  The implied coefficients are 0.019 in 1940 (=0.010 · 1.857; Table 2, column 1) and 0.061 in 1950 (=0.033 · 1.857;
Table 2, column 2).

business, repair and personal services.25 When we included the interaction of each of these

potentially confounding factors in turn, the coefficient on the main segregation interaction

remained statistically significant and varied between 0.106 and 0.138. Only two of these factors

were independently associated with black postal employment – the black population share and

the share of workers employed in construction or business services; regressions with these

variables included on the right hand side are reported in the last two columns of Table 7.

         Selective migration could explain the attenuation in the coefficient of interest between

1970 and 2000. In particular, if skilled blacks left segregated cities after 1970, those remaining

might not score high enough on the civil service exam to secure employment with the postal

service (Ananat, 2007). The first panel of Table 8 re-runs our main specification for both a

sample of young adults (age 18-30), the age group whose location is most likely to be

exogenously determined by their city of birth, and for a comparison group of adults 31 and older

(O’Regan and Quigley, 1996). Although the magnitudes are somewhat different, we find the

same time series pattern in both sets of coefficients: no relationship between segregation and

postal employment in 1940, a large positive effect in 1970, and a smaller but still positive effect

in 2000. The decline between 1970 and 2000 is similar in percentage terms for both young and

older adults, which does not support the sorting hypothesis.

         Finally, we would expect the lack of jobs within close proximity to one’s neighborhood

to be a larger barrier to employment among the less educated who may be less adept at gathering

information about job openings. The second panel of Table 8 divides the sample into high school

dropouts and adults with at least a high school degree. Among blacks, the better educated group


25
  Residential segregation is not correlated with the share of a city’s population that is foreign-born or of Spanish
heritage; the average level of educational attainment of its residents; the share of its residents that commute by
public transportation; the number of police officers or serious crimes per capita; or the share of its housing units that
are single family or owner occupied.

is four times more likely to work for the post office. However, relative to the mean, the positive

effect of segregation on postal employment is twice as strong for the less educated group in

1970. By 2000, not only had the effect of segregation on postal employment declined for both

groups, but the gap between the two disappeared. We see this as further evidence that the

importance of job access in explaining black occupational choice has declined over time.



V. Concluding Remarks

        The spatial mismatch hypothesis posits that as firms relocated to the suburbs, black

neighborhoods grew increasingly isolated from job opportunities. This paper focuses on one

large employer that has remained in downtown areas – the U.S. Postal Service. A significant

fraction of postal facilities were located in central cities during the era of railroad mail delivery

and, for largely bureaucratic reasons, remain in place today. If job accessibility matters, we

should see blacks substituting towards postal work as other employment opportunities leave the

city. This response should be particularly strong in segregated areas, where black neighborhoods

tend to be clustered near the central business district.

        We find that relative black postal employment was an increasing function of segregation

from 1960 onward. Black employment shifted towards the post office at precisely the time when

other “good jobs,” such as those in manufacturing, were leaving central cities, but before fair

housing laws opened the suburbs to middle class black residents. In addition, this pattern is

observed only for non-mail carriers, most of whom work in downtown areas, not for mail

carriers who are distributed more evenly around the metropolitan area. More recently, the

relationship between black postal employment and segregation has been declining, but has not

entirely disappeared. This timing suggests that spatial mismatch has an economic history; that is,



                                                  20
Leah Platt Boustan and Robert A. Margo                                               July 2008


spatial mismatch was once a factor in black employment outcomes but has become less

important over time.

        This paper has concentrated on the effect of segregation on black occupational choice. It

would also be of interest to determine if the continued presence of postal facilities in the vicinity

of black neighborhoods has spillover effects on other types of employment, or perhaps has kept

(some) African-Americans in downtown areas who otherwise would have moved to the suburbs.

In addition, we have also presumed that the centralized nature of mail processing and distribution

is largely exogenous, or at least pre-determined by the history of railway mail. However, it is

clear that strong unions or local government officials have managed to keep facilities centralized

in some areas, but not in others. Analysis of the political economy of these location decisions

may shed further light on the perceived benefits (and costs) of postal work to African-American

communities.

 Notes: Standard errors are in parentheses and are clustered by metropolitan area. * indicates statistical
 significance at the five percent level or better. ** indicates statistical significance at the ten percent level. The
 sample is restricted to full-time, full-year employees who are between the ages of 18-64 and are not currently
 enrolled in school, living in group quarters, in the armed services or in an agricultural industry. Full-time, full-
 year is defined as working at least 40 hours a week and 40 weeks a year. 1960 is not included because IPUMS
 lacks metropolitan area of residence identifiers in that year.
 In addition to listed fixed effects, the regressions include a fourth-order polynomial in age, dummies equal to one
 if the individual is black, married, a veteran, or foreign born, and five dummy variables for highest grade
 completed (using the IPUMS recode in 2000): 0-8, 9-11, 12, 13-15, and 16 years of schooling. All personal
 characteristics are interacted with the variable “black.” When appropriate, regressions are weighted by the
 IPUMS person weight. The dissimilarity index, our measure of residential segregation, is available at the city-
 level in 1940 and 1950 and at the metropolitan area-level from 1960 to 2000.
 §: Two of the metropolitan areas in the 1940 sample are not available in 1950. These are Augusta, GA and Des
 Moines, IA. The 1950 sample adds four metropolitan areas that are not available in 1940. These are:
 Chattanooga, TN; Omaha, NE; Springfield, MA; and Wichita, KS.

Notes: The sample includes men between the ages of 18-64 who are not currently enrolled in school, living in group
quarters, in the armed services or in an agricultural industry. Individuals must also be in the labor force. Between
1900-30, labor force participation is determined by holding a gainful occupation. Between 1940-2000, labor force
participation is determined by employment status (at work or looking for work) during the census week.
‘All public’ includes anyone who is classified as working for the government in the ‘class of worker’ variable; this
designation is available from 1940-2000. The intrinsic public sector includes only those workers whose industry is
reported as: 906 (postal), 916 (federal, non-postal), 926 (state), 936 (local). In some years, SIC code 946 (level of
government not identified) is reported, and is included in total intrinsic figure.
