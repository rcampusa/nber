We illuminate the relationship between optimal firm pricing and optimal trade policy by exploring
a generalized model that accommodates product differentiation at both the national and sub-national
(firm) levels. We assume monopolistic competition in the differentiated products at the sub-national
level. When the national and sub-national substitution elasticities are similar we find little opportunity
for small countries to improve their terms of trade through trade distortions, because firms play an
important preemptive role in optimally pricing unique varieties. We contrast this with standard applications
of perfect-competition Armington models, which exhibit high optimal tariffs--even for relatively small
countries.

1     Introduction

A common feature in many trade-policy applications is the Armington (1969) assumption of

national product differentiation. Brown (1987) critiques these applications, questioning the
validity of simulated liberalizations that result in very large adverse terms-of-trade effects for

relatively small countries. We expand this critique by noting that at the calibration stage of
formulating most Armington models sub-national (firm-level) product differentiation is not

considered. The resulting marginal-cost pricing at the sub-national level implicitly allocates

market power over unique varieties away from optimizing firms and toward the whim of

the policy authority. Although pervasive in applications, this allocation of market power to
countries rather than firms is a troubling departure from traditional tenets.
    This study contributes to the policy simulation literature in two important ways. First,

we use a generalized model of nested differentiation to illustrate the mutual consistency be-
tween traditional models of national differentiation and the large-group monopolistic com-
petition models popular in new trade theory. Second, we identify a tension in calibration
assumptions between firm-level market power and national-level international-policy lever-

age. Market power is conceptually observable, and is show to be an important consideration
in applied welfare analysis. Assuming optimal firm-level pricing over a country’s varieties
can significantly reduce the implied optimal tariff.

    In the past researchers have responded (at least in part) to the Brown (1987) critique

of the Armington formulation by either modifying parametric assumptions, or by modifying
structural assumptions. For example, McDaniel and Balistreri (2003) highlight the general

view that estimated Armington elasticities are too low, and that practitioners favor higher

elasticities, which imply lower optimal tariffs. Others [e.g., Brown et al. (1992)] adopt a

monopolistically-competitive structure that includes firm-level differentiation and industry-
wide scale effects. The approach adopted here is to develop a model that maintains the



                                                1
possibility of both types of differentiation (national and sub-national). We show that the
Armington and monopolistic competition structures impose specific parametric restrictions

on our generalized model.1 We thus shift the focus away from alternative structures and

toward potentially measurable parameters.
    Our application of the generalized model contributes to the policy debate on both the
theoretic and applied fronts. We show in a stylized theoretic model that increasing the degree

of firm differentiation, relative to national differentiation, acts to reduce the optimal tariff.

The optimal tariff remains positive when the degree of firm differentiation is less than the

degree of national differentiation.2 Positive optimal tariffs under monopolistic competition
are broadly consistent with the theoretic work of Flam and Helpman (1987) and Helpman
and Krugman (1989). Tariffs improve a country’s terms of trade regardless of whether

differentiation is at the firm or at the national level, and the terms-of-trade effects of tariffs
intensify when the degree of national differentiation is higher relative to the degree of firm

differentiation.
    We also show, however, that negative optimal tariffs are possible when the degree of
firm-level differentiation is higher than the level of national differentiation.3 This result
is dependent on our assumption that firm markups are based on direct competition with
their domestic rivals. Although natural when firm-level differentiation is lower than national

differentiation, this assumption is more tenuous when domestic varieties are more closely

related to foreign varieties (relative to other domestic varieties). For example, it is natural to

think of a California winery competing more closely with other California wineries. California
    1
      In fact, the model is also general enough to accommodate the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek formulation. In
this case we would set the firm-level and national-level elasticities of substitution to infinity.
    2
      The relevant measure of the level of differentiation between products is the inverse of the elasticity of
substitution.
    3
      Markusen (1990) also finds that optimal tariffs might be negative when the degree of domestic differ-
entiation in a monopolistic-competitive industry is low. That model is somewhat different from the one
employed here, however, because it characterizes the role of specialized inputs in a given industry and treats
all other goods as a homogeneous traded good.




                                                      2
wineries will largely base their markup on proximity, in product space, to other California
wines.

       On the other hand, consider the production of aircraft. It is probably more reasonable

to suppose that Boeing products and Airbus products are less differentiated than Boeing
products and Lockheed Martin products (given that Lockheed Martin does not currently
produce commercial aircraft). The assumption that Boeing would markup its product based

on its degree of differentiation from Lockheed-Martin is logically problematic. For this reason

we place a caveat on our negative optimal tariff results. From an empirical perspective, once

we move to a model with multiple dimensions, commodities should probably be defined in
a way that eliminates the oddity of more domestic differentiation relative to international
differentiation within a given industry. For example, (Boeing) airliners should be considered

a different good than military airplanes and aerospace components (produced by Lockheed-
Martin). As with almost any empirical exercise, aggregation is not innocuous in the context

of assuming markups based on the degree of domestic competition.
       Another interesting result that falls out of our stylized theoretic model is that, in the
presence of firm-differentiation, the optimal tariff increases as the overall degree of preference
bias toward home varieties increases. This is important from the perspective of analyzing
how different sets of calibration assumptions alter the policy implications. There is a great

deal of missing trade in our actual observation of the trade equilibrium.4 In contrast to most

theoretic models and econometric applications, simulation models accommodate missing

trade via a preference bias toward home varieties.5 This bias has an effect on the optimal
tariff under firm-level differentiation because it alters the relative impacts of variety changes

(number of foreign versus domestic varieties) on welfare. This is an important consideration
   4
    Trefler (1995) identifies missing trade relative to what one would expect from the theory.
   5
    Hillberry et al. (2005) critique the over reliance calibrated models place on preference distribution pa-
rameters, and Balistreri and Hillberry (2004) illustrate the importance of home bias in a welfare analysis of
the US-Canada border effect in a calibrated gravity-model application.

in any policy simulation model that includes a love-of-variety formulation and calibrated
preferences over regional aggregates.

    On the applied front we examine the implications, and sensitivity, of our generalized

demand system in a model calibrated to the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) social
accounts [Dimaranan and McDougall (2005)]. We examine the optimal tariff relative to
global free trade for small and large countries. We generally find that optimal pricing by

firms producing differentiated sub-national products acts to reduce the implied optimal tariff.

We also use the model to simulate the recent U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement under

alternative assumptions about firm differentiation. We contrast our results with other studies
that examine the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement.



2     Generalized Demand System

Figure 1 illustrates a generalized demand system for aggregating products differentiated at

both the firm and national levels. Within each country or region (indexed by r ∈ R) traded
goods are produced by monopolistic competitive firms. The composite traded good, Qr , is a

Dixit-Stiglitz aggregate of the Nr individual firm-specific varieties, qr . Although the varieties
produced are different, we assume symmetry across the firms. Algebraically we can represent

the sub-national aggregation of firm-level varieties by

                                              1                     1
                            Qr = [Nr (qr )αf ] αf , where σf =          .                     (1)
                                                                 1 − αf

Throughout our analysis we adopt some simplifying assumptions about the nature of the Qr

that are common in the literature. We assume each of the Nr firms is small and faces an

integrated world market. This indicates a simple markup over marginal cost equal to the

inverse of the elasticity of substitution between firm varieties, 1/σf . Integrated markets imply



                                                  4

independence between the markup and the region in which the firm’s output is ultimately
consumed.

      The parameter σf can take on any value greater than one. The degree of firm-level
differentiation falls as σf increases. When σf takes on a value of infinity then markups are

zero and we have the special case of perfect competition.6 Notice that (1) simply becomes

the sum of the qr at σf equals infinity (αf approaches one as σf approaches infinity). When
σf is finite the free-entry assumption indicates adjustments in the number of varieties such

that operating profits exactly cover fixed cost payments. We also assume that all costs
  6
    We utilize GAMS software, which accommodates assigned parameter values of +inf. In compilation
GAMS automatically assigns the limits 1/+inf = 0 and (+inf− 1)/+inf = 1. So if we have σf = +inf then
αf takes on a value of 1 when the program is compiled.

(marginal and fixed) associated with production use inputs in the same proportion. The
constant-markup formulation indicates constant firm-level output and thus no firm-scale

effects. Changes in industry output are in the form of entry or exit of symmetric varieties.

The love of variety nature of the Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator, however, does indicate industry-
level scale effects. For a general discussion (and critique) of these implications of the large-
group monopolistic-competition assumptions see Markusen (2002), Chapter 6.

    At the national level, the demand system in a given region, r, is composed of a CES ag-

gregate of the imported Dixit-Stiglitz composites and the domestic Dixit-Stiglitz composite:

The substitution elasticity between imported varieties is indicated by σn , and the substitution

elasticity between the imported composite and the domestic composite is indicated by σdm .
In the case that σn equals σdm equation (2) simply collapses to

                                      X                   αn
                                                                                             1
                           Ar =           βsr Qαs n            , where σdm = σn =                .            (4)
                                      s                                                   1 − αn

It is relatively straightforward to accommodate the predominant policy-simulation models
within the general demand system outlined in Figure 1. The special case of a simple constant-

returns Armington formulation is accommodated by setting σf equal to infinity (marginal-

cost pricing by firms) and σn equal to σdm . Contemporary applications tend to adopt the

more complex case where σdm is some fraction—usually one half—of σn .7
    7
      For example, the default elasticities used in the widely applied Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP)
model employ the “rule of two,” which assumes σn = 2σdm [Huff et al. (1997)]. We do not intend to
advocate, or perpetuate, the use of this arbitrary rule. We allow for it in our generalized system because
of its prevalence in application. That said, Liu et al. (2002) fail to reject the “rule of two” as a maintained
hypothesis.


                                                                    6
        Another special case often adopted in the policy simulation literature is the Dixit-Stiglitz
formulation of firm-level differentiation. Setting σf equal to σn equal to σdm collapses the

system such that only firm-level varieties are relevant. Thus by adjusting the elasticities

in relation to one another we can explore different assumptions about the general nature of
product differentiation at the firm and national levels. The demand system has the advantage
of accommodating (parametrically) a wide variety of favored structures that are relevant in

the policy forum.



3         Illustrative General-Equilibrium Simulation Model

The strategy for incorporating the generalized demand system in a relatively transparent
simulation environment involves formulating a stylized theoretic model. The general equilib-

rium is formulated as a Mixed Complementarity Problem (MCP), which is computed using
GAMS software.8 Following Rutherford (1999) the general equilibrium includes three sets

of variables which are associated with three corresponding sets of conditions:

    1. transformation activities, which generate outputs or utility, are associated with an
       optimality condition given the technologies;

    2. prices of inputs, outputs, and composite varieties are associated with market clear-
       ance conditions; and

    3. nominal income levels for each agent are associated with income balance—between
       the value of endowments and the value of demand.


The GAMS code for the algebraic formulation of the nonlinear MCP is presented in Appendix

A. A tabular GAMS/MPSGE formulation is also available from the authors. This section is
divided into two subsections. The first introduces the algebraic formulation, and the second

presents the experimental controls.

3.1      Algebraic formulation

The model incorporates many features designed to indicate how applied general equilibrium
models might react, but also abstracts from many complications that might obscure the
key effects. The model includes multiple regions/countries (indexed by r) that trade on

integrated world markets. This allows us to examine experiments that vary the relative size
of a region and discriminatory trade policies. Other than country size, all other aspects

of each region’s technology and preferences are assumed to be identical. Furthermore, we
assume that each region is endowed with only one factor of production, labor (Lr ), which

might be allocated to production or used directly as an input to welfare (leisure or non-

traded sector).9 Thus a country’s size is controlled by changing its share of the total world

endowment of labor. Table 1 outlines the overall scope of the numeric model indicating the

equilibrium conditions and associated variables.
    We proceed by specifying the conditions outlined in Table 1. For the first condition note
   9
     In the case with only national differentiation, the standard Armington formulation, the economy is fully
specialized, and any level of tariff cannot change domestic production. We introduce the labor-leisure choice
decision in order to avoid this complete specialization and inelasticity of traded output with respect to the
tariff.

that the unit-expenditure function indicates the marginal cost of a unit of welfare (under
optimal consumption), and the welfare level will satisfy marginal cost equals marginal benefit.

Let PAr equal the price of the composite commodity Ar [from equation (2)], and PLr represent

the price of labor, then assuming Cobb-Douglas utility, the equilibrium conditions associated
with a welfare maximizing mix of goods and leisure are given by


                                        PA1−γ

where PWr is the true-cost-of-living index (which is the marginal benefit of an additional unit

of welfare). The first term is the Cobb-Douglas unit-expenditure function. The parameter
γ indicates the value share of the non-tradable (labor) in welfare.

   Associated with optimal activity levels of Ar , the activity which generates the composite
of the traded commodities, are similar conditions that equate marginal cost to marginal

benefit. Marginal benefit is simply represented by the price of the composite, PAr . The unit
cost of Ar is the dual representation of the technology in (2). The arguments in this cost
function include the domestic Dixit-Stiglitz composite price, given by Pr , and the gross-of-

tariff prices of the foreign Dixit-Stiglitz composites, (1 + tsr )Ps (where s ∈ R but s 6= r).

activity (where pr is the price charged by a representative firm);

                                    h              i     1

                                        Nr p1−σ
                                            r
                                               f       1−σf
                                                              − Pr = 0                                (7)


                                                        9
Equation (7) is simply the dual of the Dixit-Stiglitz aggregation presented in (1). Second,
firm-level output, qr , is determined by the optimal pricing decision (where the demand

elasticity for a small firm is σf ). Marginal cost is simply the price of labor, PLr , and firms

maximize profits by pricing according to the familiar markup;


                                         PLr − (1 − 1/σf )pr = 0                                           (8)


The third condition is associated with free entry. The number of firms, Nr , is determined by

the condition that entry will adjust such that profits are zero. Operating profits cover the

value of fixed costs (where we denote fr as the fixed cost in labor units);

                                                       pr qr
                                            PLr fr −         = 0.                                          (9)
                                                        σf

Combining conditions (8) and (9) we can derive the familiar large-group-monopolistic-competition

result that firm-level output is invariant to industry scale. When σf is finite the number of
firms adjusts to ensure zero profits.10

       With all of the technologies specified in conditions (5) through (9) we generate the market
equilibrium conditions for each price. Each market-clearance condition sets excess demand

for each commodity to zero. The market equilibrium condition for labor is given by the

exhaustion of the labor endowment, Lr , on direct demand for labor in utility and on demand
for labor in production. Let RAr indicate nominal income in region r then we have the

following market clearance condition:

                                              RAr
                                     Lr − γ       − Nr (fr + qr ) = 0.                                    (10)
                                              PLr
  10
    As a matter of programming practicality, when σf = ∞ the index on the number of firms is fixed at one
(Nr = 1) and qr is allowed to vary. The level of fixed costs, fr , is calibrated based on σf and our assumption
of zero profits in the benchmark equilibrium. When σf = ∞ there is no markup, and fr = 0.

The price of firm output, pr , is determined by the firm-level market clearance condition;

                                                             Ã        ! σf
                                                                 Pr
                                              qr − Qr                        = 0.                                 (11)

Notice that the rather complex export-demand term (the last term) simplifies greatly when
the elasticity of substitution between national varieties equals the domestic-import elasticity

The first term is total supply of the Armington composite and the second is Cobb-Douglas
demand. The final market clearance condition ensures that the nominal value of welfare

equals the nominal value of representative-agent expenditures, RAr ;


                                                PWr Wr − RAr = 0                                                  (14)

Income equals the value of the labor endowment, where Lr is the endowment quantity, plus

the value of tariff revenues.
    Conditions (5) through (15) specify a complete multi-region general equilibrium that

incorporates the generalized demand system illustrated in Figure 1. Only relative prices are

determined, however, so we remove the market clearance condition for labor in the focus

region, H (Home), and declare the associated price as the numeraire (PLH = 1).


3.2     Experimental Parameters and Calibration

Our primary goal is to examine the effects of changing the relative elasticities, but we are

also concerned with examining the interaction of these effects with changes in the first-order
calibration. The first-order calibration is indicated by the CES distribution parameters (βrs )
and the endowment levels (Lr ).11 We introduce the parametric instrument θH to control

relative country sizes. The size of the focus country, indicated by the index H, is directly

controlled by θH as follows:
                                                      LH = θH LW ,                                                 (16)

where LW = 100 is the (arbitrary) world endowment of labor. For simplicity we assume that

the remaining country’s endowment shares are symmetric (θr = θs , for all r and s 6= H),
  11
     The first-order calibration also depends on the value share of the nontraded sector, γ. We do not explore
the models sensitivity to this parameter in this paper. We simply make the assumption that γ = 0.2 in all
of the experiments that follow.

where R is the total number of regions.

       We also introduce the parametric instrument λ to control the degree of home bias in
preferences. The index λ can vary from zero, indicating no bias toward home varieties, to
one. If λ = 1 then domestic agents only have a preference for home varieties and there
is no trade. This parameter is important because it captures a feature found in many

calibrated models. Normally, missing trade is accommodated (in calibrated models) by
introducing a home bias in the calibrated preferences. This stands in contrast to much of
the theoretic and empirical literature, which emphasizes unobserved trade or networking

costs as an important impediment to trade.12 Table 2 summarizes the parameters that are

utilized in our experiments.
       Given the parameter values we calibrate the benchmark trade equilibrium by computing

the βrs that apply for a given experiment. We first determine units by normalizing on the
                                             ¯ r = 1, and PL
benchmark wage and Armington price indexes (PA             ¯ r = 1) across all regions.

The bar notation indicates the level a variable takes on at the benchmark calibration. We
also normalize the benchmark level of firm output, q̄r = 1, so the number of firms and

    Trefler (1995) highlights the observation of “missing trade” relative to what we might expect. Balistreri
and Hillberry (2004) point out, that most applied general equilibrium models adopt a first-order calibration
that implicitly skews preferences toward home varieties.

We finalize the calibration by calculating the CES weights considering the trade reduction

index (λ). For trade from r to s we have region r’s production share (which is the same as
the endowment share) scaled by the trade reduction index and the reference prices;

4        Results from the Illustrative Model

The first experiments that we examine explore the impact of firm-level differentiation on the

optimal tariff. Figure 2 shows the welfare curves as we vary the tariff imposed by region H
from -15% to 40% under two scenarios. First we adopt a set of relative elasticities not unlike

those typically adopted in standard Armington applied general equilibrium models. That is,
σf = +∞ and σn = σdm = 7. In the second case we include firm-level differentiation, which

is equal to the level of national differentiation (i.e., σf = σn = σdm = 7). In both scenarios

we set the first-order calibration at the central case, characterized by a relatively small focus

region size (θH = 0.001); no home bias in preferences (λ = 0); and a labor value share in
welfare of 20% (γ = 0.2).13

       The curve under an assumption that σf = +∞ confirms the finding of Brown (1987)

that small-country tariffs are large under the typical Armington formulation. The optimal
tariff for this relatively small country is 17%. Because the country is a monopoly supplier of
its export variety the optimal tariff reflects the optimal markup over marginal cost, approx-
imately 1/(σn − 1). In contrast when we make an assumption consistent with sub-national

differentiation, allocating the market power over exports to firms, the optimal tariff drops

dramatically to less than 1/2% (a finer search reveals the optimal tariff to be about 0.4%).
       One significant contribution of our generalized demand system is that all of the interme-
diate cases are also available. Table 3 presents the computed optimal tariffs under different

assumptions about the level of firm differentiation and country size. As one might expect
the optimal tariff increases with both the level of substitution between firm varieties and

the relative country size. For small countries the optimal tariff is critically dependent on

the degree of firm differentiation assumed. For a country that has a relative size of 0.1%
  13
    We choose such a small focus region, because we know that in a perfectly competitive model with
homogeneous goods, the optimal tariff would be zero. Thus the tariff we calculate for the Armington
formulation with no sub-national differentiation (σf = +∞) is due entirely to national product differentiation
and not to country size in Figure 2

of the world economy the optimal tariff ranges from a -16% to a +17% depending on σf .
The negative optimal tariffs found for small countries with more firm differentiation than

national differentiation (σf < σn ) are consistent with Markusen (1990).

       We can think of firms as setting export taxes with their markups. In the cell (7, 0.1%),
the optimal tariff is zero because the small firm’s markup is aligned with a social planner’s
optimal export tax (given that σf = σdm ).14 The firm’s market power is based on the

differentiation indicated by σf , and the (small-country’s) social planner’s market power is

based on the differentiation indicated by σdm . When the elasticities are aligned the social

planner is preempted by optimal firm pricing. In the cell (3.5, 0.1%), the export tax set
by each small firm is too high given that σdm = 7.0, and thus a negative optimal tariff is
required as an offsetting distortion. This is the intuition about the result that moving down

any column leads to an increase in the optimal tariff.
       The intuition about moving across a row (in Table 3) follows from a more traditional

large-country argument for optimal tariffs. Large countries have market power based on the
collective size of their exporting industry on world markets. In the cell (7, 50%) home firms
are optimally exploiting differentiation, but are not accounting for the fact that collectively
they are one half of the world market.15 Essentially, within the industry there is an exter-
nality associated with marginal increases in firm pricing, the benefits of which accrue to all

competing firms. If some of these firms are in the home country then, from a home-country

social planner’s perspective, firm-level mark ups are too low. This effect intensifies as we

move across any given row of Table 3. As we move across the row more of the externality
accrues to home firms, and higher optimal tariffs are indicated.

       Figure 3 and Table 4 show the same pattern of results when we double the elasticity of
  14
     In the general equilibrium export taxes are equivalent to import tariffs. This is commonly known as
Lerner Symmetry [Lerner (1936)].
  15
     This follows directly from our assumption that firms are small. The firm-level demand function [embed-
ded in equation (11)] is based on each firm holding an approximately zero market share.

substitution between national varieties. As mentioned in our introduction one might mitigate
large optimal tariffs in the Armington framework by increasing the Armington elasticity, σn .

We show this implication, as the optimal tariff for the small country drops from 17% to

8% when the national-level elasticity is set to 14 rather than 7. The key contribution that
our generalized demand system offers, however, is a decoupling of the optimal tariff from
the specific Armington elasticity. For small countries, allocating market power over distinct

varieties to firms rather than countries centers the welfare curves in Figures 2 and 3 over an

approximately zero tariff, regardless of the Armington elasticity. Armington elasticities are

thus free to be set in a way that best reflects trade responses, and not as a control on the
optimal tariff.

   Another interesting result that emerges from our stylized theoretic model is that the
optimal tariff increases as the degree of home bias increases. In Table 5 we hold the size of

the country to be relatively small, at 0.1% of world income, but increase the value of λ from
zero to 0.5. The results in Table 5 show a dramatic increase in the optimal tariff as home
bias increases, even for a relatively small country and regardless of the degree of sub-national

differentiation assumed.

   To explain the results in Table 5, consider beginning at a symmetric free-trade equilibrium
where domestic and imported varieties are priced the same. Suppose that an import tariff

leaves the total number of varieties unchanged, but leads to a substitution of domestic for
                             P
foreign varieties: dNH = −     r6=H   dNr > 0. If there is home bias, this change benefits the

domestic economy more than without, since the shifts are weighted by their utility value
and both varieties (locally) cost the same. Conversely, the rest of the world is hurt more by

this change than without home bias, because their loss of home varieties is valued more than

                                                19
                                                                                              P
the increase in imported varieties. This generalizes to a case where dNH +                       r6=H   dNr < 0
in the relative sense that the welfare increase is greater, or the loss less, when there is home

bias than when there is not. This process is of course bounded: as the tariff increases, each

foreign variety is valued domestically (the domestic demand prices) by more than the cost
of buying it (the pre-tax import prices) and so at some point the loss of a foreign variety is
more welfare-costly than the gain of a domestic variety.

       The pattern of results presented in Table 5 is important to the contemporary debate

over unobserved trade costs. Hillberry et al. (2005) indicate that we might not need to

worry about whether a calibrated model accommodates missing trade through taste bias or
through unobserved trade frictions—as long as policy is independent of the unobserved trade
frictions.16 Our analysis suggests that this may hold in the case of perfect competition (the

optimal tariff varies little in the final row of Table 5), but when sub-national differentiation
is considered the degree that the model attributes missing trade to a taste bias affects the

optimal tariff.
       In turn, this is an important consideration in applied welfare analysis. For example,
the second row of Table 5 shows an optimal tariff of zero if we assume no taste bias but
an optimal tariff of 14% for a modest amount of taste bias. When alternative methods of
calibration (taste bias versus unobserved trade frictions) influence the implied optimal tariff,

welfare analysis of policy will be affected.



5        Application of the generalized model

To give the generalized model an applied context it is useful to compare it to models that
appear in the literature. To explore the performance of the generalized model we calibrate
  16
    In fact, Hillberry et al. (2005) argue that the strong correlation between observed trade and trade frictions
and the taste-bias parameters is evidence that policy is not independent of unobserved trade frictions and,
therefore, we should be worried about calibrated taste bias.



                                                       20
a version of it to the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) social accounts [Dimaranan
and McDougall (2005)] and conduct a number simulation experiments. The model is coded

in GAMS/MPSGE and is available upon request. Although somewhat muddled by the

complications of real trade patterns, the experiments tend to support our general findings
(from the relatively transparent model presented above). The incentive for small countries
that trade intensively (those with relatively less home bias in preferences) to unilaterally

impose high rates of protection are reduced when firm-level differentiation is considered.

   The overall scope of the applied model includes the world general equilibrium in multiple

commodities and regions. Geographically we include four focus countries and the remainder
of the world is aggregated into four regions:

   • Australia                                        • Rest of America

   • Canada                                           • East Asia

   • United States                                    • Europe

   • Chile                                            • Rest of World


The commodities in the model include the following nine aggregates:

   • Agriculture                                      • Metals and metal products

   • Coal oil gas and other minerals
                                                      • Other manufactures
   • Other processed food and tobacco products
                                                      • Services
   • Textiles apparel and leather products

   • Wood products                                    • Savings good



The model uses this level of aggregation to give an indication of how an applied model might

react, but also maintains a high degree of tractability. Given the methodological nature of

our exercise we simply accept the GTAP data as an accurate representation of the world

social accounts. Furthermore, we make no attempt at estimating actual trade elasticities.
We simply make the following assumptions across each commodity. We set the elasticity of

substitution between import varieties at seven (σn = 7). Consistent with many applications

                                                 21
we set the domestic-import elasticity at one half the import-variety elasticity (σdm = 3.5).
The key experimental control is to vary the firm-level elasticity between seven and infinity

(σf = 7 or σf = ∞).

   We start the analysis by examining the unilateral incentives for countries to impose tariffs
under the alternative assumptions about firm-level differentiation. To setup the experiment
we utilize an updated baseline of global free trade. Once the model is calibrated we remove

all trade distortions to generate the benchmark equilibrium. This is important for looking

at unilateral incentives to protect, because the observed rates of protection include product

mix as well as country mix distortions.
   With the free-trade benchmark established, we then identify the optimal rate of protection
for a given domestic country under a uniform tariff on all imports of all commodities from

all foreign countries. This will be a relatively efficient tax mechanism because it tends not to
distort across commodities or source countries. Given this setup one should not be surprised

to see relatively large optimal rates of protection. We warn the reader that these hypothetical
experiments are designed to illustrate our argument, and should not be interpreted as policy
prescriptions.
   Actual tariffs on specific products (and possibly on specific products from specific coun-
tries) are inefficient relative to our experiment because they have an impact on relative prices

in addition to increasing the average price. The relative price changes cause demand sub-

stitutions that are highly distortionary. In contrast, the uniform tariff that we analyze has

relatively minor impacts on relative prices across commodities or on relative prices across
different source regions. The uniform tariff is, therefore, relatively efficient (compared to the

more common targeted protection observed in the data).

   Figure 4 illustrates how Canada’s welfare changes with the tariff rate under the alternative
assumptions about firm-level differentiation. Relative to the global-free-trade benchmark a

typical Armington model indicates that Canada’s optimal uniform tariff would be 18% on all


                                               22
       Figure 4: Canadian welfare under a uniform tariff relative to global free trade




imports. In contrast, if we assume that firm varieties are also differentiated the optimal tariff
is cut in half. Unlike the theoretic model presented above, however, we do not see a (nearly)
complete elimination of the optimal tariff. We suggest that this is due to the presence of
a home bias in the calibrated model. Considering Table 5 we can see that inserting even

a modest amount of home bias in preferences escalates the optimal tariff (even when we

assume a high degree of firm differentiation). So, although muted, we find general support

for our hypothesis that firm differentiation is important when we examine Canada’s unilateral
incentives.

   We find less evidence of a zero optimal tariff for Chile. Figure 5 plots the welfare curves
for Chile. Under no firm differentiation the optimal tariff for Chile is 16%, and this falls to

11% under firm differentiation that is equal to the level of national differentiation. Again,

this points to the larger issue of home bias. If there are large networking costs, or other


                                               23
        Figure 5: Chilean welfare under a uniform tariff relative to global free trade




unobserved costs which restrict trade, and simulation models accommodate the observed
trade flows by asserting a preference for the home variety, then the simulation models are
likely to exhibit sizable optimal tariffs even for small countries, and even when we consider
firm differentiation.

   Given the results presented in Section 4 and knowledge of how simulation models ac-

commodate the trade pattern, it is not surprising that the reduction of the optimal tariff is

larger for Canada than it is for Chile. Canada is relatively trade intensive and less remote
than Chile. Lessons from the gravity literature (in international trade) suggest that more

unobserved trade costs will be associated with more remote regions. The calibrated model
will systematically impose more home bias on average to those countries that are more re-

mote. The results for Australia are similar to those for Chile, which generally support the

argument that home bias is important.

         Figure 6: U.S. welfare under a uniform tariff relative to global free trade




   It is also useful to examine the results for the U.S. The relative size of the U.S. economy
and the U.S. presence in world markets indicate that the optimal uniform tariff must be
relatively high. Figure 6 plots the welfare curves for the U.S. For the U.S. the optimal
rate of protection is relatively insensitive to our assumption about firm differentiation. This

is consistent with the analysis in Section 4 (Table 3), where we showed that traditional

large country effects dominate the firm differentiation effect at relatively modest shares of

world income. The optimal tariff for the U.S. falls from 20% under the standard Armington
formulation to 18% when we consider firm differentiation. This is roughly in the range of

the results presented in Table 3 for an economy the size of the U.S.
   To summarize our unilateral policy experiments, we find consistently smaller optimal

tariffs when firm differentiation is included. This supports our overall hypothesis that firm

differentiation is important. We also find, however, that in the applied model the reduction in


                                              25
optimal tariffs is not as dramatic as in our purely theoretic experiments. We suggest that this
is due to the tendency for simulation models to accommodate a lack of trade to home bias.

We find evidence that remoteness, which is correlated with home bias in calibrated models

[Hillberry et al. (2005)], tends to reduce the impact of adding firm-level differentiation.
      One additional point deserves mentioning in the context of our unilateral experiments.
Notice that for each focus country that imposes a positive tariff over the relevant range,

the welfare curve under no differentiation lies everywhere above the welfare curve assuming

firm-level differentiation. This indicates that there is more to lose by reducing tariffs (below

the optimal) when we ignore firm-level differentiation. Again this strongly supports our
argument that traditional methods might understate the value of liberalization, if in fact
firm varieties are important.

      In addition to looking at hypothetical unilateral experiments we utilize the calibrated
applied model to examine the removal of tariffs between the US and Australia. This allows

us to examine the model’s performance relative to applied applications that appear in the
literature. We compare our results to a number of studies that have examined the likely
impacts of the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Table 6 presents the results from four
different parameterizations of our calibrated model, and selected results from three studies
that appear in the literature.

      The first scenario, ARM 7, is intended to give a close comparison of the pilot model

to the United States International Trade Commission (2004) analysis of the US-Australia

Free Trade Agreement. Aggregate results from the USITC study are reported under the
column heading USITC 9090 in Table 6. In the scenario ARM 7 the pilot model adopts

a national-level elasticity of substitution of 7 across all sectors and an infinite sub-national

elasticity (equivalent to sub-national perfect competition). This is roughly consistent with
the Armington formulation of the USITC’s 9090 model.17 Thus, the model gives roughly

consistent results. The change in US welfare and change in US imports from Australia are
lower in the 9090 study but this might be attributed to exceptions in the actual agreement

that are considered in the USITC analysis, but not in our scenario. We simply remove all
tariffs as measured in the GTAP data.
    In the next scenario, MC 7, the model is parameterized with a national and subnational

(firm-level) elasticity of substitution of 7. Adding sub-national monopolistic competition

slightly reduces the US benefits from the FTA and slightly changes the aggregate trade

flows. The loss in US welfare might be attributed to a reduction in foreign varieties that is
and the model implemented by the United States International Trade Commission (2004). Most notably,
our model simply adopts a single national-level elasticity across sectors. A national level elasticity of 7 is
roughly consistent with the average of the commodity specific elasticities used by the USITC. Furthermore,
our model takes the GTAP data and benchmark distortions at face value, where as the USITC 9090 model
adds significant corrections and modifications. The data aggregations and scenario shocks also differ between
the pilot and USITC models. To facilitate rapid diagnostics our model is more aggregated. The scenario
examined in the pilot model is a complete liberalization of tariffs between the US and Australia. The USITC
scenario includes detailed exceptions that were a part of the actual agreement. The simplifications made to
the pilot model were made to facilitate a timely comparison and we would advise a more careful consideration
of the real world in any actual simulation. That said, we feel that the results from our model are sufficiently
close to the USITC’s results to make a legitimate and useful comparison.

not offset by increases in US or Australian varieties (in contrast Australian welfare impacts
increase in the MC 7 case relative to the ARM 7 case).

      The next two scenarios, ARM 30 and MC 30, indicate how the pilot model responds when

the national elasticity of substitution is 30 and the sub-national elasticities are respectively
infinite and 30. These scenarios illustrate the problematic nature of mitigating high optimal
tariffs through elasticity increases. These scenarios have similar relative results, but larger

welfare benefits and extremely large trade responses. Depending on whether we look at

imports or exports, the ARM 7 and MC 7 scenarios generate bilateral trade responses in
the range of 19% to 26%. In contrast, moving these elasticities up to 30 generates trade

responses in the range of 188% to 390% of base flows—an order of magnitude higher.
      In Table 6, we also include the aggregate welfare results used by the United States Inter-

national Trade Commission (2004) to compare their model with other estimates. The column
titled CIE includes the welfare calculation made by the USITC based on the Berkelmans et

al. (2001) study for the Center for International Economics, and the column titled BKS is
the welfare estimate made by Brown et al. (2004). It is notable that although our model
adopts a monopolistic competition structure it does not come close to replicating the welfare
impacts reported by Brown et al. (2004). As noted in the USITC study, the Brown et al.
(2004) welfare results are substantial at 85% of their reported base trade volumes with the

US.18 One reason that the results of Brown et al. (2004) are larger is because they assume

substantial benchmark distortions in service sectors, which vanish as a result of the FTA.

      We view our demonstration of the U.S.-Australia liberalization using our generalized
model as encouraging and useful. Our model generates results in the range of most standard

models, but accommodates monopolistic competition elements that may be important to the

measurement of potential gains from liberalization. The model offers a way of accommodat-

ing the gains associated with scale and variety effects without exaggerating trade responses.
The model is demonstrated to be tractable in a real policy context and allows the user the

flexibility to choose any level of national and sub-national differentiation.



6     Conclusion

Reconciling observed intra-industry trade with policy simulation models often involves adopt-

ing an assumption of product differentiation. Most applications assume national-level dif-
ferentiation with perfect sub-national competition, or alternatively, firm-level monopolistic

competition and no distinction between national varieties. It is well known that these dif-
ferent structures produce different implied optimal tariffs. This, along with industry scale
effects, means that the different structures generate different simulated impacts from liber-

alization. Accurate policy simulation seems to dictate a careful examination of the actual
industrial organization. Ideally, with unlimited resources and time, one might develop the

right structure for each industry and product.
    Unfortunately, policy relevance also dictates a timely response with relatively transparent

economy-wide results. Parsimony in modeling is the rule. Following the critique of Brown

(1987), we caution that assuming differentiated national products, although convenient, can
lead to significant implications for the welfare analysis of commercial policy. In particular,
we highlight the implicit allocation of market power over distinct varieties to policy makers

and away from firms. This is troubling in that, traditionally, economists assume that the
agents involved in the actual transactions (exporting firms in this case) extract the rents.

    To show the importance of the implicit allocation of market power we develop a general-
ized model that parametrically accommodates both national and firm-level differentiation.

Firm-level differentiation is accommodated via a standard model of monopolistic compe-
tition. The model is parsimonious but controls the degree of market power allocated to


                                              29
countries, versus firms, on a continuum. Our theoretic exploration of this new model is lim-
ited, but we have developed some interesting results, which are important for contemporary

research.

   Most importantly we show that the optimal tariff falls when we make parametric as-
sumptions that allocate market power to firms rather than countries. This is important be-
cause it indicates that many contemporary studies that adopt national differentiation, with

sub-national perfect competition, might understate the true benefits of liberalization. Fur-

thermore, we show that accommodating the trade pattern by calibrating the CES preference

parameters can exacerbate the problem even when sub-national differentiation is consid-
ered. Home bias in preferences implicitly favors home varieties and, again, moves us towards
relatively higher optimal tariffs. As an alternative to preference biases, the theoretic and

econometric literatures emphasize unobserved trade costs in their explanation of the trade
pattern. Policy simulation models may, again, understate the true benefits of liberalization,

because they calibrate in a way that implicitly indicates high optimal tariffs.
   In an empirical context we highlight that the optimal tariff is most sensitive to our
assumptions about firm-level differentiation for small countries and when there is relatively
little home bias in the pattern of trade. We also demonstrate the generalized demand system
in a pilot applied general equilibrium simulation of the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement.

Moving the research forward, the theoretic implications of our generalized demand system

deserve a closer examination. Through this examination we hope to highlight the important

role of the firm in optimally pricing varieties on international markets.
