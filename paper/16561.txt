In Search of the Multiplier for Federal Spending in the States During the Great Depression

                                               ABSTRACT

If there was any time to expect a large peace-time multiplier effect from federal spending in the states,
it would have been during the period from 1930 through 1940. Interest rates were near the zero bound,
and unemployment rates never fell below 10 percent and there was ample idle capacity. We develop
an annual panel data set for the 48 states from 1930 through 1940 with evidence on federal government
grants, loans, and tax collections and a variety of measures of economic activity. Using panel data
methods we estimate a multiplier, defined as the change in per capita state economic activity in response
to an additional dollar per capita of federal funds. The state per capita personal income multiplier
with respect to per capita federal grants was around 1.1. Some point estimates for multipliers for nontransfer
grants and nonfarm grants were higher but not statistically significantly different from one. There
is some evidence that AAA farm grants had negative or no effect on personal income. Federal grants
had stronger effects on consumption than on personal income, but they had no positive effect on various
measures of private employment.

            In Search of the Multiplier for Federal Spending in the States

                              During the Great Depression

       The Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 has been described as the worst downturn

since the Great Depression of the 1930s. In both periods the federal government sought

to combat the downturns with sharp increases in federal spending. The recent federal

stimulus package has led to a surge of interest in fiscal policy multipliers. The current

environment for fiscal multipliers is similar to the Great Depression in two important

ways. Short term interests are near the zero bound, and there is significant slack in the

economy with unemployment rates over 9 percent.

       The unemployment challenge was greater in the 1930s because real GDP dropped

by 30 percent between 1929 and 1933 and unemployment rates exceeded 20 percent for

four years and stayed above 14 percent for most of the decade. In contrast to the recent

situation, in the 1930s the Hoover and Roosevelt administrations financed most of the

increase in federal spending with taxes and thus ran relatively small fiscal deficits.

However, as is the case today, there was substantial variation in the distribution of federal

funds per capita across states that can be used to examine multipliers for federal spending

in each state on state incomes.

       In this paper, we construct measures of federal government spending in each state

for the period 1930 through 1940 and then estimate the impact of federal government

spending in the state on the state’s per capita incomes, employment, and other measures

of economic activity. In estimating the multipliers, we use several different measures of

federal spending: grants, grants and loans, nontransfer grants, nonfarm grants, and

Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) payments to farmers to take land out of

production.

        The multipliers are estimated using controls for time-varying weather patterns in

the states, state fixed effects, year effects, and state-specific time trends, as well as

instrumental variable techniques. Multipliers from most specifications with fixed effects

and no instruments were well below one. We use two different instrumental variable

(IV) strategies and multiple specifications and therefore report several estimates for each

multiplier. The IV estimates of the state per capita personal income multiplier with

respect to per capita federal grants were around 1.1. Some point estimates for multipliers

for nontransfer grants and nonfarm grants were higher but not statistically significantly

different from one. There is some evidence that AAA farm grants had negative or no

effect on personal income. Federal grants had stronger effects on consumption than on

personal income, but they had no positive effect on various measures of private

employment.



The Recent Literature on Multipliers

        Much of the focus of the recent literature on multipliers has been on

macroeconomic multipliers for the national economy. The traditional Keynesian

macroeconomic model predicts relatively high multipliers associated with high marginal

propensities to consume, while neoclassical models predict low multipliers through

crowding out of investment and consumption in part due to anticipation of future tax

liabilities. Neo-Keynesian models that combine neoclassical modeling with frictions in

the economy suggest multipliers somewhere in between.




Fishback and Kachanovskaya                     2
        Most of the empirical macroeconomic estimates for short run multipliers imply

that a dollar increase in government spending is associated with an increase in income

that ranges from about 50 cents to $1.30, or multipliers of 0.5 to 1.3. Some estimates

range as high as 1.8. The variation comes in part from differences in strategies for

resolving endogeneity problems that arise when policy makers use fiscal policy to try to

counteract downturns. The methods range from use of Vector Autoregressive (VAR)

models to identification of changes in military spending and tax policy that might be

plausibly considered to be unrelated to the macroeconomy. Recent efforts examine the

impact of unexpected changes in these plausibly exogenous factors. The results also may

vary due to the period studied, as the multiplier is predicted to be larger in times of high

unemployment and in periods when interest rates are fixed or near the zero bound.2

        It is difficult to estimate a national multiplier during the 1930s because it is hard

to argue that federal spending was not rising in response to the downturn, and finding an

instrument for federal spending in a national regression is difficult. Any estimate is

likely to be for a balanced-budget multiplier because the deficits were very small relative

to the size of the problem. Scholars have repeatedly shown that the New Deal was not a




2 See Valerie Ramey’s (2011) survey of multipliers for an upcoming issue of the Journal of Economic
Literature. The third edition of Dornbusch and Fischer’s Macroeconomics in 1984 (p. 148) reports
multiplier estimates for an increase in net government spending of 1.8 from DRI and 0.7 from the Federal
Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Key papers on the macroeconomic multiplier include Aiyagari, Christiano, and
Eichenbaum (1992), Barro (1981); Barro and Redlick (forthcoming 2011), Blanchard and Perotti (2002)
Blinder and Zandi (2010), Cogan, Cwik, Taylor, and Wieland (2009), Devereux, Head, and Lapham
(1996), Hall (1980), Pereira and Flores de Frutos (1999) Ramey (forthcoming 2011), Ramey and Shapiro
(1998), Romer 1992, Zandi (2009). Average tax multipliers tend to be somewhat higher (Romer and
Romer 2010). In estimates of the impact of fiscal and monetary policy for the 1920s and 1930s from a
panel of countries, Almunia, Benetrix, Eichengreen, O’Rourke, and Rua.find a multiplier for military
spending above 2. Ethan Ilzetski, Enrique Mendoza, and Carlos Vegh (2010) find smaller multipliers for
government consumption using panel SVAR methods on a modern panel of countries, although the
multipliers vary across conditions.

Keynesian attempt to deal with the Depression.3 On the other hand, there was

tremendous variation in the amount of per capita federal grants and loans distributed

across the states during the New Deal and federal funds to each state fluctuated over the

course of the decade. This variation can be used to identify the impact of distributing

additional federal funds within a typical state on the income in the state.

         The state-level multiplier is not the same as the federal multiplier. Nakamura and

Steinsson (2011) suggest that state multipliers for federal spending are useful as estimates

of the multiplier in a small open economy in a currency union with free movement across

borders. However, there is likely to be cross-subsidization in the state multiplier for

federal spending that is not present at the national level. A national multiplier for federal

spending addresses a situation where all of the taxation and obligations to repay future

debt are centered within the economy where the money is spent (Barro 1982). In

contrast, a state can receive federal funds but might bear less than (or more than) its full

share of the tax and debt obligation associated with funds. They develop a model that

shows that the relationship between state multipliers and the overall national multiplier

can vary a great deal depending on a variety of assumptions, ranging from the extent of

national unemployment to the variability of interest rates. In a political economy model,

the state multiplier serves another purpose by determining the benefit that the state’s

residents anticipate receiving when seeking federal government funds.

           Our estimates for the Depression therefore are most comparable to estimates

from a series of recent working papers on the impact of federal spending on state and



3 Keynes chastised Roosevelt in letters to the editor for not running deficits to finance the rise in federal
spending. E. Cary Brown (1956) and Larry Peppers (1973) both performed analysis to show that the
deficits run were very small relative to the size that Keynesians would have recommended.

local economies between 1980 and the present.4 Juan Carlos Suarez Serrato and Phillipe

Wingender develop local fiscal multiplier estimates for the modern era in the U.S. using

changes in the distribution of federal spending across districts driven by updated local

population estimates from the decennial Census. Using first-difference estimation on

panels at the county, state, and MSA level after 1983, they report an income multiplier

estimate of 1.88 and an estimated cost per job created of $30,000 per year.

           Daniel Wilson (2011) estimates jobs multipliers for the federal distribution of

funds under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. He relied

on the exogenous formulas for allocation of spending as the source of identification and

finds that the ARRA saved roughly one job per $100,000 spent and had its strongest

impact on construction employment. Emi Nakamura and Jon Steinsson (2010) estimate

state level multipliers based on variations in military procurement spending during

periods of military buildups between 1966 and 2006. To control for endogeneity, they

construct an instrument based on regressing each state’s military procurement spending

on total U.S. military spending; therefore, the instrument for a state in year t is the

coefficient from that state’s regression times U.S. military spending in year t. Their

results suggest a multiplier of 1.5, which is not sensitive to how strongly monetary policy

leans against the wind.




         4Another set of studies seek to estimate the impact of state government spending within the same
state. Daniel Shoag (2010) estimates multipliers within states for state government spending using
“windfalls” in returns on state pension assets as an instrument for state government spending. The
estimates suggest an income multiplier of $2.12 and the generation of an additional job per $35,000 spent.
Jeffrey Clemens and Stephen Miran (2011) examine the impact of state spending on state income using
budget rules for state deficit finance and differences between forecasted state budgets and actual state
budgets for identification. However, these sources of variation in state fiscal policy did not serve as strong
instruments.



Fishback and Kachanovskaya                            5
           Cohen, Coval, and Malloy (2010) use changes in federal spending related to

changes in key Congressional committee assignments to show that increases in federal

spending are associated with reductions in private investment and employment in the

states. In a study of low income countries Aart Kraay (2010) finds a multiplier of less

than one for World bank lending using fluctuations in approval of projects as a source of

variation in later spending that is uncorrelated with current output.

           Regional scientists also have developed a broad range of theoretical models that

lead to multipliers for net income coming into a state.5 The models range from the early

Keynesian regional models to input-output models to economic base models to neo-

classical models.6 The earlier empirical work on regional multipliers led to a broad

range of estimates of multipliers of between 0.5 and 2 depending on the technique used.

Some relied on simulations that derive multipliers using input-output models and surveys

5 There is a large literature on the impact of public infrastructure spending at the state level. Hulten and
Schwab (1991) conclude that the link between public infrastructure and states’ economic growth is weak,
as the states that expanded public infrastructure the most in the 1970s were not the ones that developed
faster during that period. Munnell (1992 192) finds a significant effect of public capital on state-level
output, investment and employment growth, although the effects of government spending at the state level
are smaller than at the national level. Garcia-Mila and McGuire (1992) constructed a panel of 48 states
from 1969 until 1983 to estimate input elasticity coefficients of regional Cobb-Douglas production
functions and concluded that government provided goods, such as highways and education, have a
significant and positive effect on state’s output. Costa, Ellison, and Martin (1987) consider a translog
production function and conclude that public capital and labor are complementary inputs. The estimated
elasticities of output with respect to public are around one in all states. Meanwhile, Blanchard and Katz
(1992) model the effects of negative one-percent employment shocks to a wide range of variables using
data from U.S. states from 1947 to 1990 and find sizeable effects on per capita income over an extended
number of years.
          Duffy-Deno and Eberts (1991) study the effect of the public capital stock on the state’s economic
growth, first, without using capital expenditures as a proxy for capital stock, and second, considering public
capital both exogenous to the firm and endogenous to the local community positing a simultaneous
relationship of public capital and local economic growth. The authors find a positive and statistically
significant effect of public capital on state’s economic growth rate.
          Assessing a link between public capital and economic growth, Fernald (1999) studies the direction
of causation between public capital and productivity and unsurprisingly concludes that road construction
(which is one of the biggest components of public spending) causes a surge in productivity in industries
with high motor-vehicle use. David Aschauer (1989) also finds that road construction bears the most
explanatory power of the change of local productivity, while military spending has almost none.
          6 Richardson (1985) surveys all but the neoclassical models. Merrifeld (1987 and 1990) and
McGregor, McVittie, Swales, and Yin (2000) for examples of neoclassical multipliers for the economic
base.

that describe the degree to which different industries rely on local labor and external

inputs and capital. Others rely on Ordinary Least Squares regression estimates (Mulligan

(2005, 1987).

           The coefficient on federal spending in a regional model will be determined by a

series of factors.7 It will have positive effects to the extent that it puts to work

unemployed resources; it is more productive than the private spending that is replaced by

the anticipation of future obligations for taxpayers; it produces social overhead capital

(like roads, sanitation, public health programs) that make the inputs in the state economy

more productive; and/or it leads to multiplier effects. The Keynesian multiplier model

arises as each income recipient purchases goods and services from others in the state

who, in turn, spend their receipts on goods and services produced by others in the state.

The regional neoclassical multiplier arises as labor demand is pushed out along an

upward sloping labor supply curve.

           The positive benefits of the multiplier are diminished through a variety of

“leakages” when the money spent in the process is spent on goods and services outside

the state economy. Much of the federal grant spending on work relief programs, like the

FERA, WPA, or CWA, had small initial leakages because over 80 percent was spent on

wages for people in the state. Grants from the Public Works Administration and Public

Roads Administration had larger initial leakages because more than 50 percent of the

monies were spent on materials and equipment imported from other states. More




         7The intuitive discussion of the multiplier is based on a Keynesian discussion of consumption and
imports. See Cullen and Fishback (2007) and Fishback, Horrace, and Kantor (2005b) for how this works in
a simple model. Nakamura and Steinsson (2011) have a neo-Keynesian model that leads to the same
implications.


Fishback and Kachanovskaya                          7
leakages occurred to the extent that workers on federal projects spent their wages on

goods and services produced outside the state.

         Federal spending will have smaller positive effects on the economy to the extent

that it leads people to save in anticipation that they will have to pay future taxes. The

federal spending will have an even weaker effect to the extent that it replaces local

production of goods and services. An influx of federal spending might bid up local

wages in ways that raised the costs of hiring labor to private producers. It may have also

bid up the prices for non-labor inputs with the same effect. The most obvious crowding

out came from the AAA payments to farmers to take land out of production. The stated

purpose of the act was to reduce output in hopes of raising prices enough to see an

increase in income. In other cases, the federal spending may have replaced state and

local projects that would have been built in the absence of federal spending. The impact

of the reduction in state and local spending was likely to be small because states were

generally required to run balanced budgets. Even when they ran deficits in the early

1930s, the deficits were relatively small as a share of state and local spending.



The Impact of Federal Spending in the 1930s.

       There have been some estimates of the impact of New Deal spending on general

economic activity. At the macroeconomic level, Christina Romer (1992) calculated a

fiscal multiplier of only 0.23 in a difference-in-difference estimate that examined the

change in federal funds distributed after the Veterans’ Bonus was passed out in 1936. In

simulations from a dynamic structural general equilibrium model Gauti Eggertsson

(2008) finds that the combination of increased federal spending, the move off of the gold

standard, the zero interest bound, and government efforts to raise wages and prices

through the National Recovery Administration led to a strong turnaround in the economy.

        In microeconomic studies using variation across time and place, Fishback,

Horrace, and Kantor (2005, 2006) showed a strong positive influence of public works and

relief spending on county-level retail sales and net-migration. In studies of panel data for

cities between 1929 and 1940 Fishback, Haines and Kantor (2007) and Johnson, Fishback

and Kantor (2010) show that relief spending contributed to reductions in mortality and

crime rates and increases in birth rates. On the other hand, Agricultural Adjustment

Administration (AAA) grants had a slightly negative effect on retail sales growth and net

migration. Garrett and Wheelock (2006) found similar positive effects of overall New

Deal spending in a cross-sectional analysis of the growth rate in state personal income per

capita for the entire period 1933 to 1939 and New Deal spending during that period.

However, neither paper shows the effects of a multiplier on income in the same year.

        Studies of labor markets using panel data from 1930s have focused on the impact

of relief spending on labor markets. Neuman, Fishback, and Kantor (2010) examine

monthly data from 1933 through 1940 for over 40 cities and find that relief spending

raised private employment through 1935 but reduced it afterward. Benjamin and

Mathews (1992) find small crowding out effects of private employment from relief jobs

through 1935 and much larger crowding out effects in the second half of the New Deal.8

        In response to the hard times between the fiscal years 1929 and 1933, the Hoover

administration and Congress increased nominal government spending by 52 percent, 88

percent after adjusting for the tremendous deflation.9 After a decade of no change in

annual real federal spending, Hoover sought to increase spending through existing

programs. As an example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (1932, 49-50) described

the increase in highway spending in 1932 as a relief and stimulus measure: “Emergency

employment was directly provided for varying periods for nearly 200,000 men and

indirectly for a much larger number in industries that supply necessary materials and

services.”10 By fiscal years 1932 and 1933 the federal government was running a deficit

of -4.7 percent of a much reduced GDP as growth in tax revenues failed to keep pace

with the rise in government spending.

        After Franklin Roosevelt and the new Democratic Congress took office in March

1933, government spending roughly doubled over the next 6 years. The rise in spending

did not lead to large budget deficits because tax revenues rose at roughly the same rate.

E. Cary Brown (1956) and Claude Peppers (1973) have documented that the federal

deficits as a share of GDP were small and fell well short of being Keynesian policies

designed to stimulate the economy.11 On the other hand, the distribution of the federal

spending varied enormously across states on a per capita basis. Figure 1 shows the large

          9See series Ea584, Ea585, and Ea586 in Wallis (2006, 5-80 and 5-81). The federal fiscal year ran
from July 1 in year t-1 to June 30 in year t. Nearly all of the decisions made about fiscal year 1933 were
made by the Hoover administration and Congress. Roosevelt did not take office until early March 1933
and very little of the New Deal spending occurred before July 1, 1933.
          10 In 1935 the U.S. Bureau of Agricultural Economics traced the path of $100 million of highway
spending through the economy until it was paid out as wage or salary income and calculated highway
spending multipliers of 2.7 for employment and 3 for economic activity.
          11 After July 1931, it appears that monetary policy was relatively uniform across the 12 regional
federal reserve banks. Richardson Van Troost (2009) document differences in attitudes toward providing
reserves to banks in the St. Louis and Atlanta districts in 1930 and the first half of 1931, but St. Louis
began following similar policies to Atlanta’s in July of that year. Meltzer (2003) notes that there were
differences of opinion about how to proceed with open market operations but that nearly all open market
sales and purchases were made by the New York Federal Reserve Bank.

variation in the annual changes in per capita federal grants plotted against per capita

personal income across states for the years 1930 through 1940, all measure in 1967. The

changes over time within states after controlling for national shocks in each year is the

source of variation used to identify the multipliers.



The Composition of Federal Spending

        Understanding of the impact of federal spending and taxation during the New

Deal era is complicated by the great diversity of programs. The New Deal funding

programs were divided into two major classifications: nonrepayable grants and repayable

loans.12 The Office of Government Reports (OGR) (1940) reported the total amount

spent by each program in each state in each year from July 1, 1932 through June 30,

1939. The OGR mimeos do not document where they obtained the spending figures. To

double check the OGR data and extend the series for programs back to 1930 and forward

to 1940, we went through a large number of reports from various agencies and the

Treasury department to double check the numbers. The data appendix describes the

sources we used and some of the inconsistencies we found. In addition, we added

information that the OGR did not report on the construction and maintenance spending

on Hoover (Boulder) Dam and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the loans and

cash grants on the World War I adjusted service certificates that were associated with the

Veterans’ Bonus. The totals and the amounts per capita for the period 1933 through 1939

are reported in Table I to get a sense of the size of each program.



          12The Office of Government Reports offered information on the value of housing loans insured
by the Federal Housing Administration. Since these loans were private loans, we do not incorporate these
into the analysis of net federal spending.


Fishback and Kachanovskaya                         11
       The main focus in the analysis is on nonrepayable grants from the federal

government. About 62 percent of the grants were associated with relief programs. All of

the Works Progress Administration (WPA), Civilian Conservation Corps (CCCG), and

Civil Works Administration (CWA) grants and roughly half of the Federal Emergency

Relief Administration (FERA) were spent on poverty relief projects with work

requirements and could be considered federal expenditures because they produced a good

or service. The Social Security Act Programs (SSA), and the rest of the FERA grants

were New Deal programs that offered transfer payments to alleviate poverty. The

Veterans’ Administration (VA) and Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Homes (SOLD) were grant

programs in place before the New Deal that provided pensions, disability payments, and

living support to military veterans. Grants from the SSA programs provided matching

grants to states that provided aid to dependent children (ADC), old-age assistance (OAA),

and aid-to-the-blind (AB). If we performed the analysis for the U.S. as a whole, the

transfer payments from the SSA, part of the FERA, the VA, and the SOLD, which

account for roughly 20 percent of the grants, would not necessarily be treated as

expenditures because they are net transfers within the system. However, at the state level

these transfer grants become income that influenced purchasing power within each state,

and therefore the Bureau of Economic Analysis included them in their personal income

estimates; therefore, we incorporate them into the analysis.

       The second major grant category is public works programs, which accounted for

19.4 percent of the grants. The Public Works Administration Federal (PWAF) and

Nonfederal (PWANF) programs, Public Roads Administration, Public Buildings

Administration (PBA), Rivers and Harbors Grant (RH) and other smaller programs listed




Fishback and Kachanovskaya                  12
as public works in the table were not poverty programs. All but the PWA programs were

long run federal programs established before the New Deal. Unlike the work relief

poverty programs, the public works programs could hire from the labor market and faced

fewer restrictions on hours worked. They also paid average hourly wages that were

roughly double those on the work relief programs.

        Approximately 12 percent of the grants were devoted to agriculture from

programs run by the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA), Soil and

Conservation Service (SCS), Farm Security Administration (FSA), and Agriculturual

Experiment Stations (AES). The AAA was the major New Deal program which was

devoted to payments to farmers to take land out of production. The initial AAA program

was funded with an agricultural processing tax until it was declared unconstitutional in

January 1936.13 The AAA also administered the replacement program adopted under

the Soil and Domestic Conservation Act of 1936, which continued to make payments to

farmers to take land out of production without the processing tax. The FSA started

within the FERA relief program and was more of a poverty relief program. The SCS

began before the AAA was declared unconstitutional and provided grants for training

farmers about soil conservation techniques.

        It is not always clear how to treat the federal loans in terms of developing a

multiplier. They are not government spending because at the time the loans were made

they all required repayment. However, loan distributions are often listed in the budget

deficit figures. As one example, the OGR treated the loans for construction of irrigation

projects through the Bureau of Reclamation as grants. The loans were interest-free and


         13AAA grants per capita were not very strongly correlated with processing tax receipts in cross-
sectional correlations. The correlation for 1934 was only 0.034 and for 1935 was 0.1677.


Fishback and Kachanovskaya                          13
the repayments were often delayed for a long time period, and in a number of cases the

loans were forgiven. Following the OGR practice, we treated the Bureau of Reclamation

funds as grants in this analysis.

         Nearly all of the rest of the loans were repaid, and thus were treated separately as

a loan category.14 There was a grant feature to the loans to the extent that they provided

subsidies in the form of lower interest rates and better lending terms. The Home Owners’

Loan Corporation (HOLC), for example, bought over 1 million mortgages that were on

the verge of foreclosure at close to the full book values of the loans and then refinanced

them for the original borrower at interest rates that were below market interest rates on

good loans. The HOLC also extended the standard repayment period, and allowed much

smaller down payments relative to the value of the home. The Farm Credit

Administration (FCA) loans provided good terms for farm mortgages and short-term

loans for crops, seed, and tools.15 The subsidies in Reconstruction Finance Corporation

(RFC) loans likely varied by type of loan. Given the measurement issues with loans, we

include multiplier estimates where we add 10 percent of the value of the loans as a

measure of the interest subsidy to the grants. We also run estimates where we add the

full value of the loans to the grants.

         World War I service-adjusted certificates, associated with the Veterans’ Bonus of

1936, are divided into two categories, loans and death benefit grants before January 1936

           14 There were some cases of loan forgiveness. In the case we know about, the RFC loans offered
to cities for poverty relief under the Hoover administration in fiscal year 1933 were eventually forgiven by
the Roosevelt administration. The HOLC likely experienced the highest loan default rate because it
foreclosed on 20 percent of the mortgages that it supported. Our sense from reading the reports of the
various agencies, is that they anticipated repayment and were active in seeking repayment or recovery of
assets to be sold when there was a default.
           15The Commodity Credit Corporation loan program provided nonrecourse loans that established a
price floor for the commodities produced. The CCC loan information has been eliminated from the
analysis because the loans were not reported across states in fiscal 1934 and major portions of the loans
were not reported across states in other years.


Fishback and Kachanovskaya                          14
and grants after that date. Since Cone and the BEA incorporated both the loans and

grants in their measure of personal income, these deserve direct attention. In 1924

Congress enacted an adjusted-service certificate program for men and women who served

in World War I. The program offered certificates that could be redeemed at face value

twenty years after receipt. The amount to be paid was $1 for each day served in World

War I inside the U.S. and $1.25 for each day overseas, and then the amount was

multiplied by 1.25 to take into account the delay in payment. Certificates valued at less

than $50 were paid in cash immediately and the cash value of the certificate was paid out

to heirs at the time of the veterans’ death. These payments are treated as grants

throughout.

       Living veterans could also borrow from the Veterans’ Bureau against the

certificates by accepting a lien on the value of the certificate. They could pay back the

loan and receive the full certificate value in 1945 or not repay and accept the amount left

after interest was deducted in 1945. After Congress lowered the maximum interest on the

loans to 4.5 percent (and soon after to 3.5) and increased the amount that could be

borrowed to half of the value of the adjusted service certificate on February 27, 1931,

World War I veterans took out 2 million loans valued at $795 million within the next few

months. In January 1936 the Veterans’ Bonus Bill allowed veterans to convert the

adjusted-service certificates to cash at the full face value. If veterans held them for more

than one year they could receive the face value plus 3 percent interest per year until

maturity on June 15, 1945. The VA received 3.3 million applications with a face value of

$3.2 billion for settlement by June 30, 1936. After deducting outstanding liens from

loans, the VA paid out $1.7 billion in cash. Since the payment of liens released veterans




Fishback and Kachanovskaya                   15
from making future payments on loans, we treat the entire $3.2 billion as grants

(Administrator of Veterans’ Affairs 1931, pp. 10, 42-44; 1936, pp. 1, 22-24). In the

analysis that combines loans and grants, however, the $3.2 million in grants was offset by

the repayment of $1.5 billion in loans, so the combined value of grants and loans for the

adjusted service certificates in 1936 is $1.7 billion.



Federal Tax Policy in the 1930s

          Federal taxation in the 1930s was relatively simple in that all tax rates were the

same across all states for each activity in each year. However, the tax structure during

the 1930s was quite different from the post-War economy, in which the vast majority of

internal tax revenues come from taxes on income in the form of corporate, personal, and

employment (social security and unemployment insurance) taxes. Between 1930 and

1940 the sources of federal revenue shifted dramatically away from income taxes toward

excise taxes. Less than 10 percent of households earned enough to pay personal income

taxes throughout the 1930s.16 In 1930 personal income taxes accounted for 38% of total

internal revenue and corporate income taxes composed 42%. The Tax Revenue Act of

1932 led to several major changes. Even though income tax rates were increased, the

share of revenue from personal income taxes fell markedly to 16% in 1934 and 18% in

1940, while the share from corporate income taxes fell to 15% in 1934 before rising to

21% in 1940. The big revenue sources that arose from the 1932 tax changes was an

expansion in excise taxes to cover manufactures of autos, tires, gasoline, lubricants and

taxes on pipelines, telephones, telegraphs, and electricity. The share of internal revenue


         16 Households did not begin paying income taxes before income hit $2,000 for individuals and
$5,000 for a family of four at a time when most workers were earning $1,000 or less.


Fishback and Kachanovskaya                        16
from excise taxes rose from 19% in 1930 to 28% in 1933. In 1933 the Roosevelt

administration added in processing taxes on agricultural goods, a capital stock tax and

eliminated Prohibition. The excise tax share jumped to 48% in 1934. Over the rest of the

decade the excise tax share fell back to 35%, although the share of revenue from alcohol

taxes remained steady around 12%.17

          Aside from tax rate changes, the driving force behind changes in tax revenue

within a state over time were changes in economic activity. Between 1930 and 1940 the

correlations across time between real per capita personal income and real per capita taxes

within the same state ranged from 0.95 in Georgia to 0.3624 in South Carolina. It was

above 0.8 for 22 states, between 0.7 and 0.8 in 18 states, between 0.6 and 0.7 in 5 states,

0.4913 in Nebraska, 0.4423 in Kansas, and 0.3624 in South Carolina. The taxation is so

strongly tied to income levels that it is difficult to find instruments for taxation that are

not also strong correlates of income.

          We deal with federal taxation empirically in two ways. Since national tax rates

were the same across all states, the simplest way is to incorporate year fixed effects that

control for tax rate changes in a model of state per capita income as a function of national

government spending per capita in the state. Essentially, the model shows the multiplier

of federal spending for state personal income after controlling for the fiscal drag created

by the tax rate system. We also estimate the model with a dependent variable of per

capita state income as a function of real per capita national government spending minus

real per capita national taxes. This is the multiplier for income from federal government

spending net of taxes.

Measures of Economic Activity

        The impact of federal spending is estimated for several measures of economic

activity. The broadest measure is state personal income per capita, which has been

estimated and reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis since the 1930s. Frederick

Cone (1940, 3, 10, 13, 39), who helped develop the early estimates, described personal

income as a measure of the “ability of consumers to purchase the new goods and services

currently produced by business enterprises.” With that in mind personal income was

defined as national income after subtracting business savings, social security

contributions from employer and employee, contributions to the Railroad Retirement

Fund, and contributions to retirement systems for government employees on the grounds

that these were not available for spending. To capture purchasing power, the BEA added

back many transfer payments, including direct and work relief, federal pensions to

veterans, adjusted service benefits (both loans in the early 1930s and the Veterans’

Bonus), other government retirement allowances, unemployment compensation, railroad

insurance benefits, old-age insurance benefits, and agriculture benefit payments.18

Direct relief accounted for about 1.4 percent, retirement payments for veterans and

federal workers accounted for about 1 percent, and the World War I adjusted service

certificates payouts reached peaks of 1.4 percent of income (in the form of loans) in 1931




         18Cone (1940, p. 8) made the following argument for inclusion of the World War I veterans’
loans and then 1936 cash payout on adjusted service certificates as personal income: “because these
disbursements of the Federal Government were in the nature of original receipts to the veterans and
because, owing to the large volume of the disbursements and their wide distribution among 3,000,000
veterans, they represented an important stimulus to consumption on two distinct occasions, they have been
incorporated.”


Fishback and Kachanovskaya                         18
and 2.1 percent (in the form of cash) in 1936 with negligible amounts in between (Cone,

1940, 10, 24-5).19

        We also estimate the model with measures of wage and salary income net of

payroll taxes and several other measures of economic activity. The wage and salary

income, which is net of pay-roll deductions for social insurance, accounted for about 62.5

percent of personal income in the 1930s (Martin and Creamer, 1942, p. 23).

Measurement error is also an issue with the wage and salary income personal income data

because the information on some components had to be interpolated between census

years and from scattered components. The most accurately measured information is the

wage component of wage and salary income because it relies heavily on the monthly

establishment surveys collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics during this period. The

BLS suggested that about 48 percent of employment was covered by the survey in 1938

(Cone, 1940, 31).

        To further reduce problems with measurement error and also examine in more

depth where the stimulus occurred, we examine several other series: census reports on

manufacturing payroll per capita in the odd years from 1929 through 1939, and the retail

census estimates of per capita retail sales for the years 1929, 1933, 1935, and 1939.

These two measures are particularly valuable because they are based on nationwide

censuses of all establishments. There are several additional measures of income and

spending that are not available in dollar terms, including per capita measures of John

         19 We have been trying to develop a measure of income that does not include transfers and thus is
a more production based measure. The new measure starts with the BEA measure of personal income. We
have been collecting evidence by state that will allow us to subtract transfers without a work relief
component and add back payroll taxes for social insurance and contributions to government pension plans.
Work relief is treated as production income because it was related to production. Since we are not privy to
the exact sources used to construct personal income, there is a risk of adding measurement when we make
the adjustments.



Fishback and Kachanovskaya                          19
Wallis’s (1989) broad-based employment index built up from BLS employer surveys for

1929 through 1939,20 newly computerized payroll indices for 1932 to 1939 for the same

group of industries, and per capita auto registrations, to capture the effect of government

spending on a major consumer durable. The employment and payroll indices rely very

little on interpolation but there may be sampling error in each state because the series are

based on month-to-month comparisons of the same employers from surveys that rotate

employers out of the sample (Wallis, 1989; Neumann, Fishback, and Kantor 2010).

Wallis (1989) used benchmarks to resolve some of these problems for the broad-based

employer index, but the payroll indices have not been benchmarked. The automobile

registrations also are measured well, as the states collected license revenue from the

automobiles.



Estimation Procedure

         Despite the variety of different models that generate income multipliers of

government spending, the empirical estimations of multipliers tend to be similar and use

reduced form models with a sparse set of correlates. Both Barro and Redlick (2010) and

Romer and Romer (2006) express worries about omitted variable bias that might arise

from the absence of exogenous factors in the model. To estimate the multiplier, we use

panel data methods with a measure of real per capita state income (yit) in state i and year t

in 1967 dollars as the dependent variable as a function of a measure of real per capita

federal spending in state i and year t (git),



         20 The broad-based index includes manufacturing wages only; mining wages only; street
railways; telephone and telegraph; electric light, power, and gas; insurance; brokerage; wholesale and retail
trade; year-round hotels; and laundry and dry-cleaning establishments.


Fishback and Kachanovskaya                           20
           yit = β0 + β1 git + β2 W + S +Y + S* t + εit.



To control for omitted variables that might have influenced government policy and state

income, we include several vectors. A vector of extreme weather (W) variables—days

with temperatures over 90, days with temperatures below 0, months of extreme or severe

drought, and months of extreme or severe wetness, and precipitation--controls for the

influence of these factors on crop production and prices in the farm sector, construction

activity, and other activities where weather was a factor. A vector of state fixed effects

(S) controls for factors like geography, state constitutions, and the basic economic,

cultural, and demographic structure of each state that did not change over time but varied

across states.     A vector of year fixed effects (Y) controls for national changes in the

economy that affected all states in each year, including monetary policy changes, changes

in federal tax rates, the introduction and elimination of the National Recovery

Administration and other changes in national regulation. A vector of state specific time

trends (S*t) control for differences in the trend paths of economic activity in each state,

including the shift away from state budget deficits in the early 1930s to budget surpluses

in the late 1930s. Under the complete model specification the identification of the

multiplier β1 for net New Deal spending comes from the deviation from trend across time

within states after controlling for nation-wide shocks.21

         The model can also be estimated in year-to-year first differences to control for

time-invariant state effects. In the difference model state time trends are controlled with

the addition of state fixed effects.            Both methods lead to unbiased and consistent

          21 We have also tried estimating the model while including squared terms. The estimates at the
mean of the sample are very similar and there is very little gain from adding the squared terms. In addition,
the instruments did not have adequate strength to separate the coefficients for the squared terms.


Fishback and Kachanovskaya                           21
estimates of the multiplier in large samples, but the standard errors are more efficiently

estimated by the difference estimation if there is serial correlation (Wooldridge 2006,

491-2). Since the sample is relatively small with 48 states for 11 years each, we report

both sets of estimates. Following Barro and Redlick (2011), Kraay (2010) and Nakamura

and Steinsson (2010), we have also estimated the model as the growth rate in income

from the previous year as a function of the change in government spending divided by

lagged income. The use of the growth rate matches more common macroeconomic

specifications, while the normalization of government spending by dividing by lagged

income allows the coefficient to be interpreted as a dollar-for-dollar multiplier.

       There are a variety of other factors that may have changed over time in non-trend

ways that may have influenced both net fiscal federal spending and per capita income in

the state. There are two problems that arise in trying to control for these other factors.

First, many that might be included as controls in a productivity model, such as wages,

employment, and interest rates, are themselves components of personal income.            By

controlling for them we would be restricting the measure of the impact of net federal

expenditures to the parts of state income for which we have not controlled. Second,

controls for age, race, ethnicity, population, and the structure of the economy are all

available typically only during the census years and thus measures would have to be

interpolated between census years to provide values.           Essentially, the interpolated

measures of the census-year structural variables between 1930 and 1940 would be linear

combinations of the state-specific time trends and/or the state effects.

       Third, state and local government spending and taxation are currently controlled

for with the combination of the state fixed effects and state-specific time trends.    Thus




Fishback and Kachanovskaya                   22
deviations in trend state fiscal activity is not being controlled. The multiplier estimate

therefore may incorporate influences on income that arise from correlations between

deviations from trend in state and local fiscal activity and federal spending. Since federal

spending drove some state decisions, this might not be a disadvantage. As it stands

today, comparable annual estimates of revenues and governmental cost payments in the

states are available only up through 1931 and after 1936 for all states; therefore, any

estimate incorporating controls for net state spending would miss a very large portion of

the New Deal period. Information is available on cities over 100,000 people throughout

the 1930s, but data for the rest of the governments is available only for 1932.22

         There still remains the possibility of biases from simultaneity and endogeneity.

An ample literature on the geographic distribution of New Deal spending shows that the

Roosevelt Administration tended to distribute more New Deal grants to areas where

income was declining (see Wallis 1998, Fleck 2008, Fishback, Kantor, and Wallis, 2003;

Neumann, Fishback, and Kantor 2010). This tendency imparts a negative bias to the

multiplier coefficient. To eliminate the biases arising from the issues described above,

we follow an instrumental variable strategy. To be effective, the instrument must vary

annually both across time and across space and be strongly correlated with the measures

of federal government funds but not with the error term in the final-stage equation.




          22The federal government stopped collecting the annual information from states for the volume
Financial Statistics of the States in 1933 after having collected information from 41 states for 1932. They
restarted by collecting the data for 1937 (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1940, p. vi). John Wallis, Richard
Sylla, and John Legler have posted information for 16 states for the period 1933 through 1937 with the
ICPSR, but it is taking longer than we anticipated to make the data for these states comparable with the
federal government’s categories. Working with John Wallis we have been collecting, computerizing, and
categorizing the information for the remaining states for 1933 through 1937 and for the seven states in 1932
that the Census Bureau had not worked with. We still have about two year’s worth of work to do on the
project.


Fishback and Kachanovskaya                          23
       We develop two instrument strategies each based on a similar logic about the

distribution of federal spending across states. Each year the federal government decides

to distribute a total number of grants while paying attention to the state of the economy

but not the economy within each state. In any one year each state’s share of the grants is

determined by a variety of factors, including economic problems within the state but also

long run differences across states unrelated to the economy. Our goal is to use these

factors unrelated to state-specific economic problems as instrumental variables.

       Some scholars in the modern studies have tried to use federal rules for

distribution, but this will not work in the 1930s because the federal government routinely

ignored the original rules written into the acts setting up the emergency programs.

Nakamura and Steinsson (2010) follow a strategy of estimating a separate share

coefficient for each state. This is equivalent to estimating a first stage in our panel with

47 state dummies interacted with federal spending. When we tried this, the Stock-Yogo

tests for instrument strength suggested that we had weak instrument bias. We therefore,

experimented with interactions of regional dummies with federal grant spending per

capita based on 9 census regions and 4 census regions. The instrument tests suggested

that weak instrument bias was less of a problem with the 4 census region interactions, and

Hausman tests for over-identification in this case do not reject the hypothesis that the

instruments do not belong in the final stage regression.

       The second instrument strategy relies more heavily on the finding in the New

Deal distribution literature that swing voting was the key factor influencing the cross-

state distributions of funds (Wright 1974; Fishback, Kantor, and Wallis 2003; Fleck

2001, 2008, Wallis 1998, 2001). It also tries to eliminate potential correlations between




Fishback and Kachanovskaya                   24
the state-specific portion of the total error for total federal spending and error term for the

state in the final stage regression. The instrument is the interaction of two variables: a

measure of swing voting in presidential elections up to the year t-1 and aggregate per

capita federal grant spending in year t in an area well outside the region where the state is

located. The swing voting measure is the standard deviation of the percentage voting

Democrat for president in the state between 1896 and the most recent presidential

election prior to year t. The variable varies across time because each state’s value

changes between 1932 and 1933 and again between 1936 and 1937. By using the

measure calculated up through the most recent presidential election before that year, we

eliminate contemporaneous correlation with factors that influenced income in the state.23

Given the controls for state fixed effects and state time trends, it seems unlikely that

swing voting in the presidential elections between 1896 and year t-1 would have been

correlated with the error for income in the state in year t except through the New Deal

distribution mechanism.

        The second variable in the interaction term is federal grant spending in the area

outside an geographic “moat” around the state of interest. The moat includes the state’s

census region (of 9) and nearby census regions to avoid spatial correlation with the error

term from potential spillovers. For New England, for example, the moat includes any

states in New England, the Mid-Atlantic, the East North Central, or the states of Virginia,

Maryland, Kentucky, or West Virginia; therefore, the component of federal spending for

the instrument for that state is based on federal spending outside that moat.24 25



         23 As an example, the instrument for the year 1932 would include the standard deviation of the
percent voting for the Democratic presidential candidate from 1896 through 1928.
           24For more detail on the moats for each region, see the data appendix.


Fishback and Kachanovskaya                         25
        Since AAA grant spending differed markedly from other grant spending in its

purposes, we also estimate a model with AAA grants and nonAAA grants. In the first IV

strategy the instruments using region dummies interacted with federal grant spending per

capita are reasonably strong. In the second IV strategy we construct the instrument for

nonAAA grant spending in a way similar to the manner described above but based on the

AAA procedure for handing out grants. For each crop in each year the AAA considered

past crop output and current market conditions and set a price per acre to offer farmers to

take land out of production. Typically, the allotments of acreage for each state were

based on the average number of acres harvested and the yield per acre in the state over

the previous five years. We developed an instrument that partially mimics that process

while not including state-level information from the sample period on acreage, yields, or

prices in the area. We set the basic structure for AAA payments in 1928 before the

sample starts and then update the instrument each year based on changes in AAA

spending elsewhere in the country. AAA spending well outside the region where the

state was located is multiplied by an agricultural activity measure in 1928 based all crops

that received AAA subsidies by 1940.26 The 1928 activity measure is the share of U.S.

crop activity in that state in 1928. The instrument is expected to have strength because it

has similarity to the five-year averages that served as the basis of distribution in the

actual program. By fixing the share of agricultural activity in 1928 and updating with

information on AAA spending well outside the region, the instrument should not be



         25 If the federal government had established a hard budget constraint nationwide, there might
have been a negative relationship between spending in the rest of the regions and spending in the state in
question. There did not appear to be a hard spending constraint at the national level because Roosevelt and
the Congress often approved additional funds throughout the years and ran budget deficits in most years.
26 The AAA started providing grants for different crops in different years. By using the crops in the
program as of 1940, we avoid any endogeneity related to the timing of when programs began for each crop.


Fishback and Kachanovskaya                          26
correlated with the error in the final stage regression except through its impact on AAA

spending.



Multipliers for Per Capita State Personal Income

         The state personal incomes are reported on a calendar year basis, while the federal

spending is reported on a fiscal year basis, covering the period from July 1 in year t-1 to

June 30 in year t. This automatically imparts a half-year lag into the model.27 Table II

shows coefficients and standard errors from a series of estimations with per capita state

personal income in $1967 as a function of per capita estimates of federal government

fiscal activity in the state. The first column shows the coefficient and standard errors for

per capita federal grants in the level specification as correlates are added cumulatively

and then IV methods using the region interactions with federal spending as instruments.

The raw Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimate of 1.04 with no correlates implies that a

one dollar increase in per capita federal grants increased per capita state income by $1.04.

Controlling for state fixed effects raises this multiplier estimate to 1.43, and adding

weather correlates raises it further to 1.56. The addition of year effects to control for

nationwide shocks reduces the multiplier to 0.45, and the addition of state-specific time

trends lowers the estimate further to 0.16. This last estimate suggests that the federal

spending crowded out a great deal of local economic activity and/or the impact is

weakened greatly because the spending quickly leaked out of the local economy. The



27 We investigated interpolating the federal spending in each state to a calendar-year basis by using state
level information on monthly employment in programs, but we could not do this for all programs. Without
such state-specific information, interpolation runs the risk of incorporating information on government
spending in the first half of year t+1 into the year t estimate. We did not carry the process further because
the interpolation might introduce biases to the extent that state income in year t influences the distribution
of federal government spending in year t+1.


Fishback and Kachanovskaya                           27
results for the other regression specifications show the same pattern of changes in

coefficients as correlates are added to the analysis. This pattern typically appears when

using other measures of government funding and other measures of economic activity.

       Given that the Roosevelt administration distributed more grants to areas where the

economy was in trouble, we instrument to try to eliminate negative bias in the coefficient.

The transition to instrumental variables is consistent with negative endogeneity bias, as

the instrumental variable (IV) coefficients are more positive than the non IV coefficients

from equations with the same correlates. The IV estimates that both control for a great

deal of omitted variable bias and also meet the strongest criteria for instrument strength

are the ones with controls for weather, state effects, and year effects. If we are willing to

accept up to 15 percent weak instrument bias in the size of the coefficient, the critical

value for rejecting the hypothesis of weak instrument bias at the 10 percent level

developed by Stock and Yogo (2002a, 2002b) for the Kleibergan-Paap (2006) (KP)

version of the Donald F-statistic when using robust standard errors is 12.83 with three

instruments instrument for one right-hand side variable. The values if one is willing to

accept 20 and 25 percent bias are 9.54 and 7.80. The critical values are lower if weak

instrument bias is measured relative to the bias of the OLS coefficient at 9.08 for 10

percent relative bias and 6.46 for 20-percent relative bias.

       The IV estimates without year fixed effects generate very high F-statistics that

reject the hypothesis of weak instrument bias, but the absence of year effects means that

the effects of monetary policy, federal tax rate changes, the National Recovery

Administration, and other changes, which were correlated with both income and federal

grant spending, are incorporated into the coefficient of federal grant spending. The




Fishback and Kachanovskaya                   28
addition of year fixed effects eliminates this potential problem and the KP statistics reject

the hypothesis of 15 percent weak instrument bias when state and year fixed effects are

included. The addition of state-specific time trends serves to eliminate potential omitted

variable bias but at the cost of losing instrument strength, as the F-statistic of 5.03 is not

high enough to reject 15 to 25 percent weak instrument bias. Therefore, we will focus the

discussion on the IV estimates with state and year effects.

        The per capita personal income multiplier estimates for per capita federal grants

using the IV of region interactions with federal totals vary only slightly when using

different estimating equations. The coefficient is 1.11 using level estimation, 1.10 in the

first difference specification, and 1.13 in the growth rate specification. Under the

moat/swing instrument strategy, the level specification leads to a multiplier estimate of

1.39. We do not report the difference specifications for the moat-swing instrument

strategy because the instrument F-statistics are all less than 3, suggesting weak

instrument bias. Although each of the estimates is greater than one, we cannot reject the

hypothesis that the multiplier is equal to one. Thus, an additional dollar of federal grants

may well have increased personal income by no more than the dollar of grant spending

with no additional benefit in the private sector.



Personal Income Multipliers for Different Types of Federal Funding

        The estimates of multipliers for different federal funding measures in Table III

show variations in the point estimates for different types of spending. The multiplier for

grants net of federal taxes paid from the state hovers around one. When a dollar in

federal loans is treated like a dollar in grants and we estimate the effect of the combined




Fishback and Kachanovskaya                    29
total of grants and loans, we might expect smaller multipliers for the combination of

grants and loans. There was a huge surge of loans on World War I adjusted service

certificates in 1931 when the economy was falling apart, and the size of the Veterans’

Bonus was cut nearly in half in 1936 when the economy was growing the cash grants of

over $3 billion was offset by the repayment of the earlier loans. The estimates under the

level specifications in Table III are consistent with this expectation with values of .86 and

.89. On the other hand, the difference and growth specifications lead to estimates of 1.54

and 1.93. When the loans are treated as providing a subsidy of 10 percent of the loan

value, the multipliers for grants and 10 percent of loans are very close to the multiplier

for grants alone reported in Table II and at the top of Table III.

       There is some sign that specific types of grants may have had stronger effects.

When direct transfers to the poor are removed from the grants and the focus is on

government purchases, the multiplier estimate is as high as 2.18 in the level specification

using the moat-swing instrument strategy and exceeds 1.4 in two other specifications. On

the other hand, the estimate is also only 0.38 in the first-difference specification.

       Given that the AAA farm grants were designed to take land out of production, we

expected that the nonAAA grants would have stronger effects than all grants and that the

AAA potentially had negative effects on personal income. Three of the four sets of

estimates are consistent with this view. The multipliers for nonAAA grants vary from

0.94 to 1.79, while the AAA grant coefficients are negative in three specifications

although very large and positive in the level specification using the region interaction

instruments. The findings of the positive effect of nonAAA grants and negative effects

of AAA grants are similar to Fishback, Horrace, and Kantor’s (2005, 2006) findings




Fishback and Kachanovskaya                    30
using county level data. Using a different instrument strategy, they find that public works

and relief were associated with higher retail sales and net in-migration, and that AAA

grants were associated with slightly lower retail sales and net out-migration. The

payments would have benefitted farm owners and those tenants who received a share of

the AAA payments. On the other hand, the likely reduction in the demand for farm labor

would have reduced wages and employment for farm workers and share croppers

(Fishback, Horrace, and Kantor (2005, 2006).28

         Even though the results in Table III show variations in the multiplier for different

forms of spending, it is important to note that the standard errors of the estimates are

large enough that we cannot reject a multiplier of one for nearly every estimate. Further,

the comparisons of multipliers for different types of government funding do not match

for each estimation procedure. For example, in looking down the columns for the growth

rate specification, the largest multiplier of 1.93 is the one for grants and the full value of

loans. In contrast, the multiplier for grants and the full value of loans is lowest in the two

level specifications.



The Impact of Federal Grants on Various Measures of Economic Activity




          28The policy was designed to raise prices for farmers. The negative effect on real personal
income from the price rise was likely to have been felt nationwide for crops with national markets. This
change would have led to a rise in the CPI and a reduction in real income nationwide that would show up in
the coefficients of the year dummies. In that sense, the multiplier estimate will be overstated. There may
have been differential effects within states due to differences in the consumer prices based on distance
between farmgate and final market. Much of this effect would be controlled for by the state fixed effects.
For some crops that sold in local markets, like corn and hay, the local prices might have risen more than at
the national level with the reduction in output as long as they stayed within a price range set by
transportation costs to other markets (Fox, Fishback, Rhode, 2011). This localized rise would show up in
the measure of state personal income but the effect of the rise in limiting purchasing power would not
because we have not adjusted for localized differences in the cost of living. Here again the multiplier effect
will be slightly overstated.


Fishback and Kachanovskaya                           31
        Federal grants had differential effects on various economic measures that are

aggregated into per capita personal income. Table IV shows dollar-for-dollar IV

estimates for retail sales per capita, wage and salary income per capita and manufacturing

payrolls per capita. Data for retail sales per capita and manufacturing payrolls per capita

data were reported for only some years; therefore, the table includes estimates for per

capita personal income for the same years to make comparisons on the same set of

observations. Dollar-for-dollar estimates cannot be developed when the dependent

variables are employment and durable good consumption in the form of automobile

registrations, so we report the effects as elasticities evaluated at the mean of the sample

along with elasticities for per capita state income.

        The estimates suggest that the distribution of government funds had strong effects

on consumption but virtually no effect or even a negative effect on employment. The

dollar-for-dollar coefficient in the retail sales per capita analysis for the four years in

which it was available is in the 0.8 to 0.9 range. The coefficient is similar to the

coefficient in the per capita personal income estimation for the same four years. Given

that the ratio of retail sales to income during this period was roughly 0.5, it appears that

the grants had a relatively much stronger effect on retail consumption than it did on

income per capita.

        The grants also contributed to increases in automobile purchases. The estimates

of the elasticity of automobile registrations with respect to grants range from 0.047 to

0.081 while the elasticity estimates for personal income with respect to grants range from

0.086 to 0.108. To put this in dollar terms, value each car at the price of a new Ford in

1934, which was about $500 then and $1,247 when adjusted to the 1967 Consumer Price




Fishback and Kachanovskaya                     32
Index values used to control for the price level. An additional dollar of federal spending

raised the value of car registrations by between 10 and 22 cents.

         The effect of grants on wage and salary income was small relative to the effect on

all personal income. The dollar-for-dollar coefficients for wage and salary income are

relatively low, ranging from 0.09 to 0.66. These are much smaller than the coefficients

above 1 for personal income. Wage and salary income accounts for roughly 60 percent

of all income during this period, and the wage and salary grant coefficients are less than

60 percent of the coefficients for personal income.

         In contrast to their generally strong positive effects on personal income and

consumption, the effects of grants on per capita employment and manufacturing payrolls

are mostly negative and relatively small in size.29 30 These findings for private

employment and payrolls are in the same range as the results for the impact of New Deal

relief spending found by Neumann, Fishback, and Kantor (2010) for a city-level monthly

panel from 1932 through 1939 and Benjamin and Mathews’ (1992) findings for a state

panel from 1932-1939. Both find that relief spending was associated with crowding out

of private employment after 1935. Neumann, Fishback, and Kantor found some positive

effects of relief spending on employment from 1932 to 1935, while Benjamin and

Mathews find crowding out of about 20 percent. Wallis and Benjamin (1982) also

          29We put all measures on a per capita basis for consistency. We have also estimated the models
for the payrolls and employment without putting them on a per capita basis and the magnitudes of the
results are only slightly larger.
          30It is possible that the statistically insignificant effect of government spending on manufacturing
payrolls might reflect the fact that most manufacturing was selling to national and international markets. If
so, a rise in federal spending within a state would only stimulate the demand in that state, which might be a
small share of the demand for the product. We checked this hypothesis by estimating the impact of
spending on manufacturing payrolls in the bread industry for the years 1929, 1931, 1933, 1935, and 1937.
The bread industry was found in every state and tended to sell locally. The bread industry results also show
small and statistically insignificant effects of federal spending. The dollar-for-dollar effects 0.2 cents per
dollar spent, while the elasticities are smaller than the elasticities reported for manufacturing payrolls per
capita in Table IV. The findings for the bread industry are therefore inconsistent with the idea that the
small effects on manufacturing are being driven by the dispersed nature of manufacturing consumption.

provide cross-sectional estimates that cast doubt on any positive effects of New Deal

spending on private employment.



       State by State Estimates

       The identification in the state and year fixed effects IV model comes from

changes over time within the same state in the part of federal spending correlated with the

instrument after controlling for nation-wide shocks in each year. The coefficient is

therefore an average across the states. We also estimate the relationship for each

individual state over the period using a difference model to reduce problems with non-

stationarity. The major issue with the state-by-state estimation is how well the model can

control for national shocks common to all states. Our solution is to include the difference

in the real per capita national money supply (M2) and a dummy variable for the National

Recovery Administration (NRA) period from 1933 through 1935. Cole and Ohanian

(2004) argue that the NRA’s codes of competition held wages and prices high and

contributed greatly to the underemployment of resources. On the other hand, Eggertsson

(2008) argues that the NRA push for high prices and wage stimulated the economy as

part of a program to reverse inflationary expectations. Changes in tax rates were

important but there were multiple changes over the period and there are few degrees of

freedom. To capture the impact of taxes we estimate the model with grants net of federal

taxes in each state. Results are reported for estimates without the taxes for comparison

purposes. In this analysis we use the moat/swing instrument, which has fewer problems

with weak instrument bias than when total grants spending is used.




Fishback and Kachanovskaya                  34
       Table V shows the dollar-for-dollar effects on per capita state personal income of

a one dollar increase in per capita grants net of federal taxes in each state. For

comparison, when the model specification is estimated for the panel of all states, the

multiplier coefficient is 0.605 with a t-statistic of 3.19 and the instrument strength tests

suggest that it is strong. The instrument strength varies for each state. There were 33

states where the hypothesis of weak instrument bias of 10 percent was rejected, 7 more

estimates that met the 15 percent or less criteria, and 8 with very weak instruments. The

estimates were generally consistent with a view of negative endogeneity, as the IV

multiplier estimates were more positive, by an average of about .25, than the OLS

coefficients in 35 of the 40 states where weak instrument bias is not a problem.      The

average dollar-for-dollar coefficient for those states was 0.80. For the 40 states with no

more than 15 percent weak instrument bias, the average coefficient was .79 and the

values ranged from -1.27 in Kansas to 3.4 in Idaho. The multiplier estimates for states

that where weak instrument bias could not be rejected included 5 of the 7 largest values

in absolute value.

       There was not much of a discernable pattern in the estimates across states.

Among the states with less than 15 percent weak instrument bias, the extreme values over

2 were found in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Idaho. Pennsylvania was probably the

most self-sufficient state but Idaho was one of the smallest states. States with values

between one and two included states of all sizes from several regions. Some had large

populations, like New York, Massachusetts, and California, but most were in the bottom

half of the population distribution, including West Virginia, Oregon, Utah, Mississippi,




Fishback and Kachanovskaya                    35
Washington, Maine, and Florida. Negative multipliers were found in Kentucky,

Oklahoma, Minnesota, and Kansas.



Conclusions

       If there was any time to expect a large peace-time multiplier from federal

spending in the states, it would have been during the period from 1930 through 1940.

Interest rates were at or near the zero bound for nearly the entire decade, a situation in

which macroeconomic models predict stronger fiscal multiplier effects. Unemployment

rates with work relief workers treated as unemployed were never below 14 percent during

the decade. Even if people on work relief were treated as employed, the unemployment

rate never fell below 9 percent (Darby 1976). There was idle capital in nearly every

industry. As a result, there were clearly a large number of underemployed resources that

could have been soaked up by federal spending without crowding out private activity.

       Estimates controlling for weather shocks, state and year fixed effects, and in some

cases state-specific time trend but without using instruments imply that state fiscal

multipliers were in the 0.1 to 0.5 range. Given that New Deal funds were distributed in

part in response to drops in economic activity, there is ample reason to believe that the

non-IV multiplier estimates are biased downward even in models with state and year

fixed effects and time trends. The estimates for the state multipliers that we think are

most accurate are the IV estimates controlling for state and year fixed effects. The IV

estimates without controls for state and year effects are likely too high because they do

not control for nationwide monetary and tax rate shocks, nor do they control for




Fishback and Kachanovskaya                   36
fundamental time-invariant features of the states. The addition of state-specific time

trends leads to weak instrument bias.

       The dollar-for-dollar multiplier estimates show the dollar change in the measure

of economic activity in response to a one dollar increase in the measure of government

spending. Nearly all of the state per capita personal income multiplier estimates are not

statistically significantly different from one. In some estimating strategies, the point

estimates of the multipliers for nonfarm grant spending and nontransfer grants are as high

as 1.79 and 2.18, but other estimates are below one for the same measure, and the

standard errors of the estimates in all of those cases are high enough that a multiplier of

one cannot be rejected. Three of four point estimates for coefficients on AAA grants to

farmers to take land out of production were negative but not statistically significant. As a

general statement, the distribution of a dollar of federal funds to a state led to about a

dollar increase in personal income in the state.

       Federal grants had a stronger impact on consumption than on personal income.

The per capita retail sales multiplier was roughly the same size as the personal income

multiplier in the same sample even though retail sales are typically only about 50 percent

of income. An additional dollar in federal grants contributed to an increase of about 10 to

20 cents in the value of automobiles registered in the state.

       On the other hand, there were no signs that increased government grants raised

nonfarm private employment or manufacturing employment. Most of the coefficient

estimates were negative with small elasticities. The results are consistent with the

findings by Neumann, Fishback, and Kantor (2010) and Benjamin and Mathews (1992)

using alternative data sets.




Fishback and Kachanovskaya                    37
         If we apply the lessons of the New Deal to the federal fiscal stimulus today, it is

important to realize that the estimates for the states are not for a national multiplier.

Instead, they describe the impact within the state of additional federal funding in the state

after all leakages are considered.31 In both periods interest rates are near the zero bound

and unemployment rates are well above long run averages, although the problems of the

Depression were far worse. The New Deal results suggest that federal fiscal stimulus

during a modern recession would stimulate income in the states roughly dollar-for-dollar

but have little impact on private nonfarm employment in the state.

31 Given that the states are part of a large open economy, the impact of federal spending can spill over into
other states. The direction of the bias could plausibly go in either direction. The multiplier estimate might
be overstated to the extent that a rise in government spending in a neighboring state leads to more spillover
spending in the state of interest and federal spending in the neighboring state is positively correlated to
government spending in the state of interest. The multiplier would be understated with a positive spillover
from government spending in the neighboring state but a negative correlation between federal spending in
the neighboring state and the state of interest. As a first cut, we estimated a model with a spatial lag for
income in neighboring states. The nonIV and IV results lead to substantially smaller multipliers, but we
have not yet found a strong instrument for the income in the neighboring states.

Notes: This is a balanced panel with information for 48 states for each year from 1930
     through 1940. Estimation used the STATA 10 reg and ivreg2 programs. For the
     calculations of t-statistics, standard errors are based on White corrections using the
     robust command with standard errors clustered at the state level. The instrument F-


Fishback and Kachanovskaya                   52
    statistic is the Kleibergen-Paap rank Wald (KP) F statistic. When compared with
    the Stock-Yogo critical values, the Kleibergen-Paap rank Wald (KP) F statistic can
    be used to test for weak-instrument bias based on the maximum weak-instrument
    bias that one is willing to accept. In the analyses with one instrument for one
    government activity measure, the critical value is 16.38 at the 10 percent confidence
    level if someone is unwilling to accept more than 10-percent weak instrument bias,
    8.96 for unwillingness to accept more than 15 percent bias and 6.66 for 20 percent
    bias. When using three instruments the critical values for maximal size of weak
    instrument bias are 22.30 at the 10 percent level if someone is unwilling to accept
    more than 10-percent weak instrument bias, 12.83 for unwillingness to accept more
    than 15 percent bias, 9.54 for 20 percent bias, and 7.80 for 25-percent bias. The
    critical values for willingness to accept 10-percent weak instrument bias relative to
    the bias from OLS estimation is 9.08 and for willingness to accept 20% bias is 6.46.

All analyses are from individual regressions except for the nonAAA and AAA results,
      which are estimated in the same regression. The instrument F-statistic is the
      Kleibergen-Paap rank Wald (KP) F statistic. See notes to Table II for instrument
      strength critical values with one variable that requires instruments. In the analysis
      with nonAAA and AAA grants the critical values with 10 percent confidence are
      7.03 for 10 percent bias, 4.58 for 15 percent bias, and 3.95 for 20 percent bias.
      When loans are included the panel drops 1940 due to problems in obtaining data for
      loans in 1930. The measures of economic activity are on a calendar year basis


Fishback and Kachanovskaya                  55
    while the measures of government activity are on the July t-1 to June t fiscal year
    basis. Commodity Credit Corporation loans were dropped from the loan figures
    due to inaccurate measurement of the distribution of loans across states.

Notes. The estimates come from difference regressions of the change in real per capita
personal income on the change in real per capita federal grants minus taxes, the change in
the real money supply, a dummy for the NRA period, and a year trend. The estimates
cover the period 1930 through 1940 for each state.

                        DATA APPENDIX
    IN SEARCH OF THE MULTIPLIER FOR FEDERAL SPENDING IN THE
              STATES DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION

State Personal Income
        There are different concepts of government spending used in the literature and in
national income accounting. Many macroeconomic models refer to government
purchases of goods and services when examining real GDP estimates. They exclude
transfer payments.
        In the analysis in this paper the state personal income and state populations are
from the current BEA website. Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of
Commerce, Regional Economic Information System,
http://www.bea.gov/regional/spi/SA1-3fn.cfm. The definitions reported there are very
similar to the original BEA estimates from the late 1930s and early 1940s from Creamer
and Merwin (1941). Their definition of personal income is based on the definitions used
for monthly personal income described in Cone, 1940. The focus was on consumer
purchasing power “Consumer purchasing power” signifies the ability of consumers to
purchase the new goods and services currently produced by business enterprises.
        The definition of income payments is National Income after subtracting business
savings, social security contributions from employer and employee, contributions to the
Railroad Retirement Fund and contributions to retirement systems for government
employees and then adding direct relief, federal pensions to veterans, World War I
Adjusted Service Compensation (ASC) benefits in the form of loans or cash payouts,
other government retirement allowances, unemployment compensation, railroad
insurance benefits and old-age insurance benefits. Agriculture benefit payments are
included in income (Cone 1940, pp. 3, 4, 8, 10, 13, 39).
        In addition, the following items were excluded from state personal income:
capital gains; earnings from odd jobs due to lack of data; Illegal earnings because they
have “no economic value within the legal framework of the producing economy;” and
imputed income from ownership of durable consumers’ goods is excluded.
        Cone (1940, p. 8) explained the logic for incorporating the World War I ASC
loans and payouts in the following way:

       “Prior to June 1936 payments to World War veterans took the form of
       cash loans on the security of their adjusted service certificates; in that
       month the Federal Government, in discharge of its obligations on amount
       of adjusted service legislation, remitted to the veterans more than
       $2,000,000,000 worth of adjusted service bonds and some cash. The
       larger portion of these bonds were liquidated during the year 1936, but the
       Treasury has been redeeming them in smaller amounts during the past 3
       years; the present rate is about $2,000,000 a month. More properly , then,
       the payments to veterans represent in the first instance loans on existing
       assets and in the second the gradual liquidation of these assets rather than
       the actual payment of income as here defined. Nevertheless, because
       these disbursements of the Federal Government were in the nature of
       original receipts to the veterans and because, owing to the large volume of



Fishback and Kachanovskaya                  62
       the disbursements and their wide distribution among 3,000,000 veterans,
       they represented an important stimuls to consumption on two distinct
       occasions, they have been incorporated into the monthly series.

       Since the personal income payments include transfers, transfers have been
incorporated in the federal government distribution of grants (Cone 1940, p. 8, 39).

Other Measures of Economic Activity
        State wage and salary income is from Creamer and Merwin (1942). Cone (1940)
provides an overview of the series used to construct the data. Manufacturing Payrolls for
1929, 1931, 1933, 1935, 1937, and 1939 are from the Biennial U.S. Manufacturing
Censuses of 1931, 1933, 1935, 1937, and from the Manufacturing Volumes in the
Fifteenth and Sixteenth Censuses of the United States and Haines (ICPSR 2896). Retail
Sales data are from retail censuses conducted by the Bureau of the Census and reported in
U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, 1936 and
1939. The 1929 and 1939 retail sales are from Haines (ICPSR 2896).
        Wallis (1989) constructed the index for the broad measure of employment, which
covers establishments in manufacturing, mining, retail, wholesale, laundries, and street
railroads, and does not include railroads, construction, or government workers. The
index is built up from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly establishment surveys
collected by various agencies around the country. Wallis then benchmarked the series to
census employment figures. The index of payrolls for the broad measure of employment
is constructed from the same information and is built up from the Monthly Labor Review
and a series of monthly reports Employment and Payrolls. We have not benchmarked the
payroll indices. In the payroll index we substituted information from Milwaukee from
the Neumann, Fishback, and Kantor (2010) dataset for information for Wisconsin
because the Wisconsin series led to extremely unusual figures. Wallis (1989) also
mentions this issue). We have also created the unbenchmarked employment index from
this data and have used it to create an estimate of average monthly earnings.
        Automobile registrations for each state were collected from U.S. Public Roads
Administration (1947).

Measuring Government Spending

We have compiled a data set of the key components of federal spending and loans
identified by the U.S. Office of Government Reports (OGR) between 1933 and 1939.
Starting with the OGR data we then checked the spending in each category from 1933
and 1939 and then extended the data forward to 1940 and backward to 1930 using reports
of the U.S. Treasury and many federal agencies.

The Path of Federal Spending in the States through 1932
        Prior to the New Deal there were relatively few federal programs that distributed
grants and loans to the states, local governments, or individuals within states. By the
early 1920s the grants came in the form of federal highway grants to the states through
the Department of Agriculture, public health grants for children under the Shephard-
Townsend legislation; grants for state and city soldier and sailors homes; education grants



Fishback and Kachanovskaya                  63
to state agricultural and mechanical universities, for books for the blind, marine schools,
and vocational education; grants under the Department of Agriculture to Experiment
Stations and Extension Services. The Army Corps of Engineers was building, improving,
and maintaining rivers and harbors and flood control works. The Veterans’ Bureau was
paying out pension and death payments to veterans or their dependents. There were also
payments to replace lost property taxes to counties in Oregon associated with the Coos
Bay wagon trail and to the state of Oregon for the loss of property taxes on land that the
federal government had taken back over from the original Oregon and California
Railroad land grant. Finally, there were payments to Oklahoma for gas and oil royalties.
The Shephard-Townsend grants wound down after 1930.
         The Veterans’ Bureau provided extensive vocational rehabilitation training for
disabled veterans from World War I with expenditures peaking $166 million in 1922
before slowly declining over the decade to $20 thousand in 1930. The Bureau also
provided pensions to veterans, payments to widows of veterans, various forms of
insurance, and hospital and medical services.
         The Bureau of Reclamation was providing no interest loans for building dams and
irrigation works and Boulder Dam had begun construction. In the paper we treated these
as grant expenditures because the payments on the loans were often delayed for long
periods of time and in a number of cases were forgiven.
         The loans came in the form of Federal Land Bank mortgage loans to farmers and
a series of special appropriations for emergency crop and feed loans. After 1926 loans
were available to veterans based on collateral in the form of World War I Adjusted
Service Certificates (ASCs) that would mature after 20 years from the date of receipt of
the ASC.
         Between the fiscal years 1929 and 1933 Congress and the Hoover Administration
raised federal government outlays by 52 percent in nominal terms and 88 percent after
adjusting for inflation. Mostly this came in the form of expansions of existing programs.
In February 1932 the Reconstruction Finance Corporation was established and made a
broad range of loans to financial institutions, industry, and lower levels of government.
Franklin Roosevelt and the Democratic Congress took office in early March, 1933 and
introduced the broad range of programs seen in Table 1 of the paper. The Public Roads
Administration took over the highway grants formerly distributed by the USDA and the
Federal Credit Administration

Veterans’ Bonus.
        The World War I Veterans’ Bonus that was associated with the Bonus Army
March of 1931 and the cash payout in 1936 was based on an insurance certificate that
would mature in the mid 1940s. Through 1936 World War I veterans could obtain loans
against the certificates, which they did quite actively. In 1936 over Roosevelt’s veto
Congress passed a law that allowed cash payments on the certificates and thus a very
large cash payout.
        On May 19th, 1924, Congress enacted a law providing for adjusted service
compensation for veterans of World War I. The act provided for a basic service credit of
$1 per day served and a $1.25 for each day served overseas with a maximum credit of
$625 for overseas service and $500 for home service. For veterans with credits less than
$50 the payments would be made in cash. Otherwise, the veteran would receive an



Fishback and Kachanovskaya                  64
insurance certificate of the amount multiplied by 1.25 that would pay out the amount on
the certificate at the end of 20 years. Apparently, the 25 percent increase was added to
take into account the delayed nature of the payment. If the beneficiary died before 20
years, his beneficiary would receive the amount on the certificate (Veterans Bureau,
1924, p. 688). In the original act, the veteran could borrow from banks or trust
companies using the certificate as collateral an amount up to 90 percent of the present
value of the certificate at the end of the year in which the loan was made using a discount
rate of 4 percent and adjusting for likely mortality. This turned out to be about 40 percent
of the value of a certificate maturing in 20 years. If the veteran failed to pay interest and
the face value, the bank could receive payment from the Veterans’ Bureau to cover the
loan, and the certificate was passed to the Veterans’ Bureau (Administrator of Veterans’
Affairs, 1924, pp. 688-672; 1932, p. 36). The interest rate on loans was established as 2
percent about the Federal rediscount rate for 60 days’ paper in the Federal Reserve
District where the loan was made. Many people ignore the life insurance value of the
certificates that were issued. The Veteran’s Administration suggested in 1932 that in 80
percent of the cases of veterans dying, the insurance payout from the ASC was the only
material asset left to the dependents (Administrator of Veterans’ Affairs, 1932, p. 36-37).
          Between 1925 and 1936 the Veterans’ Bureau issued roughly 3.7 million
adjusted-service certificates (ASCs) with maturity value of $3.69 billion. About $3.1
billion had been issued in certificates by June 30, 1926, while the rest trickled in over
time as the deadline for application was consistently extended.
        On March 3, 1927, Congress authorized the Veterans’ Bureau to loan directly on
the ASCs. By 1928, as seen in Table A-1, nearly 700,000 veterans borrowed against
their ascs. By 1930 the Veterans’ Bureau had made about 2.4 million loans with a value
of $215 million against the ASCs.
        On Feb. 27, 1931 Congress passed Public No. 743 over Hoover’s veto. It
provided that the loan basis of the asc shall at no time be less than 50 percent of the face
value of the asc after the certificate has been in effect for 2 years. The law also capped
the maximum interest rate at 4.5 percent. The new law led to an explosion of new loans
as the cumulative dollar value of loans on certificates rose from $215 million to nearly
$1.1 billion (Administrator of the Veterans’ Bureau, 1931, pp. 10, 42-43). The loans had
a nice feature that the veteran could forgo repayment and just allow the repayment plus
accumulated interest to be taken out of the payment made when the certificate matured.
The Veterans’ Bureau estimated this would lead to a payout of about $188 for a a typical
certificate (the average was roughly $1,000) on which 50 percent had been borrowed and
no principal and interest repaid. Of course, the veteran received the intial $500 up front.
A law of July 21, 1932 eliminated the two-year waiting period between issuance of the
certificate and the loan and cut the maximum interest rate to 3.5 percent (Administrator
of the Veterans’ Bureau (1932, pp. 10, 36-38). After the burst in 1931, the value of loans
on the certificates rose by roughly $300-350 million in fiscal 1932 and 1933, declined
some during as the recovery began and rose again until 1935.

pp. 22-23. Cone, 1940, p. 44.

        Frederick Cone (1940, 44) provided monthly estimates of loans on ASCs that he
included as part of his estimates of personal income. Table A-1 lists the fiscal year totals
of loans from 1931 through 1935. His amounts differ from the ones in the veterans’
bureau reports, as he has no loans listed in fiscal year 1930. When the transition is made
to grants and the loans paid off in 1936, his totals don’t match the veterans’ bureau totals.
We used Cone’s estimates for the ASCs to subtract out the ASCs from the personal
income measures to obtain production income numbers. His calendar year totals after
paying off loans in millions for 1936 are 1,427, for 1937 are $120, for 1938 are $58, and
for 1939 are $34. He does not report a value for 1940. In measuring grants and loans,
we used the information from the Administrator of Veterans’ Affairs Reports.
        We have been unable to find descriptions of the amount of the loans on ASCS or
the value of the veterans’ bonus on the ASCs in 1936 through 1941 by state for each year.
However, there are several sources for specific years that give good descriptions of the
share of World War I veterans in the states in several years. The 1926 report of the
Veterans’ Bureau Administrator reported the distribution of the ASCs across states
distributed to that time, but no reports were made after that. By June 30, 1926
approximately 84 percent of the certificates had been issued. The 1930 Census reported
the number of World War I veterans, and we used the Integrated Public Use Microdata
Sample for 1930 to get an estimate of the number of World War I veterans in each state.
We also have information on the number of living World War I veterans receiving
pensions in 1934 through 1941 Administrator of Veterans’ Affairs, 1926, pp. 312-313;
1934, pp. 78-79; 1935, pp. 80-81; 1936, pp. 90-91; 1937; pp. 80-81; 1938, pp. 93-94 ;
1939, pp. 93-94; 1940, pp. 101-102; 1941, pp. 89-90). The correlations between the



Fishback and Kachanovskaya                   66
1934 through 1941 numbers were all above .99. The correlations between the 1926
numbers and these numbers were in the 0.93 to 0.94 range, the correlations between the
1930 number and the 1934-1941 numbers were in the .92 range, which might be expected
if people were moving around the country. We calculated the share of veterans in each
state (taking into account veterans living elsewhere and in Washington, D.C in the total)
in each year where we had information. For the years 1927 through 1929 and 1931
through 1933 we used straight-line interpolations of the shares between the values in
1926 , 1930, and 1934. We then multiplied the values by the national totals to get loan
values for the ASCs in each state in 1927 through 1935 and by the cash payouts in 1936
through 1941.
         In response to pressure from veterans’ groups, Congress overrode a Roosevelt
veto on January 27, 1936 to create a new payment structure for the ASCs. The World
War I veterans could turn in the ASCs for payment of the face value in cash (the famed
Veterans’ Bonus) after their outstanding loans and accumulated interest to that date had
been deducted. The veteran could also choose a bond dated June 15, 1936 to mature June
15, 1945 with interest at the rate of 3 percent per annum but no interest to be paid on any
bond redeemed before June 15, 1937. As of June 30, 1936, during the life of the
program, the veterans’ bureau had issued a total 3,757,259 ASCs with a maturity value of
$3.692 billion. Of these 231,109 had matured on account of death and $229.5 million
had been awarded to the designated beneficiaries. This left 3.52 million certificates in
force with maturity values of $3.462 billion. Payments of less than $50 had been made in
165,184 cases to the value of $5.206 million. Cash settlements were made to the
beneficiaries of 135,615 veterans who died in service for an amount of $44.669 million.
After the passage of the 1936 act, the VA received 3.264 million applications for
settlements of which 98.9 percent had been certified and the rest were in the process. The
face value of the certificates was $3.206 billion. After deducting outstanding liens for
loans the net value was $1.764 billion.
         In constructing the data, we used the change in the cumulative value of the
Veterans’ Bureau’s loans on the ASCs as the value of loans in each fiscal year through
the end of fiscal year 1935. Hardly anybody held on to their loans after the passage of
the cash opportunity in 1936. The issue arises as to how to treat the cash out of the
veterans’ bureau. We treated the full $3.206 billion in cash and bond payouts in fiscal
year 1936 as a grant, while the value of loans was treated as a repayment with a value of
minus $1,679,699,884 for that year. Additional cash disbursements were made of $282.6
million in fiscal 1937, $13.8 million in 1938, $7.4 million in 1939, $9.2 million in 1940,
and $2.657 million in 1941 (Administrator of Veterans’ Affairs 1941, p. 87).


Tennessee Valley Authority Spending

        From examining the OGR figures for spending on rivers and harbors and the
Bureau of Reclamation in Tennessee and Alabama, it is clear that the Tennessee Valley
Authority expenditures on the construction of a series of Dams and Canals along the
Tennessee River are not included. The TVA was a quasi-government corporation that
was supposed to repay construction expenditures eventually with electric power revenues
but these were very slow to repay the full bill. The expenditures were included in the



Fishback and Kachanovskaya                  67
Federal Budget expenditure figures listed in the Statistical Abstract of the United States
in various years, so they likely belong as expenditures. Another reason to include them is
that the Office of Government Reports included the Bureau of Reclamation expenditures
on Dams and irrigation projects in their estimates. We constructed estimates of the
expenditures on the TVA project, which started in fiscal year 1934 using information
from the Federal budget line item for the TVA (U.S. Bureau of the Census, Statistical
Abstract of the United States, 1935, p. 169, 1936, p. 170, 1937, p. 168, 1938, p. 174,
1939, p. 172, 1940 p. 198, 1941, p. 184, and 1942, p. 198) and from the TVA annual
reports.
        We divided up the line item for each year by projects using the TVA Annual
Reports for the years 1935 through 1942. The TVA reported a net investment figure for
each Dam project for the fiscal years 1934, 1935, 1936, and 1937 (Reports of 1935, pp.
63-68; 1936 123-129; 1937, 103-109). National defense and fertilizer net investments
were all assigned to the Muscle Shoals, Alabama area. Mapping and future project
expenditures were split evenly between Alabama and Tennessee. In 1938, the TVA
began reporting the cumulative cost over the years for each of the following dams:
Wilson, Norris, and Wheeler Dams. In 1939, Pickwick was added. (Reports of 1938,
pp. 20-26; 1939, 15-22). In 1940 an evaluation of the fixed assets for Wilson, Norris,
Wheeler, Pickwick, Hiwassee, Guntersville, and Chickamauga was reported (Report of
1940, 61-63). The 1941 Report (pp. 41-43) then reported the cumulative cost again.
Prior to 1939 the construction costs for Hiwassee, Guntersville, and Chickamauga were
reported together. Using information on the amount of construction completed (Reports
of 1938, pp. 20-26, 1939, 15-22, and 1940, p. 16-18) we could divide up the expenditures
across the years. In late 1939 the TVA began reporting aggregate values of constructions
o the Watts Bar and Kentucky Dam projects. We split the total expenditures evenly
between the two projects through 1940 and then used information on the construction
costs of the projects in 1941 (pp. 41-43) to calculate the differences. The annual
estimates of expenditures from these various cumulative measures appear consistent with
the narrative descriptions of the progress of construction on each project. In the process
of developing the figures, a large estimate for Wilson dam in Muscle Shoals, Alabama
appears for the first time in 1937. Wilson Dam was built before the 1930s and
transferred to the TVA when it was started. A transfer value was not developed until
1937, and that is when it appears in the records. To get the final value for each state we
added up the total annual expenditures for all projects and then calculated the ratio of the
expenditures from the line item for the TVA in the federal expenditures to the total value
we calculated. We then multiplied that ratio by the annual values we estimated in each
state.

Extending the OGR Expenditures back to Fiscal Year 1930 and forward to Fiscal
Year 1941.

         We were able to extend the federal grant spending by state back to fiscal year
1930 and forward to fiscal year 1941 using information from the Annual Reports of the
Treasury Department, which reported direct payments made to states under cooperative
arrangements and grants to and expenditures within states providing direct relief, work
relief, and other aid, exclusive of loans (U.S. Department of Treasury, Annual
Report,1930, 623-626; 1931, 566-569; 1932,443-446; 1933, 382-385 ; 1934, 397-401;
1935, 432-4351936, 474-477; 1937, 474-479; 1938, 520-531; 1939, pp. 519-525, 1940,
821-829, 1941, 651-659). In the fiscal years 1934-1939 when both the OGR and
Department of Treasury of estimates were both reported, the data by program matched up
perfectly for the following programs for all years: Agricultural Experiment Stations,
Agricultural Extensions works, Colleges of Agricultural and Mechanical Arts, Forest
Funds, Forest Service Grants, Public Roads Administration (after summing across roads
programs in Treasury reports), Mineral Lease Payments, Special Funds grants,
Vocational Education and Rehabilitation Grants, Office of Education Grants, State
Marine School Grants, Books for Blind Grants, Federal Water Power Grants, Soldier and
Sailor Homes Grants, and National Guard Grants. All of these programs were programs
that existed before, during, and after the New Deal.

Veterans’ Bureau Spending

The Office of Government Reports reported Veterans’ Administration expenditures for
the years 1933 through 1939 by state. The loans to living veterans on the World War I
Adjusted Service Certificates prior to 1936 and the Veterans’ Bonus payouts on the ASCs
in 1936 and after were not included in the Veterans’ Administration expenditures. The
expenditures included pension payouts for Navy and Army veterans, VA homes,
Maintenance, military and naval insurance payouts for adjusted service certificates of less
than $50 in cash and payments to dependents from ASCs where the veteran has died, We
found that these matched the information reported by the Administrator of Veterans’
Affairs in Annual Reports for 1934, pp. 78-83; 1935, pp. 80-85; 1936, pp. 90-95; 1937;
pp. 80-85; 1938, pp. 93-98 ; 1939, pp. 93-98. We therefore used information from the
1940 and 1941 Reports to add the data for those years (1940, pp. 101-106; 1941, pp. 89-
94). The distributions across states in each year were pretty stable with pair-wise



Fishback and Kachanovskaya                  71
correlations between one year and the next of .98 or higher throughout the period from
1933 through 1941.
         For the period prior to 1933 the Veterans’ Administration (VA) reported national
expenditures but did not report the total spending by state. However, the VA did report
“the number of pensioners on the roll and the annual value of said roll” for war pensions
in 1931 and 1932 in the Annual Report of the Administrator of Veterans’ Affairs (1931,
p. 127; 1932, p. 95). Prior to 1931 the information was reported in the annual reports of
the U.S. Commissioner of Pensions (1920, p. 16; 1921, p. 21; 1922, p. 18; 1923, p. 12;
1924, p. 19; 1925, p. 14; 1926, p. 15; 1927, p. 14; 1928, p. ???; 1929, p. 15; 1930, p. 14)
and in the Statistical Abstract of the United States (1919, p. 380). In 1928 the
information was reported in the Secretary of Interior, Annual Report, 1928 (p. 292).
         For the years through 1932 the veterans’ administration reports the number of
pensioners on the rolls and the value of the pensions to be paid by state. This does not
represent all of the types of funds for the VA grants used in the data set from 1933 to
1939. We also have the number of veterans reported by state in the Census in 1930
from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Sample (IPUMS). The correlations across
states between these measures and the 1933 veterans’ bureau spending were .952 for the
IPUMS distribution for 1930, .943 for the distribution of pension amounts in 1932 and
.945 for the distribution of pension amounts in 1931.
         In the measure we used in the analysis we used the shares of the national totals
from the IPUMS data in 1930 and the shares for the VA spending in 1933 and developed
estimates of the shares in 1932, 1931, 1929, and 1928 using straight-line interpolations.
We then multiplied the national totals after subtracting out spending that is covered in
other categories (spending on state and territorial homes, vocational training, government
life insurance, seamen’s insurance, allotments and allowances, loans to vets for
transportation, medical and hospital services, and miscellaneous factors). The national
totals were $546,255,828 in 1932, $695,951676 in 1931, $626,485,964 in 1930,
$620,504,069 in 1929, and $611,396,308 in 1928 (calculated from Veterans
Administrator, 1934, p. 76, Table 40) We made the adjustments to the national totals
after comparing totals for 1934 with the OGR reports.
         The U.S. Employment Service grants reported by the OGR were much bigger
than those reported by the Treasury. For example, the OGR reported a total for the U.S.
of $24.556 million, while the Treasury reported $4 million. However, the Treasury
figures for 1940 look more like the OGR figures. In fact, they were substantially larger
than the 1939 OGR figures at a total around $60 million. They then fall off markedly to
$3.1 million in 1940. We looked at the Monthly Labor Review reports on public
employment agencies and we cannot explain this sudden rise and fall. Relative to the
total spending in those years, the fluctuations would be in the neighborhood of 1.5
percent of total spending in 1939. No grants were listed prior to fiscal year 1934, but we
know that the U.S. Employment Service operated in the early 1930s with a few offices
and a small staff in several states. Based on the descriptions of the size of the offices and
their tasks, we do not believe the expenditures were larger than $30,000 in those states
prior to 1934. U.S. Department of Labor, "Public Employment Services," Monthly
Labor Review (January 1931): 10-32. We chose to leave a value of zero for the U.S.
employment service prior to 1934.

         Among major New Deal programs, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration
OGR and Treasury values matched in 1939 and there were small differences in 1938, and
1937, and no listings in 1934-1936 in the Treasury Reports. The Civilian Conservation
Corps matched perfectly in 1937 and 1938, the treasury reports were 1.18 times the OGR
reported amount in each state in 1939.
         The Public Works Administration total for non-federal and for federal grants
matched up with the total in the Treasury in 1939. However, comparisons of the
Treasury information with information from the First and Second Annual Reports of the
Federal Works Administrator shows that the Treasury only reported the grants for non-
federal projects in 1940 and 1941. We filled in the grants for federal projects from PWA
expenditures form Federal Works Agency. First Annual Report, 1940, pp. 328-329 and
the Second Annual Report, 1941, pp. 318-19.
         For the Works Progress Administration, the sum of the Treasury’s National Youth
Administration and the WPA matched in 1939 and the sums were off a little in 1936,
1937, and 1938. The WPA figures from the OGR matched exactly the WPA annual
reports of federal expenditures from WPA, Report on the Progress of the Works
Progress Administration, various years. In 1940 and 1941 the Treasury expenditures
were slightly larger than the WPA expenditures reported in the Federal Works Agency,
Second Annual Report, 1941, pp. 452-453, and First Annual Report, 1940, pp. 436-437.
The Federal Emergency Administration Grants in the OGR and Treasury Reports
matched in 1935, 1937, 1938, and 1939 and differed slightly in 1936. The FERA
expenditures were not listed in the Treasury Reports of 1934, so no comparisons could be
made between the OGR and Treasury Reports that year.
         The Social Security Administration Expenditures reported by the OGR matched
the Treasury Reports and the grants listed for fiscal 1936 and 1937 in the Social Security
Board’s Second Annual Report of the Social Security Board, 1937, pp. 99-100. These
included grants for old-age assistance (74 percent of total in 1937) , aid to the blind
(2.8%), aid to dependent children (14.8%), unemployment compensation administration
(5.5%), as well as Department of Labor grants for maternal and child health services
(1.8%), services for crippled children (1.2%), and child welfare services (0.6%), and
Treasury department grants for public health work (4.6%). The OGR reports had lower
totals in 1938 and 1939 than those listed in the Treasury reports, while the Treasury
reports listed in 1938 and 1939 matched exactly the reported amounts in the Social
Security Board’s Fourth Annual Report of the Social Security Board, 1939, pp. 195-196.
We therefore used the Treasury and Social Security grant estimates for 1938 and 1939
instead of the OGR estimates.
         The Treasury Department figures for the Farm Security Administration were
similar to the OGR figures for 1938, but were much larger in 1937 and 1939. It appears
that the Treasury was including the value of FSA loans in the grant figures. For 1940 and
1941 we adjusted the Treasury figures downward based on the ratio of the OGR grant in
1939 to the Treasury listing in 1939.
         The Public Building Administration spending is not reported in the Treasury
Reports until 1940 but is reported in the OGR Reports. The data for the OGR matches up
exactly for 1934 with the data reported for the Public Buildings Administration in Federal
Works Agency, Annual Report, 1940, pp. 264-265, and are similar in most other years.
The Treasury data for 1940 are similar to and strongly correlated with the data reported in



Fishback and Kachanovskaya                  73
the Federal Works Agency Annual Report, 1940 , pp. 264-265. There are some
substantial differences between the Treasury and the Federal Works Agency report in
1941 (Federal Works Agency, Annual Report, 1941 pp. 247).
        The sources for Public Works Administration loans in fiscal years 1940 and 1941
are Federal Works Agency, First Annual Report, 1940. Washington, D.C.: Government
Printing Office, 1940, pp. 328-329 and Federal Works Agency, Second Annual Report,
1941. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1941, pp. 318-319. These were
loans on non-federal projects. Negative numbers means that bonds were cancelled in lieu
of payments.

Bureau of Reclamation
        One of the main questions to address is how to deal with the Spending on
construction of dams and irrigation projects by the Bureau of Reclamation. Technically,
all Bureau of Reclamation projects were interest-free loans to the users of the irrigation
works or the electric works associated with dams. However, the repayments on the loans
were generally delayed and in a number of cases the scheduled payments were pushed
back even further. This was particularly true during the 1930s. On some projects the
loans were forgiven. Thus, a case could be made that the Bureau of Reclamation
spending could be treated as similar to grants. Certainly, in terms of net flow of funds
they lie somewhere in between the non-repayable grants of the WPA and the loans with
repayment schedules. The OGR reports Bureau of Reclamation grant spending. These
estimates in most cases are pretty similar to estimates of construction costs reported
separately in the annual reports of the Bureau of Reclamation after the construction
spending for the Boulder Dam project (begun in fiscal year 1931), the All-American
Canal (begun in fiscal year 1935), and the Marshall Ford Dam (Mansfield after 1941 and
begun in fiscal year 1938) are added to the construction statistics listed in the Bureau of
Reclamation Annual Reports (see Bureau of Reclamation, Annual Reports for Fiscal
Year for the period 1921 through 1932) and Secretary of Interior Annual Reports for
Fiscal Year for the period 1933 through 1941.
        We constructed two different versions of the Bureau of Reclamation spending. In
one we used the OGR estimates of Bureau of Reclamation grant spending for fiscal years
1934 through 1939 and then added in estimates using the Bureau of Reclamation
Construction Spending for fiscal years 1930 through 1933 and 1940 and 1941 plus
construction spending for the Boulder Canyon Project, the All-American Canal and the
Marshall Ford Dam. These were added because it was clear from comparisons during
1934 through 1939 of the spending by state listed by the OGR and Reclamation Bureau
that those three projects were included in the OGR estimates but not the Reclamation
Bureau estimates. The Reclamation Bureau reported separate accounting for the Boulder
Canyon projects and the All-American Canal in their reports (Secretary of Interior 1933;
pp. 40-1; 1934, pp. 50-51; 1935, pp. 80-81; 1936, pp. 84-85; 1937, pp. 28-29; 1938, pp.
77-79; 1939, pp. 225-227; 1940, pp. 120-122; 1941, pp. 45-47).
        In a second set of estimates we used the Bureau of Reclamation Report estimates
of spending plus the spending on the Boulder Canyon Project, the All-American Canal
and the Marshal Ford Dam. We constructed estimates of Boulder Canyon spending from
the following material. For the fiscal years 1934 through 1940 the Reclamation Bureau
reported accounting summaries for the Boulder Canyon Project that showed an estimate



Fishback and Kachanovskaya                  74
of fixed capital under construction and also total cumulative disbursements by the fiscal
agents of the project. For Boulder Canyon the difference between the two cumulative
numbers was roughly $8 million out of around $60 million total in 1934 and 1935 and $3
million thereafter, for percentage differences of 13.6 in 1934, 9.3 in 1935, 5.6 in 1936,
3.3 in 1937, 2.7 in 1937, 2.3 in 1938, and 1.7 in 1939. The same figures were provided
for the All-American Canal from 1935 through 1940. The differences were 142,000 in
1935 and less than 850,000 thereafter with percentage differences of 6.3 in 1935, 12.3 in
1936, 5 in 1937, 2.6 in 1938, 2.3 in 1939 and 3 in 1940 (Secretary of the Interior 1934,
pp. 54-56; 1935, 84-87; 1936, 88-92; 1937, pp. 30-33; 1938, pp. 80-83; 1939, pp. 228-
231; 1940, pp. 123-126). For fiscal year 1941 we used the appropriations estimates
reported in Secretary of Interior 1941, pp. 32-33 for Boulder Canyon and listed on p. 557
in the U.S. Department of Treasury, Budget of the United States, 1942, printed in 1943 ).
For the Boulder Canyon Project, the Bureau of Reclamation (1932, p. 88 provided an
estimate of cumulative construction costs by the end of fiscal year 1932 of $21,745,004.
And information on expenditures in fiscal year 1931 suggests that roughly $5.5 million
was spent on constructing railroads, highways, Boulder City, and electric transmission
lines that year (about $3.1 million on railways, $300,000 on highways, $1.5 million on
transmission lines, and $600,000 on the initial parts of Boulder City (U.S. Bureau of
Reclamation. Boulder Canyon Project Final Reports: Part I: Introductory. Bulletin I.
General History and Project Description. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing
Office, 1948, pp. 84-85). To get an estimate of cumulative construction costs in 1933, we
subtracted the line item amount of $19,526,000 for the Boulder Canyon Project in the
Treasury report on expenditures of (Stat. Abstract, 1935, p. 170) from the 1934 estimate.
The spending for the All American Canal was allocated to California and the Boulder
Canyon project was split evenly between Arizona and Nevada because it sits astride their
border. The split seems to be the way the OGR also allocated the Boulder Canyon funds.
        For the Marshall Ford Dam for the years 1935 through 1939, we used the
estimates for the Bureau of Reclamation provided by the Office of Government Reports
for Texas. The Bureau of Reclamation reported no construction estimates for Texas
during the period and we had no separate information on the Marshall Ford dam prior to
1941. For 1941 we used a figure of $3 million that came from an appropriations request
by Roosevelt for Marshall Ford Dam in 1941. For 1940 we assumed a figure of $ 4
million based on the decline in annual spending between 1939 and 1941. Marshall Ford
Dam was allocated to Texas.

Rivers, Harbors, and Flood Control
         The Office of Government Reports offered estimates of spending on rivers and
harbors and flood control by the Army Corps of Engineers for the fiscal years 1933
through 1939. To push these estimates back to 1928 and forward to 1941 we examined
the reports of the Chief of Engineers, U.S. Army, Annual Report of the Chief of
Engineers for the years 1919 through 1941. The reports listed the net expenditures by
project from the Chief of Engineers budgets as well as separate estimates of net spending
from budgets provided under the National Industrial Recovery Act through the Public
Works Administration and from budgets provided by the Federal Emergency Relief Acts.
We found that a number of the state expenditures did not match up well for 1933;
therefore, we also created an alternative estimate for the rivers and harbors spending
based on the annual reports. Some projects were associated with multiple states, like the
various sub-districts of the Mississippi River and sub-districts of the Ohio River. In the
cases where we could identify specific locations within the sub-districts we used the
amounts spent in those locations to divide the spending between states. In situations
where specific information was not available we divided the expenditures based on rough
estimates of the mileage of the rivers measured with maps and rulers. In most of the
districts the spending was not divided by project for the following types of spending:
preliminary examinations and reports, plant allotments, preliminary examinations and
reports for flood control and plant allotments for flood control. For the first two we
distributed the spending on those categories across states based on the spending in the
district on the projects in the states in that year. For the third and fourth categories we
distributed the spending based on the state distribution of flood control projects. The
expenditures we use are net expenditures after net receipts from sales are subtracted. We
treated negative values as zeroes in this situation on the grounds that when the area had
negative net expenditures, they were not pulling money out of the area.
         The Mississippi River Commission covered the Mississippi River from the Head
of Passes at the end of the river as it flowed into the Gulf of Mexico to northern parts of
the river. For 1922 through 1940, the Mississippi River Commission information for
Rivers and Harbors spending by the Army Corps of Engineers was reported by district
and for specific spots where money was spent. We used a variety of maps, Wikipedia,


Fishback and Kachanovskaya                  76
and other sources on the internet to locate the specific spots reported and assigned the
expenditures to the states. These are the numbers that we used in the basic statistics with
and without negative numbers for the period 1922 through 1930. All funds contributed
by local levee districts and governments were excluded.


Splitting the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Loans between fiscal 1932 and
fiscal 1933.
We used information from Reconstruction Finance Corporation (1932x, pp. 3-4 and
1933x, pp. 8-9, 14-15). The RFC did not report the total loans by state for fiscal year
1932 or for fiscal year 1933 in their monthly and quarterly reports of 1932 and 1933.
They did report the number of borrowers by state for fiscal year 1932 for each category:
banks and trust companies, credit unions, building and loan association, insurance
companies, mortgage-loan companies, joint-stock land banks, livestock credit
corporations, agricultural credit corporations and railroads (including receivers). In the
1933 report they reported the cumulative number of borrowers in the categories above
plus the additional categories under the expanded range for the RFC after June 1932. The
added categories included Federal Land Banks, Federal Intermediate Credit Banks,
Regional Agricultural Credit Corporations, Self-liquidating projects, Financing of
Agricultural Commodities and Livestock, Relief and Work Relief, Loans on Preferred
Stock of Banks, and Purchases of Capital Notes and Debentures of Bonds. Using this
information we determined the number of borrowers (B32js) in each category (j) in each
state (s) as of June 30, 1932 (32) and the additional borrowers added in fiscal year 1933
(B33js). The two reports also reported the total loans in each category as of June 30, 1932
and June 30, 1933. From that information we determined the value of loans of loans in
each fiscal year for loans. We calculated the average loan size for each category of loan
(l32j)

        l32j = L32j/Σs B32js.

Σs is the summation sign over all states s.

To get an estimate of the amount of loans in state s in 1932 (EL32s) we multiplied the
number of borrowers in the state in each category (B32js) by the national average loan size
(l32j) and then summed across all categories.

EL32s = Σj l32j* B32js

We followed the same procedure for each state in 1933.

EL33s = Σj l33j* B33js

The proportion of loans in state s from February 2, 1932 to June 30, 1933 that was in
fiscal year 1932 (P32s) is then

P32s = EL32s/ (EL32s + EL33s).



Fishback and Kachanovskaya                    77
This was then multiplied by the reported amount of loans from the Office of Government
Reports to get the 1932 figure. The RFC reported Loans allotted, the amount disbursed,
the amount repaid, and the amount outstanding. The Office of Government Reports
appears to have used loans outstanding in their reports, so we used that definition here.


Agricultural Loans through Federal Land Banks 1917 through 1932, Emergency
Crop Loans, 1921-1932 and Farm Credit Administration (Federal Land Banks,
Land Bank Commissioner, Production Credit Associations, and Emergency Crop
and Feed Loans) from 1933 forward.

        Federal Land Bank Mortgage Loans through 1932. In 1917 12 Federal Land
Banks were organized and authorized to “extend long-term mortgage credit to farmers on
security of first mortgages on farm lands.” The loans could be made for a period from 5
to 40 years. The loans almost entirely were made through national farm loan association,
corporations charted under the 1917 act and organized by farmers on a cooperative basis.
The membership of the cooperatives was made up exclusively of borrowers from the
Federal land banks. The banks were organized on a cooperative bases because nearly all
of the stock was owned by the borrower-owned national farm loan associations. Each
bank was liable for its own bond issues and the bond issues of the 11 other Federal land
banks. As of 1930 the Federal Land Banks held about 12 percent of the farm mortgage
indebtedness in the U.S. The administration oversight of these banks was taken over by
the Farm Credit Administration in 1933 (Federal Farm Loan Board. Annual Report,
1930, pp. 2, 12). Interest rates on bank loans were limited to a maximum of 1 percent
over the interest rate at which the federal land bank sold its most recent issuance of
bonds. For example, in 1925 Federal Land Banks were marketing their bonds at 4.5
percent, which implied a maximum interest rate on the mortgages to farmers of 5.5
percent. Some of the larger banks charged on 5.25 percent (1925, p. 5).
        In May 1921 the Federal Land Banks resumed operation after a cessation of
lending that lasted roughly 15 months, which seemed to occur between the beginning of
December 1919 and the end of April 1921. The stoppage was a result of litigation over
the constitutionality of the Federal Farm Loan Board lending system established in 1917.
( pp. 2-3, Federal Farm Board. Fifth Annual Report of the Federal Farm Board, 1921.
Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1922).

        We collected information on the value of loans closed by the federal land banks
in each year from the Federal Farm Loan Board Annual Reports for the years 1918, pp.
25-27; 1919, pp. 25-27; 1920, p. 5; 1921, p. 12; 1922, p. 20; 1923, p. 21-22; 1924, p. 21-
22; 1925, pp. 27-28; 1926, p. 32; 1927, p. 71; 1928, p. 122; 1929, pp. 162, 163; 1930, pp.
121, 124, 1931, p. 124, 1932, p. 106-7. The reports reported the amounts loaned through
December 31, of the year of the report back through 1922. Between 1922 and 1928 only
the cumulative totals to December 31 were reported, so the annual amounts were based
on the change in the cumulative totals. From 1918 through 1921, the cumulative totals
through November 30 of the year was reported. In checking the data we discovered some
discrepancies in 1929 between the value of loans reported for that calendar year and the



Fishback and Kachanovskaya                 78
value determined by subtracting the 1928 cumulative total from the 1929 cumulative
total. Most were less than 5 percent but Georgia and Florida had sizeable discrepancies.
We used the 1929 calendar year reported values. (Fdldbk.xls). In the analysis we
converted the calendar year data to a fiscal year basis for year t by taking half of the
calendar amount in year t and half of the calendar year amount in year t-1.

       Farm Loan Board (1931, p. 121; 1929, p. 158; 1928, p. 116; ) showed that
roughly 60 to 66 percent of the amount of federal land bank loans closed in the calendar
years 1929 and 1931 were closed in the first half of the year. 53 percent in 1930,

        Joint Stock Land Bank Loans. The Annual Reports of the Federal Farm Loan
Board first reported loans granted by joint-stock land banks in 1923. The joint-stock land
bank loans were privately organized corporations chartered by the federal government to
provide farm loans. Interest rates on bank loans were limited to a maximum of 1 percent
over the interest rate at which the federal land bank sold its most recent issuance of
bonds. For example, in 1925 joint stock land banks were marketing their bonds at 4.5 to
5 percent, which implied a maximum interest rate on the mortgages to farmers of 5.5 to 6
percent (1925, p. 5).
        “Based on the results of actual experience, the board deems it wise not to charter
additional joint-stock land banks, except and unless it shall be shown by a careful survey
that there is a need for the bank and reasonable assurance of a profitable volume of
business and evidence that the financial responsibility and competency of the personnel
of the proposed organization will afford satisfactory and efficient operation. Such a bank
must function so as to insure conservatism in its lending activities and at the same time
accumulate legitimate profits to absorb necessary charges for expenses and still afford
reasonable dividends to stock holders.(1925, p. 8).” Between 1923 and 1926 the amounts
of loans granted from time of organization to October 31st of the year in question were
reported (1923, p. 29; 1924, pp. 29-30; 1925, p. 40; 1926, p. 45. From 1928 onward the
amounts closed from date of organization through December 31st of the year were
reported (1928, p. 122; 1929, p. 163; 1930, p. 125; 1931, pp. 125-127; and 1932, pp. 107-
109). In 1927 only the loans submitted for approval as collateral for bond issues were
reported (1927, p. 78). The same values were also reported for 1928 through 1931 (1928,
p. 141; 1929, p. 182 ; 1930, p.145 ; 1931, p. 146). To get a figure for the 1927 loans
closed, we multiplied the cumulative number of loans submitted for approval for
collateral in 1927 by the ratio in 1928 of the cumulative loans closed to the cumulative
loans submitted for approval as collateral in that year for each state. This estimate is
likely to be a good estimate because in 1928 the ratio of loans closed to loans submitted
for approval as collateral ranged from .978 in Tennessee to 1.115 in California with an
average of 1.043 and a standard deviation of 0.047. The ratios in 1929 for each state
were close to the same, as the ratio of the ratio in 1928 to the ratio in 1929 was within
one percent of one in all but two states. In 1929 the change in cumulative loans was
negative for Missouri, and we inserted the annual amount reported on p. 162 in the
volume. In 1931 the change in the cumulative total of loans was negative for Ohio and
Pennsylvania. We inserted the annual amount reported on p. 124 in the 1931 volume
instead. In general, we used the change in the cumulative amounts rather than the




Fishback and Kachanovskaya                 79
reported annual amounts because only the cumulative amounts were reported in the
earlier years.

        Emergency Crop and Feed Loans through 1932. Congress made funds available
for emergency crop production and seed loans in several different years between 1921-
1932 under special appropriations. We also had precise information on the distribution
across states of the funds in 1922 (Agriculture Yearbook, 1922, p. 51; 1923, p. 120) and
in 1924 (Yearbook of Agriculture, 1924, p. 91). We had information on the states that
received the emergency loans in 1921, 1929, and 1930. Using the information from the
total distribution of loans over the period 1921 through 1930 (FCA, 1933, pp. 115-117),
we could do a reasonable job of figuring out the distribution of loans across states within
those years (see fca3337.xls and fca3841.xls). There were loans in 1921 of $1,935,125
and in 1922 of 1,481,988. An Act of March 3, 1921 allowed for $1,954,929 in seed-grain
loans to Montana, North Dakota, Idaho, and Washington. An Act of March 20, 1922
authorized lending of $1,481,988 seed-grain loans in crop-failure areas for the crop of
1922. The loans were for $24,685 in Idaho, $756,213 in Montana, $661,548 in North
Dakota, $37,812 in South Dakota, and $1,730 in Washington (Agriculture Yearbook,
1922, p. 51; 1923, p. 120). USDA financial statements from 1924 report appropriations
of $1 million for seed and farm loans to farmers in New Mexico (Yearbook of
Agriculture, 1924, p. 91). The total loans reported for 1921-1930 to New Mexico in
FCA, 1933, pp. 115-117 were $433,849, so we believe that was the amount spent in
1924. The USDA financial statement in 1926 included $22,560 in seed grain loans
(Yearbook of Agriculture,1926, p. 121). At some point between 1921 and 1930 there
was another distribution of loans in the range of $1.6 million, but we have not found the
description of that loan distribution. It likely occurred in 1927. In 1929 Congress made
available $6 million for the USDA to make emergency loans to farmers for seed, feed,
and fertilizer. About $5.5 million was loaned in Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Alabama, Georgia and Florida for staple crops. About $200,000 was loaned in
southern Florida on vegetables. By June 30, 1930 about $4.6 million had been repaid. In
spring 1930 under the first deficiency act of March 26, 1930, loans were made to other
farmers in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia and Florida and
crop financing was aided in Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma, New Mexico,
Minnesota, North Dakota and Montana. Except in the Southeastern states and in North
Dakota and Montana, however, the amounts loaned were negligible. The total spring
loans amounted to $4,612,136. In August and September roughly $500,000 was loaned
in Florida on winter vegetables and another $170,000 was loaned on fall pasture crops in
Alabama, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Virginia (Yearbook of Agriculture, 1931, pp. 5, 6).
        We had precise information on the distribution of the emergency crop and feed
loans made during the calendar year for 1931 and 1932 from the annual reports of the
Federal Credit Administration (First, 1933, pp. 115-117). The 1932 loans were made
from funds provided by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation but were administered
by the Federal Farm Bureau of Loans and were reported there and not in the RFC reports.
Roughly $120 million was advanced in 1931 and 1932. Although reported on a calendar
year basis, nearly all of the loans, with the exception of late loans were made prior to July
1 of each year. In nearly all cases the fiscal year value and the calendar year value were




Fishback and Kachanovskaya                   80
similar. Where they were not, we subtracted the loan values in fall year t from the year t
calendar value and added it to the year t+1 value.

        Farm Credit Administration from 1933 onward. The Farm Credit Administration
was created in 1933 and the duties of various farm loan activities were merged into its
administrative realm. The FCA continued the Federal Land Banks. A new program
under the Land Bank Commissioner was authorized under the Emergency Farm
Mortgage Act of 1933 with a fund of $200 million. The funds were used to refinance
indebtedness, for providing working capital for farm operations, and for enabling farmers
to redeem or repurchase property which has been foreclosed since July 1, 1931. The
loans were granted on security of first or second mortgages on land and permanent
improvements. The maximum amount of loans per farmer was to be $5,000 with no
indebtedness to exceed 75 percent of the appraised normal value of the property. These
loans were focused on farmers who could not obtain Federal land bank financing ( Farm
Credit Administration, First Annual Report, 1933, p. 10).

        FCA Federal Land Bank and Land Bank Commissioner Loans. Federal Land
Bank and Land Bank Commissioner Loans made during the calendar year were reported
in the Farm Credit Administration Reports (First, 1933, pp. 78-79; Second, 1934, pp. 91-
92; Third, 1935, pp. 119-120; Fourth, 1936, pp. 115-116; Fifth, 1937, pp. 113-114;
Sixth, 1938, pp. 187-9; Seventh, 1939, pp. 138-139; Eighth, 1940, pp. 155-156; Ninth,
1941, pp. 145-146). The FCA annual report provided information on the number of
loans closed by the Federal Land Banks and Land Bank Commissioner during the 11
months through November 1933. However, 59.5 percent of the loans closed in the full
calendar year of 1933 were closed in December of 1933( Farm Credit Administration
First Annual Report, 1933, p. 7). Therefore, we multiplied each figure by 1.6809 to
determine the total loans for the calendar year. Thus, we are assuming that the
percentage of loans in each state was the same in December as it had been in the first 11
months of the year.
        FCA Production Credit Division. The crop production loans made during the
calendar year were reported in the Farm Credit Administration Reports, (First, 1933, pp.
118-119; Second, 1934, pp. 152-154; Third, 1935, pp. 133-134; Fourth, 1936, pp. 136-
137; Fifth, 1937, pp. 136-137; Sixth, 1938, pp. 187-9; Seventh, 1939, pp. 165-166;
Eighth, 1940, pp. 201-202; Ninth, 1941, 189-191). The Farm Credit Act of 1933 also
created the Production Credit Division, a system of cooperative credit institutions
chartered by the Farm Credit Administration and operating under rules set up by 12
Production Credit Corporations (PCC), one in each Federal land bank city. The local
associations made loans directly and were capitalized partly by the production credit
corporations and partly by the borrowers. They could borrow and rediscount with the
Federal intermediate credit banks. The PCCs provided part of the capital for the loans
and set the regulations. Their initial capital stock of $7.5 million each was subscribed by
the Governor of the FCA, and the Governor could raise and lower the capital stock. The
funds of the PCCs were not loaned directly to farmers but provided paid-in capital for the
creation of the PCCs. Production Credit Associations (PCAs) could be organized by 10
or more farmer-borrowers after a meeting of interested farmers living in the territory to
be served. As of December 31, 1933 there were 322 PCAs, each with a specified



Fishback and Kachanovskaya                  81
territory. Class A stock in the PCAs was nonvoting but preferred upon liquidation and
was purchased primarily by PCCs but could be bought by private investors. The Farm
Credit Act called for the value of Class A stock to be roughly 20 percent of the volume of
loans. Class B stock was purchased primarily by farmer-borrowers and was paid in as
loans were made. Each borrower was required through the local PCA to own class B
stock equal to 5 percent of the value of his loan. Each Class B stock holder had one vote.
The PCAs could rediscount loans in an amount equal to about 5 times their paid-in
capital. When the rediscounts were equal to 5 times paid-in capital, the PCCs could
provide added capital by purchasing more Class A stock. The plan was to have one-
fourth of the capital stock be owned by borrowers as Class B stock, and the rest as class
A stock owned by the PCCS (FCA, First Annual Report, 1933, pub. 1934, pp. 33-36). In
1933 the state distribution for loans by the PCAs was reported only through November
31st of the year. However, the total for the entire period from January 1 through Dec. 31
was very close to the amount reported through November 1933 (see FCA, First Annual
Report, p. 2 and pp. 119-120). Therefore, we used the total through November for each
state.

         FCA Emergency Crop and Feed Loans. The administration of the original
emergency crop and feed loans made by Congressional appropriation was transferred to
the FCA. In 1933 $90 million was authorized for loans to purchase feed, finance crop
production, and cover the costs of administering the loans. Security on the loans was a
first lien on the crop to be harvested and/or livestock fed. The 1933 maximum for each
feed loan was $250, the individual maximum for crop production purposes was $300 and
the maximum that could be advanced to all tenants of any one landlord was $2,000 (
FCA, First Annual Report, 1933, pub. 1934, pp. 51-52). We had precise information on
the distribution of the emergency crop and feed loans made during the calendar year for
each year from 1931 through 1941 from the annual reports of the Federal Credit
Administration (First, 1933, pp. 115-117; Second, 1934, pp. 168-170; Third, 1935, pp.
155-157; Fourth, 1936, pp. 165-167; Fifth, 1937, pp. 174-6; Sixth, 1938, pp. 187-9;
Seventh, 1939, pp. 205-207; Eighth, 1940, pp. 232-234; Ninth, 1941, 221-223).

        FCA Drought Relief Loans. In 1934 and 1935 the Farm Credit Administration
passed out Drought Relief Loans authorized by a Congressional Act approved June 19l,
1934. Congress appropriated $525 million for relief in agricultural areas seriously
affected by drought. Of that amount the FCA was allocated $96,785,000 to make loans
to farmers of purchase of seed and feed, summer fallowing, and similar purposes. The
Emergency Crop and Feed Loan Section administered the loans. The first loans were
disbursed on July 3, 1934 and were made continuously until June 30, 1935 when the
appropriation expired. The loans were made principally to care for cattle and other
livestock in the drought areas. They were made on “extremely liberal” terms, based on a
borrower’s unsecured not and on a nondisturbance agreement to expire at the end of
1935, executed by all holders of liens and other livestock to be fed. The borrower could
not increase the lien without permission of the FCA Governor. Most were made at 5.5
percent interst. Loans were also made for orchard rehabilitation in Washington, citrus
rehabilitation and truck loans related to a freeze in Florida, and strawberry loans. (FCA
Third Annual Report, 1935, pp. 75-76). The drought relief loans made during the fiscal



Fishback and Kachanovskaya                 82
year 1934-1935 are reported in (FCA Third Annual Report, 1935, pp. 158). We can
separate them into calendar year loans using information on the loans made during the
fiscal year 1934 in FCA, Second Annual Report, 1934, p. 168).

The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) loans from the Office of Government Reports
do not match up well at all with CCC loan information reported for 1939, 1940, and
1941. One problem in the OGR reports is there is missing information for 1934. On
many state sheets they say that the state by state loans are not available, but then the OGR
reports CCC loans for Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri,
Nebraska, and South Dakota. In the 1939 state by state report from Department of
Agriculture (Agriculture Statistics, 1940, p. 632), the cumulative numbers for 1933
through 1939 don’t match the cumulative numbers from the OGR, in part because of the
missing 1934 data in many states. However, the numbers are substantially different for
the states where the OGR did report the 1934 numbers. Also in the Agricultural statistics
for 1939, they state that approximately $159 million in loans were not included because
they went to cooperative associations. The CCC numbers are so problematic that we
removed them from the analysis.

Moat Areas for Instrument Using Spending Outside Region

        When constructing one of the instrumental variables, we used a measure of
federal grant spending in the area outside an geographic “moat” around the state of
interest. The moat includes the state’s census region (of 9) and nearby census regions to
avoid spatial correlation with the error term from potential spillovers. For New England,
for example, the moat includes any states in New England, the Mid-Atlantic, the East
North Central, or the states of Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, or West Virginia; therefore,
the component of federal spending for the instrument for that state is based on federal
spending outside that moat.For the Mid-Atlantic states the area used for the instrument
does not include any states from New England, the Mid-Atlantic, the East North Central,
the South Atlantic, or the states of Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. The area used for the
instrument for the East North Central states does not include any states from the Mid-
Atlantic, the East North Central, the West North Central, or the states of Alabama,
Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, or West Virginia. The area used for the instrument for the
West North Central states does not include any states from the East North Central, the
West North Central, the East South Central, the West South Central, and the Mountain
States. The area used for the instrument for the South Atlantic states does not include
any states from the Mid-Atlantic, the South Atlantic, the East North Central, the East
South Central, or the West South Central. The area used for the instrument for the East
South Central does not include any states from the Mid-Atlantic, the South Atlantic, the
East North Central, the East South Central, the West South Central, or the states of Iowa,
Kansas, Missouri, or Nebraska. The area used for the instrument for the West South
Central states does not include any states from the East North Central, the West North
Central, the East South Central, the West South Central, or Mountain regions. The area
used for the instrument for the Mountain states does not include any states from the West



Fishback and Kachanovskaya                  83
North Central, the West South Central, the Mountain, or the Pacific regions. The area
used for the instrument for the Pacific states does not include any states from the
Mountain and Pacific regions or the states of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, North and South
Dakota, and Nebraska.
