     The model developed in this paper is a model of internal non-
price competition among members of a cooperative firm. Members take
price arid income distribution method as given, but perceive a posi-

tive relationship between their own production of quality and the
flow of consumers to them, when constrained by demand. At an
internal Nash equilibrium, each member may be producing too much'
quality, yet will not reduce production for fear of losing
customers. In this paper, the fOCUS is on the           price   and income
distribution method, which serve as an incentive mechanism for
coordinating behavior. An unusual feature of this model is the
switching behavior generated as members of the firm move form the
unconstrained to the constrained regime. This feature is

incorporated for empirical testing by specifying the model to be
estimated as a spline function. The empirical testing is possible
due to the existence of a unique data set for American medical group

practice.
     The estimation results of this study confirm the hypotheses of
switching behavior and a positive relationship between price and the
strength of the   link   between reward and productivity. This provides
strong evidence to support the      contention    that internal non-price
competition is present in cooperative service firms, and that it
increases as members' rewards are linked more closely with their own

productivity.

I. Introduction

     Recent work on the theory of the firm has emphasized the importance of

internal organization of the firm and the accompanying structure of

incentives (e.g., Williamson, 1975; Aichian and Demsetz, 1972; Marschak and

Radner, 1972). In order to highlight and isolate the nature of internal

organization and incentives, this paper studies the cooperative firm. In

the cooperative firm all members are claimants to the residual, and thus

the incentive effects of alternative forms of organization are highlighted.

     Past studies of the cooperative firm have emphasized the negative

incentive effects of equal sharing of group net income (e.g., Sen, 1966;

Meade, 1974; Carson, 1977). The less that rewards are linked to

performance, the less efficient will be the co1lectve outcome. It is not

necessary, however, that this result always obtain. In the case where non—

price competition exists between members of the firm,   it has been shown
that stronger links between reward and individual action can lead to

outcomes which are non—optimal from the point of view of the group (Gaynor;

1983, 1984). This paper develops a model of firm behavior in the face of

internal non—price competition and tests it for the case of U.S. medical

group practice. The results paint a quite different picture of the

behavior of the cooperative firm and U.S. medical group practices than the

literature in either area has presented in the past.

     The literature on cooperatives and on medical groups has mainly

focused on the production and cost inefficiencies present in these groups

due to lack of proper incentives in the member reimbursement system. The

early papers on co—ops, such as Ward (1958), Domar (1966), and Sen (1966),

recognized the problem of shirking in such a context. Sen (1966) had
                                                                          2




formulated a model of the effect of income distribution on labor supply in

an agricultural cooperative and recognized the problem of shirking present

in such a context. The later literature on co—ops is in the same vein,

thus non—price competition within the firm never appears. The empirical

part of this literature is restricted almost entirely to the Yugoslav

labor—managed firms or to other firms which are labor, but not

producer/seller, cooperatives and thus never needs deal with the issue of

non—price competition.

     There are a few papers which deal with pricing or income distribution

behavior in seller cooperatives located in market economies. These

cooperatives are typically service firms, such as medical or legal groups,

formed because of indivisibilities in inputs or stochastic or lumpy

demand. Sloan (1974) postulates a theoretical model of a profit—maximizing

physician who sets price independent of the group. The only collective

aspect of this model is in cost. Scheffler (1975) constructs an empirical

model and estimates it on data obtained from a survey of medical groups in

North Carolina. The salient finding is that groups with a non—salaried

system of remuneration set lower prices. Presumably this is because non—

salaried groups have a closer link between income and productivity, which

leads to greater efficiency, and, thus, lower prices. This is not

necessarily the case, however, due to the lack of precision with which the

link between income and productivity is measured, lack of control of

market—level determinants of price, and the small sample size of 61

physicians. Leibowitz and Tollison (1980) conducted a study of legal group

practices in which they attempted to determine whether team production of

legal services is efficient relative to solo production. Their results are
                                                                           3



consistent with efficiency in team production, but they have no measure of

income distribution method, only cost, size, and general organizational

measures.



II. The Model

     The model developed in this paper is a model of internal non—price

competition among members of a cooperative firm. Members take price and

income distribution method as given, but perceive a positive relationship

between their own production of quality and the flow of consumers to them,

when constrained by demand. At an internal Nash equilibrium, each member

may be producing "too much" quality, yet will not reduce production for

fear of losing customers. The literature on non=-price competition under

regulation running from White (1972), to Vanderweide and Zalkind (1981),

contains models which are similar, yet differ because they examine the

behavior of firms in an industry, not individual members within a firm. In

this paper, the focus is on the price and income distribution method which

serve as an incentive mechanism for coordinating behavior.



     A. Members

     Individual members of the firm maximize a utility function assumed to

be linear in income and strongly separable in the members' actions, which

are production levels of quantity and quality. The utility function is

     u1 =   y — V(q1,   zj, T)   i = 1, ..., n                           (1)

where I is the index for the a members of the firm, u is utility, y is

income, q is quantity, z is quality, and V is the function transforming

i's actions into a real, nonmonetary, cost. V1(q, z1, T) is the member's
                                                                           4




"cost function," measured in terms of disutility. T is a factor assumed to

have a positive effect on cost. The utility function is assumed to be

strictly concave, differentiable, increasing, and to take on value zero

when all its arguments are zero.

     Firm members derive income only from their activities with the firm,

and that income is equal to a share of the revenue they generate plus a

share from a firm level revenue—sharing pool.1 Therefore, member i's

income is expressed as



         = aPq. + — (1 —   a) Pq.,     0 < a < 1                          (2)




where a is the proportion of i's revenue "kept" by i and P is the price

charged by the firm for q1, a unit of its output. The member views P as

invariant with respect to its actions.2 The first term in (2) is the

member's share of its "own" revenue, the second term is the share from the

revenue—sharing pooi.




     'It is assumed that the only inputs to production are supplied by co-
op members, and therefore there is no pecuniary cost of production. This
is not a critical assumption, since all results follow through without it,
but it does simplify the exposition considerably. For the case of
services, this is reasonably realistic anyway.

     2One can describe this as pure price—taking behavior, or else think of
a process in which all members set a price collectively, after which it is
regarded as a fixed by all. The latter process may be more realistic, but
operationally amounts to the same thing.
                                                                           5




     Each member perceives a demand function by which they are inexactly

constrained,3 so



      q. < f(P,z.,z.,n),                                                  (3)




where z. is the vector of quality levels produced by all other n — 1

members of the firm j      1. Economic considerations suggest that demand for

a member's output decrease if firm price is increased, that a member's

demand increase as his product quality increases, decrease with others'

quality, and decrease as additional members enter the firm. These

considerations imply



      f1 < 0,      > 0, f3 < 0, f4 < 0,



where a subscript k indicates the first partial derivative with respect to

the kth argument. f is called the member's "perceived" demand function

because, due to the assumptions of price—taking and Cournot—Nash behavior,

the member sees P, z., and n as fixed. When the other variables are

allowed to change as z1 changes, f gives true, or actual, deniand.4 Since

price is fixed for the member when the demand constraint is binding, his




     3mis implies no inventories. In the case of a service firm
inventories are impossible. Shortages are possible since members could
always manage to see fewer customers than are scheduled for them in any
given time period.

only choice variable is quality, which also determines quantity through

(3).

       Further, each member is constrained to produce a certain minimum                            level
of quality either by group requirements, peer pressure, or the legal

system, SO Zj

       Given the model outlined above, a member's objective is to choose

quantity, q, and quality, z1, to maximize the Kuhn—Tucker objective

function



       K.       aPq + 1 (1 —                Pq
                                                 —   V.(q.,       z1 T)



                —          —                                  —
                    X(q1       F(P, z, z., n)) —     .i(z          zmi).                           (4)




Each member maximizes K under the assumption that all other members'

decisions (q., z.,) are invariant with respect to changes in                              and z and

taking P and n as fixed. The first order conditions are5



        [a +    1   (1 — a)JP —        —A   = 0,                                                   (5)




                                                                                                   (6)



            —
                f(P,   z1, z., n) < 0, A > 0, A[q1 —              f(P,    z1, z.,   nfl   =   0,   (7)




     5These are necessary and sufficient Kuhn—Tucker conditions for a
global maximum, since the objective function is strictly concave and the
constraint convex.
                                                                                7




      z —       z.    > 0, i > 0,        —
                                             z]   =   0.                       (8)




     The demand constraint multiplier, A, is interpreted as the effect of a

change in quantity demanded on income,



      A =   [a         (1 — cz)]P.




When the demand constraint is binding, A is positive, and thus the first

order condition in equation (5) drops out. When the demand constraint is

binding, the member does not choose quantity explicitly, but rather,

implicitly, through the choice of quality, z.

     When the member is not bound by the demand constraint, A          0, and thus

(5) corresponds to the standard interpretation of producing where marginal

revenue equals marginal cost. The choice of quality is then bound by the

minimum, Zmin        since   producing more quality to shift the demand constraint

has no payoff for the member. Equation (6) reduces to

     —vi2
            —
                p =   0,
where p is the effect on i's income of an increase in the minimum quality

level. In this case quantity is the choice variable, not quality, since

the quality constraint is binding.6




     6While it is possible that both the demand and quality constraints are
binding simultaneously, this case is of little interest, since then the
member has no choice.
                                                                          8




     Evaluated across al,members of the firm, equations (5) through (8)

define an equilibrium for the members of the firm.7 The solution to this

system defines a member's equilibrium production of quantity and quality as

functions of group price, income distribution method, and group size,

                h1(P, a, n, T)           if A = 0.


Implicit differentiation of the system (5) through (8) yields comparative

static derivatives which reveal the character of gj and h under the two

separate regimes where the demand constraint is binding or free. Table 1

displays these results, which are developed in detail in the Appendix.

     When the demand constraint is free, quantity is the choice variable.

Increases in price or increases in the retention of private earnings lead

to an increased supply of quantity, since both increase the marginal

revenue realized from quality production. An increase in group size will

reduce the supply because more members take shares of i's revenue. The

results are the same when the demand constraint is binding, except that, in




     7Given the mathematical assumptions made, the first—order conditions
are necessary and sufficient for an optimum, so the solution to (5) — (8)
exists, is unique, and is differentiable over any one regime.

quality



     B. The Firm

     The firm    controls     P and , the price and incentive scheme variables,

and sets them in order to maximize group welfare,



      w =        u. =        —
                        PQ
                                       V(q.,z).                                        (11)




This is assumed to be an unweighted sum of individual members' utilities.

In effect, W amounts to "non—monetary" profit, or a standard profit measure

net of non—monetary costs.9

     The members' supply functions are constraints on the group's choices

with the form,


                                 n      *
      Z =H(P,a,n, T) =                      =         h1(P,a,n, T), when A > 0          (12)
                                       z1
                                 i=1            1=1


      Q = G(P,c,n, T) =                q'   =         g(P,z,n), when A = 0.             (13)




     81f we assume that the demand function is of form q =                    zPg(n)   as in


VanderWeide and Zalkind (1981), then -j- is positive.




     91n an economy where markets for all claims exist, non-monetary costs
would find monetary expression as opportunity costs, and there would be no
difference between W and standard profits.
                                                                           11




The firm faces a demand function for quantity of its output which depends

in the standard way on its price, its quality, other firms' prices, other

firms' qualities, and the number of firms in the market. The demand

function is



      Q = F(P,Z,P,Z,m,X),                                               (14)



where P and Z are vectors of prices and qualities, respectively, of other

firms in the market, m is the number of firms, and X is an exogenous factor

which is assumed to have a positive effect on demand. We assume Cournot—
                               © ©
Nash behavior by all firms, so P, Z and m are taken as fixed by any firm

with respect to its actions. F has the characteristics that increases in

own price decrease demand, F is increasing and concave, other prices are

positively related to demand, and other firms' quality affects demand

negatively, as does entry,



      F1 < 0, F2 > 0, F22 < 0, F3 > 0, F4 < 0, P5 < 0, F6 > 0.



All other firms in the market face the same demand function, so demand is
             10
symmetric.

     When members are not bound by the demand constraint the group's

problem is




     101f each firm has the same distribution of member disutility types
(V17s), then they have identical "cost" functions, and the resulting Nash
equilibrium will be symmetric.

The first order conditions are



               Q — AF1 -            =   0,                                            (16)

                1=1



A, the demand constraint multiplier, is interpreted as the effect of a

change in quantity demanded on group welfare. The member supply constraint

multiplier, p, gives the effect of a change in quantity supplied on group

welfare. In equation (16), Q — AF1 corresponds to marginal (welfare)

revenue, and i           g1 corresponds to marginal (welfare) cost. In



equation (17), i           g2 is the marginal effect on group welfare of

changing a. In effect, this means that the firm sets price so that profits

are maximized, and then sets a so that members will be induced to produce

the quantity demanded at the profit maximizing price.

       When the constraint is binding, the memberts problem is


max                                     n
P,a PF(P,H(P,cz,n),P,Z,m,X) —               V.(f(P,h.(P,a,n, T),z.n),h.(P,cz,n, T)). (18)

       The first—order conditions for the firm's choice of price and sharing

system which maximize (11) subject to (12) and (14) are
                                                                            13




          =   Q   ÷ PF1 + PF2H1 —         ÷ V1f2h.1 ÷ V2h.11 = 0,        (19)



and

              PF2H2       [V1f2h2                                        (20)




This is a unique, global optimum, given all the assumptions on the relevant

functions which make the firm's welfare function strictly concave in P

and a, twice differentiable, and take the value zero when either P

and a equal zero. Evaluated at all firms' P and a, this is a Nash

equilibrium, and if costs as well as demand are symmetric, then the

equilibrium is symmetric as well (Schmalensee, 1977; VanderWeide and

Zalkind, 1981).

      As before, the firm sets price to maximize profit, and a to induce

members to produce the optimal amount of quality. The difference here is

that there are feedback effects from the members' supply function of

quality through demand, due to the fact that members are constrained and

thus produce quality above the minimum. Thus, in (19), marginal revenue

(Q + PF1 + PF2H1) includes the effect on revenue of a change in quality

supply caused by a change in price changing demand (PF2111). The summation

terms in (19) represent marginal cost and include the effects of increased

quality production on costs (       [v1f2h11 + V2h.1]). Equation (20) includes

only terms which reflect feedbacks from members' quality supply function.

The first term in (20) gives the marginal revenue effect of additional

quality production induced by an increase in the sharing rate. The
                                                                                   14



summation terms are the marginal cost of the additional quality production

induced by an increase in the group's sharing rate.



III. Specification of the Empirical Model

     The previous sections outlined a model of price and income

distribution determination for a co—operative firm where members engage in

non—price competition. The purpose of this section is to outline a method

for generating and testing the predictions of the model via econometric

estimation. The type of function to be estimated, and its form, will also

be examined. In addition, the types of variables to be used in estimation

will be examined.

     In order to generate some testable hypotheses, let us first define the

"efficient price locus." The efficient price locus gives an optimal price

for the group for any given combination of group size, exogenous demand and

cost shifters, and group sharing rate. It is defined by the first order

conditions for price setting laid out in the last section,



      Q + (P —
                      Vii)(Fi     —            = 0,                              (16)




when the constraint is free, and



                  +           —            +              +             =   0,
      Q +
            PF1       PF2H1       [V.1f1       V.1f2h.1       V.2h.1]            (19)



when it is binding. Equations (16) and (19) define two different efficient

price functions,
                                                                                  15




          *     1
         P =   P (a,n,X,T),                                                     (21)




and



          *
         P = P2 (a,n,X,T),                                                     (22)



respectively. The          comparative   static properties of P1 and P2 are derived

in the Appendix, Part C and displayed in Table 2. In the unconstrained

regime where P1 is the efficient price function, a and P move in opposite

directions, since an increase in a leads members to produce more and thus

decrease the optimal price. When members are constrained, an increase

in a induces them to produce more quality, thus increasing the optimal
                       -


price.

      Whether firm members are constrained or not depends on the value

of a, since higher levels of a induce higher levels of production, thus

moving members toward the constraint as a increases. When a is at its

minimum (a =    0),   members will be unconstrained by demand. To see this,

compare the member's first—order condition determining his utility

maximizing output (5) with the condition which determines the level of

output for the member which would maximize group welfare (23):



      [a +      (1 — a)JP —         = 0,                                        (5)




      P +                   = 0.                                               (23)

          T   -

When a    = 0,   the member may     produce   less than the quantity dictated by (23),

if the second term in (23) is less than (1                   n)• In other words, the

member will produce too little unless the demand curve is very steep.

As a increases, members increase production and move towards the demand

constraint. When a = 1, (5) is P —                   = 0,    and the member will want to

produce "too much." Therefore, at some a < 1, members hit the demand

constraint. Before that,                < 0, and after that,           > 0.

        The behavior being described can effectively be summarized

mathematically by using a spline function. A spline function is a function

with distinct pieces which are themselves continuous functions (see

Poirier; 1976 for a thorough exposition on this topic) In the case where

there are only two pieces (as predicted by the theory), and those pieces

are linear, the relationship to be estimated is



           =         + 8a. + 3(a        —
                                            )D   ÷          + 85X. ÷ 86T +
                                                                              c,     (24)

                 r
        D= [         0 otherwise

     Or course, a, the sharing rate, while being treated as an independent

variable in this exposition, is not exogenous. It is set by the group and

will vary when the truly exogenous variables themselves vary, a is set so

that the first—order conditions for a welfare maximum of the group are

met. These are equations (17) and (20) from section II. The directions of

the effects of changes in the exogenous variables on the optimal sharing
                                                                                18




rate are derived in section B of the Appendix. Table 3 presents the

results. When group size (n) increases, the group optimally increases ci if

members are not bound by the demand constraint in order to counteract the

increased disincentive effects on supply. If the demand constraint is

binding, however, an increase in group size does some of the work of

keeping members from oversupplying quality, and thus the sharing rate must

be reduced.

     When X increases, demand increases. Whether the members are bound or

not by the demand constraint, the group must induce greater production to

meet the increased demand, and thus, must increase ci.

     Increases in T cause costs to rise. When      the   demand constraint is

slack, optimal price rises and optimal quantity falls. Therefore, the firm

must cut ci to counteract the positive effect of the price increase on

member supply. Of course, oversupply is not physically possible in the

case of a service, but it Is certainly better to have incentives for

optimal behavior rather than not. When physicians face a binding demand

constraint, the optimal action for the firm   is   to increase the sharing

rate. This is because at the old ci and the new, higher price, members will

cut back too much in response to the shift in costs, since price increases

by less than marginal cost, and ci is less than one. Thus, at the old a and

new price members are not getting the right signals, and ci must be

increased.

    All of this discussion indicates that the most appropriate method of

estimation to test these hypotheses is by two—stage least squares. The

efficient price locus is the function to be estimated, and one of its

independent variables, the sharing rate, is clearly endogenous.



V. Data

     The data utilized for this study were assembled by Mathematica Policy

Research, Inc., under contract to the National Center for Health Services

Research, Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Government. The

bulk of the data set is composed of surveys conducted by Mathematica,

although some secondary data sources have been merged in. During the

period March to June of 1978, Mathematica conducted a nationwide survey of

medical group practices. The final sample included 957 groups and 6353

physicians practicing in those groups. The sample was stratified by:

group size, type of group (multispecialty or single specialty), physician

specialty, and prepaid vs. fee—for—service. Large group practices were

oversampled in an effort to supply a reasonable number of observations, and

a census was taken of pre—paid groups, for the same purpose. Further, only

five medical practice specialties were sampled: general practice, internal

medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, and obstetrics/gynecology.

Approximately 60 percent of all office—based physicians practice in these

specialties.

     Since surveys tend to produce low response rates, Mathematica

conducted analysis for nonresponse bias on their data. Examining each of

the survey instruments and using statistical techniques (e.g., the Heckman

Technique) Mathematica concluded that nonresponse bias was not a problem to

be faced in the utilization of the data set for purposes of statistical

analysis.
                                                                           21




     This data set also includes data measuring characteristics of the area

in which the group practiced and data on the hospital with which the group

is affiliated. The data on area characteristics were obtained from many

sources, including the American Medical Association, the County and City

Data Book, and various other sources. For a full listing of all these data

sources see Boldin, Carcagno, Held, Jamieson, and Wooldridge (1979). The

hospital data were obtained from the American Hospital Association Guide

tape for 1978.

     This data set is currently the most complete and comprehensive of its

kind in the U.S., and as such is appropriate for the empirical analysis

conducted in this paper.



V. Estimation

     In this section we first translate the theoretical variables into

variables from the data set, then present some summary statistics, and

finally the estimation results. The unit of output is a first—time office

visit to a physician. The acronyms and definitions of the variables used

in estimation are reported in Table 4.

     Since the true full price (P) for an office visit includes not just

money price but also measures of time cost, measures of waiting time

(OFFWAIT and APPTWAIT) are included along with the money price (PRICE).

Waiting time is not exogenous, so OFFWAIT and APPTWAIT must be treated as

endogenous variables.

     Some standard exogenous demand shifters CX) such as measures of income

(PCAPINC and LOWINC) and cost of living (RENT) are included, along with

some others specific to the medical care sector or data set. MDPOP and
                                                                                22

MDENS are variables aimed at controlling for the observed positive

correlation between fees and physicians per capita, and the Pauly—

Satterthwaite (1980) increasing monopoly model, respectively. The

increasing monopoly model proposes that increasing physician density makes

information gathering more difficult for consumers. This leads to less

elastic demand and a higher price. In addition, anything which makes

information gathering more difficult is expected to lead to a higher

price. MDPOP should then have a negative or negligible effect.

     Also associated with the increasing monopoly model are variables which

serve as proxies for consumers' ease in gathering information. FEMHEAD and

PCTNOVED are hypothesized to make information gathering more difficult and

EDUCATE to make it easier.

     Since the number of physicians in an area is in reality endogenous,

variables representing attractiveness characteristics of the area should

have an effect on MDPOP and MDENS. These are: PUBTRANS, PCTURBAN,

ARPRICE, GOVSPEND, and PCTPROF.

     PRODSCAL (a) and DUMDIFF5 are the measures of a and     —   *)    from

equation (24). GRPSIZE is expected to have a positive effect on price.

DIJMGRP picks up the break in the effect of GRPSIZE on PRODSCAL. MANAGER

and PRODGDLN should help explain the group's choice of PRODSCAL, which is

endogenous. The specialty dummy variables IN, GP, OB and GS are intended

to pick up the variation in price across medical specialties. WAGERN is an

exogenous variable expected to increase group costs, and thus, price.

DUMWAGE picks up the expected break in the effect of WAGERN on PRODSCAL.

     Table 5 presents the means and standard deviations of all the

variables. The results from the first—stage of the two—stage estimation
                                                                          26




process are contained in Table 6. PRODSCAL, DUMDIFF5, OFFWAIT, APPTWAIT,

MDPOP and MDENS are endogenous, independent variables. The results for

DUHDIFF5 are not presented for the purpose of brevity, since they are

qualitatively identical to those of PRODSCAL.

     In general, the first—stage results are consistent with theory and

intuition. The variable PRODSCAL varies positively with the presence of a

business manager, and negatively with the presence of productivity

guidelines set by the group. A manager does not face the incentive to free

ride that a group member does, and thus may be expected to try to relate

physician income more closely to productivity. Productivity guidelines are

an alternative to income distribution incentive schemes, and thus their

presence may be expected to lower PRODSCAL. GRPSIZE has a negative effect

on PRODSCAL throughout its entire range. DUMGRP has no statistically

significant effect, indicating the absence of the hypothesized break in the

effect of GRPSIZE on PRODSCAL. This may indicate that even at low levels

of PRODSCAL, increases in group size have an extremely strong effect.

Interestingly enough, GRPSIZE has a negative effect on PRODSCAL, which is

the opposite of the theoretical prediction. This may be due to higher

costs (e.g., monitoring costs) of implementing a productivity based system

in a large group. Variables which would make demand less elastic or shift

it out, such as FENHEAD, PCTMOVED, ARPRICE, and PCAPINC, all have a

positive effect on PRODSCAL. The effect of wage (WAGERN, DUMWAGE) is

negative when physicians are "unconstrained" by demand (PRODSCAL < 5),

since an increase in the wage would increase the firm's profit—maximizing

price, and decrease the quantity demanded, but increase the quantity

physicians desire to supply. To control this, a would be optimally set

 lower. When physicians are constrained, an increase in the wage would

increase costs and thus induce a smaller supply, thus a must be increased

to achieve the optimal quality level.

     A priori, the qualitative effects of independent variables on MDPOP

and MDENS are expected to be the same, but that is not the case. The

variables expected to be most relevant are characteristics of the area:

PCAPINC, PCTURBAN, PUBTRANS, ARPRICE, GOVSPEND, and PCTPROF. Per capita

incon in the area has a positive effect on both the physician—population

ratio and physician density, although the effect is one order of magnitude

larger for MDPOP. The percent of the population which is urban has no

significant effect on MDPOP and a positive effect on MDENS.   itt is


reasonable to suppose that the degree of urbanization of the population is

more closely related to physician density than to the physician—population

ratio since a largely urban population will likely be more dense and this

will have a relatively high physician density. The percent of the

population commuting via public transit has no significant effect on MDPOP,

but a positive effect on MDENS. This is also likely due to population

density. The prevailing LJCR price in the area for an office visit has a

positive effect on both MDPOP and MDENS, since ARPRICE functions as one

signal of potential profitability. The level of local government

expenditures, a measure of the area's attractiveness, increases MDPOP, but

has no effect on MDENS. PCTPROF has a positive effect on both variables.

     Just as in the case of MDPOP and MDENS, the effects of independent

variables on APPTWAIT, number of days wait for an appointment, and OFFWAIT,

number of minutes spent waiting In the office, were expected to be the
                                                                           32




same. GRPSIZE had no significant effect on either measure of waiting

time. The presence of a manager lowered APPTWAIT and productivity

guidelines lowered OFFWAIT. Per capita income had a negative effect on

APPTWAIT, and no significant effect on OFFWAIT. PCTURBAN decreased both

waiting times, and PUBTRANS raised OFFWAIT. EDUCATE had a positive effect

on APPTWAIT and a negative effect on OFFWAIT. This may reflect APPTWAIT as

associated more closely with quality than time cost. ARPRICE has a

positive effect on both waiting time variables, which is the opposite of

what was expected. If high quality is associated with both high price and

high waiting times, this result is rationalized.

     Table 7 contains the major empirical results of this study. The

second—stage results give estimates of the price spline function, with

endogenous dependent variables converted into instruments through the first

stage of the estimation procedure. The system is identified by the order

condition. The number of included endogenous variables minus one equals 8

and the number of excluded predetermined variables equals 11.

     The results presented are for a spline function with a knot at

PRODSCAL equal to 5. Goldfeld and Quandt (1972, 1973) and Poirier (1976)

discuss the problem of estimating models with unknown points of structural

change.   Such models are commonly   referred to In the literature as

"switching regression" models. The method proposed for a straightforward

estimation is to estimate the model for all possible spline knot values, or

points of structural change, and choose the model for which the sum of

squared errors is minimized. The model was estimated for all possible

switching values of PRODSCAL, which are the integer values in the closed

interval between one and ten. The sum of squared errors is minimized for
the model      where   the switch occurs at PRODSCAL equals 5.
     The results of the estimation are largely consistent with the

theoretical predictions. The most important result is that a switch in the

effect of PRODSCAL on PRICE does occur, and that initially the effect is

negative, and later, positive. For values of PRODSCAL in the interval

[1,51,   the   constant equals 17.03 and the effect of PRODSCAL on

PRICE (-)      is   equal to —2.19. This indicates that over this range, when

PRODSCAL (a) is increased, price falls, which is consistent with the

theoretical predictions of the model for the reginE where physicians are

unconstrained by demand. In this reg1n, price falls by $2.19 for every

increase   by 1 of PRODSCAL. When PRODSCAL         [6,10], the results are

consistent with the regina in which group numbers are constrained by demand

and compete internally. The value of the (mythical) constant term is

—10.82 and the coefficient on PRODSCAL equals 3.38. This result is

consistent with the hypothesis that group nember physicians are

constrained, and in competing over quality, drive price up by $3.38 for

every unit increase in PRODSCAL.

     The nEdical specialty dummies control for differences in price across

major nedical specialties. They indicate that there is no statistically

significant difference between the UCR prices for office visits of

internists or obstetricians or surgeons and pediatricians. General

practitioners have higher prices than pediatricians.

     The size of the group, GRPSIZE, has a positive and significant effect

on price, which is consistent with the prediction that the disincentive

effects of increased group size lead to inefficiency and, therefore, a
                                                                          36




higher price. DUMGRP turns up statistically insignificant, rejecting the

hypothesis of a structural break in the relationship between group size and

price. It seems that, even at higher levels of PRODSCAL, the disincentive

effects of increased group size are   present.
     The waiting time variables both are significant, but have opposite

signs. The number of days spent waiting for an appointment has a positive

effect   on price. It was hypothesized that APPTWAIT was a component of the
time price of a visit and thus would have a negative effect on PRICE. That
effect should be   present, but is overpowered by a positive effect. It was

previously   hypothesized that APPTWAIT is strongly linked with quality, and

if that is so, such a link would produce the result observed in the

estimation results.

     OFFWAIT, on the other hand, has the expected negative effect on

price. This is consistent with a hypothesis that office waiting time is a

component of full price, and, if linked with quality, linked in a weak

fashion.

     The effect of registered nurses' wages on price is positive, as

expected. DUNWAGE is negative and significant, indicating a structural

break. Thus, for PRODSCAL c [1,5], the coefficient on WAGERN equals 0.52,

meaning that a $1 increase in wages increases price by 52g. When

PRODSCAL c [6,10], the coefficient on WAGERN equals —0.28. A $1 increase

in nurses' wages causes doctors to cut back on production of quality,

causing price to fall by 28.

     The physician—population ratio has a positive, significant, and large

effect upon price, even after controlling for endogeneity via first stage

estimation. This fact, associated with the negative and significant
                                                                                    37



coefficient    on FEMHEAD, does not provide much support for the increasing

monopoly model of Pauly and Satterthwaite (1980). That model would have

the coefficient on MDPOP negative, and positive on MDENS, FEMHEAD, and

PCTMOVED.    MDENS and PCTMOVED are positively related to price, but FEMHEAD

turns up negative, and MDPOP is positive. These results tend to reject the

increasing monopoly theory, but neither support nor reject a model of

induced   demand.
     The coefficient on the variable EDUCATE is negative, indicating that
higher levels of education may make consunrs more efficient at gathering
information.
     Lastly,   per capita incor has no statistically significant effect on

price.    This may    occur   because per   capita inconE for the area is too far

removed   to have a    significant effect on a group's demand curve. The ideal

nasure would be per capita         inconE of the   group's   patients, but that is not
available.


VI. Summary

     Co—operative firms operating in the market for professional services

defy sons of the commonly held notions about cooperative type firms. The

model proposed in this paper generates these differences through the

nEchanism of non—price competition. An unusual feature of this model is

the switching behavior generated as nEmbers of the firm move from the

unconstrained to the constrained regime. This feature is incorporated for

empirical testing by specifying the model to be estimated as a spline

function. The empirical testing is possible due to the existence of a

unique data set for American medical group practice.
                                                                           38



     The estimation results of this study confirm the hypotheses of

switching behavior and a postive relationship between price and the

strength of the link between reward and productivity. This provides strong

evidence to support the contention that internal non—price competition is

present in cooperative service firms, and that it increases as nmbers'

rewards   are linked more closely with their own productivity.

     These results raise a new set of questions about the nature of this

non—price competition, the design of optimal incentive systems in the face

of such behavior, and the effects on equilibrium in markets where this

phenonenon is present. Future research can focus on generating hypotheses

about these questions, and testing them in the various service sectors of

the economy where co—operative firms are present.

The denominator of (A8) must be negative by the second—order conditions for

a   maximum. Thus     the sign of (A8) will be the samu as the sign of the

expression within brackets in the nuurator of (A8). Whether this is

positive depends on the signs of f21 and V21, and the magnitude to the

second and last terms relative to the first and third terms. If f21, the

effect of an increase in price on the marginal effect of quality on demand

is positive, and if V21, the effect of an increase in quantity on marginal

disutility "cost" of quality, is positive, then

                 0.




It will also be positive if either one of the aforenntioned cross—partials

is negative, but the positive terms outweigh its effect. The most

plausible situation is one where V21 is positive, since producing more

quantity will plausibly make providing an extra unit of quality more

costly, and f21 is non—positive, since the effect of increasing quality on

demand will likely fall off with price or be unaffected. In this case,
