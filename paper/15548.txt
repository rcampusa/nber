1.   Introduction

    This note describes two sets of concordances between the ten-digit Harmonized System
(HS) codes used by the United States to track international trade and the Standard Industrial
Classi…cation (SIC) and North American Industry Classi…cation System (NAICS) categories
used to characterize domestic production.
    The …rst set of concordances links each ten-digit import and export Harmonized System
(HS) code to a single four-digit SIC (SIC4) and six-digit NAICS (NAICS6) industry. These
concordances are assembled from published Census data, which provide a mapping of HS to
SIC and NAICS industries from 1989 to 2001 and 2000 to 2006, respectively. Our contri-
bution here is to extend these mappings to match HS codes with SIC industries after 2001,
and to match HS codes with NAICS industries before 2000. This permits construction of a
long (i.e., 1989 to 2006) time series of U.S. industry-level import and export data by trading
partner in either SIC or NAICS format, subject to the caveats discussed below.
    The second set of concordances links ten-digit import and export HS categories to one or
more …ve-digit SIC (SIC5) or seven-digit NAICS (NAICS7) product classes. These concor-
dances are constructed using “basecodes”created by the U.S. Census Bureau (“Census”). In
each year of an economic census, Census constructs two mappings: the …rst links HS codes
to basecodes while the second links basecodes to SIC5 or NAICS7 product classes. We com-
bine the two mappings to link HS codes to product classes. We note that due to di¤erences
between how the HS and SIC/NAICS systems classify goods, a given HS code may match
to more than one SIC5/NAICS7 product class.
    Finally, this paper brie‡y discusses how these concordances might be applied in current
empirical international trade research. In particular, we provide background information
useful for linking the …rm-product-class domestic production data in the U.S. Census of
Manufactures (CM) to the …rm-product import and export data in the Longitudinal Firm
Trade Transaction Database (LFTTD).1
    Section 2 provides a brief description of HS, SIC and NAICS codes. Section 3 de-
scribes the HS to SIC4/NAICS6 industry concordance, while Section 4 describes the HS
to SIC5/NAICS7 product-class concordance. Section 5 discusses how the latter can be used
to link Census production and trade data. Detailed discussion of Census’“HS-Baseroot”and
“Principal Di¤erences”…les, the key inputs to our HS to product class concordances, are rele-
gated to appendices. The appendices also include a brief discussion of how our concordances
relate to others that can be found on the web.

2.   A Brief Description of HS, SIC and NAICS

    U.S. import and export codes are based on the Harmonized System established by the
World Customs Organization (WCO). The WCO assigns six-digit codes for general cate-
gories, and countries adopting the HS are allowed to characterize goods at more detailed
levels by adding digits, usually two to four, for a total of eight to ten. The United States
uses up to ten digits. U.S. export codes are administrated by Census and are technically
   1
     For more detail on the former, see Bernard, Redding and Schott (2009). For more detail on the latter
see Bernard, Jensen and Schott (2009).
                                     HS to SIC and NAICS                                                3


known as Schedule B codes. U.S. import codes are administered by the U.S. International
Trade Commission (USITC) and are technically known as Harmonized Tari¤ System (HTS)
codes. In this paper, we refer to both generically as HS codes. Changes to the U.S. im-
port or export codes occur via three routes: changes by the World Customs Organization
(WCO) to the o¢ cial list of international six-digit pre…xes; U.S. legislation that a¤ects U.S.
eight-digit codes (imports only); or changes by the Committee for Statistical Annotation of
Tari¤ Schedules (known as the “484(f) Committee”) to statistical ten-digit codes.2 For a
concordance of HS codes over time, see Pierce and Schott (2009).
    SIC codes are used to classify domestic production in the United States until the 1997
economic census, with major revisions of the SIC occurring in 1972 and 1987. Starting with
the 1997 census, U.S. output is classi…ed according to the NAICS. Census refers to the …rst
four digits of an SIC code, and the …rst six digits of a NAICS code, as an “industry”. It
reserves the terms “product class” and “product” for the …rst …ve and seven digits of an
SIC code, and the …rst seven and ten digits of a NAICS code, respectively. While the set of
o¢ cial U.S. industries is de…ned outside the Census Bureau, Census generally has discretion
in de…ning product classes and products within these industries.3
    The HS codes used to classify trade data and the SIC or NAICS codes used to classify do-
mestic production data cannot be matched directly due to di¤erences in how the two systems
classify products. In particular, while HS codes are based solely on product characteristics,
SIC and NAICS codes may also take into account the method of production. This di¤erence
has two consequences with respect to the concordances discussed below. First, it may not
be possible to match a given HS category to a single SIC or NAICS category. Second, U.S.
trade cannot be broken out by the full set of SIC or NAICS categories. For example, two SIC
industries that cover goods with the same characteristics may have to be combined into a
single, aggregate category that does not provide information as to how the goods are made.4

3.       Concording HS to SIC4/NAICS6 Industries

    Census includes HS to SIC4/NAICS6 industry concordances with its publicly available
trade statistics.5 For reasons discussed in the next section, these are referred to here as HS
to “baseroot” mappings. From 1989 to 2001, these mappings match ten-digit HS codes to
four-digit SIC baseroots. From 2000 to the present, they match ten-digit HS codes to six-
digit NAICS baseroots. In almost all cases, these baseroots are proper industries listed in
either the SIC or NAICS.6 We assemble a “master list”of these concordances by appending

trade/faq/sb/sb0008.html for more detail.

     See Census (1992) for more detail. The SIC, for example, was the responsibility of the Technical Com-
mittee on Industrial Classi…cation in the O¢ ce of Management and Budget.

ticular the website “U.S. Commodity Exports and Imports as Related to Output (OEI)” at

     They also include HS to Standard International Trade Classi…cation (SITC) concordances, which we
include with our other concordances in the …les described below.

     Of the 461 NAICS baseroots in the HS-NAICS6 import concordance and 455 NAICS baseroots in the
HS-NAICS6 export concordance, 10 are not real industries as de…ned in the NAICS. They are 11211X,
1123XX, 31131X 31181X, 31511X, 33631X, 910000, 920000, 980000, 990000. Of the 471 SIC baseroots in

the HS-baseroot mappings contained in the December trade CD-ROMs published by Census
from 1989 to 2006.7
    For certain applications, it might be useful to extend each set of mappings beyond the
years for which these o¢ cial concordances are available. That is, it may be useful to have an
HS-SIC concordance for years after 2001 or an HS-NAICS concordance for years prior to 2000.
We extend the HS-SIC and HS-NAICS mappings to incorporate the entire period from 1989
to 2006 using a three-step alogorithm based on the procedures used previously in Feenstra
et al. (2002). The steps of this algorithm are described immediately below. The Stata code
for steps 1 and 2, and for incorporating the results of step 3, is available in the zip archive
accompanying this paper on Schott’s website, with …lename schott_algorithm_10.do.8

   1. Step 1: Look at all ten-digit HS within a nine-digit category. If all assigned ten-digit HS
      within this category have the same SIC assignment, assign that SIC to any unassigned
      ten-digit HS within that nine-digit category. Repeat for eight-, seven-, etc. digit HS
      categories.

   2. Step 2: Sort list by ten-digit HS code. Examine “gaps” between ten-digit HS codes
      with assignments. If a gap is preceded and succeeded by the same SIC code, use that
      SIC code for all unassigned ten-digit HS codes in the gap.

   3. Step 3: Hand match remaining unmatched HS codes where possible. Note that any
      remaining unmatched ten-digit HS codes account for a very small fraction of U.S.
      imports or exports.

    Table 1 summarizes the number of SIC and NAICS codes “…lled in”using this procedure
for exports and imports, respectively. The descriptions in the …rst column match those
provided by the variable “matchtype”in the …les discussed in Section 6 below.

314X, 3XXX, 9000, 9100, 9200, 9800, 9900.

     These CDs are sold by Census’s Foreign Trade Division and are often available in university libraries.
The copies used here are provided generously by the Yale University Social Sciences Library. Each of the
monthly CDs for imports and exports contains a dBase-formatted …le (called concord.dbf) that separately
relates the ten-digit import and export HS codes used in the month to four-digit SIC and/or six-digit NAICS
basecodes, depending upon the year. CDs are available starting in December, 1989 for exports and January
1989 for imports. Note that the December CD for each year contains trade information for that month as
well as the yearly totals.

    By aggregating the HS-baseroot mappings for all available years and extending them for
the full period in which the HS was in existence, we create HS to SIC4 and HS to NAICS6
concordances for both imports and exports, for the period from 1989 to 2006. See Section
6 for a full description of the …nal concordance …les available in the electronic appendix to
this paper.

4.       Concording HS to SIC5/NAICS7 Product Classes

4.1. Census’s Procedure for Mapping HS to SIC and NAICS
   Census matches trade data to domestic production data using a bridge code known as
an “SIC-base” or “NAICS-base” code, which we refer to here generically as “basecodes.”9
Basecodes are eight-digit alphanumeric codes that can generally be thought of as describing
product characteristics. The …rst four (six) digits of the SIC (NAICS) basecode represent
the “root”industry of the basecode, which, loosely speaking, is Census’s best match for the
industry in which the traded product belongs. We refer to basecode roots here as “baseroots”
and use them in constructing the industry concordances noted above. The remaining digits
are internal identi…ers for whether the basecode encompasses one or more product classes,
and, in the latter instance, whether those product classes are from di¤erent industries. For
Census year 1992, enough data are available for us to also construct a HS to SIC5/NAICS7
concordance based on basecodes. For the 1997 and 2002 HS to SIC5/NAICS7 concordances,
however, we are restricted by data limitations to matching HS and SIC/NAICS product codes
through baseroots only. The di¤erences between constructing concordances using basecodes
versus baseroots are discussed in detail in the next sub-section.
   We match HS product codes to SIC5/NAICS7 product classes via baseroots using two
complementary mappings produced by Census. The …rst mapping, which we refer to here
as an “HS-baseroot” concordance, assigns a single baseroot to each HS code.10 As noted
above, these mappings are published in Census’s monthly releases of U.S. trade data on CDs.
The second mapping, known as a principle di¤erences (PD) …le, is constructed for every
economic census, which take place in years ending in 2 and 7; it assigns a single baseroot
to each product class in the SIC or NAICS.11 HS product codes can then be matched to
SIC5/NAICS7 product classes through their baseroots. The HS-baseroot and PD mappings
are discussed in detail in Appendixes 2 and 3 below, respectively.
     9
     As noted above, a more detailed discussion of Census’SIC and NAICS concordance methods is available
at www.census.gov/epcd/www/intronet.html.
  10
     Census constructs the HS-to-basecode concordance so that the Foreign Trade Division can publish trade
statistics using the same industry categories it uses to publish domestic production statistics. As alluded
to above and as discussed in more detail at www.censusbureau.biz/epcd/oei/view/appenda.txt, the HS to
basecode mappings often make more sense for exports than for imports: “It is somewhat easier to …nd a
reasonable statistical basis for comparing domestic output with exports than with imports. This is because
there are substantial numbers of imported commodities which are not produced in the United States or are
produced in very small quantities. On the other hand, the merchandise exported from the United States is
ordinarily produced in this country and re‡ects items important to output.”
  11
     “Product trailer” …les associated with the quinquennial CM record the set of product classes produced
by U.S. manufacturing establishment in each census year. See Bernard, Redding and Schott (2009) for more
detail. Similarly, the “materials trailers” record the set of products establishments use as inputs.
                                       HS to SIC and NAICS                                                  6


    At this point, an example may be useful for …xing ideas. In 1992, HS code 7215200000 was
used to track exports of “other bars and rods of iron or nonalloy steel, cold-formed or cold-
…nished, less than 0.25 percent carbon.” According to the 1992 HS-baseroot concordance,
this HS code – and 222 others – maps into SIC baseroot 3312. This baseroot, in turn,
maps into 11 di¤erent SIC product class codes from 3 di¤erent four-digit SIC industries in
the 1992 PD …le: 33121, 33122, 33123, 33124, 33126, 33127, 33128, 3312C, 33167, 33168
and 33170.12 We note that in the o¢ cial Census ten-digit HS to four-digit SIC mapping
discussed in Section 3, HS code 7215200000 maps uniquely to SIC industry 3312.
    This example highlights the “many-to-many” nature of the HS-product-class concor-
dances. While each HS code maps to a single baseroot, many HS codes (223 in this example)
can map to a single baseroot. Similarly, while each …ve-digit SIC product class maps to a
single baseroot, many product classes (from three di¤erent industries, in this example) may
map to a single baseroot. As discussed in Section 5 below, the HS-baseroot and PD …les can
in theory be used to match the product classes U.S. manufacturing …rms produce in each
CMF year to the products they import and export in those years.

4.2. Matching on Basecodes Versus Baseroots
   Matching on baseroots is appealing because HS-baseroot mappings are available in all
years, allowing us to create concordances for every economic census year since 1992. As
noted above, however, we have access to more disaggregated HS-basecode and SIC5-basecode
mappings for 1992. The primary advantage of concordances using basecodes is a “more
precise”mapping between HS and SIC5.
   To illustrate what we mean by “more precise”, consider once again HS code 7215200000,
which we used to illustrate matching through baseroots in the previous sub-section. As
mentioned above, HS code 72150200000 and 222 other HS codes matched to 11 di¤erent SIC5
product classes through baseroot 3312. When HS and SIC5 codes are matched through full
basecodes, rather than baseroots, however, we …nd that 7215200000 is one of only 10 HS
codes that map to only two SIC5s –33128 and 33168, de…ned under basecode 33128B00 –
described as “cold-…nished steel bars/bar shapes (made in mills)” and “cold-…nished steel
bars/bar shapes (not made in mills).”13 Because HS code 7215200000 is described as “other
bars and rods of iron or nonalloy steel, cold-formed or cold-…nished, less than 0.25 percent
carbon”, it appears that assigning SIC5s based on a full basecode, rather than a baseroot,
has provided a better match, by dropping unrelated SIC5 products like sheet and strip, pipe
and tube and rails.
   HS code 7215200000 was matched to 9 additional SIC5s when we matched HS codes to
  12
      The product descriptions for these SIC5 product-classes are as follows: 33121 - Coke over and blast
furnace products; 33122 - Steel ingot and semi…nished shapes; 33123 - Hot-rolled sheet and strip including
tin-milled products; 33124 - Hot-rolled bars and bar shapes, plates, structural; 33126 - Steel pipe and tubes
(made in steel mills); 33127 - Cold-rolled steel sheet and strip (made in mills); 33128 - Cold-…nished steel
bars/bar shapes (made in mills); 3312C - Other steel mill products, including steel rails; 33167 - Cold-rolled
steel sheet and strip (not made in mills); 33168 - Cold-…nished steel bars and bar shapes (not made in mills);
33170 - Steel pipe and tubes.
   13
      Note that this example provides a good illustration of how HS codes may match to more than one SIC5,
since the SIC considers the method of production when assigning product classi…cations. The di¤erence
between these product classes is whether or not they are made in steel mills.
                                       HS to SIC and NAICS                                           7


SIC5 codes with baseroots versus basecodes. This matching of HS codes to additional SIC5s
when matching with baseroots is not uncommon, as illustrated in the following analysis of
1992, the only year for which we can do both types of mappings. Of the 16,022 import HS
codes in use in 1992, 9,289 are matched to additional SIC5s when using baseroot matching.
The mean number of additional SIC5s matched to each import HS is 2.35. Similarly, of
the 8,054 export HS codes in use in 1992, 5,396 are matched to extra SIC5s under baseroot
matching. The mean number of additional SIC5s matched to each export HS is 2.72. Table
2 displays the number of extra SIC5s associated with HS10 import and export codes for
1992.

                              Notes: Table displays the number of "Additional" SIC5s
                              associated with HS10 export and import codes in 1992.
                              Additional SIC5s are SIC5 product codes that are
                              associated with a particular HS10 when a concordance is
                              constructed with 4-digit baseroots, rather than a full 8-digit
                              basecode.



    For some types of research, matching HS and SIC5/NAICS7 codes through full basecodes
might be useful. Pierce (2009), for example, identi…es U.S. manufacturing establishments
that received antidumping protection by matching the HS10s used to classify products in an-
tidumping investigations to the SIC5 product-classes that establishments reported producing
in the CMF. In this case, matching on baseroots, rather than full basecodes, would likely
lead to some unprotected plants being incorrectly identi…ed as recipients of antidumping
protection.
    Unfortunately, Census published a full HS10-basecode mapping only for 1992. As a
result, matching on basecodes can only be performed in a somewhat limited time period. In
the electronic appendix, we provide HS10 to SIC5 concordances constructed with basecode
matching for 1992 with …lenames m_basecode_92.csv and x_basecode_92.csv for imports
and exports, respectively.14 In the import concordance 16,022 HS codes are matched to 1,564
  14
    This concordance might be extended to prior and subsequent years using the HS-over-time concordance
provided in Pierce and Schott (2009).

5.    Concording the LFTTD and CM

   The concordance procedures described above can be used to link …rm-level domestic
production data contained in the Census of Manufactures (CM) with the transaction-level
trade data housed in the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD). The
resulting merged dataset would contain a …rm-baseroot-level dataset recording production,
imports and exports at the same level of aggregation (i.e., according to SIC or NAICS
baseroots) for a particular census year.
   The merged trade and production dataset can be constructed as follows. First, the
LFTTD is merged with the trade concordance for the appropriate year, which yields a …rm-
baseroot version of the LFTTD. Second, the product trailer …les of the CM–which contain
data on output by product for every U.S. manufacturing establishment–are merged with the
PD …le for the appropriate year, yielding a …rm-baseroot version of the CM. Lastly, these
two datasets are merged by baseroot. This process is illustrated in Figure 1.

A      Appendix 1: Other Concordances

   This appendix discusses the relationship between the concordances developed above and
two other HS-SIC/NAICS concordances that can be found on the web.

A1. The Feenstra (2002) Concordance
    Feenstra et al. (2002) provide background for U.S. HS10-level trade data for 1989 to
2001. Those data have subsequently been extended to 2006 and are available on Feenstra’s
website. Of the 26,277 ten-digit HS codes used to track U.S. imports (exports) in the
Feenstra et al. (2002) 1989 to 2001 dataset, Census provided a baseroot concordance for all
but 1,222. Of these 1,222 HS codes, 898 were assigned to a four-digit SIC category using
a HS to 1987-revision MSIC concordance from Feenstra (1996). Though in principle MSIC
codes di¤er from SIC codes, a number of MSIC codes map directly into regular SIC codes.
The remaining 324 products were assigned to industries via an algorithm similar to that
described in Section 3 above.
    The set of HS codes found in the Feenstra et al. concordances di¤ers slightly from that
of the master list described in Section 3. Of the 25,329 (11,509) unique import (export)
HS codes that result from merging Feenstra et al.’s concordances with our own, we …nd
that 24,947 (11,472) are in common while 382 (37) are only in the Feenstra et al (2002)
concordance. We don’t have an explanation for the codes unique to the Feenstra et al (2002)
dataset though we suspect they may be due to Census’periodic revisions of the trade data.

A2. The EIIT Concordance
    A …ve-digit SIC to ten-digit HS concordance of unknown origin is posted to the EIIT
website.18 This concordance does not distinguish between import or export HS categories
and it does not note the years to which either its HS codes apply.
    The EIIT concordance contains 17,436 HS codes and maps them to 805 …ve-digit SIC
categories, 741 of which are in manufacturing. If collapsed to the four-digit SIC level, this
list comprises 439 four-digit SIC codes, 386 of which are in manufacturing. This compares
with the 1,440 …ve-digit and 459 four-digit manufacturing SIC codes contained in the 1987
revision of the SIC, and the 1,462 …ve-digit and 459 four-digit manufacturing SIC codes in
the 1992 revision of the SIC. The 386 unique manufacturing codes in the EIIT concordance
are similar to the 386 “super-sic”codes described in Feenstra et al (2002).
    The EIIT concordance appears to be a close cousin of the concordance described in Sec-
tion 4. Of the 8,215 (15,120) export (import) HS codes which appear in both concordances,
6,058 (10,762) have the same four-digit root.

B      Appendix 2: Census’s HS-Baseroot Concordances

   Census produces an HS-basecode concordance only for the years in which there is an
economic census. However, it provides more aggregate, HS-baseroot concordances with its
monthly published trade statistics. As discussed above, we assemble a “master list”of these
 18

mappings by appending the HS-baseroot concordances contained in the December trade CD-
roms. The Stata …les containing these lists are discussed in Section 6. They are available on
Schott’s website.19

B1. HS-SIC
   Census’s HS-baseroot concordances virtually always map HS codes to a single four-
character SIC root. As noted above, these roots are the …rst four characters of an eight-
character SIC basecode.20 For the most part, these baseroots are proper industries, but there
are some (e.g., 3XXX) that re‡ect the di¢ culties noted in Sections 3 and 4 above. We note
the following:

      As indicated in Table 3, the number of unique HS export (import) codes in the master
      list that have SIC basecodes associated with them in at least one year ranges from
      7,908 (14,402) in 1989 to 8,629 (17,183) in 2001. 2001 is the …nal year in which SIC
      codes appear in the concordance.

      The number of unique SIC codes to which these export (import) HS codes match
      ranges from 429 (443) in 1989 to 449 (450) in 2001.21

      Some of the SIC basecodes to which HS codes are assigned are incomplete (e.g., 23XX),
      while others are outside manufacturing (e.g., 0273). As noted in the third column of
      each panel in Table 3, the number of manufacturing SIC basecodes to which these
      export (import) codes match ranges from 371 (386) in 1989 to 391 (392) in 2001. The
      fact that there are fewer than the o¢ cial number of 459 manufacturing SIC codes in
      the concordance …les is consistent with the discussion in Sections 3 and 4 above.


B2. HS-NAICS
    As with the SIC, Census’s concordance …les virtually always map HS codes to a unique
six-digit NAICS baseroot. For the most part, these baseroots are proper NAICS industries,
but there are some that re‡ect the di¢ culties noted in Sections 3 and 4 above. We note the
following:

      As summarized in Table 4, the number of HS export (import) codes in the master
      list that have NAICS basecodes associated with them in at least one year ranges from
      8,628 (16,897) in 2000 to 8,972 (17,746) in 2006. 2000 is the …rst year that NAICS
      codes appear in the concordance …les.
  19
     Though we have not explored whether reliance on the December …les makes a di¤erence (e.g., whether
there is within-year variance of SIC mappings to a particular HS), we note that, very rarely, the baseroots
Census assigns to an HS code do change across years.
  20
     Though the concordance …les included with the monthly trade data do not include the full, internal-
to-Census basecode, that mapping is available for 1992 at http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/intronet.html
(see second paragraph).
  21
     There are 459 “o¢ cial” four-digit SIC manufacturing codes in 1992 and 1997 economic censuses. For a

        The number of NAICS basecodes to which these export (import) codes match ranges
        from 454 in 2000 to 453 in 2006 for both imports and exports.22
        Some of the NAICS basecodes to which HS codes are assigned are incomplete, while
        others are outside manufacturing. As noted in the third column of each panel of Table
        4, the number of manufacturing NAICS industry codes to which these export (import)
        codes match ranges from 387 in 2000 to 386 in 2006. As with the SIC, these numbers
        of manufacturing codes are lower than the 473 o¢ cial manufacturing industries in the
        NAICS.

C1. 1992 Economic Census
   The 1992 PD …le maps …ve-digit SIC product classes to eight-digit (SIC-based) basecodes
and is available in the electronic appendix with …lename pd92.csv. We note the following:

       814 unique basecodes match to a product class (PC) in the 1992 PD …le, 768 of which
       are in manufacturing. Table 5 summarizes the distribution of these basecodes according
       to the number of …ve-digit SIC product classes into which they map. As a group, the
       eight-digit basecodes contain 418 unique four-character basecode roots, 391 of which
       are in manufacturing. Note that there are 459 unique four-digit SIC manufacturing
       industries in 1992.23

       1,566 unique …ve-digit SIC product classes are matched to an eight-digit basecode in
       the 1992 PD …le. The o¢ cial list of SIC categories for the 1992 CMF encompasses
       1,462 …ve-digit product classes for manufacturing.24

    The set of four-digit SIC manufacturing industries in 1992 is identical to the set used in 1987. See

          – A merge of the unique …ve-digit SIC codes from the PD concordance into the
            o¢ cial list from Census (1992) reveals that 1400 codes match exactly and that
            they are all in manufacturing. The largest portion (24) of the 62 in the o¢ cial
            list but not in the PD concordance end in “9”, and their descriptions indicate
            they are generally receipts for contract work on the good categorized by the …rst
            four digits. Code 22579 in the PD …le, for example, is “contract and commission
            receipts for knitting only or knitting and …nishing weft (circular) knit fabrics”.
            Code 22573, which appears in both the PD and the o¢ cial list, by comparison,
            is “…nished weft (circular) knit fabrics, excluding hosiery”.
          – There are 166 …ve-digit SIC codes that are matched to HS codes in the PD
            concordance but do not appear in the o¢ cial SIC list. Of the 166, 102 end in
            “0” and 95 are in manufacturing. We suspect that the 102 codes ending in “0”
            are used to facilitate the matching of SIC and basecodes by capturing a range of
            goods spread across …ve-digit codes with the same four-digit root. For example,
            20220 is in the PD …le but not on the o¢ cial list, and is described as “cheese,
            natural and processed, not speci…ed as to kind”, versus 20223 and 20224, both
            of which are in both the PD and the o¢ cial list but which break cheese down
            into natural and processed cheese, respectively. All three of these codes map into
            the same basecode, 20223B00, which maps to HS codes beginning with 0406, i.e.,
            “cheese and curd”.

C2. 1997 Economic Census
    The 1997 PD …le maps seven-digit NAICS product classes to eight-digit (NAICS-based)
basecodes and is available in the electronic appendix with …lename pd97.csv.25 We note the
following:

       841 unique basecodes are matched to a product class (PC) in the 1997 PD …le, 763
       of which are in manufacturing (i.e., begin with a “3”). Table 6 summarizes the dis-
       tribution of these basecodes according to the number of seven-digit NAICS product
       classes into which they map. As a group, the eight-digit basecodes contain 451 unique
       six-character basecode roots, 388 of which are in manufacturing.

       1559 unique seven-digit NAICS product classes are matched to an eight-digit basecode
       in the 1997 PD …le, of which 1418 are in manufacturing. The o¢ cial list of NAICS
       categories for the 1997 CMF encompasses 1469 seven-digit product classes in manu-
       facturing.

C3. 2002 Economic Census
    The 2002 PD …le maps seven-digit NAICS product classes to eight-digit (NAICS-based)
basecodes and is available in the electronic appendix with …lename pd02.csv. We note the

     832 unique basecodes are matched to a product class (PC) in the 2002 PD …le, 754
     of which are in manufacturing (i.e., begin with a “3”). Table 7 summarizes the dis-
     tribution of these basecodes according to the number of seven-digit NAICS product
     classes into which they map. As a group, the eight-digit basecodes contain 450 unique
     six-character basecode roots, 388 of which are in manufacturing.


     1,547 unique seven-digit NAICS product classes are matched to an eight-digit basecode
     in the 1997 PD …le, of which 1,406 are in manufacturing. The o¢ cial list of NAICS
