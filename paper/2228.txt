             Interpreting the Evidence on Money-Income Causality




                                  ABSTRACT




   Previous authors have reached puzzlingly different conclusions about the

usefulness of money for forecasting real output based on closely related

regression-based tests. An examination of this and additional new evidence

reveals that innovations in Ml have statistically significant marginal

predictive value for industrial production, both in a bivariate model and in a

multivariate setting including a price index and an interest rate. This

conclusion follows from focusing on the trend properties of the data, both

stochastic and deterministic, and from drawing inferences using asymptotic

theory that explicitly addresses the implications of these trends for the

distributions of the various test statistics.

                                 1. Introduction

   Whether movements in money help to predict movements in output or income

has been an enduring topic in macroeconomics. This question has traditionally

been associated with the monetarist-Keynesian debate over the effectiveness of

monetary policy. Recently, however, some authors have suggested that

equilibrium models in which aggregate movements have real rather than monetary

origins imply that money should have limited value for forecasting output

(King and Plosser [1984], Bernanke [1986], and Eichenbaum and Singleton

[1986]). Since Sims' (1972, 1980a) seminal articles, empirical investigations

into this relation have focused on whether money "Granger causes" output in

either a bivariate or a niultivariate framework.

    Unfortunately, researchers using only slightly different specifications

have reached disconcertingly different conclusions using postwar U.S. data.

Focusing on systems with money, output, prices and interest rates, these

different findings can be summarized as three puzzles. First, in a three-

variable system with log output, log money, and inflation and in a four-

variables system in which an interest rate is added, Eichenbauni and Singleton

(1986) found sharp reductions in the importance of money when the tests were

performed using log differences of the variables rather than log levels with a

time trend.

   Second, Sims (l980b) found that adding an interest rate to the three

variable system (output, money and price) reduced the fraction of the

variation in output explained by innovations in money. As Bernanke (1986)

emphasized, however, when a time trend is added to this regression, King

(1984, Appendix B) and Runkle (1986) (using a linear time trend) and Litterman




                                    -1-
and Weiss (1985) (using a quadratic time trend as well) report a substantial

increase in this fraction, indicating an increased predictive role for money

in the four-variable system.

   Third, the conclusions appear sensitive to the sample period. For example,

Eichenbaum and Singleton (1986) emphasize that the evidence supporting a

causal role for money in a detrended levels specification is much weaker in a

sample that excludes the 1980's than if the 1980's are included (for a further

discussion see King [1984, Appendix B], Christiano and Eichenbaum [1986] and

Stock [1986]).

   At the heart of the first two puzzles is the use of different techniques to

"detrend" time series that arguably contain unit roots. Christiano and

Ljungqvist (1987) and Ohanian (1986) have recently provided Monte Carlo

evidence that nonstandard "unit root" distributions might play a role in

resolving these puzzles. Specifically, Christiano and Ljungqvist (1987)

compute the distribution of a levels causality test statistic in a bivariate

model of money and output under the assumption that money and output are not

cointegrated, but have unit roots and drifts; they find a substantial

rightward shift in the distribution of the F-statistic under the null of no

causality. Ohanian reports similar 'unexpected' distributional shifts in a

Monte Carlo experiment with a VAR including money, output, prices, an interest

rate, and an artificially generated independent random walk. While these

authors offer no theoretical explanation for their Monte Carlo results, their

findings suggest that nonstandard distribution theory may prove central to

reconciling the empirical puzzles.

   Our objective is to develop an explicit empirical characterization of

money, output, prices, and interest rates that resolves these three puzzles




                                     -2-
 and permits us to draw conclusions concerning the money-output relation in

 postwar U.S. To facilitate the application of existing asymptotic

 distribution theory, we focus on Granger causality tests rather than variance

 decompositions.

   Our key finding is that although the growth of Ml itself does not Granger

cause real growth in the industrial production index, the deviation of money

growth from a linear time trend does. This result obtains in a bivariate

system with money and output, in a trivariate system in which we add prices,

and in a four variable system in which we add interest rates.   Moreover, the

key restriction that appears to be rejected is the neutrality of output to

changes in detrended money growth. This finding is robust to changes in the

sample period, to estimation using two, three, and four-variable

specifications, and to changes in the number of lags in the relevant

regressions.

   The analysis focuses on the effects of different detrending techniques when

the regressors contain some unit roots. Our first step, reported in Section

2, is to ascertain the orders of integration and cointegration of the

variables, as well as whether the series appear to have polynomial time

trends. We use monthly data from January 1959 to December 1985, with

industrial production as the output measureJ Consistent with the findings of

other researchers, over the postwar period in the U.S. each of these variables

appears to contain one unit root, possibly with drift, so that (for example)

output growth is stationary. In addition, money growth (mt, where       denotes

the log of nominal Ml) seems to be well described as being stationary around a

small but statistically significant time trend. That is,




                                   -3-
                    = l + y2t +

where     is a stationary, mean zero process. Thus      can be thought of as

"detrended nominal money growth't; alternatively,    is the stochastically

trending component of money. Using the results of this analysis, in Section 3

we provide direct evidence that Lip Granger causes       Moreover, the growth

in detrended money is found to be non-neutral, in the sense that (treating
                                                                              p
as exogenous and the parameters of the VAR as constant) a permanent increase

in the level of    leads to a statistically significant predicted permanent
increase in industrial production.2

   In Section 4, the characterization of Section 2 and the theoretical results

of Sims, Stock and Watson (1986) are used to address the first two puzzles.

According to Sims, Stock and Watson (1986), the asymptotic distribution theory

can be used to interpret F-tests in two cases: (i) the restrictions being

tested can be expressed as restrictions on mean zero, stationary variables, or

(ii) the restrictions involve some variables that are dominated by a

polynomial in time (and perhaps some additional variables that are mean zero

and stationary), but there are no other linear combinations of regressors that

are dominated by stochastic trends. Otherwise, the F-statistics will have

nonstandard distributions. In particular, these results imply that causality

tests computed from regressions involving levels of the data typically will

have nonstandard distributions.

   These theoretical results are applied to the different specifications in

the literature. When they are warranted, we use the usual p-values,

predicated upon asymptotic normality; when they are not, the p-values are

computed by numerical integration of the nonstandard asymptotic distributions.




                                      -4-
The proposed resolution of the first two puzzles involves both these

distributional issues and the finding of Sections 2 and 3 that detrended money

growth is non-neutral with respect to output growth. Thus the differences in

conclusions drawn from the various specifications arises partly because of

previously incorrect asymptotic inference in the levels regressions, and

partly because including time as a regressor allows the dominant component of

money growth (its time trend) to be stripped away, revealing the stochastic

component (Eipt)   that   has predictive value for industrial production.

    The final puzzle is addressed in Section 5 by repeating the analysis of

Sections 2-4 for a shorter sample ending in September 1979. For this shorter

period, inflation is better characterized as being stationary around a time

trend. This accounts for many of the observed changes in the causality F-

statistics. While the neutrality proposition is rejected for this shorter

sample, upon controlling for the predictive value of the Treasury Bill rate

    appears to have less predictive content for industrial production in the

shorter than in the longer sample.

   Our conclusions are summarized in Section 6.




                            2. Trend Properties of the Data



   Sims, Stock and Watson (1986) show that the asymptotic distributions of

neutrality and causality tests are sensitive to unit roots and time trends in

the series. This suggests that the finite sample distributions of these tests

will depend on trending or Ituflit roottt behavior as well. Since the asymptotic

theory will be used below to approximate these sampling distributions, we




                                        -5-
begin by characterizing the time trend and unit root properties of the data.

The data consist of monthly observations on the log of nominal Ml (m), the log

of industrial production (y), the log of the wholesale price index (p) (not

seasonally adjusted), and the secondary market rate on 90-day U.S. Treasury

Bills (r), obtained from the Citibase data base. Stated sample lengths refer

to the estimation period, with earlier observations being used for initial

conditions as necessary.

   It is now widely recognized that many macroeconomic series appear to

contain unit roots (e.g. Nelson and Plosser [1982], Perron [1986], Perron and

Phillips [1986], Stock and Watson [l986a,b]). Table 1 investigates the

possibility that these series might have up to two unit roots and time trends

up to second order. The first column presents a modification of the Stock-

Watson qf test (described in Appendix A) for a single unit root when there

might be a quadratic time trend; in no case is there significant evidence

against the unit root hypothesis. The next two columns present the results of

Stock-Watson and Dickey-Fuller (1979) tests for a second unit root, i.e. for a

unit root in the first difference of the series, allowing for the alternative

that the series is stationary in first differences around a linear time trend.

According to these tests, no series contains two unit roots.3

   To ascertain the order of the polynomial in time, the first difference of

each series was regressed against a constant, time, and six of its own lags

(the latter to obtain correct standard errors); the t-statistics on the time

trend are reported in the sixth column of Table 1. Money growth exhibits

clear evidence of a trend, so that m is well characterized by a single unit

root and a quadratic time trend. Performing the same test without a time

trend (column seven) indicates that while output growth and inflation have

significant drifts, the interest rate does not.

   Since output growth, inflation and the interest rate appear not to exhibit

time trends, the fourth and fifth columns of Table 1 reports tests for a unit

root in levels, allowing only for the process to be stationary around a linear

time trend under the alternative. Again, all tests fail to reject. We

conclude that, over the 1960,2-1985,12 sample, y and p are well described as

processes having a single unit root with drift; r has a single unit root

without drift; and m has a single unit root and a quadratic time trend, i.e.

it has the univariate representation (1).

   Multivariate representations of these data will thus be characterized by a

quadratic time trend and at most as many unit roots as variables. However, if

the series have stochastic trends in common, their multivariate

representations will be cointegrated as defined by Engle and Granger (1985)

and so will contain a reduced number of unit roots. However, tests for

cointegration among these data (reported in panel B of Table 1) fail to reject

the null that the series are not cointegrated, suggesting that the

multivariate specifications have as many unit roots as variables.4

   Summarizing these results, the variables can be characterized as



                        y0 ÷
                Mit =   amO
                              +   %1t +

                                          pt
where               and           are mean zero stationary processes. Letting x

denote (y,n1) in the bivariate case, (yt,mt,pt) in the trivariate case, and




                                          -7-
(yt,mt,pt,rt) in the four-variable case, letting               denote the corresponding

vector comprised of t,                   and p, and assuming that       has a VAR(p)

representation, this system can be rewritten as



(2)                x = a0   + a1t + a2t2 +                 =
                                                               A(L)t +
where       is an error term. The lag polynomial A(L) can always be rewritten so

that A(L)=A(l)+A*(L)(lL), where A=-÷1A; since each series has a
unit root and since         is not cointegrated, A(l)=I (the identity matrix).

Thus, upon imposing the unit roots and lack of cointegration on (2),



(3)                      l +         +
                                                    t    A*(L)tl +


      The representation (3) - -   with      nonzero only in the case of money growth
--    summarizes the empirically observed unit root and time trend results of

Table 1. Before turning to the empirical results about the coefficients in

(3), it is worth noting two points. First, a simple calculation using the

definition of A*(L) shows that, if the unit root and non-cointegration

restrictions are true, then the restriction that               does not enter the output

equation in (2) implies and is implied by the restriction that               does not

enter the output growth equation in (3). This is not to say that the test

statistics in the two regressions will have the same numerical values, or even

the same asymptotic distributions -        - just   that the restrictions are the same

in population. Second, (2) and (3) are not quite VAR's in the original

variables: upon premultiplying (2) by A(L), or (3) by A*(L), polynomials in

time remain in the specification.

                               3. Evidence of Non-neutrality



      This section provides empirical evidence for the proposition stated in the

introduction that industrial production growth is not neutral to changes in

the growth rate of detrended money. Consider the output growth equation in a

bivariate VAR(p) of money and output in first differences:



(4)                Yt =   yi   +            + flyy(L)yl + ft


The usual test for Granger causality tests the p restrictions that
                                                                       9(L)=O.
One of the restrictions being tested is that money is "neutral" in the sense

that (l)=O. To focus on this restriction, note that

                                                        thus (4) can be
       L)(l)-FP(L)(l-L) (where ymj           i=j+lymi
rewritten as



(I)        Yt yi +        (l)mti + (L)2m1 + yy(L)Ly1 +


where 2E(l-L)2. Thus a t-test on the coefficient                in (I) provides a

simple test of the hypothesis that

      Since money growth contains a deterministic time trend, a test of

in (I) does not provide a direct test of the neutrality of detrended money

growth. This alternative hypothesis can be examined in a regression in which

Lm is replaced by the residual from regressing Lm on a constant and time; in

large samples, this should reflect more closely the effect of         °'




                                         -9-
 Denoting detrended money growth by               one could consider,



             =                      l+
 (II)
                 1yl   + yn(l)&At            m(L)2mti + /3(L)Ay1 +


    Finally, a third approach to testing whether Lijz Granger causes    would

be to detrend all the regressors in (I). This could be done either in a

 series of preliminary regressions, or by estimating



 (III) Yt yi + fly2t + mt-l + (L)2mt i + (L)y1 + ft


   The results of estimating (I)-(III) are presented in Table 2. According to

the analysis of Section 2, none of the regressors contain unit roots, although

in (I) and (III) the regressors include variables that are dominated by linear

time trends. Thus the usual standard errors and procedures of asymptotic

inference are valid and are used in the Table.

   Focusing first on the bivariate relation, the neutrality proposition is

rejected in all three specifications. However, in the regressions with

detrended money the point estimate of ym(l) more than doubles, and the t-

statistic rises sharply. When the Granger causality proposition is tested

using the specifications (I)-(III), the predictive role of money is

substantially enhanced using the detrended data. The increase in the F-

statistic from (I) to (II) in Panel B is consistent with the proposition that

much of the power of the causality test arises from the non-neutrality of

which is tested only in specifications (II) and (III) (at least

asymptotically).

   The results for the three- and four- variable systems are similar:

Notes: t-statistics in panel A are significant at the **l% *5% +10% level.
All statistics are based on regressions with p lags of money growth rearranged
as in (4) in the text, and with 12 lags of Ly, p, and Lr as appropriate,
where p=6 in the first panel and p=l2 in the second panel. In panel A, t-
statistics are in parantheses, and in panel B p-values are in parentheses.
Significance levels and p-values are based on the usual asymptotic normal and
F approximations.
detrended money growth exhibits stronger non-neutrality, and thus more

evidence of causality, than does money growth itself.

   In all systems, upon increasing the number of lags of money growth from six

to twelve, the point estimates of (l) rise somewhat, indicating a small but

positive sum of the coefficients on            for lags 7-12. The corresponding t-

statistics are slightly reduced, but for the detrended specifications they

typically remain significant at the 1% level. In contrast, increasing the

money lag length sharply reduces the Granger causality F-tests (although all

detrended specifications still reject at the 5% level). This is consistent

with the proposition that increasing the number of lags of money vitiates the

influence of the non-neutrality on the test statistic.5




                        4. The Puzzling Causality Tests



   We return to the first two puzzles stated in the introduction by examining

the effects of different treatments of time trends and unit roots on F-tests

of the predictive content of money. Table 3 contains F-tests for the two,

three, and four variable systems for specifications using growth rates and log

levels, using different numbers of lags, and using different orders of

deterministic time trends.

  The Sims-Stock-Watson guidelines can be used to ascertain which statistics

in Table 3 have the usual asymptotic distribution. In panel A all the

regressors contain unit roots and none are cointegrated. Since the

restrictions being tested cannot be represented as restrictions on mean zero,

stationary variables, the F-statistics will have nonstandard distributions.

Notes: p-values appear in parantheses. When just one p-value appears, it is
based on the usual aysmptotic approximation using the F distribution. When
two p-values appear, the first is based on the usual F distribution, and the
second is based on the nonstandard asymptotic distribution, computed
numerically as described in Appendix B.
In panel B the regressors other than money growth contain unit roots. When

time is included as a regressor (panel B, rows 2 and 3), the restrictions

being tested are effectively on detrended money growth, which is mean zero and

stationary, so the usual distributions apply. However, when time is excluded

(row 1), money growth is dominated by a time trend and a linear combination of

money growth and output is dominated by a stochastic trend, with which money

growth is in turn correlated. Thus one of the restrictions being tested -         - in
particular, the neutrality proposition that the sum of the coefficients on

money growth is zero - -      involves   a coefficient on a variable that is dominated

by a time trend, resulting in a nonstandard distribution. Finally, since none

of the regressors in panels C or D are dominated by stochastic trends, the

usual p-values apply. In the nonstandard cases, both the usual (incorrect) p-

values and the "unit roots" distribution p-values (computed as described in

Appendix B) are reported.

   The first puzzle is that using detrended levels data yields substantially

larger F-statistics than using first differences with a constant. The gap is

particularly wide between the F-statistic based on a VAR(12) in differences

(panel D, row 1) - -    the   specification examined by Eichenbauni and Singleton

(1986) - -   and   the F-statistic based on a linearly detrended levels regression

with 6 lags of m and 12 lags of the other variables (panel A, rows 2 and 3):

in the four-variable system, the 12 lag differences regression has a p-value

of .141, while the detrended levels regression has an (incorrect) p-value of

.002. However, the findings reported in Section 2, along with the nonstandard

asymptotic distribution theory, provide a consistent interpretation of these

results.

   Considering first the bivariate results, comparing panels C and D suggests




                                           -   12   -
that the nonzero coefficients are those on the first lags: testing the

coefficients on later lags serves only to reduce the F-statistic, holding

constant the number of other variables in the regressions. In addition,

including time in the regression increases the F-statistic. These

observations are consistent with the implications of Table 2 that non-

neutrality of     is a key source of the Granger causality. If the unit root

assumption is correct, then the regressions with time trends in panels B and C

test the same causality restrictions, although the test statistics will differ

because of sampling variability: in fact, the reported tests under these

alternative specifications suggest a predictive role for money. Thus much of

the puzzling gap between the differences and levels specifications is largely

accounted for by using a F-test that focuses more directly on the neutrality

proposition, and by recognizing that it is detrended money growth that appears

to Granger cause output.

   The analysis in the three- and four-variable case is similar. Those

specifications with 6 lags of money and 12 lags of the other variables which

test the neutrality of zt (panel B, rows 2 and 3; panel C, rows 2 and 3)

yield qualitatively similar results: all reject non-causality at the 5% level,

although the specific p-values vary among specifications as expected from

sampling error.

   Comparing the usual and the nonstandard p-values for the detrended levels

regression suggests two general conclusions. First, the usual (incorrect) p-

values typically are "too small", i.e. the significance is overstated when the

unit roots nature of the distributions is ignored.6 Second, the (correct) p-

values in the levels regressions tend to be larger than the (correct) p-values

in the mixed levels/differences specification in panel B. A possible




                                    -   13   -
explanation of this is that an additional restriction is being tested in the

panel A regressions - -   that   the level of money (or detrended money) Cranger

causes output growth - -   and   that this restriction is not violated, reducing

the power of the tests in panel A. However, the (correct) p-values in panel

A, row 3 are consistent with the p-values in the differences regressions in

panel C in which the restrictions on detrended money are tested (panel C, rows

2 and 3)•7

   Summarizing, in a given system the nonstandard asymptotics and the

proposition that      rather than           itself Granger causes output growth

provides a consistent explanation for the larger F-statistics in the detrended

levels model.

   The second puzzle concerns the importance of          when r is added in systems

with and without linear and quadratic trends. This puzzle arises from

comparing variance decompositions, but is reflected in the F-statistics in

Table 3 as well. Consistent with the variance decomposition puzzle, the gap

between the three- and four- variable F-statistics is less when trends are

added to the levels specification (panel A, row 1 vs. row 2); indeed, the F-

statistic increases from 3.46 to 3.65 when interest rates are added in the

specification with a trend, although the corrected p-values change only

slightly.8 This drop is consistent with the previous argument that detrended

money growth rather than Emt Granger causes output, since in this case both of

the levels regressions without a trend are misspecified, having omitted time

as a regressor. The relative direction of the bias resulting from omitting

time in the three- and four-variable systems is uncertain on a-priori grounds,

although this bias would be expected to have differenct effects in the two

systems. Thus the "explanation" of the second puzzle is simply that the




                                        -   14   -
regressions in panel A, row 1 have omitted a variable (time) that the analysis

of Sections 2 and 3 suggests is important for isolating the permanent role of

money innovations in forecasting output growth. According to this view, the

specifications including time (and the nonstandard p-values) constitute the

correct basis for inference, in which the marginal predictive content of money

changes little when the interest rate is added.

   The preceding analysis assumes that inflation and detrended money growth

are stationary. While these specifications were suggested by the tests of

Section 2, an alternative characterization of these series would be that both

have unit roots, perhaps with drifts. Are the previous conclusions sensitive

to this modification? Supposing first that inflation is integrated, the

corrected p-values for the levels regressions reported above would have been

computed incorrectly (since the incorrect number of unit roots was included in

the multivariate specification). However, the F-tests in the detrended

regressions in panels B, C and D would still have the usual asymptotic

distributions, since the restrictions could be written in terms of mean zero,

stationary variables (detrended money growth). This suggests that our main
conclusion - -   that   detrended money growth helps to predict industrial
production -- would be unchanged were inflation an integrated process. In

contrast, if money growth has a unit root, then all the reported tests would

involve restrictions on integrated variables, and none of the reported p-

values would apply. However, the discussion of Section 2 suggests that the

argument for this particular alternative characterization is weak.

                                   5. Subsample Stability



   This section addresses the third puzzle, the apparent instability of the

causality tests when the 1980's are eliminated from the sample. The

calculations reported in Sections 2-4 were repeated using data from January

1959 to September 1979. The results are reported in Table 4-6.

   The integration, cointegration, and time trend tests (Table 4) yield the

same inferences as when the full sample is used, with one important exception:

during the shorter sample, inflation seems to be well characterized as

containing a linear time trend. While modeling inflation as having a linear

time trend in the shorter sample but as having no time trend in the larger

sample is logically inconsistent, the purpose of this initial "identification"

phase of the analysis is to obtain an empirical representation of the

variables that will serve as a framework for approximating the sampling

distributions using the Sims-Stock-Watson asymptotic theory. Since a linear

time trend appears to be an important empirical feature of inflation in the

shorter sample, we therefore adopt a characterization of the four variables

during 1959-1979 in which all contain unit roots, there is no cointegration,

and inflation -- as well as money growth -                  - has   a linear time trend:

with those using the shorter sample (Table 5, panel A), in both cases the

point estimate of /3(l) in the bivariate case doubles when a time trend is

added to the regression. In contrast, in the shorter sample the point

estimate changes little when a time is added in the three- and four-variable

specifications. This apparent discrepancy has a simple explanation in terms

of the identified trend in inflation in the shorter sample: when inflation

has a trend component, including inflation as a regressor is essentially

including time, plus some stationary errors, as a regressor. Thus inflation

detrends money growth, permitting the estimation of the sum of the

coefficients on a linear combination of                 and   which is evidently close

to the sum of the coefficients on              alone.

     The causality tests in panel B of Table 5 exhibit two major differences

from the corresponding tests in the longer period. First, these results

generally indicate less influence of money on output during the shorter

period, particularly using twelve lags. Second, given this generally

decreased influence, the major discrepancy between the F-tests in Tables 2 and

5 is the significant causation evident in specification (I) in the shorter

sample for the systems including prices. A possible explanation for this is

that detrended inflation (1r) helps to predict output growth. When time is

omitted from the regression, money growth is "detrended" by inflation. Thus

one of the restrictions being tested is that a linear combination of             and
      -   - rather   than   itself -   - Cranger causes industrial production growth;
if         Granger causes      omitting the time trend would spuriously indicate a

greater role for money.

     The full set of causality results (Table 6) also indicate a diminished role

for money in predicting output in this shorter sample. The first puzzle of




                                           -   17   -
the introduction - -   the   difference in p-values between the differences and

detrended levels specifications --     is   still present in the bivariate results

(panel C, row 1 vs. panel A, row 2). The explanation is the same as before:

focusing on fewer restrictions on lagged money, detrending money growth, and

using the nonstandard critical values accounts for the apparent discrepancy.

In the multivariate models, however, this puzzle is reversed. One explanation

for this reversal is that given in in the discussion of Table 5, panel B; the

similarity of the (correct) p-values in the detrended differences and

detrended levels regressions with six lags of m support this view.

   The   second   puzzle (adding a trend to the levels specification alters the

effect of money when interest rates are included) is summarized in panel A,

rows 1 and 2. The preceding analysis suggests that the anomolous resulthere

is the three-variable levels specification without a trend. Thus the

"explanation" of this puzzle is the same as in the longer sample, appealing to

the bias induced by omitting time as a regressor and to the overstatement of

the p-values arising from using the usual asymptotic theory.

   Summarizing, when the time trend in inflation is recognized and when the

correct critical values are used, money appears to help forecast industrial

production in a bivariate model in both samples. However, its marginal

predictive content drops in multivariate settings in the shorter sample.

Since the point estimates of Bym(l) are similar across samples and across the

two-, three- and four-variable systems, this decrease appears to be

attributable to a combination of (i) relatively more of the short-run

movements in industrial production being explained by innovations in money

during the 1980's than before; (ii) increased variability in the regressors in

the 1980's, and therefore greater power in the F-tests; and (iii) simply




                                        -   18   -
 having more observations in the longer sample. In particular, using corrected

 p-values, in the shorter sample the role of money drops substantially when

 price is added to the specification, while it does not in the longer sample.

 In contrast to Sims' (l980b) findings, the predictive value of money does not

 change appreciably when an interest rate is added to the detrended

 specifications in either sample.




                                    6. Conclusions



   The asymptotic p-values reported in Tables 3 and 6 have been computed under

specific assumptions about the unit root and trend behavior of the various

series. If these assumptions are incorrect, some or all of these asymptotic

p-values would be incorrectly calculated, depending upon the specific

assumption in question. This can be interpreted as a drawback of our two-step

procedure, first testing for trends, then calculating p-values conditional on

the trend specification. An alternative approach - -    at   least in theory - -
would be to specify a prior distribution over different trend
                                                              specifications,
to assume Gaussian innovations in the VAR's, and to compute posterior odds

ratios, integrating over the various cases. However, the computational burden

in this alternative approach is substantially greater than that entailed here;

for an application and discussion in a comparatively simple three lag

univariate autoregressive model, see Geweke (1986). More importantly, we

suggest that the major economic import of these results - -    the   rejection of

the "neutrality" and Granger causality propositions -   - is   largely unaffected

by this criticism. One message of Sims, Stock and Watson (1986) is that




                                     -   19   -
certain linear combinations can be tested using the usual asyniptotics even if

there are unit roots. Our key results -- those in Tables 2 and 4 and in

Tables 3 and 5, Panel C, row 2 --   will   have normal distributions even if many

of our stochastic trend identifications are incorrect.

   Subject to this caveat, these results suggest three conclusions. First,

innovations in the growth of nominal Ml are useful in forecasting industrial

production in the bivariate money-output relation. Second, over the entire

sample period monetary innovations have predictive value for industrial

production beyond information contained in prices and interest rates, although

the marginal significance levels rise somewhat in the multivariate systems.

Third, the additional role of money over prices and interest rates is

substantially less if attention is restricted to a shorter sample ending in

1979. However, the difference between the two samples might simply arise from

the greater variation in output, money, prices and interest rates over the

1980 and 1982 recessions, so that the tests in the longer sample would have

substantially more power.

  This analysis suggests two reasons that past researchers have found

conflicting results. First, many of the earlier specifications failed to

focus on innovations to money, i.e. on the nondeterniinistic component of money

growth that we find to have predictive content for long-run movements in

industrial production. Second, incorrect p-values were used to analyze the

levels regressions, typically resulting in overstatements about the predictive

content of money. These observations provide consistent explanations of the

puzzles stated in the introduction.

1. 1959 was chosen as the start of the sample because of the change in
definitions of the monetary aggregates that year. While most other
researchers have used data from the 1950's and late 1940's, these earlier
series involve retrospectively constructed data that presumably contains
additional measurement error.

2. Our use of the terms "causality" and "neutrality" is narrow. By non-
causality we refer only to the relevant zero restrictions in a VAR; we have no
intention of contributing to the large literature (reviewed by Geweke [1984])
discussing deeper interpretations of causality, predictability and exogneity.
Similarly, by neutrality we mean only the proposition that the sum of the
coefficients on lagged money - - or (detrended) money growth, depending on the
specification -- equals zero in the relevant regressions.

3. The unit root tests were repeated using twelve rather than six lags.
Generally similar results obtained, although with twelve lags it was more
difficult to reject the null that inflation has a second unit root. One
potential problem with inferences concerning inflation is that wholesale
prices exhibit substantial heteroskedasticity during the 1973-1975 oil price
rise and the lifting of price controls. We thus computed modified, weighted
Dickey-Fuller and Stock-Watson test statistics in which this
heteroskedasticity was modeled using a dummy variable for 1973,1-1975,1. With
both six and twelve lags, the weighted tests more strongly rejected the unit
root hypothesis; the largest root in inflation, after adjusting for
heteroskedasticity and short run serial correlation, was estimated to be .83.
This suggests that inflation is not integrated over the sample, although it
exhibits substantially greater dependence than (say) output growth.

4. Similar results obtain using twelve rather than six lags to construct the
cointegration tests.

5.   Similar point estimates for fi(1) (in the range .9 to 1.4) obtain when
these equations are reestimated wh the data aggregated to the quarterly
level. The t-statistics are smaller, although significant at the 10% level.

6. This is consistent with Christiano and Ljungqvist's (1987) Monte Carlo
evidence on the bivariate money-output F-test in the levels regression without
a time trend.

7. The F-statistics of 2.65 in Table 3, panel C, row 1 and 6.07 in panel B,
row 1 for the bivariate models may at first seem contradictory, since both
correspond to coefficients on money growth excluding time trends from the
regression. However, these statistics in fact test different restrictions.
In the pure differences specification, money growth is dominated by its time
trend, and the neutrality of detrended money growth is not tested. In the
mixed differences/levels specification, money growth is "detrended" by
industrial production, which is dominated by a time trend. Thus this
statistic can be rewritten to test (among other restrictions) whether a linear




                                      -    21   -
combination of detrended money growth and the stochastic part of output
Granger causes output. While this linear combination does appear to Granger
cause output, this still is not the hypothesis of interest (concerning
alone), which is untested until a time trend is included in the regression.

8. In finite samples, these F-statistics are only loosely linked to the
variance decompositions. In addition, as Runkle (1986) emphasizes, the
variance decompositions can be very imprecisely estimated, leading to spurious
inferences based on modest shifts in the variance decomposition point
estimates. Thus associating the second puzzle with the shifts in panel A of
Table 3 is only approximate.

             Testing for a Unit Root with a Quadratic Time Trend



   The Stock-Watson (1986a) q(k,m) statistic tests the null hypothesis that

a n-vector of time series variables has k unit roots, perhaps with drift,

against the alternative that the variables have among them only m<k unit

roots, perhaps with drift. This drift in the stochastic trends results in a

linear time trend in the series themselves plus a driftiess stochastic trend.

If it is suspected instead that the series might have a quadratic as well as a

linear time trend, the q(k,m) statistic is not applicable. Since money

growth appears to contain a linear time trend in the current application, the

q(k,m) statistic is inappropriate either for testing for a single unit root

in money or for testing for reduced unit roots in the multivariate systems.

We therefore adopt a modification of the Stock-Watson q(k,m) statistic that

can be used to test for k vs. m unit roots when there might be a quadratic

term under either the null or the alternative.

  This modified statistic, termed q(k,m) in Table 1, is computed exactly

as is the q(k,ni) statistic, except that the data are first detrended using

a quadratic as well as a linear time trend. Selected critical values for the

statistic with m=k-i, computed as described in Stock and Watson (l986a) using

4000 Monte Carlo replications, are given in Table A-i.

                       Computation of Nonstandard p-Values



   The marginal significance levels for the test statistics with nonstandard

distributions were computed by integrating numerically the limiting

distributions of these statistics. In general, the causality tests of the

type considered here with p restrictions have limits of the form,



(B.l)           F => [F1 +   F2(W(t);O)]/p


where F1 has a x.1 distribution, W(t) is n-dimensional Brownian motion,

where n is the dimension of the system, and 9 is a vector of parameters.

Except in special cases, 9 contains parameters from the entire VAR, including

the error covariance matrix. In addition, W(t) enters F2 only through a

limited number of functionals such as JW(t)W(t)'dtr and fW(t)dW(t)'W.




                                        -   26   -
(Explicit formulas for F2 are given in Sims, Stock and Watson [1986, Theorem

2].)

   This representation, combined with Theorem 2.2 of Chan and Wei (1986) which

implies that F1 and W(t) (and thus F1 and F2) are independent, provides a

convenient formulation for Monte Carlo integration of the asymptotic

distribution. The specific procedure we adopt is an extension of Stock's

(1985) suggestion for computing the asymptotic distribution of least squares

estimators of cointegrating vectors when there is zero drift. Specifically,

the nonstandard p-values were estimated using the following algorithm:        (i)

Generate the functionals such as r and '     using   sample path realizations; for

example, a draw of r is rT_T tlYtYt, where            is a driftless n-

dimensional random walk with Y0=0 and an identity innovation covariance

matrix. We chose T to be 1000 and used a normal random number generator to

construct 4000 pseudo-random realizations of these functionals. (ii) Compute

an estimate   of the parameters 9 for the VAR in question.       (iii) Drawing

sequentially from the previously generated random matrices T' etc.), use

to construct a random realization of F2; add this to an independently drawn

x1 variate and divide the sum by p to construct a draw of F in (.l).

Step (iii) was repeated 4000 times for each estimated model, and the

(nonstandard) p-value was computed using the resultant empirical distribution

of F.

   The programs for performing these computations are available from the

authors upon request.
