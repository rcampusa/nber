Dimensions of Health in the Elderly Population

                                            ABSTRACT

In this paper, we characterize the multi-faceted health of the elderly and understand how health along
multiple dimensions has changed over time. Our data are from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey,
1991-2007. We show that 19 measures of health can be combined into three broad categories: a first
dimension representing severe physical and social incapacity such as difficulty dressing or bathing;
a second dimension representing less severe difficulty such as walking long distances or lifting heavy
objects; and a third dimension representing vision and hearing impairment. These dimensions have
changed at different rates over time. The first and third have declined rapidly over time, while the
second has not. The improvement in health is not due to differential mortality of the sick or a new
generation of more healthy people entering old age. Rather, the aging process itself is associated with
less rapid deterioration in health. We speculate about the factors that may lead to this.

       Understanding changes in the health of the elderly is a central policy issue. A healthier

elderly population is able to work to later ages, spends less on medical care each year, and

requires less informal care from family and friends. Efforts to promote population health are

therefore central to many health reform proposals (Pardes et al., 1999).

       By many metrics, the health of the elderly has improved over time. For example, the

share of elderly people with basic physical impairments such as difficulty walking around the

home or bathing has declined markedly over the past two decades. By other metrics, however,

the health of the elderly is worsening. Problems with more advanced functional measures such

as stooping and walking moderate distances have increased over time, and obesity among the

elderly has soared along with weight in the non-elderly population.

       Researchers have attempted to combine indicators of the health of the elderly into a

single summary measure, but these summaries are generally ad hoc and lacking in nuance. The

most common single measure of disability is whether the person has any impairments in

Activities of Daily Living (ADLs, such as bathing or dressing) or Instrumental Activities of

Daily Living (IADLs, such as doing light housework or managing money). In the Medicare

Current Beneficiary Survey, which we analyze in this paper, the share of the elderly population

that is disabled by this definition has declined from 53 percent in 1991 to 42 percent in 2007

(figure 1). This summary measure exhibits somewhat different trends in different surveys and

for different measures of health (Schoeni et al., 2001; Manton and Gu, 2001), however, and

ignores measures of functional impairment (e.g., can the person walk a reasonable distance),

cognitive problems such as memory loss, and sensory impairments such as difficulty seeing and

hearing.

        Note: Disability is measured as the share of people reporting at least one impairment in Activities of Daily
        Living and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. Data are from the Medicare Current Beneficiary
        Survey Access to Care sample. Tabulations use sample weights and are adjusted to the age/sex
        composition of the elderly population in 2000.



       At the same time, there is a history of more theoretically grounded measures of disability

– as with the Grade of Membership (GOM) model proposed by Ken Manton and colleagues

(Lamb, 1996; Manton et al., 1998; Woodbury et al., 1978; Manton et al., 1994). But these

models met resistance because of their complexity. Perhaps as a result, they have not been

widely pursued.

       In this paper, we characterize the multi-faceted health of the elderly and understand how

health along multiple dimensions has changed over time. Our data are from the Medicare

Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), a rotating panel of nearly 12,000 elderly people annually.

The survey started in 1991; we employ data through 2007. The MCBS has the virtue that it is a

person-based sample, not a housing-unit based sample. Thus, it samples and follows people

when they move into nursing homes and records death.


                                                        2
       We first consider how to optimally combine different measures of health into a smaller

number of summary measures. Of course, the best way to summarize multiple measures of

health depends on the question being asked. The optimal measure to predict medical spending

may be somewhat different than the optimal measure to predict health transitions, for example.

We use a somewhat ad hoc approach and estimate factor models for 19 indicators of health in the

community-based population. These measures include specific ADL impairments, IADL

impairments, functional impairments, and sensory impairments.

       We show that these 19 dimensions can be compressed into three broad summary

measures. The dominant factor is impairment in very basic physical and social tasks such as

dressing, eating, transferring in and out of bed, preparing meals, doing light housework, and

managing money. This encompasses many of the ADLs and IADLs, but not all. The second

factor loads heavily on functional limitations and includes measures such as walking moderate

distances, stooping, and reaching. The third dimension is sensory impairments – trouble seeing

and hearing.

       After determining these factors, we analyze the evolution of these health dimensions over

time. We show that the set of physical and social limitations and sensory impairments have

declined rapidly over time. Functional ability was flat or increasing, after declining early in the

time period.

       These results suggest many possible patterns. One possibility is that the community-

dwelling population is increasingly concentrated among the less severely ill, with more severely

ill individuals in nursing homes or having died. We show, however, that composition changes –

both people leaving the sample and new people entering the sample – cannot explain a change in

the health of the community-dwelling population. In a second scenario, it may be that people are



                                                 3
recovering from severe disability more frequently in later years in the sample, thanks to better

medical care or other environmental changes.

         We investigate the evolution of health states in the final part of the paper. In particular,

we estimate models explaining within-person health trends over time, controlling for

demographic characteristics and year dummy variables. We examine health trends in the early

years in the sample (1991-96), middle years in the sample (1997-2001) and later years in the

sample (2002-2007). We show that health deteriorates less rapidly in later years of the sample

than in earlier years. This sets up an exploration of what shocks to health are occurring less

rapidly, which is the subject of ongoing research.

         This paper is structured as follows. The first section describes the data we employ. The

second section presents information on trends in elderly health and reports the results of factor

analyses for the 1991-2007 period. The third section shows the evolution of summary health

measures of health over time, and the fourth section examines within-person changes. The last

section concludes.



I.       The Data

         Our primary data source is the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). The

MCBS, sponsored by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), is a nationally

representative survey of aged, disabled, and institutionalized Medicare beneficiaries, that over-

samples the very old (aged 85 or older) and disabled Medicare beneficiaries. Since we are

interested in disability among the elderly, we restrict our sample to the population aged 65 and

older.




                                                   4
       While a number of surveys have measures of disability in the elderly population

(Freedman et al., 2002), including the National Health Interview Study and the Health and

Retirement Study, the MCBS has a number of advantages. First, the sample size is large, about

10,000 to 18,000 people annually. In addition, the MCBS samples people regardless of whether

they live in a household or a long-term care facility, or switch between the two during the course

of the survey period. Finally, the set of health questions are very broad, encompassing health in

many domains.

       The MCBS started as a longitudinal survey in 1991. In 1992 and 1993, the only

supplemental individuals added were to replace people lost to attrition and to account for newly

enrolled beneficiaries. Beginning in 1994, the MCBS began a transition to a rotating panel

design, with a four year sample inclusion. About one-third of the sample was rotated out in

1994, and new members were included in the sample. The remainder of the original sample was

rotated out in subsequent years. We use all interviews that are available for each person from the

start of the survey in 1991 through the 2007 survey.

       The MCBS has two samples: a set of people who were enrolled for the entire year (the

Access to Care sample) and a set of ever enrolled beneficiaries (the Cost and Use sample). The

latter differs from the former in including people who die during the year and new additions to

the Medicare population. The primary data that we use are from the health status questionnaire

administered in the fall survey, which defines the Access to Care sample. We thus use the

Access to Care data. We supplement this with information about death in the year following the

fall interview, taken from the Cost and Use data. Because the Cost and Use data are only

available through 2006, our analysis of deaths, nursing home transitions, and loss to follow-up

go only through that year. Other data go through 2007.



                                                5
        Table 1 shows the number of individuals in the sample by year or interview and wave

(number of interviews for that person). The sample of new beneficiaries is low in 1992 and

1993, rises throughout the 1990s, and then declines in the early 2000s. The difference between

the number of people in one wave in year t and the next wave in year t+1 is an approximate death

and attrition rate across years.

        The health questions asked about in the MCBS are shown in Table 2. The questions are

generally the same for the community population and the institutional population, with the

exception that the institutionalized are not asked about three IADLs limitations – light

housework, preparing meals, and heavy lifting. The tabulations in table 1 are for people

interviewed in 1991-2007. On average, 5 percent of people are in a nursing home.

       Functional limitations are most common. Sixty-nine percent of the community-dwelling

population report difficulty stooping, crouching, or kneeling, along with 93 percent of the

institutionalized. For other questions, positive responses are reported by a quarter to a half of the

population. Very severe physical impairments such as help needed bathing or toileting are very

                                                    7
common for the institutionalized, but rare in the community. The same is true about social

indicators such as managing money and shopping, with the exception that there is significant

difficulty doing heavy housework among people living in the community. About one-third of

both groups report difficulties seeing or hearing.

       Figure 2 shows the trend in health for each of the dimensions identified in Table 2, along

with the share of people living in a nursing home. For each dimension, we determine the share

of people who report having being impaired in at least one specific item, in each year of the data.

For example, our ADL trend is the share of people in each year who report at least one ADL

impairment. In this analysis, we do not distinguish between one or more than one impairment.

Our models in the next section will do so.

       There are very different patterns for the different dimensions of health. The share of

people who are in a nursing home, who have an ADL or IADL impairment, or who have a

sensory impairment has declined over time. The decline in nursing home residence is about 30

percent. The reduction in ADL impairment is also about 30 percent, while the reduction in

IADL impairment is about 20 percent. Sensory impairments declined by 24 percent. The share

of the population with functional limitations, in contrast, was relatively flat.

       The Appendix shows the specific items that contribute to the trends for each dimension.

There is surprisingly little variation within the specific items in each domain. Almost all of the

ADL and IADL impairments have declined, as have both of the sensory impairments. Most of

the functional limitations have been relatively flat, as have the two cognitive measures. This

suggests that the grouping shown in Figure 1 may be relatively accurate as a true description of

elderly health. We turn to this next.

II.    The Dimensions of Elderly Health

       As noted above, most research defines disability as a binary variable based on the self-

report of any ADL or IADL impairment. While simple to implement, this measure lacks a

theoretically rigorous foundation. Moreover, a binary measure does not capture heterogeneity in

the population. For many purposes, we care about the distribution of health in addition to the

proportion with any specific limitation. At the same time, there is a literature (e.g. Verbrugge

and Jette, 1994) arguing for a distinction between functional status (measures of specific physical

functioning) and disability (the ability to engage in the activities typically expected of a person).

Within this latter spirit, we examine the different dimensions of health among the elderly.

       The optimal way to combine the different measures depends on the purpose for which the

data are being used. If one were interested in forecasting medical spending, for example, one

would weight the questions by how much they are associated with medical service use. We

propose a less structural version and simply ask the question: how many domains summarize the

health impairments that people have? Those domains can then be used to assess the health status

of the elderly. To do this, we will use factor analysis to characterize responses into different

domains of functioning.

       Formally, denote yij as the response to question j for individual i. Suppose there are J

questions total (J=19 in our setting). We imagine that these health states are a linear function of

K different unobserved or latent factors, denoted Fik. We fit a latent variable model of the form

(e.g., Bartholomew, 1987; and Knol and Berger, 1991):



       yij = γ0j + γ1jFi1 + γ2jFi2 + γ3jFi3 + … + γKjFiK,                             (1)




                                                  10
where yij is a 0 or 1 outcome variable, γ0j is a threshold parameter that accounts for varying

prevalence of limitations in the population (for example, limitations climbing stairs are more

common that limitations in bathing) and the γkj’s are factor loadings that describe the relationship

between unobserved factor k and question j. Unobserved factors are assumed to follow a

Multivariate Normal distribution. The latent variable model described by (1) is similar to the

factor analyses and Grade of Membership models that have been previously used to describe

dimensions of disability (Lamb, 1996; Manton et al., 1998; Woodbury et al., 1978; Manton et al.,

1994).

         We can fit this model provided K<J. Empirically, because the data tend to be highly

correlated and we have 19 dimensions of health, a small number of factors is associated with a

wide range of variation in the data.

         Table 3 shows the results of the factor analysis on community-dwelling elderly over the

1991-2007 time period. By the usual criterion of eigenvalues greater than 1, there are three

significant factors. These three also have natural economic and demographic interpretations.

We thus work with those three.

                          from 1991-2007. The sample includes 211,952
                          observations.

        To aid in interpretation, we consider rotations of the factors that maximize the loading of

individual measures into single factors while also allowing correlation between latent factors.

Specifically, we use an oblique rotation of the three factor scores (promax=3). The predicted

factor scores are positively correlated. The correlation between factors 1 and 2 is .428, between

1 and 3 is .251, and between 2 and 3 is .242.

        Figure 3 shows plots of the (rotated) first factor against factors 2 and 3. These plots are

primarily useful to see the individual items that are loading most highly on each dimension. The

first factor encompasses largely ADL and IADL limitations, with heavy loading on all of the

ADLs and IADLs such as shopping, light housework, and preparing meals. The second factor is

largely associated with functional limitations and related IADLs, including difficulty walking,

lifting, stooping, reading, and doing heavy housework. The third factor is concentrated in

sensory impairments, including both vision and hearing.

         For each individual, we predict their score on each of the three dimensions. Figure 4

shows trends in factor scores over the 1991-2006 time period. By definition, the factor scores

are normalized to mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Thus, a decline of .1 is a reduction of .1

standard deviation. Corresponding to figure 2, there are large declines in factor 1 (ADL and

IADL limitations) and factor 3 (sensory impairment) over time. Factor 2 declines in the early

years of the sample, picking up the reduction in IADLs and ADLs that enter factor 2.

         We next plot the factor scores by age. If all of the health improvement were at younger

elderly ages, the explanation would likely fall in the medical and environmental factors that

influence health of the working age population. Conversely, improvements in health at older

ages raise the possibility that conditions at those older ages are the driving factor (though they

don’t prove it, as the literature on the impact of in utero conditions shows; Barker, 1992).

         Figure 5 shows the trend in each of the three factor scores by age. Health improvements

in factors 1 and 3 are prevalent at all ages. For example, the reduction in factor 1 is 0.1 (.1

standard deviation) for people aged 65-69 and 0.38 for people aged 85+.

       Since there are more young elderly than old elderly, the contribution of the older elderly

to the reduction in total disability is perhaps overstated. Another metric is to evaluate the share

of the total improvement in the health of the elderly is accounted for by improvements in the

health of each age group. At any time period t, F(t) = Σa pct(a,t) * F(a,t), where pct(a,t) is the

percent of the population at time t that is in age group a. The contribution of age group a to the

total change in health between two time periods is then pct(a,0)*ΔF(a), and the total change in

the population is Σa pct(a,0)*ΔF(a). The ratio of those two, pct(a,0)*ΔF(a) / Σa pct(a,0)*ΔF(a), is

the contribution of health improvements at age group a to the total change in population health.

       Figure 6 shows these contribution shares for factors 1 and 3, the dimensions on which

health is improving most significantly, along with the population distribution by age. For both

factors 1 and 3, the oldest old contribute disproportionately to health improvements. People aged

85 and older are 14 percent of the population in 1991 but account for 30 to 50 percent of the

health improvement. This suggests that late life health and social conditions may be important

contributors to population health. At minimum, any theory of health improvement will have to

account for this age differential.

III.   Explaining the Improvement in Health

       The central economic challenge is to understand why health improves in so many

dimensions. We consider two explanations for improved health. The first explanation is

composition change: people with severe health impairments may be more likely to die or

transition into a nursing home over time. Alternatively, new entrants to the survey may be

healthier than the people they replace. Either of these situations would improve the health of the

community-dwelling population because of selection. Second, people may be impaired along the

same dimensions, but impairment may not progress to more severe stages as frequently as it did

formerly, either because of person-specific aging trends (e.g., richer people can manage their

chronic conditions better), or because of population-wide shocks (a new treatment for vision

impairment).

       Figure 7 shows a schematic of the model that we estimate. We start off with the

community-dwelling population in year t. Between t and t+1, two things happen. First, the

sample changes. Some people leave the sample, either through death, loss to follow-up, or

nursing home entry, and others enter. The combination of these two transitions is the

composition effect. Second, new health shocks occur (for example, a heart attack or diagnosis of

cancer) and old health conditions exert an effect on health. An example of the latter is a

continued deterioration that might occur from untreated arthritis. The combination of

composition changes and health changes among the existing population yields the new

population health at t+1.

       Composition Change

       We now show the equations that we model, starting with the composition change.

Denote Fkit as the factor score in dimension k for person i in year t; Fit is the vector of factor

scores for person i in year t. The equations for nursing home entry (NH), death (Die), and loss to

follow-up (Loss) are given by:



       NHit+1 = FitαNH + Xit+1θNH + μNHit+1                                                    (2)

       Dieit+1 = FitαDie + Xit+1θDie + μDieit+1                                                (3)

       Lossit+1 = FitαLoss + Xit+1θLoss + μLossit+1                                            (4)



where i denotes individuals and t is year. In a general specification, the μ·it error terms might be

correlated. For simplicity, we assume they are not.

       For new entrants, the issue is whether people who are new to the survey are healthier than

those who continue. We estimate this as follows:



       Fkit = Xitθk + πk1Wave1 + μkit                                                          (5)


                                                      17
where Wave1 is a dummy for the first year in the survey. To the extent that new entrants at any

age are more or less healthy than people of the same age but who are continuing in the survey,

the coefficient π1 will be different from zero.



       Health Trends Within Individuals

       We then consider the model for health of the continuing population. We describe the

evolution of health for the surviving, community-dwelling population as:



       Fkit = α0ik + α1ik t + α2ik hit + Yeart γk + εkit                                     (6)



The factor score for an individual depends on their demographics (α0ik), aging (t), new and

ongoing health shocks (hit), and year dummy variables (γk).

       It is natural for α0ik to vary in the population, for both measurable reasons (older people

are sicker than younger people) and unmeasurable reasons (random differences across

individuals). Similarly, aging and health shocks may affect different people differently.

Generally, we parameterize αjik (j=0, 1, and 2 – corresponding to the three α terms in equation

(6)) as follows:



       αjik = βj0k + Xit βj1k + Periodit βj2k + ξjik                                  (7)



Equation (7) relates the level and trend in health to a constant, person-specific factors, and the

time period.




                                                       18
        In principle, the εkit errors may be correlated (factor scores in different domains), as might

the ξjik errors (coefficients on different control variables). A general formulation would model

these as ε ~ N(0, Σ) and ξ ~ N(0, Ψ). For this analysis, we assume that the ε’s are independent,

as are the ξ’s. Also for simplicity, we assume that the only coefficients that vary over people are

α0ik and α1ik – the constant term and the coefficient on the time trend. We parameterize α0ik as

depending on demographics and an error term (i.e. α0ik = β00k + Xit β01k + ξ0ik) and the β12k as

differing in three time periods: 1991-96; 1997-2001; and 2002-07 (i.e. α1ik = β10k + Periodit β12k +

ξ1ik). Finally, for this analysis, we leave out the health measures hit. We do this not because they

are unimportant, but because we wish to focus on the aging effect α1ik. We therefore estimate

β00k, β01k, β10k, β12k, var(ξ0ik), and var(ξ1ik).

        Our X vector consists of basic demographics. We include dummy variables for age and

gender (a dummy for aged 65-69,70-74, 75-79, 80-84, and 85+ interacted with gender), and a

dummy for non-whites. We also include year dummy variables. Future work could naturally

incorporate a richer array of variables, including health shocks to the individual and other family

members, changes in socioeconomic status such as reductions in income or wealth, and

environmental conditions.



IV.     Composition Change

        All three exits from the community sample are common. About 1.5 percent of the elderly

population transitions into a nursing home in any year. This is smaller than the share of people

who are living in a nursing home at a point in time (around 5 to 6 percent) because of the long-

stayers. We also exclude from this analysis people who died between one survey wave and the

next, since we do not know about nursing home utilization for them. About 4 percent of the



                                                    19
population dies in any year (this is among the community-dwelling sample; a larger share of the

institutionalized population dies). Finally, about 12 percent of the population is lost to follow-up

each year. This share is particularly high early in the sample, when the initial population was

purposely phased out. Outside of those years, the average loss to follow-up is about 10 percent.

        The primary question we explore is whether people who are sicker (that is, score higher

on the factor score) depart the sample more frequently, and whether this is particularly likely to

occur over time. Thus, we interact the factor scores in equations (2)-(4) with the period dummies

noted above: 1991-96, 1997-01, 2002-06. We then test whether being sick has a greater effect

on sample exit in later years of the sample.

        Table 3 shows the estimates of death, transitions to a nursing home, or loss to follow-up.

Since we have repeat observations on the same individual, we cluster the standard errors by

individual – as we do in table 5 as well. In the first column, factor 1 is particularly predictive of

mortality. An increase of 1 standard deviation raises mortality rates by 3 percent. Factor 1 is

mildly more predictive of death in the later years of the sample than the earlier years. An F-test

rejects that that the coefficients in later years are the same as in earlier years. But the

quantitative difference is not large, .4 percentage points.

        We determine the quantitative impact of this change on the health of survivors using a

simulation model. Specifically, we draw uniform random numbers and simulate for each person

death under the coefficients in the early time period, and then again using the coefficients in the

later time period, but keeping the X’s the same as in the early time period. We then average

health of the survival group in each case. We estimate that the average score on factor 1 would

decline by .004 because of the increased propensity of the sick to die. Given an overall decline




                                                  20
in factor 1 of .072 between the early and late time periods, mortality selection can explain only 5

percent of the decline in factor 1 over time.

       In the models for nursing home entry, shown in the second column, factor 1 is

particularly predictive of transitions into a nursing home. This corresponds to severe physical or

social impairment. Factors 2 and 3 (functional limitations and sensory impairment), in contrast,

have relatively little impact on nursing home transitions. The coefficient on factor 1 declines a

bit, implying that sicker people are more likely to be in the community in later years of the

sample.

       The third column shows the model for loss to follow-up. If appropriate effort is put into

follow-up, loss to follow-up should be approximately random. Somewhat surprisingly, this is

not true in the data. Higher scores on factor 1 (that is, worse health) predicts loss to follow-up,

while those with sensory impairments are somewhat less likely to be lost to follow-up. These

coefficients are relatively small, however, and do not vary much over time.

       We evaluate the combined impact of these three sources of sample attrition using the

simulation noted above. We draw random variables to predict death, nursing home entry, and

loss to follow-up and then simulate the community-dwelling population under the coefficients in

the early years of the sample and the later years of the sample. The simulation shows that factor

1 for the community-dwelling population would decline by .006 as a result of selection, or 8

percent of the total decline. For factor 3, the predicted change is only 1 percent of the total

improvement.

       The regressions in table 3 have year dummies included, and these year dummies are

graphed in figure 8. Generally, the year dummies are relatively flat – death and nursing home

entry are no more or less likely over time, conditional on health status and demographics. As

noted above, loss to follow-up is high in two years of the sample (1991 and 1994) and constant

in other years.

                                     sample. Table 3 describes the model.



                 The final component of composition change is the changing health of new enrollees to

the survey. We estimate equation (5) interacting the wave 1 dummy variable with dummy

variables for early, middle, and late periods of the sample. We then examine whether people in

the first wave of the survey are increasingly healthy over time.

                 Table 4 shows the results. The three columns show averages for factors 1, 2, and 3

respectively. New entrants to the survey are less healthy than existing members along factor 1,

but healthier in the second dimension. In both cases, the coefficients are relatively small.

Furthermore, the factor 1 and 3 coefficients are somewhat increasing over time. That is, health

of new entrants is on average deteriorating relative to the health of existing members across the

years.

       The implication of these transition models is therefore that the improving health of the

community-based population is not attributable to changes in the sample of people living in the

community, or picked up by the MCBS. By residual, then, it must be the case that the same

population is increasingly healthy over time.



V.     The Evolution of Health Among Community-Dwellers

       In this section, we turn to the evolution of health among the community-dwelling

population. Specifically, we estimate the model given by equations (6) and (7). Given the

results above, our primary focus is on the time trend, and how that varies in the early, middle,

and later years of the sample.




                                                 24
       Table 5 shows the models health trends. The three columns correspond to models for the

three different factors. Within each model, we present the average aging effect (β10k) and the

standard deviation of that coefficient. There are also year dummies in the model, and these are

shown in Figure 9.

                     Survey. Demographic controls include age-sex
                     dummies (ages 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, 85+, by
                     gender), and a dummy for non-white. Standard errors
                     are clustered by individual.



       The averages show considerable decline in health as a person ages. For example, factor 1

increases by .065 each year (.065 standard deviations) during the early phase of the sample, and

factor 3 increases by .019 each year.

       The rate of decline in health has slowed over time. Relative to the increase in factor 1 of

.065 each year, as shown in the first time period, the increase is only .034 in the more recent time

                                                25
period. This reduction, which occurs after 1997, accounts for a large change in health over time.

Had the decrement to health stayed the same after 1996 as before 1996, health in 2007 would

have been one-third of a standard deviation worse. Another way to show the impact of this

change is to consider the year effects in figure 8. While there are strong year trends in factors 1

and 2 up through 1996, there are no consistent year trends afterwards.

                  Health in the third dimension also deteriorates less rapidly over time, with roughly the

same pattern. Factor 3 increases by 0.019 per year in the early time period, and then declines by

.016 per year in the later time period. There is an unexplained year trend in the early time period

and again between 2001 and 2003. Other than those time periods, there is little aggregate drift.

                  Not only does the rate of decline in health slow, but health is actually estimated to

improve for many people. The standard deviations of health trends, shown in the middle rows of

table 5, are large. The standard deviation of .19 for factor 1 in the early time period implies that

                                                               26
the 95 percent interval for the impact of aging is -.32 to +.44. There are clearly many people

whose health is improving, even while health is deteriorating on average.



V.     Conclusions and Next Steps

       Our results provide important evidence on the well-noted decline in disability in the

elderly population. We show that health has several dimensions: one that is largely severe

physical and social impairment; a second that is less severe physical limitations; and a third that

encompasses sensory impairments. The first and third of these dimensions are improving over

time, while the second is not.

       The reason for the improvement in health is complex. On the one hand, the health

improvement is not a result of sample or demographic changes. Younger people are healthier

than younger people used to be, but the same is true of older people. Rather, health is improving

because individual health deteriorates less rapidly now than in the past. We do not know exactly

why this occurs, but we show that the average trend masks significant heterogeneity. Even as

health deteriorates overall as people age, health is improving for a significant minority of people.

       The next step is to develop a richer model of the change in health over time. To what

extent is the improvement in health a result of fewer new conditions developing, existing

problems being cared for better, or changes in the social and environmental circumstances that

the elderly face? Considering these questions is a fruitful area for further study.
