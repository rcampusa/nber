Does Partisan Conflict Deter FDI Inflows to the US?

                                          ABSTRACT

I analyze how partisan conflict about trade policy affects foreign direct investment flows to the
US using a novel indicator, the Trade Partisan Conflict Index (TPCI). Partisan conflict is relevant
for the evolution of cross-border capital flows because the expected returns on investment
projects are less predictable when the timing, size, and composition of trade policy is uncertain.
The trade partisan conflict index tracks the evolution of political disagreement among
policymakers on topics such as tariffs, subsidies, and trade agreements as reported by the media.
Using data from 1985 to 2016, I show that an innovation of the PCI is associated with a
significant decline in FDI flows to the US. The effect is also present when disaggregated (annual)
data from a panel of parent countries is considered instead.

1       Introduction
Direct investment positions in the US (as percentages of GDP) have grown considerably since
the 1980s, as shown in Figure 1. Moreover, direct investment flows constitute a considerable
fraction of cross-border transactions. For example, U.S. direct investment flows in 2013 com-
posed about half of the total U.S. net acquisition of foreign financial assets, and foreign direct
investment flows were about 20 percent of the total foreign net acquisition of U.S. financial
assets.1 There is an extensive empirical literature studying the determinants of capital in-
flows, that has mostly centered on macroeconomic conditions, monetary and exchange rate
policy, geographic proximity, and institutional factors (see Faeth, 2009 for a survey of the
literature). In this paper, I focus on political disagreement instead. More specifically, I study
whether partisan conflict on trade policy deters foreign direct investment.

    Partisan conflict is relevant for the evolution of foreign direct investment flows to the
US because the expected returns of investment projects become less predictable when policy
is uncertain. Foreign direct investors typically have a long time horizon when operating
abroad. They are less informed about the policy environment and may be treated differently
than domestic investors (Battacharya, Galpin, and Haslem 2007). Moreover, FDI cannot be
easily reversed without paying large costs (Rivoli and Salorio, 1996). Hence, forward-looking
foreign investors must be constantly anticipating how changes in trade policy could affect the
expected returns of their investments and/or their barriers to enter and exit the US market.
    Following the large contraction in cross border investment flows during the 2008 Financial
Crisis and its unusually slow recovery from the Great Recession (see Figure 2), together with
the high levels of uncertainty caused by the political climate in the US, the detrimental effects
of policy uncertainty gained interest as a possible explanation (Julio and Yook, 2016).2 The
standard approach in this literature uses the timing of elections to measure variations in policy
uncertainty (see Durnev, 2010 and Julio and Yook, 2012, 2016). While this provides a quasi-
natural experiment in a panel of countries, it may confound the effects of uncertainty with
those that naturally arise under the ‘political business cycle’ (Nordhaus, 1975). According

    Even though FDI net inflows have been positive for most of the sample, we see a large disinvestment in
the first quarter of 2014 (of around 1.7% of GDP). An OECD report on FDI published on December 2014
states that ’The drop in FDI in the first quarter was mainly due to a single deal involving a company in the
United Kingdom selling a company in the United States to another US company causing both outward FDI
from the United Kingdom and inward FDI to the United States to fall.’ Note that negative values of FDIUS
represent net inflows where divestment was greater than investment in a given quarter. For more details, see

to the original political business cycle theory, policymakers have incentives to stimulate the
economy prior to an election. If investors are naive, they would increase investment in
response. If they are forward-looking, as suggested by more recent theories (see Canes-Wron
Park, 2011), they may reduce investment in expectation of higher taxes used to pay for the
stimulus policy after elections take place. Regardless of the direction, this potential response
makes it difficult to disentangle the effect of uncertainty from that of the political cycle around
elections. Moreover, the political climate may also affect FDI in off-election periods. To the
extent policymakers disagree on the details trade agreement (such as NAFTA) or protectionist
policies (such as an increase in steel tariffs), uncertainty over the policy to be implemented
can affect the behavior of foreign investors. In this paper, in addition to using the timing of
elections, I also consider an important underlying cause of political uncertainty: the degree of
conflict between actors determining policy itself. To that end, I develop the Trade Partisan
Conflict Index (TPCI), which tracks the frequency of newspaper articles reporting political
disagreement on trade policy in a given month. Higher index values indicate greater conflict
among political parties, Congress, and the President. The index rises not only when elections
take place (and trade policy is discussed during the campaign), but also around well-known
policy debates such as those surrounding international trade agreements such as GATT,


                                                                                                                                                         3
NAFTA, and TPP, as well as the implementation of barriers to imports (such as the steel
import quota of 1999), and measures that may affect the returns to cross-country capital flows.
Hence, it is a complementary measure of political uncertainty to the timing of elections or
political turnover. Because it is measured at the monthly level, it allows us to identify the
effects of uncertainty at shorter frequencies than alternative uncertainty proxies. Relative to
other similar measures of uncertainty, such as the Partisan Conflict Index (PCI) developed
by Azzimonti (2018) or the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index developed by Baker,
Bloom, and Davis (2015), it has the advantage of capturing uncertainty about information
that is potentially more relevant for FDI, namely trade policy. Finally, since the measure is
based on political disagreement as reported by the media, it is potentially a good summary
statistic of the information used by foreign investors to make decisions and update their
expectations.3
    The first empirical model aims at estimating the effect of TPCI on foreign direct invest-
ment from the rest of the world as a percentage of the existing position at the beginning
of a given quarter. I include standard control variables, such as trade openness, changes in
the exchange rate, the level of inflation, the growth rate of GDP, the federal funds rate, and
whether Presidential elections are held. I find that a one standard deviation increase in PCI
at a given quarter results in about 0.127 standard-deviation decline in investment flows (as
percentage of the position in the country) in the following quarter. This corresponds to about
a 8.9% decline in FDI flows from it sample mean. Since TPCI may not be the only source of
political uncertainty, I also consider the effects of PCI and EPU together with TPCI in an
augmented model. I find that the result is robust to introducing these variables. Finally, I
also consider alternative measures of expectations typically used in the literature to reduce
potential omitted variable bias (such as consumer confidence and predictions regarding GDP
growth), but these do not significantly alter the results.
    I also study investment flows to the US disaggregated by country of origin (e.g parent
country).4 I consider a panel of 38 countries with annual data over the period 1985-2016.
The multi-country model specification includes country specific control variables (such as
the growth rate of the parent country, its inflation rate and changes in the degree of trade
openness), pair-specific variables (such as changes in the bilateral exchange rate and bilateral
trade with the US), US-centric variables (those used in the aggregate specification above),
   3
      See Azzimonti (2017) for a theoretical model linking partisan conflict to political uncertainty. Moderate
levels of partisan conflict are positively related to economic policy uncertainty. There is a threshold point
in which additional increases in PCI actually reduce uncertainty about policy (e.g. the relationship between
PCI and EPU is inverted u-shaped). Investors still react negatively to gridlock because they expect the
government to choose inefficient policies when partisan conflict is high (by, for example, not reacting soon
enough to negative shocks). Empirically, neither the PCI nor the TPCI allow us to disentangle the effects
of gridlock (which can potentially actually be positive in some cases) from those of uncertainty. Developing
separate indexes is an interesting avenue of future research.

      Reverse causality is typically an issue in models trying to address the effects of political uncertainty on
domestic investment, as policymakers may disagree about economic policy (which implies high levels of the
PCI) in periods where investment is low because of its effects on the government budget. This is less likely to
be a problem with FDI, as foreign investment does not significantly affect government revenues. It is even less
likely that changes in foreign investment from a specific parent country would consistently affect the aggregate
level of disagreement across policymakers in the US.



                                                       4
and country specific fixed-effects (to control for time invariant country characteristics such
as geographic and language proximity). I find that a one-standard deviation increase in PCI
is associated, on average, with a 0.04 standard-deviation decline in FDI flows as a percentage
of the positions in the US in a given year.
    Finally, I also consider whether countries in different geographical regions or with dif-
ferent degrees of economic development have an heterogeneous response to changes in the
trade partisan conflict index. I find that Canada and Mexico (both included in the NAFTA
agreement) have a smaller reaction than other countries to increases in TPCI. Among those
other countries, Middle-Eastern, East Asian, and Latin American countries have a stronger
reaction to rises in TPCI than Canada and Mexico. This is not the case for European and
South-East Asian countries. Finally, I find that emerging economies (e.g. those not in the
OECD) reduce FDI inflows to the US by a larger amount when TPCI rises than OECD
countries do.



Related Literature The result is consistent with predictions from the theoretical literature
studying the effects of policy uncertainty on aggregate investment (Bernanke, 1983; Bloom,
2009; Fernández-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramı́rez, 2010; Stokey, 2016; Bloom, Bond, and Van
Reenen, 2007; Pindyck and Solimano, 1993). These theories suggest that in periods of high
variability of fiscal policy, economic agents delay hiring, investment, and production decisions.
Canes-Wrone and Park (2011) connect increases in policy uncertainty with the electoral cycle,
arguing that agents have incentives to delay decisions subject to large reversibility costs before
polarized elections. Azzimonti and Talbert (2013) suggest that political disagreement affects
economic decisions. They show that polarization increases induce policy uncertainty, causing
long run investment to decline. Azzimonti (2017) shows a similar result under imperfect
information on the degree of partisan conflict. While most of these studies center on domestic
investment, their logic can be easily extended to a framework of foreign direct investment
facing uncertainty about trade policy. Rodrik (1991) models FDI choices explicitly under
political uncertainty in an environment where agents face uncertainty about the success of
a political reform. He shows that foreign investors delay investing until the uncertainty
is resolved. This paper contributes to the literature by showing an empirical relationship
between political uncertainty, proxied by the TPCI, and foreign direct investment.
    This is not the first paper relating political risk to cross-border investment flows empir-
ically. Basi (1963) was among the first to show that political stability is one of the most
important determinants of FDI flows. Schneider and Frey (1985) document that political
instability significantly affects cross-border flows in developing countries, whereas Singh and
Jun (1995) show that political risk affects countries that have attracted high foreign direct
investment flows in the past. Wei (2000) finds that the degree of corruption in the parent
country reduces FDI flows significantly, Loree and Guisinger (1995) show political stabili-
ty affects FDI outflows, and Li and Resnick (2003) that democratic institutions affect FDI
flows in a panel of countries.5 More recently, Busse and Hefeker (2007) show that govern-
   5
     An exception to these studies is Grosse and Trevino (1996), who find that political risk in the parent
country does not effect FDI inflows to the US.


                                                    5
ment stability, internal and external conflict, corruption and ethnic tensions, law and order,
democratic accountability of government, and quality of bureaucracy are highly significant
determinants of foreign investment inflows. Finally, Julio and Yook (2016) show that FDI
flows from US companies to foreign affiliates drop significantly during the period just before
an election is held in the destination country.
    While this paper complements the results of this literature, there are two main departures.
First, I focus on the effect of political uncertainty over trade policy in the US to FDI inflows to
the country, whereas most of the literature centered attention on outflows to other countries
experiencing uncertainty. Second, I construct a novel indicator of political uncertainty on
trade policy constructed from newspaper articles and use to quantify the effects of political
disagreement on FDI inflows. The trade partisan conflict index is potentially a more suitable
measure of the type of uncertainty faced by foreign investors than proxies previously used
in the literature such as political stability (e.g. turnover of the party in power), corruption,
economic policy uncertainty, and partisan conflict.
    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes how the trade partisan conflict
index is constructed. Section 3 analyzes the effects of political uncertainty on the aggregate
inflows of foreign direct investment to the US. The empirical model summarized in Section
3.1 and the results described in Section 3.2. Section 4 studies investment flows to the US by
country of origin, whereas Section 4.4 allows for the possibility of heterogeneous responses.
Section 5 concludes.


2       Trade Partisan Conflict Index
The Trade Partisan Conflict Index (TPCI) is a sub-index of the benchmark PCI developed by
Azzimonti (2018).6 It tracks the degree of political disagreement about trade policy among
U.S. policymakers by measuring the frequency of newspaper articles related to the topic in a
given month. The benchmark PCI, computed in Azzimonti (2018), quantifies the degree of
general disagreement between policymakers (either across party lines or within a party) about
fiscal policy and regulation by following coverage of ideologically divisive issues, polarization,
gridlock in Congress, and presidential vetoes to legislative measures, among others. The
Trade PCI developed in this paper restricts attention to a subset of those articles explicitly
discussing foreign trade—agreements and policy—, which are potentially more relevant to
foreign investors.
    The database from which newspaper information is extracted is Factiva (by Dow Jones)
and covers major US newspapers over the interval 1981:Q1-2016:Q1. Table 9 in Appendix
6.1 contains a complete list of sources. The top newspapers included in the search are The
Washington Post, The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, The Wall
Street Journal, Newsday, The Dallas Morning News, The Boston Globe, and Tampa Bay
Times.
    The TPCI is computed in a similar way to the benchmark PCI. I first count the number of
articles that contain terms related to disagreement between political parties, political actors

(e.g. candidates running for office), and branches of government (legislators in Congress, State
Governors, and the President) about trade policy in a given month. The articles selected
contain at least one keyword in the following three categories: (i) political disagreement, (ii)
government, and (iii) trade policy. The specific terms used in each category are listed below
    Political Disagreement: standstill, stalemate, gridlock, disagreement, fail to compro-
mise, polarization, polarized, dysfunctional, ideological difference(s), deadlock, budget battle
(or fight), filibuster, standoff, veto, vetoes, vetoing, delay /oppose bill.7
    Government: White House, senate, senator, Capitol, Congress, congressman(woman),
party, partisan, Republican, GOP, Democrat, political, politician, legislator, lawmaker, “the
President,” Appropriation Committee, Finance Committee, Ways and Means Committee,
federal government.
    Trade Policy: trade policy (policies, act, agreement, or treaty), trade subsidies, import
tariff (barrier, duty, or duties), import tariff (or barrier or subsidy, or duty), export tariff (or
subsidy), dumping, wto, world trade organization, gatt, Doha round, Uruguay round.
    I focus on articles including keywords at the intersection of these three categories, as
illustrated by the darker area of Figure 3. The benchmark PCI, on the other hand, includes
articles at the intersection of the Political Disagreement and Government sets.

                             Figure 3: Representation of Boolean search.

     In the search, the terms are separated by a small number of words in the article (using the
Boolean term ‘near’ or ‘within’ 3 to 5 words depending on context). I also apply some specific
filters. For example, I restrict the Boolean search to articles related to the US and written
   7
   In addition, I also search for specific terms related to partisan conflict, such as “partisan divisions,”
and “divided Congress.” Note that the search involves terms related to the political debate (e.g., “fail to
compromise”), as well as the outcome of the partisan warfare (e.g. “gridlock” and “filibuster”).



                                                     7
in English.8 This is the case because it reduces the possibility of capturing news about trade
agreements not involving the US (such as the European Union and Brexit). Routine general
news, reviews, interviews, etc. are also excluded in order to reduce the incidence of false
positives. A comprehensive list of filters applied can be found in Appendix 6.2. Articles with
less than 200 words and republished news are excluded (this is standard in the semantics
literature, the latter to avoid double-counting). Note that the search is performed on full
articles, not just titles or abstracts.
    The raw trade partisan conflict count is then divided by the total number of articles in
the same newspapers over the same time interval. This number is obtained by counting the
number of articles containing the word “today” in a given month.9 Finally, the measure is
normalized to average 100 in the year 1990. This normalization is without loss of generality,
and the year 1990 is chosen to simplify comparisons with the benchmark PCI.
    Intuitively, higher index values capture greater conflict among political parties, Congress,
and the President on trade-related policies and regulation.

      Using a semantic algorithm, Factiva attaches an indexes to the region most related to any given article. I
filter out those that are indexed as most related to countries/regions other than the US. This set will therefore
include not only articles to the US but also those which have not been coded.
    9
      Using the word “the” to count the total number of articles instead causes no noticeable difference in the
index.

2.1    Evolution of Trade PCI
Figure 4 depicts the evolution of the trade partisan conflict index between 1981 and 2016
obtained from the search. The mean value of TPCI in the sample is 89.9, with a standard
deviation of 59. The series has mostly fluctuated around a constant mean throughout the
period of study, and exhibited relatively low volatility between 2005 and 2014.
    The highest value of 523 was observed on November 1993, month in which the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was debated and eventually passed by Congress
in the US. The agreement established the world’s largest free trade zone at the time, and
was signed into a Bill after much consideration and emotional debate in the US House of
Representatives. This is illustrated in Appendix 6.3, which contains an excerpt of an LA
Times article retrieved from the search in Factiva. It is worth noticing that the large value
in the index was obtained despite the fact that NAFTA was not included among the terms
of the search.
    The second largest spike is observed in September 1985, month in which members of
the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) agreed to start negotiations on free
trade (which then lead to the Uruguay round starting in 1986).10 The final noticeable spike
surrounds the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) debate, particularly during June 2015 when
the Bill was first rejected by House Democrats, but fast-track authority was subsequently
given by the Senate to President Obama near the end of the month.
    Overall, we can see that the series increases when contentious changes in trade regulation
(through international treaties) are discussed by policymakers, as well as in months when
trade policy is a subject of pre-election debated. Two clear examples are: (i) the period
leading to the 1992 Presidential election between George Bush and Bill Clinton, and (ii) the
Republican primary of 1996, with Pat Buchanan’s anti free-trade rhetoric ‘Putting Americans
First.’

2.2    Trade PCI vs alternative measures of political uncertainty
The methodology used to calculate TCPI is similar to that used by Azzimonti (2018) to
compute the Partisan Conflict Index and that of Backer, Bloom, and Davis (2016) to compute
Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU). It is illustrative to compare the behavior of TCPI to
these alternative measures of political uncertainty.
    The search terms in the first two categories (Political Disagreement and Government) are
identical to those used to compute the benchmark PCI. Because the newspapers included in
the database and the filters applied are exactly the same, Trade PCI is, strictly speaking, a
sub-component of the benchmark PCI series. Figure 5 depicts the monthly TPCI together
with the benchmark PCI. The first thing to note is that TPCI is much more volatile than
PCI. This is the case because disagreement over trade policy is discussed less often than
other fiscal policies and regulations such as taxes, debt, and welfare programs. Moreover,
  10
    Also, during that month, ‘President Reagan outlined a trade policy consisting of three parts: tough action
against other nations’ unfair trade practices, negotiations to liberalize world trade, and international economic
policy reforms’ (Office of the United States Trade Representative, 1986). His position generated much debate
among policymakers.

the discussions are typically centered around very specific events, NAFTA being the most
noticeable one. A second difference is that while the benchmark PCI exhibits a structural
break after the Great Recession, the TPCI fluctuates around a constant mean during the
whole sample. The correlation between the monthly indexes over the whole period is just
0.20.
     Figure 6 depicts TPCI and EPU over time. Note that since EPU is computed only
since 1985, the plot starts on that year. As with PCI, we can observe that TPCI is more
volatile than EPU for most of the sample, with the exception of the period 2008-2014 when
it is actually smaller than EPU. The two series are basically uncorrelated over time, with a
correlation coefficient of −0.03.

2.3   Trade PCI and the economy
Figure 7 shows the TPCI (left axis, solid line) together with the Output Gap (right axis,
broken line) at the quarterly frequency between 1985:Q1 and 2016:Q1. The output gap is
computed as the difference between Real GDP and Potential Real GDP in billions of dollars.
The variables, which are only available at a quarterly frequency, are obtained from FRED
(see Appendix 6.4 for details). There is no clear pattern in the evolution of the two variables,
which exhibit a slightly positive correlation of just 0.17. For comparison, the correlation
between the benchmark PCI and the output gap is −0.4, whereas that between EPU and the

    There is, however, some seasonality in TPCI which is tyically higher in the 4th quarter of
every year. Whereas TCPI is on average 85 in the first three quarters, it reaches an average
of 107 in Q4. A simple t-test indicates that the null hypothesis of equal TPCI in the fourth
quarter to the one on the first three quarters is rejected. When a similar test is computed for

     Note that a negative output gap indicates that the economy is producing below capacity. Hence, a negative
correlation between the variable of interest and the output gap indicates counter-cyclicality, as these variable
rises during recessions.

the benchmark PCI and EPU, the null cannot be rejected (that is, there is no statistically
significant difference between the first three quarters and the last one). I considered the
possibility that such difference may be driven by the fact that elections are typically held in
the last quarter, and hence more conflict surrounded trade policy is observed at that time.
However, there is no difference (statistically speaking) between Presidential (and midterm)
election quarters and non-elections quarters.


3         Aggregate FDI inflows
This section describes the benchmark model used to estimate the effects of domestic political
discord on FDI inflows to the US using aggregate data. I consider investment flows to the
US by foreign investors from the rest of the world in the form of foreign direct investment.
The analysis comprises the period 1985:Q1 to 2016:Q1, with data measured at the quarterly
level.12

Foreign Direct Investment
The FDI dataset is obtained from the Flow of Funds, Balance Sheets, and Integrated Macroe-
conomic Accounts compiled by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US).
The information is contained in Table S.9.q of the ‘Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts for
the United States,’ in statistical releases ‘Z.1 Financial Accounts of the United States’ pro-
vided by the BEA. This dataset is based on internationally accepted set of guidelines for
the compilation of national accounts, and tries to harmonize the BEA National Income and
Product Accounts (NIPAs) and the Federal Reserve Board Flow of Funds Accounts (FFAs).
Foreign direct investment in the U.S. refers to ownership by a foreign country’s residents of
at least ten percent of a business in the US. The direct investor is known as a parent, and
the parent’s foreign business is known as a US-affiliate. The flow of foreign direct investment
in the United States will be referred to as FDIUS in the remainder if the analysis. These
flows capture the funds that foreign parents provide to their US-affiliates including equity
investment, intra-company loans, and reinvested earnings. FDI positions, which are reported
annually, measure the stock of foreign direct investment in the US at the end of a given year.
It corresponds to cumulative FDIUS, and will be referred to as Positions in the analysis. See
Appendix 6.4 for a direct link to the historical series of these variables.
    Table 1 summarizes FDI flows and levels in the US by the rest of the world (in US millions).
The quarterly average FDI inflow to the US is $ 151,237 million dollars, constituting 1.3% of
quarterly GDP and about 11% of the stock of FDI in the country (about $1,543,478 million
dollars).
    The evolution of FDI inflows as a percentage of FDI positions in the US can be seen in
Figure 8.

3.1    Model Specification
Following Baker, Foley and Wurgler (2009), the dependent variable is analyzed is F DItP ,
which corresponds to FDIUS (in a given quarter) scaled by the cumulative FDI position in
the US at the end of quarter t − 1,

   The benchmark specification is as follows

                                           F DItP = γ + α1 T P CIt + α2 T P CIt−1 + Z0t θ + QTR0t µ + t ,                                                                                                                                                                                                               (1)

where T P CI stands for the Trade Partisan Conflict Index, where we allow for both lagged
and contemporaneous effects. At a quarterly frequency, it is possible that news about parti-
san conflict over trade affect foreign investors with some delay (we would not expect this to
happen, for example, at an yearly frequency). The set of macroeconomic indicators is com-
posed of the following: Zt = {GDP grt , GAPt , ∆F Xt , πt , F Ft , ∆T radet , Et }. ALFRED, the
electronic database maintained by Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, is the primary source
of these variables. Summary statistics for these indicators are included in the top panel of
Table 2.
    GDP growth, GDP gr, controls for the state of the domestic economy; we expect FDI
inflows to be higher during booms than in recessions. I also include the output gap GAPt , an
alternative control for the business cycle. GAP is computed as the difference between real
and potential GDP in a given quarter. Changes in the exchange rate, ∆F X, affect the relative
wealth levels of foreign and domestic investors, leading to changes in foreign investors’ relative
purchasing power (see Klein and Rosengren, 1994). Good monetary policy that leads to low
inflation is likely to reduce the risk premium for foreign investment, and hence boost FDI
inflows. I also include the Federal Funds Rate, F Ft as an alternative measure of monetary
policy. Both inflation and the FF rate are introduced to control for other forms of policy
distortion such as monetary imbalances (see Busse and Hefeker, 2007).
                                     X+I
    Trade openness, measured as GDP       , can affect FDI inflows in two ways. First, trade
openness facilitates the import of foreign inputs needed for production in the US and makes
it easier to export the final product to other countries (increasing potential demand and
hence the returns to FDI). There are also externalities, as suggested by Lipsey and Weiss
(1984), by which a firm may expect its production presence in the US to generate demand
for other products of this firm (even if they were to be produced aborad). These factors
suggest that trade openness promotes FDI. Second, as noted by Markusen (1995) and others,
trade barriers may cause a substitution away from exports towards FDI. The intuition is that
the higher the tariff, for example, the more likely a foreign firm is to supply the US market
from US-affiliates rather than through exports. These factors suggest that trade openness
discourages FDI.
    Similarly to TPCI, Presidential elections may introduce policy uncertainty, and may dis-
courage FDI inflows (see Julio and Yook, 2016). Because the timing of elections is known
ex-ante, I introduce it as an additional control Et which equals 1 in the quarter in which a
Presidential election is held and zero otherwise. Summary statistics for T P CI and E can be
found in the bottom top panel of Table 2. Finally, in order to control for potential seasonal-
ity in FDI, a set of quarter-dummies are introduced. The vector QTRt encompasses three
dichotomic variables QTRt = {Q2,t , Q3,t , Q4,t }, with Q2,t = 1 in the second quarter and zero
otherwise (Q3,t and Q4,t are analogously defined).

3.2   Empirical Results
Table 3 reports the results. All variables have been normalized by their sample standard
deviation in order to simplify the interpretation of coefficients and ease comparison across
covariates. Each estimated coefficient represents how F DItP (normalized by its standard de-
viation) responds to a one-standard-deviation increase in the respective independent variable.

The first row denotes the estimated coefficient, while robust standard errors (corrected for
autocorrelation by using an AR(2) specification) are reported in parenthesis.
    Specification (1) corresponds to the regression eq. (1), where the dependent variable is the
ratio of FDI to lagged positions in the US. While contemporaneous Trade PCI is statistically
insignificant (that is, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that its estimated coefficient is
zero), lagged Trade PCI has a negative and significant coefficient. A one standard-deviation
increase in political discord regarding trade policy results in a reduction of 0.127 standard
deviations in FDI inflows (as a percentage of the total position). To put this number in
perspective, note that a one-standard deviation increase in Trade PCI results in a decline
of F DItP of 9.8% from its mean value in a given quarter. This number is calculated as
0.098 = −0.127×0.086/0.111, where −0.127 is the estimated coefficient, 0.086 is the standard
deviation of F DItP , and 0.111 corresponds to the average value of F DItP over the sample.
We can also see from the regression results that a positive output gap (e.g. the economy
is above trend) induces FDI inflows to the US. Other control variables are not statistically
significant, with the exception of Q4,t (omitted from the table) which has a positive estimated
coefficient.


Uncertainty over Fiscal and Monetary Policy: Trade PCI controls for a very specific
source of political uncertainty, namely disagreement among policymakers about trade policy.
It is possible that uncertainty over fiscal policy more generally (such as corporate taxes and
production subsidies), as well as other government regulation (e.g. on financial markets)
also affect FDI inflows to the US. By not including a control for these additional sources of
uncertainty the coefficient on T P CI (and its first lag) may be biased, especially since trade

policy is often discussed together with other budgetary items. To control for these, I first
augment the benchmark specification by introducing the benchmark PCI measure computed
by Azzimonti (2018). The results are presented in column (2). We can see that the coefficient
on lagged TPCI is basically unchanged. Including, in addition, a lag on benchmark PCI does
not alter this (results omitted but available upon request).
    Under column (3), I also include the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPU) developed
by Baker or Bloom, and Davis (2016) as an additional control. The value of this coefficient is
statistically insignificant as seen by the large standard error of its coefficient. Interestingly,
the magnitude and significance of TPCI remains unchanged. Introducing a first lag on EPU
does not change the results (omitted from the table). That the coefficient on EPU has a large


                                                              16
p-value may be due to the fact that this variable is highly (negatively) correlated with both,
the federal funds rate and the output gap. The correlation between (lagged) EPU and F F
is −0.41, whereas its correlation with GAP is −0.73. If both F F and GAP were excluded
from the regression, lagged EPU would have a statistically significant coefficient.13


The role of expectations: Previous literature discussing the effects of policy uncertainty
(Gulen and Ion, 2015, Baker, Bloom, and Davis, 2016) and partisan conflict (Azzimonti, 2018)
on aggregate investment raised two potential issues with identification. First, there may be
a problem of reverse causality. It is possible that policymakers’ disagreement over the course
of economic policy heightens when the economy is in a recession, which is also a period in
which investment tends to be low. Second, there may be omitted variables bias by failing
to control for other variables, such as expectations over business cycle conditions, affecting
policy uncertainty measures and investment. The first issue is less significant in the current
study. The reason being that it is unlikely that discussions over trade policy are driven by
FDI inflows or outflows.
    Omitted variable bias caused by failing to control for investment opportunities is poten-
tially a more serious concern. Following Gulen and Ion (2015), I consider two alternative
measures of expectations: the Michigan consumer confidence index and the Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia leading index. The consumer confidence index, denoted by Sentimentt ,
is constructed by the University of Michigan and proxies consumer expectations about the
state of the economy. The leading index, Leadingt , predicts the six-month growth rate of
the coincident index, state-level housing permits (1 to 4 units), unemployment insurance
claims, and other leading indicators. It proxies expectations about GDP growth. These
two variables, normalized by their standard deviations, are added as additional regressors.
The estimated coefficients are shown in column (4) of Table 3. While we cannot reject the
hypothesis that Leading has no effect on FDI inflows, Sentiment seems to have a positive
impact. A one-standard deviation in Sentiment is associated with a 0.283 standard devia-
tion increases in F DI p . We can see that increases in ∆F Xt are also positively associated
with FDI inflows. Finally, the effect of Trade PCI is slightly more negative in this case: a
one-standard deviation increase in lagged T P CI results in a 0.141 standard-deviation decline
in FDI flows.


Busse and Hefeker: For robustness, I also consider a log-transformation of the dependent
typically used in the empirical FDI literature developed by Busse and Hefeker (2007)
                                                  r              !

                        lnF DIi,t = ln F DIi,t +     F DIi,t    +1 .

  13
    I find that in such case a one-standard deviation increase in EPU results in a −0.18 standard deviations
decline in F DI p . The coefficient on EP Ut would still be insignificant though. This modification, on the other
hand, would not change the magnitude of the estimated coefficient of TPCI.




                                                       17
The last column in Table 3 summarizes the result of a specification analogous to the one pre-
sented in column (4), where lnF DIi,t   P is normalized by its standard deviation. The coefficient

is less intuitive to interpret in this case, but the main message is that the effect of Trade PCI
on log-FDI flows is negative and statistically significant.


4     FDI flows by country
Using country-specific data on foreign direct investment, it is possible to further identify the
effects of political dysfunction on FDIUS inflows. The main advantage of this approach is
that we can better control for omitted variables bias by including country fixed-effects and
country-specific control variables, in addition to controlling for macroeconomic conditions
in the country of origin which may also affect FDI flows (bilateral exchange rates, bilateral
trade, etc). The main disadvantage is that data is available annually for a wide range of
countries, and that disaggregated information is not available for all countries.

4.1    Data on country-specific FDI
The sample used includes information from 38 countries on foreign direct investment to the
US, over the interval 1985-2016. The FDI series are obtained from the Survey of US Direct
Investment Abroad, undertaken by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.14 FDI inflows
from country i, F DIU Si , is reported in millions of US dollars. As in the previous section,
direct investment in the U.S. refers to ownership by a foreign country’s residents of at least
ten percent of a business in the US. The third and fifth columns of Table 4 summarize the
average F DIU Si,t per country of origin. The average annual FDI inflows range from a low
of $8 million from Kuwait to a high of $24 billion from the United Kingdom.

           Notes: Sample period 1985 to 2016. The second and fourth columns show average foreign direct investment
           (FDI) inflows from country i to the US in a given year as a percentage of lagged positions in that country.

   The second and fourth columns of Table 4 report F DItP , the average FDI inflows from
country i in year t as a ratio of the (lagged) stock of FDI from country i in the US. That is,

where following Julio and Yook (2016), the denominator corresponds to cumulative FDI
positions in the US from country i. This variable measures the total outstanding level of
country i’s direct investment in the US at year-end (e.g. the stock of FDI on the country).
    Following Busse and Hefeker (2007), I will also consider the following log transformation
of FDI flows:                                     r                !
                                                              2
                                P            P             P
                         lnF DIi,t = ln F DIi,t +     F DIi,t    +1

Because FDI is measured on a net basis, many country-quarter observations have negative
values. This transformation allows us to consider a non-linear relationship between FDI
and partisan conflict over trade policy, while at the same time preserving observations with
negative values.

    Summary statistics, averaged over our sample of 38 countries, are presented in Table 5.
Average FDI inflows to the US per parent country are $3,842 million dollars each year, or
25.3% of the total position already in the country.

4.2   Country Characteristics
In order to estimate the effects of partisan conflict about trade policy on FDI inflows to the
US, it is important to control not only for the state of the domestic economy, but also for char-
acteristics of the parent country. In particular, I will consider: (i) changes in parent country
trade openness, where openness is measured as X     i +Ii
                                                   GDPi with i denoting the parent-country; (ii)
                                                                                       X U S +I U S
changes in bilateral trade, where bilateral trade is measured as iGDPii , with MiU S and XiU S
denote US imports and exports, respectively, from/to country i, (iii) percentage changes in
the bilateral exchange rate, measured as National Currency/US dollar; (iii) country i’s real
GDP growth, and (iv) parent-country’s inflation rate, measured as the percentage change in
country i’s consumer prices. More detailed description of these variables and their sources
can be found on Appendix 6.5. Table 6 summarizes the characteristics of the 38 countries in
our sample.

    Trade openness, measured as the ratio between the sum of exports and imports and GDP,
averages 77% of GDP across countries. This is in line with Julio and Yook (2016)’s value of
around 80 %. Changes in this variable average 0.8%. Bilateral trade represents around 10 %
of the country’s output in the sample, and the average change is −0.4%. The mean growth in


                                                             20
real GDP has been 3.2 %, with a standard deviation of around 4.5 %. The average inflation
rate is 14.8%, mostly driven by the observations in Latin America. If these are excluded,
average inflation is 4.4% instead.

4.3    Model specification and empirical results
Exploiting the panel structure of the data, I will compute a fixed-effects regression of the
form
                            P
                        F DIi,t = γi + αT P CIt + X0i,t β + Z0t θ + i,t ,               (2)
                P is FDI flows from country i as a ratio of lagged positions in the US. As before,
    where F DIi,t
T P CIt stands for the Trade Partisan Conflict Index in the US. The vector X denotes the set of
country-specific control variables, Xi,t = {GDP gri,t , ∆F Xi,t , ∆T radei,t , ∆Bilaterali,t , πi,t }.
Economic conditions of the parent country are captured by the growth rate of its GDP,
GDP gri,t , changes in the relative wealth of foreigners by ∆F Xi,t , changes in the degree of
trade openness by ∆T radei,t , changes in the bilateral trade between country i and the US
by ∆Bilaterali,t , and the parent country’s inflation rate by πi,t (measured as the change in
average consumer prices in country i). I also control for time-invariant country characteristics
that may affect FDI flows by including country fixed-effects, denoted by γi . Examples are
geographic and language proximity and legal origin (see Daude and Fratzscher, 2008) or the
degree of financial liberalization, which is mostly invariant over this time period.
    I also incorporate a set of variables that control for the political environment and business
cycle conditions in the US, Zt = {GDP grt , GAPt , πt , F Ft , Et }. These correspond to the set
of controls in the benchmark specification analyzed in Section 3.1 for aggregate data. They
are: the growth rate of real GDP, GDP grt , the output gap, GAP , the inflation rate in the US,
πt (measured as the change in average consumer prices in the US), the Federal Funds Rate,
F Ft , and the indicator variable Et which equals 1 in years in which a Presidential election is
held and zero otherwise. These time-varying variables are included to control for other trends
that may be correlated with the Trade PCI, but affect FDI inflows independently, and hence
reduce a potential omitted variables problem. Sources and details for the variables included
in Zt can be found on Appendix 6.4.
    Table 7 summarizes the main results from the regression. As in the previous section,
all variables have been normalized by their sample standard deviation. Column (1) reports
the regression coefficients corresponding to the specification represented in eq. (2). Standard
errors are clustered by parent country, and corrected for heteroskedasticiy and autocorrelation
(in parenthesis). The estimated coefficient implies that a one standard-deviation increase in
Trade PCI is associated with an average decline of 0.04 standard-deviations in FDI inflows
from a given country in a given year. This value implies that a 10% increase in Trade PCI
from its mean (of 91) corresponds to a 11.2% decline in the FDI ratio from its average value
of 0.253.15 The regression also shows that an increase in one standard deviation in the growth
  15                                                           P
    To compute this number note that the change in F DIi,t       units when Trade PCI rises in one unit is
                                                                                                           P
−0.003 = −0.04 × 3.08/41, where −0.04 is the estimated coefficient, 3.08 is the standard deviation in F DIi,t ,
and 41 is the standard deviation in Trade PCI. Hence, a 10% increase in Trade-PCI from its mean (e.g. 9.1
                                                         P
units) results in a 0.0279 = −0.003 × 9.1 decline in F DIi,t . This, in turn, corresponds to an 11.2% decline
from its mean, e.g. −0.112 = −0.0279/0.253, where 0.253 is the average value of F DItP in the sample.

rate of the home country rises FDI ratios by 0.08 standard deviations. Increases in the speed
of depreciation of country i’s currency relative to the dollar (e.g. rises in ∆F Xi,t , measured
as domestic currency per US dollar) increase FDI inflows to the US (relative to the country’s
position in the US). Parent-country inflation has a similar effect, as seen by the positive sign
of the coefficient on πi,t . Increases in the rate of bilateral trade of country i are negatively
related to FDI inflows to the US, F DItP . However, changes in the overall degree of trade

                                                                22
openness do not, on average, affect FDI inflows (as seen by the large standard error of its
estimated coefficient). The only macroeconomic indicator of the domestic country which has
a statistically significant effect is the growth rate of GDP. The positive coefficient indicates
that better economic conditions in the US attract FDI inflows into the country. Other control
variables are not statistically different from zero, as seen by their large standard errors (in
parenthesis).


Uncertainty over Fiscal and Monetary Policy:                   In column (2) I control for the
benchmark P CI, whereas in column (3) I add EP U as an additional regressor. While the
effect of P CI is null (statistically) once other variables are considered, I find that a one-
standard-deviation increase in EPU reduces FDI ratios by 0.09 standard deviations. This
value is statistically significant at the 10% level (e.g. its p-value is smaller than 0.1). The
effect is larger in magnitude to that of Trade PCI, indicating that uncertainty over fiscal and
monetary policy is an important deterrent for foreign investors once bilateral FDI flows are
considered. Interestingly, the magnitude and significance of Trade EPU remains unchanged.


The role of expectations:        Column (4) incorporates expected GDP growth, Leadingt ,
and consumer sentiment, Sentimentt , (both normalized by their standard deviations). These
variables are the annual counterparts of the ones used in Section 3. While Leadingt does
not seem to affect FDI flows, Sentimentt has a negative effect. This is somewhat puzzling
given that the result obtained in the aggregate specification had a different sign, and what
one would expect from standard macroeconomic intuition. We can see that the coefficient
on F DItP is slightly more negative (i.e. −0.053), whereas those corresponding to the other
control variables are basically unchanged. The coefficient on US GDP has almost doubled
(with a p-value now smaller than 0.05). The sign and magnitude of other regressors is
basically unchanged.


Busse and Hefeker: Column (5) estimates the same model as the one in column (4), but
considers the transformation of FDI developed by Busse and Hefeker (2007), lnF DIi,t     P , also

normalized by its standard deviation (see Section 3 for details). The estimated coefficient
cannot be directly compared to the one in column (4), but it does indicates that increases in
T P CI are associated with significant reductions in (transformed) FDI inflows. Qualitatively,
the effect of other independent variables is consistent with the linear specification of column
(4).


Robustness:        Several robustness exercises were performed in terms of functional form
in the regression equation and alternative proxies for some of the control variables. When
considering the natural logarithm of Trade PCI and EPU, the sign and significance of the
Trade EPU coefficient remains unchanged, but the overall fit of the model worsens. The
results are also robust to considering an alternative proxy for aggregate economic conditions

                                               23
in the US, namely the growth in the unemployment rate. The results of using this measure
instead of GDP growth are summarized in Table 10 of Appendix 6.6. The coefficient on the
rate of change of the unemployment rate is negative, indicating that as economic conditions
in the US worsen FDI inflows decline. The sign or significance of our variable of interest,
T CP I, is unchanged.
    To summarize, we can see that the main result of this paper, namely that increases in
partisan conflict over trade policy are associated with lower FDI inflows to the US, is also
robust when a panel of parent-countries is considered. Potential omitted variable bias present
in the aggregate specification of Section 3 are addressed by including country fixed effects
and other country-specific control variables, as well as time-varying controls for US economic
and political conditions.

4.4   Heterogeneous effects
In this subsection, I consider the possibility that T P CI has an heterogeneous impact on FDI
flows originating from a particular set of countries that may have tighter links with the US
or be more affected by specific trade agreements debated by policymakers.


Nafta: The first set of countries considered are Canada and Mexico given their the physical
proximity to the US, their trade ties, and the establishment of a free-trade zone through the
N AF T A agreement in the early 1990s. To test whether these countries react differently to
T P CI then other countries in the sample do, I add the interaction between an indicator
variable N af ta—which takes a value of 1 for Canada and Mexico, and zero otherwise— and
T P CI in the baseline specification:

                      Yi,t = γi + λt + αT P CIt × N af tai,t + X0i,t β + i,t ,               (3)
where Yi,t denotes the benchmark FDI flow measure F DIi,t     P or the Busse and Hefeker (2007)

transformation, ln F DIi,tP . Notice that since we are no longer interested in estimating the

average effect of Trade PCI on foreign direct investment, we can replace the T P CIt term in
equation (2) with a time fixed effect, λt , in equation (3). This has the additional benefit of
controlling for any aggregate macroeconomic conditions in the US that may confound the
effect of trade partisan conflict. As a result, the vector Zt is abstracted from in the regression
equation.
    The first and second columns of Table 8 show that the estimated value of α is positive
and statistically significant. This implies that increases in T P CI have a lower impact on FDI
inflows for Canada and Mexico than it does for other countries in the sample. This could
happen because these countries are better informed about trade policy and hence do not
over-react to news about political uncertainty as much as other countries do. It could also
happen because once the Nafta agreement was signed, their foreign direct investment was
more protected by other changes in tariffs or import/export quotas debated over the period.
It would be interesting to analyze whether there is a change in the sign or magnitude of α pre-
1994 and post-1994. There are, unfortunately, too few observations in the pre-Nafta period in

                                                 24
the current panel to study this properly (as most data starts on 1985). Better understanding
why Canada and Mexico are actually less susceptible to TPCI is an interesting avenue for
future research.


Sub-Regions:        Next, I try to disaggregate the information further by analyzing which
regions are more sensitive to T P CI over the sample period than Canada and Mexico are. I
construct the following indicator variables: (i) Europe takes the value of 1 for Austria, Bel-
gium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Nether-
lands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom and 0 otherwise; (ii)
America takes a value of 1 for Bahamas, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Panama, Venezuela; (iii)
M iddle equals 1 for Israel, Kuwait, and United Arab Emirates; (iv) EAsia is 1 for Hong
Kong, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan; (v) SEAsia is 1 for Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and
Indonesia; (vi) Other equals 1 for South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The specifica-
tion estimated in columns (3) and (4) includes the interaction between T P CI and each one
of these variables. The base countries are the ones in N af ta, namely Mexico and Canada.
A negative coefficient then indicates that countries in a given region react more negatively
to news about partisan conflict over trade than Canada and Mexico do. From the last two
columns of Table 8 we learn that Middle East countries are the ones that reduce FDI inflows
the most when T P CI rises. The second group that has the most negative reaction is East
Asia, as seen by the negative and significant estimated coefficients on the interaction term.
The coefficients on America and Other are only statistically significantly different from zero
when the log model is considered (e.g. when the dependent variable is ln F DIi,t P ), as seen in

the last column of the table.

OECD: The final test considers we consider whether emerging countries have a different
response to more developed ones. To that end, I construct an interaction term between Noecd

which takes a value of 1 if the country does not belong to the OECD and zero otherwise.16
This variable is interacted with the T P CI measure. The negative coefficient indicates that
non-OECD countries have a stronger response to trade PCI than OECD ones (e.g. increases
in T P CI are more detrimental for FDI inflows). On average, a one standard deviation
increase in T P CI is associated with a 0.082 standard deviation larger decline in FDI inflows
from non-OECD countries. Note that, qualitatively, the effect is the same regardless the
functional form used for FDI flows.
    Finally, it is worth noticing that the sign and magnitude of the coefficients in other
country-specific variables (e.g. GDP gri,t , ∆F Xi,t , πF Xi,t , ∆Bilaterali,t , and ∆T radei,t ) in
Table 8 are consistent across disaggregation models (e.g. Nafta, Sub-regions, and OECD
cases), as well as with those in Table 7.


5    Conclusion
This paper analyzed the effects of partisan conflict about trade policy political on foreign
direct investment flows to the US. The main departure from existing literature lies on devel-
oping and using a novel measure of disagreement about policy that is particularly relevant to
foreign investors: the trade partisan conflict index (TPCI). The index tracks the frequency of
newspaper articles discussing disagreement about trade policy and international agreements
between policymakers. Using aggregate data on investment flows, I find that a one-standard
deviation increase in the TPCI results in about 9.8% decline in FDI flows as a percentage
of positions in the country on a given quarter. I also consider FDI flows by parent country,
which allows to better control for omitted variable bias and country characteristics, and find
a similar response. The results are robust to alternative specifications of the model, such as a
log-linear a relationship between FDI and PCI. Finally, I study whether countries in different
geographical regions or with different levels of development have heterogeneous responses to
increases in TPCI. I find that Canada and Mexico rect less, on average, than other countries
and that non-OECD countries tend to have a stronger response to news about trade PCI
than OECD countries do.

     OECD countries are: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Spain,
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Non-OECD countries are: Bahamas, Brazil, Colombia, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, Panama, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, United Arab
Emirates, and Venezuela. Note that the United Arab Emirates joined the OECD at the end of 2014, so we
consider it outside of the OECD for the purpose of this study.

           House Passes NAFTA, 234-200 : Clinton Hails Vote as Decision 'Not to Retreat' :
           Congress: Sometimes bitter debate over the trade pact reflects hard-fought battle among
           divided Democrats. Rapid approval is expected in the Senate.
           November 18, 1993 | JAMES GERSTENZANG and MICHAEL ROSS | TIMES STAFF WRITERS

           WASHINGTON — A painfully divided House of Representatives approved the North American Free Trade Agreement by an unexpectedly large margin
           Wednesday night, ending a hard-fought battle that grew into a referendum on the fundamental changes sweeping the American economy.

           The vote was 234 to 200, 16 more than the 218 needed for passage. The Senate is expected to act on the measure within days. Passage there is not in doubt.

           In a brief appearance in the White House grand foyer less than an hour after the vote, a beaming President Clinton savored the come-from-behind victory and
           declared: "Tonight's vote is a defining moment. At a time when many of our people are hurting . . . we chose to compete and not to retreat."

           The strongest support in the House came from Republicans, who cast 132 votes for the trade plan and 43 against it. Among Democrats, 102 voted for the
           agreement and 156 opposed it. The one independent in Congress voted against the plan.

           "It is not a perfect agreement," said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) in an address to his colleagues. "But this is, for the moment, an opportunity to
           expand our trade, to reach out beyond our borders . . . to seize the future."

           "Is it good for America or not? I believe passionately it is good for America," he said.

           Reflecting the division that the plan has generated, his two most senior deputies, House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and House Majority
           Whip David E. Bonior of Michigan, opposed the agreement.

           "It will cost jobs. It will drive down our standard of living. It will lock in place a Mexican system that exploits its own people and denies them the most basic
           political and economic rights," Bonior said.

           Expanding on a 5-year-old, U.S.-Canadian free-trade pact, the agreement would eliminate most tariffs, quotas and other barriers to unrestrained commerce
           among the United States, Mexico and Canada over a 15-year period, beginning Jan. 1, 1994.

           The agreement would remove most tariffs now levied on Mexican goods entering the United States, such as the 15% surcharge slapped on electronic
           components manufactured south of the border. As a result, U.S. companies and their workers will be forced to compete with Mexican firms paying wages that
           in some cases are as little as one-tenth those paid here.

           On the other side of the equation, most Mexican tariffs assessed on U.S. products would be eliminated. For example, U.S. chemical manufacturers, which now
           pay similar tariffs when they ship their goods to Mexico, say they expect sales to expand well beyond last year's $3 billion once the pact takes effect, giving
           them a competitive edge over overseas chemical concerns. U.S. firms that make other products now subject to Mexican tariffs anticipate similar benefits.

           The Clinton Administration has argued that the net effect of such trade-offs, with tariffs disappearing on thousands of products, will help lift Mexico out of the
           economic rut in which it has been stuck for generations. The jobs created by an expanding Mexican economy, in turn, will fuel the growth of a booming
           consumer market anxious to purchase the products of U.S. factories, the Administration contends.

           Despite the emotion that has enveloped the issue across the nation, much of the debate on Wednesday--save for the final arguments--contained little passion.
           The debate began at 9 a.m. and continued for approximately 13 hours.

           All told, 245 representatives--an astoundingly high number--trooped to the well of the House to speak. But with the results not in doubt, they spoke not so
           much to influence their colleagues as to explain their votes to political supporters at home.

           The House vote was widely regarded as a key test of Clinton's legislative acumen. A loss would have cast doubt on his ability to shepherd other Administration
           initiatives through Congress and weakened his hand in dealings with foreign leaders. The victory gives new momentum to his ambitious domestic agenda and
           pending trade talks with other nations.

           Perhaps more important, the verdict is expected to send a strong signal of U.S. willingness to continue exercising leadership in world affairs. Some supporters
           argued that a rejection would have heralded a dangerous new era of isolation and protectionism.

           "A vote against NAFTA is a vote for economic surrender," declared House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), one of the
           Administration's key allies in the congressional leadership.

           If the emotion of the debate was dissipated, it was replaced by a palpable bitterness as dejected opponents angrily accused colleagues of selling their votes in
           exchange for promises of political support or pork-barrel rewards.

           "The wounds are pretty deep, and it will take time and work to heal them" House Deputy Whip Bill Richardson (D-N.M.) said after the vote.

6.6   Alternative specifications
Table 10 includes growth in the unemployment rate, ∆Ut , instead of the growth rate of real
GDP in order to control for aggregate economic conditions in the US. We can see that the
sign and magnitude of the coefficients is basically unchanged for the main variable of interest,
as well as other controls. As expected, higher unemployment growth deters FDI inflows as
seen by the negative coefficient throughout all specifications.
