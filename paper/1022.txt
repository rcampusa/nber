    Swedish firms acquired by foreigners were considerably larger than the

average firms In their industries. They were relatively low in value added

per employee at the time of takeover and before, a characteristic we take

to indicate relatively low profitability, capital intensity, or efficiency,

or some combination of these. However, they had been growing at least

as fast as their industries over the longest periods we can measure.

    The takeovers tended to take place in years when the acquired firms did

poorly relative to their industries and also relative to their own past

performance with respect to the growth of employment, value of production,

and value added. Thus the acquired firms seem to have been weak relative to

others in their industries and had particularly suffered during the year

in which the takeovers occurred.

    There were short—term recoveries after takeover from the misfortunes

of the takeover year and a return to higher growth rates of employment and

output, particularly the former. Over the longer run the acquired firms

did not show the same relative employment gains as in the first year or

two after takeover but seem to have increased their profitability or effi-

ciency relative to their industries. The industries in which takeovers

took place grew more rapidly after the takeovers than total manufacturing

although they had grown less rapidly in the years before takeover.

    A common way to study the effects of direct investment on host

countries is to compare foreign—owned and domestically—owned firms in the

same country and assume that differences between them, after allowing for

size, industry, or other attributes of firms, are the consequence of the

difference in ownership. We have used this technique, since it is often

the only one possible and it enables one to observe a wide range of

characteristics of firms. For a few countries it is possible to use

another approach: to examine host—country firms which are taken over by

foreign owners. Takeovers are attractive as a source of information

because It is possible to compare the firm before and after the takeover as

a way of isolating the effects of foreign ownership.

    The first set of questions we wish to ask about firms taken over by

foreign companies is what they are like at the time of takeover. Are they

relatively large—firms, high— or low—wage firms, fast— or slow—growing

firms, financially weak or strong firms, etc.? These questions themselves

can be divided into two parts: one is the characteristics of the industries

in which takeovers have taken place and the other is the characteristics of

the firms relative to their industries. These questions in turn can be

further subdivided: which of the characteristics are long—term attributes

of the firm or industry and which are associated with the particular time

at which the takeover took place.

    The second set of questions is about changes in the firms after

 takeover. We would like to know whether they grew faster than other firms,

or faster than they did before takeover, or whether they changed with

 respect to their production or value added per worker. Again the answer

can be divided between changes in their industries and changes in the firms

relative to their industries.

    The questions about the characteristics of firms at time of takeover

may be thought of as attempts to shed some light on the motivations of the

acquiring firms and the acquired firms, although they may also give some

information as to the impact of takeovers on the host country. On the

whole, host countries have been reluctant to approve of takeovers of the

most profitable, fastest growing, or technologically leading domestic

enterprises but look more kindly on takeovers of unprofitable or lagging

firrnsj

    The questions about changes in host—country firms after takeover are

directed at estimating the effects of foreign ownership on the acquired

firm, using its pretakeover characteristics to separate the influence of

the foreign parent from those of the characteristics of the local firm

itself. That separation can be performed with varying degrees of

sophistication, assuming that in the absence of a takeover the firm would

change as its industry does, that it would change in the same direction and

at the same rate as it did before takeover, or that it would change

relative to its industry as it did before takeover. The last seems to be

the best assumption but requires data we do not have in all cases.
                                      —3—

    In an earlier paper (Lipsey and Swedenborg, 1981) we made use of data

on Swedish enterprises taken over by foreign firms between 1961 and 1970

from a study by Samuelsson (1977). Those data gave characteristics of

firms taken over only for 1965 and 1970 and only if they had already been

taken over by those dates. We therefore had no knowledge of a firm's rate

of growth or other characteristics before takeover, to compare with later

developments. We also had to assume that firms taken over in 1961—65 still

had, in 1965, their characteristics at takeover time, and that firms taken

over in 1966—70 retained their characteristics until 1970.

    Our new data set for Swedish firms has several advantages over the

older one. In particular it contains data for each firm at the date of

takeover (defined as the end of the year of acquisition) and also before

takeover, back to 1966, and after takeover, up to 1977. A drawback of the

new data is that they do not contain some of the information on salaries

and wages and types of employees we had for the earlier period. They

include for each firm in each year oniy employment, the sales value of

output, which we also call the value of production, and value added. They

are particularly good, however, for examining changes in a firm before and

after takeover.



Characteristics of Acquired Firms

  In our earlier paper we concluded that the firms taken over were much

larger than average for their industries, being more heavily concentrated

in the class of over 200 employees, and including almost no firms with

under 20 employees, which were a majority of the enterprises in each
                                          —4—


industry. However, among the firms      with   over 200 employees the average

takeovers were only half the size of the average Swedish firm. The other

characteristics we could examine were the ratios of salaried and technical

employees   to total employees and the average salary and wage per employee,
all of which we took   to be rough measures of the skill level or technical

orientation   of the firm. The acquired firms were     above average by all

three   measures, particularly those   taken over in 1966—70,   suggesting that
foreign   buyers were, within each industry, picking the firms of higher

skill or technical orientation. As far as we could tell, this selection

was not to any large extent simply a reflection of either the size or the

industry composition of the firms taken over, but was a characteristic of

those firms relative to Swedish firms of the same size and industry.

However, the data and the tests were imperfect in several respects pointed

out in the original paper.

    The acquired firms in the more recent data set were, at the time of

takeover, clearly much larger than the average Swedish firms in their

industries,   by any of the three measures we used, and in all the industries
(Table 1), just as we found for the earlier period. To some degree the
size   difference reflects an apparent cutting off of the sample at some

minimum size level, but that is not the whole explanation since we know

from the earlier study that there are few takeovers of very small firms.

The sales value of output per employee in the acquired firms was, in most

industries, slightly above the average for their industries, but the

differences were small. The value added per employee in acquired firms was

lower than average, and by a substantial margin. We might interpret the

differences in value added per employee in several ways. One is that the

firms taken over were low—productivity firms, in the production function or

total factor productivity sense. Another is that these were firms with low

labor productivity because their input of capital was low relative to their

labor input. A third possibility is that the firms were relatively

unprofitable. The firms may have been inefficient, undercapitalized, or

unprofitable relative to their industries.

    As we can see from the comparisons relating to the year before

takeover, these characteristics of the acquired firms did not apply only to

the takeover years. As we would expect, the size relationships did not

change greatly and the value added per employee was already low in the year

before takeover.

    Other ways in which we might characterize acquired firms are the rates

of growth before takeover for the firms themselves and the rates of growth

relative to their industries. To get the longest possible view of growth

rates we measure them, for each firm and its industry, as far back as the

data permit, usually over five years or less.

   Both the acquired firms and their industries were reducing employment

and increasing the value of production, value added and the value of

production and value added per employee before takeover (Table 2). The

acquired firms had been reducing their employment more slowly and growing

somewhat faster than their industries. Thus their profitability or labor

productivity, as far as we can judge it by value added per employee, had

been rising at a slightly more rapid rate than that of their industries

despite the fact that, as indicated by the data in Table 1, these were

 firms of below—average value added per employee in their industries at the

 time of takeover and a year earlier.2

    While the acquired firms had been growing faster than their industries,

 the industries in which acquisitions took place were decreasing their

employment at about the same rate as total manufacturing and growing in

value of production and value added somewhat less rapidly. However, in

comparisons with total manufacturing we cannot assume, as we do within

industries, that nominal values reflect changes in quantities. The

industries in which takeovers were occurring may have been growing more

slowly or only raising their prices more slowly than manufacturing as a

whole.

    The declines we observe in both acquired firm and industry employment

before takeover may reflect the way in which we performed these

calculations. Each change in employment was measured from the earliest

date available, usually in the mid—1960's. That was a period of high

employment in Swedish manufacturing as a whole relative to most of the

other years in our data.


    The effect of the characteristics of the beginning year for our

calculations raises a more general question about timing. When we measure

the characteristics of an acquired firm at year of takeover, or even the

year before, do these represent the permanent attributes of the firm or the

events of the particular year or years? The same question could be asked

about the industries in which the acquired firms operate. If, for example,

we find that acquired firms are relatively unprofitable ones, it would be

useful to know whether they had been lagging behind their industries for
                                          —9—

many years or are firms     which had been profitable or fast—growing but had
encountered cyclical or other difficulties in a particular year or period

that impelled them to seek mergers or made them vulnerable to takeovers.

Even if the acquired firms had kept up with their industries, they might be

in industries which had suffered in profitability or liquidity. And even

if the industries were not in greater difficulties than others in their

countries, the takeovers may have tended to occur In periods of financial

stringency or low profitability for the country    as a whole.
    A general picture of the timing of takeovers in Sweden Is given by

Table 3. There were apparently four waves of takeovers after the late

1940's and 195O's, when there were hardly any. One was in 1960—62, another

in 1965—66, another in 1968—69, and the last one in 1974—75. In 1960—62

the takeover wave began in years of high profitability for Swedish industry

but hit its peak in the year of reduced profits. The same pattern can be

observed for 1965—66 and 1974—75. Only 1968—69 is an exception, the

takeover peak coinciding with a profit recovery from a fairly low level.

Thus takeovers of Swedish firms seem to be concentrated near peaks in the

profit cycle but on the downward side of the cycle, and that is

particularly true of the sample used in this paper. The dating would be

somewhat different if it were based on employment in acquired firms (Col.5)

but the story would be similar.

    Another way of looking at the timing of takeovers is to examine it for

the individual firms and their industries. If we compare the growth In

employment   of   the acquired firms in our sample in the year before

takeover3 with the average of earlier years we do not find any evidence

    They were also not particularly years of decline for the industries the

of takeovers is that they took place after relatively good years for the

industries involved, compared to their past, but involved companies that

did not do as well as their industries in the year before acquisition

although they may have been growing slightly faster before that.

If we make a similar comparison for the year of takeover itself (t/t—l),

the differences between that year and past years for the firms and between

the firms and their industries tell a very different story (Table 4).

    The acquired firms had a history of somewhat faster growth than their

industries in the years before takeover, as can be seen in Table 4 as well

as in Table 2 which excludes the year of takeover (t). However, in the

takeover year itself, the relationship was reversed: the acquired firms

were having a bad year in every respect. They were reducing employment

after increasing it over previous years and their growth rates of the value

of   production and value added were far lower than earlier. During these

 same takeover years the industries in which these acquired firms operated

were increasing employment. Since the value of production and value added

are affected by the rates of inflation in different years the best

comparison to make is that in the last column, between the takeover year

minus earlier year figures for the acquired firms and those for their

industries. By almost every measure, the takeovers took place in years of

difficulty for the acquired firms relative to their own longer—term

relationships with their industries and to their own histories. The

contrast may be exaggerated somewhat in the smaller sample of firms, as can

be seen by comparison with the larger sample, but the general outline is

the same. Furthermore, the particularly large difference for value added

suggests that it was profitability rather than output and employment, that

was most affected in that takeover year.

     A shorter—term view of the characteristics of takeover firms and their

industries is presented in Table 5.   Unfortunately, because various types

of data are missing for some firms or some periods, the numbers of firms

vary from one comparison to another. However, the data are comparable

within each of the four sets.

     Two strong impressions again emerge from the comparisons. One is that

the acquired firms were reducing employment before takeover, both in

absolute terms and even more relative to their industries. The second is

that the value of their production was declining relative to that of their

industries. Value added showed a much less clear picture, rising

relatively in some intervals but falling very sharply in the year of

takeover.   The extent of these differences among intervals suggests that

profitability was probably the source of the changes, since the wage part

of value added per worker must have moved similarly between the acquired

firms and their industries.

    If we take the two intervals with the best coverage, t—lIt—3 and tlt—1,

to represent the characteristics of the acquired firms, we would conclude

that in the two years before the year of takeover they were, relative to

their industries, cutting employment and output but increasing value added,

probably in the form of higher profits. The year of takeover was a year of

declining employment, particularly relative to their industries, and of

relatively declining value of production, value added, and even value of

production and value added per employee, despite the cuts in employment.

The combination suggests that the year of takeover itself was probably an

unprofitable year for the acquired companies, not only relative to their

own past performance but relative to their industries as well. The record

of the preceding two years suggests that the acquired firms had been losing

ground to others then also, but perhaps increasing profits by contracting

output and employment. The overall impression is that the firms acquired

had not been a particularly successful group in the period close to

takeover.

   A point that should be mentioned in connection with these measures

based on events of the year of takeover is that they imply that the new

owners of the firms had not yet, by the end of the year, made changes In

the acquired firms; the state of a firm at the end of the takeover year is

assumed to represent its pre—takeover situation. If new owners act very
                                         — 16 —




quickly    to reduce employment, for example, we may be mistaking post

acquisition changes for pre—acquisitlon characteristics of the acquired

firm.     However, such quick reductions in employment at the initiative of
new management seem unlikely since firings at short notice are difficult in

Sweden.

    While we lack the data to establish firmly our conclusion that

takeovers tend to occur in years of distress for the acquired firms, it is

of interest that it matches the findings of an earlier study (Rydn, 1972)

of Swedish mergers in general, in which takeovers by foreign firms were not

distinguished from domestic takeovers in most calculations. That study

found that acquired firms were, on the average, less profitable and less

liquid than firms in general and also had deteriorated in both respects

before acquisition (pp. 209—224). A study of U.S. manufacturing firms

acquired by foreigners (Little, 1981) found that they were "...    apt   to be

less profitable than the average firm in their industry and less reliably

able to service their existing debt." An analysis of takeovers in the U.K.

(Singh, 1975) not distinguishing foreign from domestic, also found that

although there was a large degree of overlap between the characteristics of

acquired firms and survivors, ".   ..take—over companies have on average worse
records than surviving ones..." The variables that appeared to distinguish

the two groups of firms were average profitability over one year and three

years and the one—year change in profitability.

   Our characterization of Swedish firms acquired by foreigners thus seems

to fit the attributes that have been ascribed by other studies in several

countries to acquired firms in general.

Changes after Takeover

    What happened to these acquired firms after takeover is described in

Table 6. With respect to employment, which is the only measure we have in

real terms, and with respect to the value of production and the value of

production per employee, the acquired firms are hardly distinguishable from

their industries. Their value added and value added per employee rose

somewhat more rapidly than those of their industries. Thus there was

apparently some restoration of profitability after the decline during the

takeover year. The improvement in profits may have been associated with a

rise in productivity relative to their industries, to the extent that we

can interpret the value added per worker that way.

    Another way of viewing the post—takeover development of acquired firms

is by comparing it with the growth of the same firms before takeover or

with the growth of these relative to their industries. Unfortunately, the

size of the sample falls sharply if we confine it to those firms with both

pre—takeover and post—takeover information for all three characteristics.

    One way of comparing before and after performance is used for Table 7

which is based on the longest possible spans of data both before and after

takeover, excluding the year of takeover itself. For the firms themselves,

the before and after periods hardly differ with respect to employment

growth. The variables that are in monetary terms grew much faster after

takeover but it is difficult to interpret these comparisons by themselves.

The comparisons for the firms' industries suggest an improvement between

the before and after periods, not only for the monetary variables, which

are affected to some degree by inflation, but also for employment. In the

after-takeover    periods the acquired firms seemed to be growing a little

more slowly than their industries, except for value added. Thus the

acquired firms went from a long—term superiority over their industries in

growth rates to a sharp relative decline in the years of takeover, to

growth at about average rates or a little below after takeover.

       The industries in which takeovers occurred also changed somewhat

relative to total manufacturing. From slower—than—average growth rates in

money terms before takeovers occurred they moved to faster than average

rates after. The differences for value added and value of production could

reflect only faster rates of inflation in these industries than in

manufacturing in general, rather than faster real growth. However, the

small positive growth in employment while aggregate manufacturing

employment declined suggests some small margin of higher real growth in

these industries.

       Another way of looking at the comparisons of before and after is to

look at the swings in growth rates shown in columns 3, 6, and 9. The

industries in which takeovers occurred increased their growth rates more

than did the acquired firms themselves and both the firms and their

industries increased the value of production and value added more rapidly

than manufacturing in   general.   We might interpret that as showing that the

takeovers   failed to restore the acquired firms to their earlier superiority
in growth, after their poor performance in the takeover years, although
they   did restore some of their earlier margin in profit and perhaps in

productivity growth. Another possibility is that the takeovers themselves

spurred the industries to grow more rapidly in the years after takeovers
                                      — 21 —




occurred.

    Shorter—term versions of the before—after comparisons are presented in

Table 8, beginning with a relatively long—term one using spans of two years

omitting the year of takeover and proceeding to one using two—year spans

including the takeover year and finally a short—term comparison of the

takeover year with the following year. Again, we are plagued by small

samples and erratic changes in results as the samples change, but some

patterns do emerge.

    The employment figures are the most reliable both because they are not

affected by inflation and because the samples are larger. The comparisons

between the year after takeover and the takeover year show the most

striking results. The acquired firms shifted from declining employment and

value of production relative to their industries during the takeover year

to relative gains in employment and equal changes in value of production in

the year after takeover. The combination of the two shows a relative

decline in value of production and value added per employee after takeover,

which suggest relatively falling efficiency, The longer time spans show

increases, but smaller ones, in employment for the firms and the firms

relative to their industries, but they show relative declines in value of

production and value added. However, these measures are derived from the

smallest samples and should not be given much credence. We can say at

least that we find no evidence for short—term gains in profitability over

earlier performance after takeover If we exclude the year of takeover from

the base of the comparison. We find no evidence that the takeovers

resulted in increased efficiency within the first year or two, as far as we

can tell from these crude measures and small samples.

    We have interpreted changes in behavior or fortune for a company

between pre— and post—takeover periods as indications of the effects of

takeovers. Another possibility that might be mentioned is that takeovers

occur in periods of distress for a firm   but   that the ensuing recovery would

have taken place with or without takeover. Only a very close examination

of individual companies or a comparison with individual companies not taken

over could answer this question definitively, if there is any way of doing

that. However, one indication that might be taken to mean that the

fluctuations might be only random deviations from a trend and independent

of the occurrence of a takeover would be if large pre—takeover declines

were associated with large post—takeover recoveries. We have tested this

hypothesis by correlating post—takeover with pre—takeover ratios of growth,

as shown in Table 9.

    Employment changes after takeover do not seem to be explainable as a

reaction to events of the takeover year. Either there was no significant

relationship or there was a positive one; the firms that were increasing or

decreasing employment more in the periods prior to the takeover year

continued to do so. However, even this relationship is noticeable in only

one of the four employment regressions. Some of the other variables did

give evidence of snapping back after the takeover year in one or two sets

of regressions, particularly those for value added and value added per

employee, which we associate with profitability and possibly with

efficiency changes. A large part of the two—year post—takeover changes in

value added and value added per employee after takeover could be explained

by pre—takeover changes, mainly increases explained by declines before

takeover, and the same was true for some of the larger one—year changes

even though the overall correlation was not high. While this relationship

does not preclude an effect of takeover on profitability it does suggest

another possibility. The acquiring firm may have been able to take

advantage of an unprofitable year to buy the Swedish firm cheaply and then

enjoy the benefit of a recovery that would have taken place, at least to

some extent, even without the acquisition.


Conclusions

    Swedish firms acquired by foreigners were large relative to the average

firms in their industries but of relatively low profitability, capital

intensity, or efficiency. We cannot distinguish among these possibilities

but one of them or some combination of them seems the most likely

interpretation of the low value added per employee at the time of takeover

and before. The acquired firms had been growing at least as fast as their

industries over the longest periods we can measure, but the industries

tended to be growing no more rapidly or possibly less rapidly than

manufacturing as a whole.

    The takeovers tended to take place in years when the acquired firms did

poorly relative to their industries and also relative to their own past

performance. We find that to have been true with respect to the growth of

employment, value of production, and value added. Thus the takeovers seem

to have involved Swedish firms that had been in some sense weak relative to

others in their industries and had particularly suffered during the year in

which the takeovers occurred. This impression of the acquired firms as
                                      — 27 —




 laggards in their industries, especially with respect to profits, fits with
 the findings of studies of Swedish mergers and of takeovers in other

count ries.

    The consequences of takeovers are more ambiguous. There is strong

indication of short—term recovery after takeover from the misfortunes of

the takeover year and a return to higher growth rates of employment and

output, particularly the former. To the extent that value added per

employee measures productivity or efficiency, however, there is no evidence

that the takeovers raised the rates of growth in these. In fact the

acquired firms ended up lower relative to their industries than before.4

Over the longer run the acquired firms did not show the same relative

employment gains as in the first year or two after takeover but seem to

have increased their profitability or efficiency relative to their

industries. The industries in which takeovers took place grew more rapidly

after the takeovers than total manufacturing although they had grown less

rapidly in the years before takeover. It remains uncertain whether the

takeovers themselves influenced these rates of industry growth.


                                  Data

Swedish Industries

    Information on Swedish industries, at the 5—digit SNI level, is from

various issues of Industri published by the Statistiska Centralbyrn.


Takeovers

    Data on Swedish establishments taken over by U.S. and other foreign

companies are from Swedish census reports tagged by country of ownership
                                      — 28 —



and supplied by the Statistiska CePtralbyrn to the Swedish Committee on

Direct Investment. The reports included some, but not all, of the standard

information collected in the industry censuses for the years 1966 through

1977 as well as the date on which each establishment was taken over and the

nationality of the purchasing firm. However, the names of the Swedish

establishments and of the parents were not included and there was,

therefore, no way to identify U.S. parents.

    Quite a few data items were missing from the information provided,

including all sales value of output and value added for 1973. Since many

takeovers took place in 1974 and 1975, the omission of these data greatly

reduced the number of observations we could use in calculations involving

the year before takeover and the year before that.

    A few of the remaining observations were removed for other reasons.

One was that they involved rates of growth for newly established firms,

sometimes extremely large. Another was that the firms merged with others

or sold off parts of their operations. A third was that the data suggested

changes too large to be believable.

    'For example, Brash (1970, P. 309) quotes a speech by Australian Prime

Minister Gorton in which he stated "...he would have no objection to a

foreign company acquiring 50 'or even 60%' of the equity of an inefficient

Australian company if the latter would benefit from an infusion of capital,

know—how, or management skill. Re emphasized that he was only objecting to

a 'raid' on an efficient Australian company which already had good

management and 'good technical application' by foreign interests 'who could

afford to buy it out at high prices.'"

    2There was some consolidation among Swedish establishments in general

so that the growth in sales and value added per firm was higher than that

for the industry, although still below that of the acquired firms. There

was no change in average employment per firm.

    3That is, t—l/t—2 where t   is   the year in which the takeover took place.

    4A comparison of foreign—owned food manufacturing firms (most acquired

by takeover) with all Swedish food manufacturing firms showed the foreign—

owned ones expanding their employment much more rapidly in 1960—65 and

1965—70 and then reducing it more rapidly in 1970—75 (Statens Industriverk,

1977). The authors found that there was no substantial change in the rate

of employment growth, relative to the industry, between pre—takeover and

post—takeover periods. For this industry they found that productivity grew

more rapidly relative to the industry after takeover than before.
