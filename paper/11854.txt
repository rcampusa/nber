Optimal Inflation Stabilization in a Medium-Scale Macroeconomic Model

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper characterizes Ramsey-optimal monetary policy in a medium-scale macroeconomic model
that has been estimated to fit well postwar U.S.\ business cycles. We find that mild deflation is
Ramsey optimal in the long run. However, the optimal inflation rate appears to be highly sensitive
to the assumed degree of price stickiness. Within the window of available estimates of price
stickiness (between 2 and 5 quarters) the optimal rate of inflation ranges from -4.2 percent per year
(close to the Friedman rule) to -0.4 percent per year (close to price stability). This sensitivity
disappears when one assumes that lump-sum taxes are unavailable and fiscal instruments take the
form of distortionary income taxes. In this case, mild deflation emerges as a robust Ramsey
prediction. In light of the finding that the Ramsey-optimal inflation rate is negative, it is puzzling
that most inflation-targeting countries pursue positive inflation goals. We show that the zero bound
on the nominal interest rate, which is often cited as a rationale for setting positive inflation targets,
is of no quantitative relevance in the present model. Finally, the paper characterizes operational
interest-rate feedback rules that best implement Ramsey-optimal stabilization policy. We find that
the optimal interest-rate rule is active in price and wage inflation, mute in output growth, and
moderately inertial. This rule achieves virtually the same level of welfare as the Ramsey optimal
policy.

1     Introduction
Two fundamental but separate questions in the theory of monetary stabilization policy are
what is the optimal monetary policy and how can the central bank implement it. Both
questions have been extensively studied in the existing related literature, but always in the
context of simple theoretical structures, which by design are limited in their ability to account
for actual observed business-cycle fluctuations. The goal of this paper is to characterize
optimal monetary policy and its implementation using a medium-scale, empirically plausible
model of the U.S. business cycle.
    The model we consider is the one developed in Altig et al. (2005). This model has been
estimated econometrically and shown to account fairly well for business-cycle fluctuations
in the postwar United States. The theoretical framework emphasizes the importance of
combining nominal as well as real rigidities in explaining the propagation of macroeconomic
shocks. Specifically, the model features four nominal frictions, sticky prices, sticky wages,
a transactional demand for money by households, and a cash-in-advance constraint on the
wage bill of firms, and four sources of real rigidities, investment adjustment costs, vari-
able capacity utilization, habit formation, and imperfect competition in product and factor
markets. Aggregate fluctuations are driven by three shocks: a permanent neutral technol-
ogy shock, a permanent investment-specific technology shock, and temporary variations in
government spending. Altig et al. (2005) and Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005)
argue that the model economy for which we seek to design optimal monetary policy can
indeed explain the observed responses of inflation, real wages, nominal interest rates, money
growth, output, investment, consumption, labor productivity, and real profits to neutral and
investment-specific productivity shocks and monetary shocks in the postwar United States.
    In our characterization of optimal monetary policy, we depart from the widespread prac-
tice in the neo-Keynesian literature on optimal monetary policy of limiting attention to
models in which the nonstochastic steady state is undistorted. Most often, this approach
involves assuming the existence of a battery of subsidies to production and employment
aimed at eliminating the long-run distortions originating from monopolistic competition in
factor and product markets. The efficiency of the deterministic steady-state allocation is
assumed for purely computational reasons. For it allows the use of first-order approximation
techniques to evaluate welfare accurately up to second order (see Rotemberg and Woodford,
1997). This practice has two potential shortcomings. First, the instruments necessary to
bring about an undistorted steady state (e.g., labor and output subsidies financed by lump-
sum taxation) are empirically uncompelling. Second, it is ex ante not clear whether a policy
that is optimal for an economy with an efficient steady state will also be so for an economy


                                               2
where the instruments necessary to engineer the nondistorted steady state are unavailable.
For these reasons, we refrain from making the efficient-steady-state assumption and instead
work with a model whose steady state is distorted.
      Departing from a model whose steady state is Pareto efficient has a number of impor-
tant ramifications. One is that to obtain a second-order accurate measure of welfare it no
longer suffices to approximate the equilibrium of the model up to first order. We solve the
equilibrium of the model up to second order using the methodology and computer code de-
veloped in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004c) for second-order accurate approximations to
policy functions of dynamic, stochastic models. One advantage of this numerical strategy is
that because it is based on perturbation arguments, it is particularly well suited to handle
economies with a large number of state variables like the one studied in this paper.
   We address the first question posed above, namely, what business-cycle fluctuations
should look like under optimal monetary policy by characterizing the Ramsey equilibrium
associated with our model. The central policy problem faced by the monetary authority is,
on the one hand, the need to stabilize prices so as to minimize price dispersion stemming
from nominal rigidities and, on the other hand, the need to minimize and stabilize the op-
portunity cost of holding money to avoid transactional frictions. The task of characterizing
Ramsey-optimal policy is challenging because the model is large and highly distorted. A
methodological contribution of the research project to which this paper belongs is the devel-
opment of computational procedures to derive and characterize the Ramsey equilibrium for
a general class of dynamic rational expectations models.1
   We find that the policy tradeoff faced by the Ramsey planner is resolved in favor of
price stability. In effect, the Ramsey optimal inflation rate is -0.4 percent per annum, with
a standard deviation of only 0.1 percentage points. The optimality of near-zero inflation,
however, is highly sensitive to the assumed degree of price stickiness. Available estimates of
the degree of price stickiness vary between 2 and 5 quarters. Within this range, the optimal
rate of inflation increases from a deflation of about 4 percent per year when prices are
reoptimized every two quarters to a mild deflation of less than half a percent when prices are
reoptimized every five quarters. So, depending on what available estimate of price rigidity
one chooses to pick, the Ramsey-optimal policy can range from close to the Friedman rule,
to close to price stability.
    Quite independently of the precise degree of price stickiness, the optimal inflation target
is below zero. In light of this robust result, it is puzzling that all countries that self-classify
as inflation targeters set inflation targets that are positive. In effect, in the developed world

inflation targets range between 2 and 4 percent per year. Somewhat higher targets are ob-
served across developing countries. An argument often raised in defense of positive inflation
targets is that negative inflation targets imply nominal interest rates that are dangerously
close to the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates and hence may impair the central
bank’s ability to conduct stabilization policy. We find, however, that this argument is of
no relevance in the context of the medium-scale estimated model within which we conduct
policy evaluation. The reason is that under the optimal policy regime, the mean of the
nominal interest rate is about 4.5 percent per year with a standard deviation of only 0.4
percent. This means that for the zero lower bound to pose an obstacle to monetary policy,
the economy must suffer from an adverse shock that forces the interest rate to be more than
10 standard deviations below target. The likelihood of such an event is practically nil.
   We address the question of implementation of optimal monetary policy by characterizing
optimal, simple, and implementable interest-rate feedback rules. We restrict attention to
what we call operational interest rate rules. By an operational interest-rate rule we mean
an interest-rate rule that satisfies three requirements. First, it prescribes that the nominal
interest rate is set as a function of a few readily observable macroeconomic variables. In the
tradition of Taylor (1993), we focus on rules whereby the nominal interest rate depends on
measures of inflation, aggregate activity, and possibly its own lag. Second, the operational
rule must induce an equilibrium satisfying the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.
And third, operational rules must render the rational expectations equilibrium unique. This
last restriction closes the door to expectations driven aggregate fluctuations.
    Our numerical findings suggest that in the model economy we study, the optimal opera-
tional interest-rate rule responds aggressively to deviations of price and wage inflation from
target. The price-inflation coefficient is about 5 and the wage-inflation coefficient is about 2.
In addition, the optimal interest-rate rule prescribes a mute response to deviations of output
growth from target. In this sense, the implementation of optimal policy calls for following
a regime of inflation targeting. The parameters of the optimized rule are robust to using a
conditional or unconditional measure of welfare.
   Remarkably, the optimal operational interest-rate rule delivers a welfare level that is
virtually identical to the one obtained under the Ramsey-optimal policy. Specifically, the
welfare cost associated with living in an economy where the monetary authority follows the
optimal operational rule as opposed to living in the Ramsey economy is only 0.23 dollars per
year per person (or 0.001 percent of 2006 annual per capita consumption).
   The remainder of the paper is organized in five sections. Section 2 presents the theoreti-
cal economy and derives nonlinear recursive representations for the price and wage Phillips
curves as well as for the state variables summarizing the degree of wage and price disper-

sion. Section 3 describes the calibration of the model and discusses the solution method.
Section 4 characterizes the steady state of the Ramsey equilibrium. Section 5 studies the dy-
namics induced by the Ramsey monetary policy. Section 6 computes the optimal operational
interest-rate rule. Section 7 provides concluding remarks.


2     The Model
The skeleton of the model economy that we use for policy evaluation is a standard neoclassical
growth model driven by neutral and investment-specific productivity shocks and government
spending shocks. In addition the economy features four sources of nominal frictions and five
real rigidities. The nominal frictions include price and wage stickiness à la Calvo (1983) and
Yun (1996) with indexation to past inflation, and money demands by households and firms.
The real rigidities originate from internal habit formation in consumption, monopolistic
competition in factor and product markets, investment adjustment costs, and variable costs
of adjusting capacity utilization.
    To perform monetary policy evaluation, we are forced to approximate the equilibrium
conditions of the economy to an order higher than linear. To this end, we derive the exact
nonlinear recursive representation of the complete set of equilibrium conditions. Of par-
ticular interest is the recursive nonlinear representation of the equilibrium Phillips curves
for prices and wages. These representations depart from most of the existing literature,
which restricts attention to linear approximations to these functions. Another byproduct
of deriving the exact nonlinear set of equilibrium conditions is the emergence of two state
variables measuring the degree of price and wage dispersion in the economy induced by the
sluggishness in the adjustment of nominal product and factor prices. We present a recursive
representation of these state variables and track their dynamic behavior.


2.1    Households
The economy is assumed to be populated by a large representative family with a continuum
of members. Consumption and hours worked are identical across family members. The
household’s preferences are defined over per capita consumption, ct , and per capita labor
effort, ht , and are described by the utility function

the parameter b ∈ [0, 1). The consumption good is assumed to be a composite made of a

This price index has the property that the minimum cost of a bundle of intermediate goods
yielding ct units of the composite good is given by Pt ct.
   Labor decisions are made by a central authority within the household, a union, which
supplies labor monopolistically to a continuum of labor markets of measure 1 indexed by
                                                                                        −η̃ d
j ∈ [0, 1]. In each labor market j, the union faces a demand for labor given by Wtj /Wt     ht .
Here Wtj denotes the nominal wage charged by the union in labor market j at time t, Wt is
an index of nominal wages prevailing in the economy, and hdt is a measure of aggregate labor
demand by firms. We postpone a formal derivation of this labor demand function until we
consider the firm’s problem. In each particular labor market, the union takes Wt and hdt as
exogenous.2 Given the wage it charges in each labor market j ∈ [0, 1], the union is assumed
   2
     The case in which the union takes aggregate labor variables as endogenous can be interpreted as an
environment with highly centralized labor unions. Higher-level labor organizations play an important role
in some European and Latin American countries, but are less prominent in the United States.

   Our setup of imperfectly competitive labor markets departs from most existing exposi-
tions of models with nominal wage inertia (e.g., Erceg, et al., 2000). For in these models, it is
assumed that each household supplies a differentiated type of labor input. This assumption
introduces equilibrium heterogeneity across households in the number of hours worked. To
avoid this heterogeneity from spilling over into consumption heterogeneity, it is typically as-
sumed that preferences are separable in consumption and hours and that financial markets
exist that allow agents to fully insure against employment risk. Our formulation has the
advantage that it avoids the need to assume both separability of preferences in leisure and
consumption and the existence of such insurance markets. As we will explain later in more
detail, our specification gives rise to a wage-inflation Phillips curve with a larger coefficient
on the wage-markup gap than the model with employment heterogeneity across households.
   The household is assumed to own physical capital, kt , which accumulates according to
the following law of motion
                                                               

where it denotes gross investment and δ is a parameter denoting the rate of depreciation of
physical capital. The function S introduces investment adjustment costs. It is assumed that
in the steady state, the function S satisfies S = S 0 = 0 and S 00 > 0. These assumptions
imply the absence of adjustment costs up to first-order in the vicinity of the deterministic
steady state.
   As in Fisher (2005) and Altig et al. (2005), it is assumed that investment is subject


                                                        7
to permanent investment-specific technology shocks. Fisher argues that this type of shock
is needed to explain the observed secular decline in the relative price of investment goods
in terms of consumption goods. More importantly, Fisher shows that investment-specific
technology shocks account for about 50 percent of aggregate fluctuations at business-cycle
frequencies in the postwar U.S. economy. (As we will discuss below, Altig et al., 2005, find
smaller numbers in the context of the model studied in our paper.)
    We assume that investment goods are produced from consumption goods by means of
a linear technology whereby 1/Υt units of consumption goods yield one unit of investment
goods, where Υt denotes an exogenous, permanent technology shock in period t. The growth
rate of Υt is assumed to follow an AR(1) process of the form:

                                   µ̂Υ,t = ρµΥ µ̂Υ,t−1 + µΥ ,t,

where µ̂Υ,t ≡ ln(µΥ,t /µΥ ) denotes the percentage deviation of the gross growth rate of in-
vestment specific technological change and µΥ denotes the steady-state growth rate of Υt.
   Owners of physical capital can control the intensity at which this factor is utilized. For-
mally, we let ut measure capacity utilization in period t. We assume that using the stock of
capital with intensity ut entails a cost of Υ−1
                                             t a(ut )kt units of the composite final good. The
function a is assumed to satisfy a(1) = 0, and a0 (1), a00(1) > 0. Both the specification of cap-
ital adjustment costs and capacity utilization costs are somewhat peculiar. More standard
formulations assume that adjustment costs depend on the level of investment rather than
on its growth rate, as is assumed here. Also, costs of capacity utilization typically take the
form of a higher rate of depreciation of physical capital. The modeling choice here is guided
by the need to fit the response of investment and capacity utilization to a monetary shock
in the U.S. economy. For further discussion of this issue, see Christiano, Eichenbaum, and
Evans (2005) and Altig et al. (2005).
    Households rent the capital stock to firms at the real rental rate rtk per unit of capital.
Total income stemming from the rental of capital is given by rtk ut kt . The investment good is
assumed to be a composite good made with the aggregator function shown in equation (2).
Thus, the demand for each intermediate good i ∈ [0, 1] for investment purposes, iit , is given
                          −η
by iit = Υ−1
          t it (Pit /Pt )    .
    As in our earlier related work (Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2004a,b), we motivate a demand
for money by households by assuming that purchases of consumption goods are subject
to a proportional transaction cost that is increasing in consumption-based money velocity.




                                                8
Formally, the purchase of each unit of consumption entails a cost given by `(vt ). Here,

                                                     ct
                                             vt ≡                                                  (8)
                                                     mht

is the ratio of consumption to real money balances held by the household, which we denote
by mht . The transaction cost function ` satisfies the following assumptions: (a) `(v) is
nonnegative and twice continuously differentiable; (b) There exists a level of velocity v > 0, to
which we refer as the satiation level of money, such that `(v) = `0 (v) = 0; (c) (v − v)`0 (v) > 0
for v 6= v; and (d) 2`0 (v) + v`00(v) > 0 for all v ≥ v. Assumption (a) implies that the
transaction process does not generate resources. Assumption (b) ensures that the Friedman
rule, i.e., a zero nominal interest rate, need not be associated with an infinite demand for
money. It also implies that both the transaction cost and the associated distortions in
the intra and intertemporal allocation of consumption and leisure vanish when the nominal
interest rate is zero. Assumption (c) guarantees that in equilibrium money velocity is always
greater than or equal to the satiation level v. As will become clear shortly, assumption (d)
ensures that the demand for money is decreasing in the nominal interest rate. Assumption (d)
is weaker than the more common assumption of strict convexity of the transaction cost
function.
    Households are assumed to have access to a complete set of nominal state-contingent
assets. Specifically, each period t ≥ 0, consumers can purchase any desired state-contingent
                 h                                                 h
nominal payment Xt+1 in period t + 1 at the dollar cost Et rt,t+1 Xt+1 . The variable rt,t+1
denotes a stochastic nominal discount factor between periods t and t + 1. Households pay
real lump-sum taxes in the amount τt per period. The household’s period-by-period budget
constraint is given by:

                                                                     xht + mht−1

The variable xht /πt ≡ Xth /Pt denotes the real payoff in period t of nominal state-contingent
assets purchased in period t − 1. The variable φt denotes dividends received from the own-
ership of firms and πt ≡ Pt /Pt−1 denotes the gross rate of consumer-price inflation.
   We introduce wage stickiness in the model by assuming that each period the household
(or unions) cannot set the nominal wage optimally in a fraction α̃ ∈ [0, 1) of randomly chosen
labor markets. In these markets, the wage rate is indexed to average real wage growth and



                                                 9
to the previous period’s consumer-price inflation according to the rule

where χ̃ ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter measuring the degree of wage indexation. When χ̃ equals 0,
there is no wage indexation. When χ̃ equals 1, there is full wage indexation to long-run real
wage growth and to past consumer price inflation.
   The household chooses processes for ct , ht , xht+1 , wtj , kt+1 , it, ut , and mht so as to maximize
the utility function (1) subject to (6)-(9), the wage stickiness friction, and a no-Ponzi-game
constraint, taking as given the processes wt, rtk , hdt , rt,t+1 , πt, φt, and τt and the initial
conditions xh0 , k0 , and mh−1 . The household’s optimal plan must satisfy constraints (6)-(9).
In addition, letting β tλt wt µ̃t , β tλt qt, and β tλt denote Lagrange multipliers associated with
constraints (6), (7), and (9), respectively, the Lagrangian associated with the household’s
optimization problem is

that wage rates, w̃t , and employment, h̃t , are identical across all labor markets updating

derive the household’s first-order condition with respect to the wage rate in those markets
where the wage rate is set optimally in the current period, it is convenient to reproduce the
parts of the Lagrangian given above that are relevant for this purpose,

                                                         in the expression for marginal revenue
reflects the fact that as time goes by without a chance to reoptimize, the real wage declines
as the price level increases when wages are imperfectly indexed. In turn, the marginal cost
of supplying labor is given by the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and
leisure, or −Uht+s
             λt+s
                   = wµ̃t+s
                        t+s
                            . The variable µ̃t is a wedge between the disutility of labor and
the average real wage prevailing in the economy. Thus, µ̃t can be interpreted as the average
markup that unions impose on the labor market. The weights used to compute the average
difference between marginal revenue and marginal cost are decreasing in time and increasing
in the amount of labor supplied to the market.

With these definitions at hand, the wage-setting equation becomes

   The household’s optimality conditions imply a liquidity preference function featuring a
negative relation between real balances and the short-term nominal interest rate. To see this,
we first note that the absence of arbitrage opportunities in financial markets requires that
the gross risk-free nominal interest rate, which we denote by Rt , be equal to the reciprocal
of the price in period t of a nominal security that pays one unit of currency in every state
of period t + 1. Formally, Rt = 1/Et rt,t+1 . This relation together with the household’s

                                                                          12
optimality condition (11) implies that

                                                      λt+1
                                       λt = βRtEt          ,                                (20)
                                                      πt+1

which is a standard Euler equation for pricing nominally risk-free assets. Combining this
expression with equations (10) and (15), we obtain

                                                          1
                                      vt2`0 (vt ) = 1 −      .
                                                          Rt

The right-hand side of this expression represents the opportunity cost of holding money,
which is an increasing function of the nominal interest rate. Given the assumptions regarding
the form of the transactions cost function `, the left-hand side is increasing in money velocity.
Thus, this expression defines a liquidity preference function that is decreasing in the nominal
interest rate and unit elastic in consumption.


2.2    Firms
Each variety of final goods is produced by a single firm in a monopolistically competitive
environment. Each firm i ∈ [0, 1] produces output using as factor inputs capital services, kit ,
and labor services, hit . The production technology is given by

                                      F (kit , zthit ) − ψzt∗,

where the function F is assumed to be homogenous of degree one, concave, and strictly in-
creasing in both arguments. The variable zt denotes an aggregate, exogenous, and stochastic
neutral productivity shock. The parameter ψ > 0 introduces fixed costs of operating a firm
in each period. In turn, the presence of fixed costs implies that the production function ex-
hibits increasing returns to scale. We model fixed costs to ensure a realistic profit-to-output
ratio in steady state. Finally, we follow Altig et al. (2005) and assume that fixed costs are
subject to permanent shocks, zt∗ , with

                                           zt∗      θ
                                               = Υt1−θ .
                                           zt

This formulation of fixed costs ensures that along the balanced-growth path fixed costs do
not vanish. Let µz,t ≡ zt /zt−1 denote the gross growth rate of the neutral technology shock.
By assumption, in the non-stochastic steady state µz,t is constant and equal to µz . Also, let
µ̂z,t = ln(µz,t /µz ) denote the percentage deviation of the growth rate of neutral technology


                                                13
shocks. Then, the evolution of µz,t is assumed to be given by:

                                               µ̂z,t = ρµz µ̂z,t−1 + µz ,t,

with µz ,t ∼ (0, σµ2z ).
    Aggregate demand for good i, which we denote by yit, is given by

                                                  yit = (Pit /Pt )−η yt,

    We rationalize a demand for money by firms by imposing that wage payments be sub-
ject to a working-capital requirement that takes the form of a cash-in-advance constraint.
Formally, we impose

where mfit denotes the demand for real money balances by firm i in period t and ν ≥ 0 is a
parameter indicating the fraction of the wage bill that must be backed with monetary assets.

   Firms incur financial costs in the amount (1 − R−1 t )mit stemming from the need to
hold money to satisfy the working-capital constraint. Letting the variable φit denote real
distributed profits, the period-by-period budget constraint of firm i can then be written as

where Et rt,t+1xfit+1 denotes the total real cost of one-period state-contingent assets that the
firm purchases in period t in terms of the composite good.3 We assume that the firm must
satisfy demand at the posted price. Formally, we impose

     Implicit in this specification of the firm’s budget constraint is the assumption that firms rent capital
services from a centralized market. This is a common assumption in the related literature (e.g., Christiano
et al., 2005; Kollmann, 2003; Carlstrom and Fuerst, 2003; and Rotemberg and Woodford, 1992). A polar
assumption is that capital is firm specific, as in Woodford (2003, chapter 5.3) and Sveen and Weinke (2003).
Both assumptions are clearly extreme. A more realistic treatment of investment dynamics would incorporate
a mix of firm-specific and homogeneous capital.

The objective of the firm is to choose contingent plans for Pit , hit , kit , xfit+1 , and mfit so as
to maximize the present discounted value of dividend payments, given by

                                                 X
                                                 ∞
                                            Et         rt,t+s Pt+s φit+s ,

                 Qs
where rt,t+s ≡     k=1 rt+k−1,t+k ,      for s ≥ 1, denotes the stochastic nominal discount factor
between t and t + s, and rt,t ≡ 1. Firms are assumed to be subject to a borrowing constraint
that prevents them from engaging in Ponzi games.
    Clearly, because rt,t+s represents both the firm’s stochastic discount factor and the market
pricing kernel for financial assets, and because the firm’s objective function is linear in asset
holdings, it follows that any asset accumulation plan of the firm satisfying the no-Ponzi
constraint is optimal. Suppose, without loss of generality, that the firm manages its portfolio
so that its financial position at the beginning of each period is nil. Formally, assume that
xfit+1 + mfit = 0 at all dates and states. Note that this financial strategy makes xfit+1 state
noncontingent. In this case, distributed dividends take the form
                                        1−η
                                   Pit                                            f

                                                                              t )mit .          (24)
                                   Pt

For this expression to hold in period zero, we impose the initial condition xfi0 + mfi−1 = 0.
The last term on the right-hand side of the above expression for dividends represents the
firm’s financial costs associated with the cash-in-advance constraint on wages. This financial
cost is increasing in the opportunity cost of holding money, 1 − R−1
                                                                  t , which in turn is an
increasing function of the short-term nominal interest rate Rt .
    Letting rt,t+s Pt+s mcit+s denote the Lagrange multiplier associated with constraint (23),
the first-order conditions of the firm’s maximization problem with respect to capital and
labor services are, respectively,
                                                                                  
                                                                          Rt − 1
                               mcitzt F2(kit , zt hit ) = wt          1+ν                       (25)
                                                                           Rt

and
                                           mcit F1(kit , zt hit ) = rtk .                       (26)

It is clear from these optimality conditions that the presence of a working-capital requirement
introduces a financial cost of labor that is increasing in the nominal interest rate. We note
also that because all firms face the same factor prices and because they all have access to
the same production technology with the function F being linearly homogeneous, marginal


                                                          15
costs, mcit , are identical across firms. Indeed, because the above first-order conditions hold
for all firms independently of whether they are allowed to reset prices optimally, marginal
costs are identical across all firms in the economy.
     Prices are assumed to be sticky à la Calvo (1983) and Yun (1996). Specifically, each
period t ≥ 0 a fraction α ∈ [0, 1) of randomly picked firms is not allowed to optimally set
the nominal price of the good they produce. Instead, these firms index their prices to past
                                             χ
inflation according to the rule Pit = Pit−1 πt−1 . The interpretation of the parameter χ is the
similar to that of its wage counterpart χ̃. The remaining 1 − α firms choose prices optimally.
Consider the price-setting problem faced by a firm that has the opportunity to reoptimize
the price in period t. This price, which we denote by P̃t , is set so as to maximize the expected
present discounted value of profits. That is, P̃t maximizes the following Lagrangian:

According to this expression, optimizing firms set nominal prices so as to equate average
future expected marginal revenues to average future expected marginal costs. The weights
used in calculating these averages are decreasing with time and increasing in the size of
the demand for the good produced by the firm. Under flexible prices (α = 0), the above
optimality condition reduces to a static relation equating marginal costs to marginal revenues
period by period.

This wage index has the property that the minimum cost of a bundle of intermediate labor
inputs yielding hit units of the composite labor is given by Wthit .


2.3     The Government
Each period, the government consumes gt units of the composite good. We assume that the
government minimizes the cost of producing gt . As a result, public demand for each variety
i ∈ [0, 1] of differentiated goods git is given by git = (Pit /Pt )−η gt .


                                                                    17
        We assume that along the balanced-growth path the share of government spending in
value added is constant, that is, we impose limj→∞ Et gt+j /yt+j = sg , where sg is a constant
indicating the share of government consumption in value added. To this end we impose:

                                                        gt = zt∗ḡt ,

where ḡt is an exogenous stationary stochastic process. This assumption ensures that gov-
ernment purchases and output are cointegrated. We impose the following law of motion for
ḡt :                                                             

                                                 ḡ              ḡ
                                                                                       R1

assume that government debt is zero at time zero and that the fiscal authority levies lump-
sum taxes, τt to bridge any gap between seignorage income and government expenditures,
that is, τt = gt − (mt − mt−1 /πt ). As a consequence, government debt is nil at all times.
        We postpone the presentation of the monetary policy regime until after we characterize
a competitive equilibrium.


2.4        Aggregation
We limit attention to a symmetric equilibrium in which all firms that have the opportunity to
change their price optimally at a given time choose the same price. It then follows from (4)
that the aggregate price index can be written as Pt1−η = α(Pt−1 πt−1χ
                                                                        )1−η + (1 − α)P̃t1−η .
Dividing this expression through by Pt1−η one obtains

                                                        χ(1−η)

                                                                             t   .                                 (34)

2.4.1       Market Clearing in the Final Goods Market

Naturally, the set of equilibrium conditions includes a resource constraint. Such a restriction
is typically of the type F (kt , ztht ) − ψzt∗ = ct [1 + `(vt)] + gt + Υ−1
                                                                        t [it + a(ut )kt ]. In the present
model, however, this restriction is not valid. This is because the model implies relative price
dispersion across varieties. This price dispersion, which is induced by the assumed nature
of price stickiness, is inefficient and entails output loss. To see this, consider the following
expression stating that supply must equal demand at the firm level:

with s−1 given. The state variable st summarizes the resource costs induced by the inefficient
price dispersion featured in the Calvo model in equilibrium. Three observations are in order
about the price dispersion measure st . First, st is bounded below by 1. That is, price
dispersion is always a costly distortion in this model. To see that st is bounded below by 1,


                                                                             19
let vit ≡ (Pit /Pt )1−η . It follows from the definition of the price index given in equation (4) that
hR        iη/(η−1)                                            R 1 η/(η−1)

      vit          = 1.  Also,  by definition we  have s t =     v
                                                               0 it
                                                                          . Then, taking into account
                                                                   hR       iη/(η−1)  R 1 η/(η−1)
                                                                      1
that η/(η − 1) > 1, Jensen’s inequality implies that 1 = 0 vit                       ≤ 0 vit      = st.
Second, in an economy where the non-stochastic level of inflation is nil (i.e., when π = 1)
or where prices are fully indexed to any variable ωt with the property that its deterministic
steady-state level equals the deterministic steady-state value of inflation (i.e., ω = π), then
the variable st follows, up to first order, the univariate autoregressive process ŝt = αŝt−1 .
In these cases, the price dispersion measure st has no first-order real consequences for the
stationary distribution of any endogenous variable of the model. This means that studies that
restrict attention to linear approximations to the equilibrium conditions are justified to ignore
the variable st if the model features no price dispersion in the deterministic steady state.
But st matters up to first order when the deterministic steady state features movements in
relative prices across goods varieties. More importantly, the price dispersion variable st must
be taken into account if one is interested in higher-order approximations to the equilibrium
conditions even if relative prices are stable in the deterministic steady state. Omitting st
in higher-order expansions would amount to leaving out certain higher-order terms while
including others. Finally, when prices are fully flexible, α = 0, we have that p̃t = 1 and
thus st = 1. (Obviously, in a flexible-price equilibrium there is no price dispersion across
varieties.)
   As discussed above, equilibrium marginal costs and capital-labor ratios are identical
across firms. Therefore, one can aggregate the firm’s optimality conditions with respect to
labor and capital, equations (25) and (26), as

2.4.2    Market Clearing in the Labor Market

It follows from equation (32) that the aggregate demand for labor of type j ∈ [0, 1], which
                   R1
we denote by hjt ≡ 0 hjit di, is given by

                   hit di denotes the aggregate demand for the composite labor input. Taking
into account that at any point in time the nominal wage rate is identical across all labor
markets at which wages are allowed to change optimally, we have that labor demand in each
of those markets is                                                  −η̃
                                                                w̃t

Combining this expression with equation (39), describing the demand for labor of type
j ∈ [0, 1], and with the time constraint (6), which must hold with equality, we can write

                                                             . The variable s̃t measures the degree of
wage dispersion across different types of labor. The above expression can be written as

                                                        ht = s̃t hdt .                                                (40)

The state variable s̃t evolves over time according to
                                              −η̃                    −η̃                        η̃

We note that because all job varieties are ex-ante identical, any wage dispersion is inefficient.
This is reflected in the fact that s̃t is bounded below by 1. The proof of this statement is
identical to that offered earlier for the fact that st is bounded below by unity. To see this, note
                                 R 1  −η̃
that s̃t can be written as s̃t = 0 W    it

                                              di. This inefficiency introduces a wedge that makes
the number of hours supplied to the market, ht , larger than the number of productive units
of labor input, hdt . In an environment without long-run wage dispersion, the dead-weight
loss created by wage dispersion is nil up to first order. Formally, a first-order approximation
of the law of motion of s̃t yields a univariate autoregressive process of the form s̃ˆt = α̃s̃ˆt−1,
as long as there is no wage dispersion in the deterministic steady state. When wages are
fully flexible, α̃ = 0, wage dispersion disappears, and thus s̃t equals 1.
   It follows from our definition of the wage index given in equation (33) that in equilibrium
the real wage rate must satisfy
                                                                                                1−η̃

In equilibrium, real money holdings can be expressed as

                                        mt = mht + νwt hdt ,                            (44)

and the government budget constraint is given by

                                   τt = gt − (mt − mt−1 /πt).                           (45)


2.5    Functional Forms
We use the following standard functional forms for utility and technology:
                              h                            i1−φ3
                                            1−φ
                               (ct − bct−1 ) 4 (1 − ht )φ4       −1
                         U=                                                             (46)
                                                      1 − φ3

and
                                         F (k, h) = k θ h1−θ .

The functional form for the investment adjustment cost function is taken from Christiano,
Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005):
                                                                       2
                                        it          κ        it
                               S                  =                − µI        ,
                                       it−1         2       it−1

where µI is the steady-state growth rate of investment.
   Following Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004a,b) we assume that the transaction cost tech-
nology takes the form
                                                    p
                               `(v) = φ1v + φ2/v − 2 φ1 φ2.                             (47)

The money demand function implied by the above transaction technology is of the form

                                                  φ2   1 Rt − 1
                                       vt2 =         +          .
                                                  φ1 φ1 Rt

Note the existence of a satiation point for consumption-based money velocity, v, equal to
p
  φ2/φ1 . Also, the implied money demand is unit elastic with respect to consumption expen-
ditures. This feature is a consequence of the assumption that transaction costs, c`(c/m), are


                                                     22
homogenous of degree one in consumption and real balances and is independent of the par-
ticular functional form assumed for `(·). Further, as the parameter φ2 approaches zero, the
transaction cost function `(·) becomes linear in velocity and the demand for money adopts
the Baumol-Tobin square root form with respect to the opportunity cost of holding money,
(R − 1)/R. That is, the log-log elasticity of money demand with respect to the opportunity
cost of holding money converges to 1/2, as φ2 vanishes.
    The costs of higher capacity utilization are parameterized as follows:

                                                              γ2
                                     a(u) = γ1 (u − 1) +         (u − 1)2 .
                                                              2

2.6     Inducing Stationarity
This economy features two types of permanent shocks. As a result, a number of variables,
such as output and the real wage, will not be stationary along the balanced-growth path.
We therefore perform a change of variables so as to obtain a set of equilibrium conditions
that involve only stationary variables. To this end we note that the variables ct , mht , mt,
wt , w̃t , yt, gt , φt , x1t , x2t , and τt are cointegrated with zt∗. Similarly, the variables kt+1 and it
are cointegrated with Υt zt∗, the variable λt is cointegrated with zt∗(1−φ3 )(1−φ4 )−1 , the variables
qt and rtk are cointegrated with 1/Υt , and the variables ft1 and ft2 are cointegrated with
zt∗ (1−φ3 )(1−φ4) . We therefore divide these variables by the appropriate cointegrating factor
and denote the corresponding stationary variables with capital letters.


2.7     Competitive Equilibrium
A stationary competitive equilibrium is a set of stationary processes ut , Ct, ht , It, Kt+1 ,
vt, Mth , Mt , Λt , πt, Wt , µ̃t , Qt , Rkt , Φt , Ft1, Ft2, W̃t, hdt , Yt , mct , Xt1 , Xt2 , p̃t , st, s̃t , and
Tt satisfying (7), (8), (10), (12)-(21), (28)-(30), (34)-(38), and (40)-(45) written in terms of
the stationary variables, given exogenous stochastic processes µΥ,t , µz,t , and ḡt , the policy
process, Rt , and initial conditions c−1 , w−1 , s−1 , s̃−1 , π−1, i−1, and k0 . A complete list of the
competitive equilibrium conditions in terms of stationary variables is given in the technical
appendix to this paper (Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2005b).


2.8     Ramsey Equilibrium
We assume that at t = 0 the benevolent government has been operating for an infinite number
of periods. In choosing optimal policy, the government is assumed to honor commitments
made in the past. This form of policy commitment has been referred to as ‘optimal from
the timeless perspective’ (Woodford, 2003).

                                                       23
    Formally, we define a Ramsey equilibrium as a set of stationary processes ut, Ct , ht , It,

subject to the competitive equilibrium conditions (7), (8), (10), (12)-(21), (28)-(30), (34)-
(38), and (40)-(45) written in stationary variables, and Rt ≥ 1, for t > −∞, given exogenous
stochastic processes µz,t , µΥ,t , and ḡt , values of the variables listed above dated t < 0, and
values of the Lagrange multipliers associated with the constraints listed above dated t < 0.
    Technically, the difference between the usual Ramsey equilibrium concept and the one
employed here is that here the structure of the optimality conditions associated with the
Ramsey equilibrium is time invariant. By contrast, under the standard Ramsey equilibrium
definition, the equilibrium conditions in the initial periods are different from those applying
to later periods.
    Our approach to analyzing the business-cycle properties of Ramsey-optimal policy is
comparable to that in the existing literature under the standard definition of Ramsey op-
timality (e.g., Chari, Christiano, and Kehoe, 1995). The reason is that existing studies of
business cycles under the standard Ramsey policy focus on the behavior of the economy in
the stochastic steady state (i.e., they limit attention to the properties of equilibrium time
series excluding the initial transition).


3      Calibration
The time unit is meant to be one quarter. For most of the calibration we draw on the paper
by Altig et al. (2005) (hereafter ACEL). We assign most of the parameter values from the
‘high-markup’ case of the ACEL estimation results. In this case, the steady-state markup
in product markets is 20 percent (or η = 6).
    Following ACEL, we assume that in the deterministic steady state of the competitive
equilibrium the rate of capacity utilization equals one (u = 1) and profits are zero (φ =
0). ACEL calibrate the discount factor, β, to be 1.03−1/4 , the depreciation rate, δ, to be
0.025, and the capital share, θ, to be 0.36. ACEL assume that preferences are separable
in consumption and leisure and logarithmic in habit-adjusted consumption (φ3 = 1). Their
assumed functional form for the period utility function implies a unit Frisch elasticity of labor
supply. ACEL assume a steady-state markup of wages over the marginal rate of substitution

                                                                   24
between leisure and consumption of 5 percent (or η̃ = 21).
    ACEL estimate the degree of nominal wage stickiness to be slightly above 3 quarters
(α̃ = 0.69). They also estimate the degree of habit formation measured by the parameter b
to be 0.69, the elasticity of the marginal capital adjustment cost, κ, to be 2.79, the elasticity
of the marginal cost of capacity utilization, γ2 /γ1 , to be 1.46, and the annualized interest
semielasticity of money demand by households, (1/4)∂ ln(mht )/∂(Rt ), to be -0.81.
   ACEL estimate the parameters of the exogenous stochastic processes for the investment-
specific and neutral technology shocks µΥ,t and µz,t to be, respectively, (µΥ , σµΥ , ρµΥ ) =
(1.0042, 0.0031, 0.20) and (µz , σµz , ρµz ) = (1.00213, 0.0007, 0.89).
   ACEL estimate the degree of price stickiness to be 5 quarters (or α = 0.8) when capital
is not firm specific, which is the assumption maintained in this paper.
    We do not draw from the work of ACEL to calibrate the degree of indexation in product
prices and wages. The reason is that in their study the parameters governing the degree
of indexation are not estimated. They simply assume full indexation of all prices to past
product price inflation. Instead, we draw from the econometric work of Cogley and Sbordone
(2005) and Levin et al. (2005) who find no evidence of indexation in product prices. We
therefore set χ = 0. At the same time, Levin et al. estimate a high degree of indexation in
nominal wages. We therefore assume that χ̃ = 1, which happens to be the value assumed in
ACEL.
   Following Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005), hereafter CEE, we set the steady-
state share of money held by households, mh /m, to 0.44. Using postwar U.S. data, we
measure the average money-to-output ratio as the ratio of M1 to GDP, and set it equal to
17 percent per year. Neither ACEL nor CEE impose this calibration restriction. Instead,
they assume that all of the wage bill is subject to a cash-in-advance constraint—i.e., they
impose ν = 1. By contrast, our calibration implies that only 60 percent of wage payments
must be held in money (or ν = 0.6).
   In calibrating the model we assume that in the deterministic steady state of the compet-
itive equilibrium the rate of inflation equals 4.2 percent per year. This value coincides with
the average growth rate of the U.S. postwar GDP deflator.
   ACEL do not consider government purchases shocks. One study that estimates the
process for government purchases in the context of a model similar to the one we are studying
is Ravn (2005) and we use his findings to calibrate this process. Specifically, Ravn estimates
ρg = 0.9 and σg = 0.008. Finally, we impose that the steady-state share of government
consumption in value added is 17 percent, which equals the average value observed in the
United States over the postwar period.

4     The Ramsey Steady State
In this section, we characterize the long-run state of the Ramsey equilibrium in an economy
without uncertainty. We refer to this state as the Ramsey steady state. Note that the Ramsey
steady state is in general different from the allocation/policy that maximizes welfare in the
steady state of a competitive equilibrium.
    In most existing studies on optimal monetary policy in economies with neo-Keynesian
features, the task of characterizing the Ramsey steady state is trivial. The reason is that
these studies assume the existence of a single nominal distortion, namely sluggish adjustment
in nominal product or factor prices or both. In this case, the optimal rate of inflation in
the Ramsey steady state is nil. By contrast, the economy studied in this paper features
additional nominal frictions in the form of money demand by households and firms. This
feature complicates the computation of the Ramsey steady state in the context of the rich
theoretical environment studied in this paper.
    Two exceptions to the common practice of abstracting from money demand in anal-
ysis of optimal monetary policy in the neo-Keynesian model are Khan et al. (2003) and
Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004a). In both of these studies, the computation of the Ramsey
steady state is relatively straight forward because of the simplicity of the theoretical struc-
tures considered. In particular, neither study features wage stickiness, capital accumulation,
habit formation, variable capacity utilization, or factor adjustment costs. When all of these
complications are added, it becomes virtually impossible to characterize the Ramsey steady
state conditions analytically. A contribution of the research project to which this paper
belongs is the development of a general algorithm to characterize and numerically solve the
Ramsey equilibrium in medium-scale macroeconomic models. This algorithm yields an exact
numerical solution for the Ramsey steady-state equilibrium.


4.1    Price Stickiness and the Optimal Inflation Rate
We find that the most striking characteristic of the Ramsey steady state is the high sensitivity
of the optimal rate of inflation with respect to the parameter governing the degree of price
stickiness, α, for the range of values of this parameter that is empirically relevant.
    Available empirical estimates of the degree of price rigidity using macroeconomic data
vary from 2 to 5 quarters, or α ∈ [0.5, 0.8]. For example, CEE (2005) in the context of
a model similar to ours estimate α to be 0.6. By contrast, ACEL (2005), using a model

identical to the present one, estimate an marginal-cost-gap coefficient in the Phillips curve
that is consistent with a value of α of around 0.8 when the market for capital is assumed to
be centralized, as is maintained in our formulation.4 Both CEE and ACEL use an impulse-
response matching technique to estimate α. Bayesian estimates of this parameter include
Del Negro et al. (2004) and Levin et al. (2005) who report posterior means of 0.67 and 0.83,
respectively, and 90-percent probability intervals of (0.51,0.83) and (0.81,0.86), respectively.
Evidence on price stickiness based on microeconomic data suggest a much higher frequency
of price changes than the evidence based on macro data. The findings reported in Bils and
Klenow (2004) and Golosov and Lucas (2003), for example, suggest values of α of around
1/3, or a degree of price stickiness of about 1.5 quarters.

available empirical evidence using macro data, the optimal rate of inflation is -4 percent,
virtually equal to the level called for by the Friedman rule. For our baseline value of α of
0.8, which is near the upper range of the available empirical evidence using macro data, the
optimal level of inflation rises to -0.4 percent, which is close to price stability. Also evident
from figure 1 is the fact that values of α based on microeconomic evidence, around 1/3,
imply that the Friedman rule is Ramsey optimal in the long-run.
   The above analysis suggests that it is of outmost importance to devote further research
into refining the available estimates of the degree of price stickiness. This research should
aim not only at narrowing the range of values that stem from macro evidence but also at
reconciling the apparent disconnect between estimates emerging from macro and micro data.
   Besides the uncertainty surrounding the estimation of the degree of price stickiness, a
second aspect of the apparent difficulty in establishing reliably the long-run level of inflation
has to do with the shape of the relationship linking the degree of price stickiness to the
optimal level of inflation. The problem resides in the fact that this relationship becomes
significantly steep precisely for that range of values of α that is empirically most compelling.
The problem would not arise if the steep portion of the relationship would take place at
values of α below 1/3 or above 0.8, say. It turns out that an important factor determining
the shape of the function relating the optimal level of inflation to the degree of price stickiness
is the underlying fiscal policy regime.


4.2    Fiscal Policy and the Optimal Inflation Rate
In this paper, we follow the widespread practice in the literature on optimal monetary policy
in the neo-Keynesian framework of ignoring fiscal considerations by implicitly or explicitly
assuming the existence of lump-sum, nondistorting taxes that balance the government budget
at all times and under all circumstances. This assumption is clearly unrealistic and usually
maintained on the sole basis of simplicity. We wish to argue that taking explicitly into
account the fiscal side of the optimal policy problem has crucial consequences for the optimal
long-run level of inflation.
   Fiscal considerations fundamentally change the long-run tradeoff between price stability
and the Friedman rule. To see this, we now briefly consider an economy where lump-sum
taxes are unavailable. Instead, the fiscal authority must finance government purchases by
means of proportional capital and labor income taxes. The social planner sets jointly mon-
etary and fiscal policy in a Ramsey-optimal fashion. The details of this environment are
contained in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2005a). Figure 2 displays the relationship between
the degree of price stickiness, α, and the optimal rate of inflation, π. The solid line cor-

responds to the baseline case considered in this paper (featuring lump-sum taxes).5 The
dash-circled line corresponds to the economy with optimally chosen income taxes analyzed
in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2005a).6 In stark contrast to what happens under lump-sum
taxation, under optimal distortionary taxation the function linking π and α is flat and very
close to zero for the entire range of macro-data-based empirically plausible values of α,
namely 0.5 to 0.8. In other words, when taxes are distortionary and optimally determined,
price stability emerges as a prediction that is robust to the existing uncertainty about the
exact degree of price stickiness. Even if one focuses on the evidence of price stickiness stem-
ming from micro data, the model with distortionary Ramsey taxation predicts an optimal
long-run level of inflation that is much closer to zero than to the level predicted by the
Friedman rule.
    Our intuition for why price stability arises as a robust policy recommendation in the
economy with optimally set distortionary taxation runs as follows. Consider the economy
with lump-sum taxation. Deviating from the Friedman rule (by raising the inflation rate) has
the benefit of reducing the price dispersion that originates in the presence of price stickiness.
Consider next the economy with Ramsey-optimal income taxation and no lump-sum taxes.
In this economy, deviating from the Friedman rule still provides the benefit of reducing
price dispersion. However, in this economy increasing inflation has the additional benefit
of increasing seignorage revenue thereby allowing the social planner to lower distortionary
income tax rates. Therefore, the Friedman-rule versus price-stability tradeoff is tilted in
favor of price stability.
   It follows from this intuition that what is essential in inducing the optimality of price
stability is that on the margin the fiscal authority trades off the inflation tax for regular
taxation. Indeed, it can be shown that if distortionary tax rates are fixed, even if they are
fixed at the level that is optimal in a world without lump-sum taxes, and the fiscal authority
has access to lump-sum taxes on the margin, the optimal rate of inflation is much closer to
the Friedman rule than to zero. In this case, increasing inflation no longer has the benefit of
reducing distortionary taxes. As a result, the Ramsey planner has less incentives to inflate.

      In producing the solid line shown in figure 2, all structural parameters take their baseline values shown
in table 1 except for the long-run growth rates of the two productivity shocks, which are set to zero. This
deviation from the baseline calibration is necessary to preserve comparability with the model in Schmitt-
Grohé and Uribe (2005a), which features no long-run growth. The solid line looks essentially like the one
shown in figure 1, with the only difference that at the Friedman rule the inflation rate is -2.9 percent, whereas
in figure 1 it is -4.6 percent. This difference is explained by the lack of growth in the model used to produce
the solid line in figure 2.

shown in table 1 in the present paper, except for those governing long-run growth, which are set to zero.
The model economy features proportional labor, capital, and profit taxes. The profit tax rate is constrained
to be equal to the capital income tax rate. Government transfers are set to zero.

      Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005) and Altig et al. (2005). All parameters other
      than χ take their baseline values, given in table 1.


4.3    Price Indexation and the Optimal Inflation Rate
The parameter χ measuring the degree of price indexation is crucial in determining the
optimal level of long-run inflation. The reason is that when prices are fully indexed (χ =
1), price dispersion disappears in the deterministic steady state. As a result the social
planner faces no longer a tradeoff between minimizing price dispersion and minimizing the
opportunity cost of holding money. In such an environment, the Friedman rule is Ramsey
optimal. In the absence of perfect indexation (χ < 1), any deviation from zero inflation
will entail price dispersion, and the lower the degree of indexation, the higher will be the
price dispersion associated with a given level of inflation. Consequently, the Ramsey optimal
deflation rate is increasing in the degree of price indexation.
   Figure 3 shows that the Ramsey optimal inflation rate is indeed a decreasing function of
the indexation parameter χ. CEE and ACEL assume that prices are perfectly indexed to
lagged inflation, that is, they calibrate the parameter χ to be unity. Under this assumption,
the Friedman rule is optimal in the deterministic Ramsey steady state. However, the few

existing studies that attempt to estimate econometrically the indexation parameter χ find
little empirical support for price indexation. For example, Levin et al. (2005) using Bayesian
methods report a tight estimate of χ of 0.08. Similarly, Cogley and Sbordone (2005) using
a different empirical strategy than Levin et al. also find virtually no evidence of price
indexation in U.S. data. As we argued above, these two empirical studies motivate our
setting χ = 0.


4.4    Money Demand and the Optimal Inflation Rate
Given the long-run policy tradeoffs present in the model—namely, minimizing the opportu-
nity cost of holding money (by setting Rt = 1) versus minimizing price dispersion (by setting
πt = 1)—one should expect that the larger is the money demand friction, the closer is the
optimal rate of inflation to the one prescribed by the Friedman rule. Figure 4 displays the
optimal rate of inflation as a function of the two structural parameters defining the demand
for money by households, φ1 and φ2 . The figure suggests that the optimal rate of inflation
is rather insensitive to changes in these two parameters. For instance, at the baseline value
of 0.05 for the parameter φ1 , the optimal rate of inflation is -0.4 percent per year and money
demand is 17 percent of GDP. If one increases φ1 by a factor of 10 to 0.5, the optimal rate of
deflation is still small at only 1 percent, but the demand for money doubles to 35 percent of
GDP. One must increase φ1 by a factor of more than 150 to around 8 to induce an optimal
inflation rate close to the Friedman rule. At this value of φ1, the demand for money is larger
than one entire annual GDP.


                                                        33
   The reason for the implied low sensitivity of the Ramsey inflation rate with respect to
the parameters defining the demand for money is the assumed high degree of price stickiness.
This distortion is so dominant in the present model that optimal policy is overwhelmingly
geared toward price stability. As a result, low inflation survives as the overriding goal of
monetary policy even for economically large values of the money demand distortion. If
one lowers the degree of price stickiness, the optimal rate of inflation becomes much more
sensitive with respect the transaction-cost parameter φ1 . Figure 4 displays with a dashed
line the relationship between the optimal rate of inflation and the parameters φ1 and φ2 when
the sticky-price parameter α takes the value 0.6. In this case, the optimal rate of inflation
falls from near price stability to the Friedman rule much faster as one increases φ1 than in
the baseline case in which α is 0.8.
   A similar message emerges as one varies the other transaction cost parameter, φ2. Only for
economically implausible values of φ2 (ones implying extremely high interest-rate elasticities
of money demand) does the Friedman rule emerge as Ramsey optimal.


4.5    Implications for Inflation Targeting
A robust implication of the ACEL model studied here is that the central bank should target
mild deflation. This implication is at odds with the observed inflation goals among the
by-now large number of industrialized and emerging-market countries that self-identify their
monetary policy as inflation targeting. In industrialized countries, inflation targets typically
lie in the rage of 2 to 3 percent per year. Inflation targets are somewhat higher in developing
countries.
   It is therefore a challenge for monetary policy to square theoretically optimal inflation
targets with actual ones. One reason often offered for why the inflation target should be
positive is that too low an inflation target (in particular, zero or negative targets) would leave
the central bank too close to the zero bound on nominal interest rates, thereby impairing the
monetary authority’s ability to steer the economy out of recession. Our analysis thus far is
necessarily mute on this point because we have limited attention to a characterization of the
Ramsey steady state. In order to ascertain whether the zero bound will indeed be frequently
visited under the Ramsey optimal stabilization policy, a dynamic equilibrium analysis must
be carried out. We turn to this matter next.

5     Ramsey Dynamics
In this section, we characterize the business cycle dynamics that arise in the stochastic
steady state of the Ramsey equilibrium. We approximate the Ramsey equilibrium dynam-
ics by solving a first-order approximation to the Ramsey equilibrium conditions. There is
evidence that first-order approximations to the Ramsey equilibrium conditions deliver dy-
namics that are fairly close to those associated with the exact solution. For instance, in
Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004b) we compute the exact solution to the Ramsey equilibrium
in a flexible-price dynamic economy with money, income taxes, and monopolistic competi-
tion in product markets. In Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004a) we compute the solution to
the exact same economy using a first-order approximation to the Ramsey equilibrium condi-
tions. We find that the exact solution is not significantly different from the one based on a
first-order approximation. More recently, Benigno and Woodford (2005) have shown, in the
context of optimal taxation in the standard RBC model, that the first-order approximation
to the Ramsey equilibrium conditions implies second moments that are similar to the second
moments computed from an approximation based on a minimum-weighted-residual method
reported in Chari et al. (1995).


5.1    Is the Zero Bound an Impediment to Optimal Policy?
As mentioned earlier, one argument against setting a zero or negative inflation target, as
recommended by the present model, is that at zero or negative rates of inflation the risk
of hitting the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates would severely restrict the central
bank’s ability to conduct successful stabilization policy. This argument is made explicit in
Summers (1991), for example. Table 2 reports the standard deviations of the nominal interest
rate as well as other key macroeconomic variables under the Ramsey optimal stabilization
policy. In computing these second moments, all structural parameters of the model take
the values shown in table 1. The table shows that the standard deviation of the nominal
interest rate is only 0.4 percentage points at an annual rate. At the same time, the Ramsey
steady-state level of the nominal interest rate is 4.4 percent. These two figures taken together
imply that for the nominal interest rate to hit the zero bound, it must fall more than 10
standard deviations below its target level. The probability of this happening is so small that
in the context of the estimated medium-scale model studied in this paper, the zero bound on
nominal interest rates does not impose an economically important constraint on the conduct
of optimal monetary policy.
    This conclusion appears to be robust to changes in the degree of price or wage stickiness
within the range of available empirical estimates for the parameters determining the degree

5.2    Optimality of Inflation Stability
The Ramsey authority faces a three-dimensional tradeoff in determining the optimal degree
of inflation volatility. The sticky price distortion in isolation calls for minimizing inflation
volatility. The money demand distortion, on the other hand, calls for stabilizing the op-
portunity cost of holding money, that is, minimizing the standard deviation of Rt . Finally,
the sticky wage distortion renders stabilization of wage inflation (in the absence of indexa-
tion) or stabilization of wage inflation net of lagged price inflation (under full indexation to
past price inflation) Ramsey optimal. Table 2 shows that this three-way tradeoff is resolved
overwhelmingly in favor of inflation stability.
   To see how sensitive the inflation stability goal is with respect to the size of the sticky
wage distortion, we also consider the case of α̃ = 0.9, which implies that unions reoptimize
wages only every 10 quarters. In this case, as expected, the optimal volatility of price
inflation increases and that of wage inflation falls. The optimal standard deviation of price
inflation is now 0.4 percent per year and the optimal standard deviation of wage inflation is
now 1.0 percent. Yet, price inflation continues to be significant smoother over the business
cycle than wage inflation. We conclude that a central characteristic of optimal stabilization
policy is smooth inflation rates. In this sense, one could say that the Ramsey planner pursues
a policy of inflation targeting.


5.3    Ramsey Optimal Impulse Responses and Variance Decompo-
       sition
Optimal stabilization policy will in general be shaped by the number and nature of the
exogenous shocks generating aggregate fluctuations. There is considerable debate in the
empirical literature about the identification of the main sources of business cycle fluctuations.
One branch of the literature uses structural vector autoregression analysis to identify specific
structural shocks. Examples of this approach are Altig et al. (2005) and Fisher (2005). The
work of Fisher (2005) suggests that investment specific technology shocks may explain as
much as 50 percent of variations in hours worked. Altig et al. identify monetary policy shocks
and investment-specific as well as neutral technology shocks. They find that investment-
specific shocks play a smaller role in generating business cycles: specifically, they estimate
that neutral and investment-specific technology shocks together explain only about one third
of the fluctuations in hours, output, and consumption.

   On the other hand, there is a very active recent literature that uses Bayesian methods
to estimate the entire data generating process of a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
model. The paper of Smets and Wouters (2004) is a key example of this line of research.
Those authors estimate a model with 10 shocks. One might consider using all of those
10 estimated shocks in the optimal policy problem. However, in econometrically estimated
versions of the model studied in this paper (or variations thereof), it is often the case that
many of these shocks are difficult to interpret economically. In effect, these shocks, to a
large extent, represent simple econometric residuals reflecting the distance between model
and data rather than true sources of business-cycle fluctuations. A case in point are shocks
to Euler equations or markup shocks. Before incorporating this type of residual as driving
forces, it is perhaps more productive to give theory a chance to get closer to the data.
Therefore, we do not attempt to build a model that includes all sources of fluctuations. We
simply focus on three shocks that have been shown in the empirical literature to explain
a significant fraction of aggregate fluctuations. Namely, neutral and investment-specific
technology shocks and government purchases shocks.
   Table 3 shows how important each of these three shocks is in explaining short-run fluctu-
ations under the Ramsey regime. Variations in output growth are explained in equal parts
by government purchases shocks and neutral technology shocks, which each account for 45
percent of output growth variance. Investment-specific productivity shocks play a minor role
in driving fluctuations in output growth. However, investment-specific shocks are important
in explaining movements in hours worked (47 percent), wage inflation (37 percent), and in-
vestment growth (61 percent). Fluctuations in consumption growth, the nominal interest
rate, inflation, and wage inflation are mainly driven by neutral productivity shocks with a
small contribution of government purchases shocks.

Note: The size of the initial innovation to the neutral technology shock is one
percent, ln(µz,0 /µz ) = 1%. The nominal interest rate and the inflation rate
are expressed in levels in percent per year. Output, wages, investment, and
consumption are expressed in cumulative growth rates in percent. Hours and
capacity utilization are expressed in percentage deviations from their respective
steady-state values.

of the neutral technology shock (ln(µz,0 /µz ) = 1%). The Ramsey planner raises nominal
interest rates by 175 basis points on impact and allows inflation to fall slightly by 45 basis
points. This monetary tightening is short lived however, after 6 quarters the nominal interest
rate is back at 5 percent, or 50 basis points above its long run target. We conjecture that
the reason for this tightening is as follows. The Ramsey planner aims to replicate the real
allocation associated with the flexible-price flexible-wage economy. In such an economy,
the real interest rate would rise at least temporarily in response to a positive shock to the
growth rate of technology. With sluggish nominal price adjustment, the Ramsey planner
would like to induce a rise in the real interest rate without relying in costly movements in
the inflation rate. Because the real interest rate equals the risk free nominal interest rate
minus the inflation rate, it follows that the Ramsey-optimal policy is to raise nominal interest
rates roughly by the amount that real interest rates would rise in the flexible-price economy.
Interestingly, nominal interest rates are tightened not to avoid inflation, but rather to avoid
deflation.
   Currently, there exists an active debate surrounding the estimated effects of neutral
technology shocks on hours. For example, Galı́ (1999) finds that hours decline on impact
whereas ACEL find that hours increase. Consistent with the findings of Galı́, our model
predicts that under the Ramsey policy hours decline on impact in response to a positive
innovation in the neutral technology shock. Our intuition for the initial decline in hours is as
follows. Because monetary policy induces a sharp increase in real interest rates on impact,
the wealth effect on consumption is muted initially. Additionally, due to the presence of
adjustment costs in investment, investment spending does not increase much on impact. As a
result the positive wealth effect generated by the increase in productivity growth materializes
in an expansion of the consumption of leisure.
  Figure 6 presents the Ramsey impulse responses to a one percent innovation in govern-
ment purchases. A one percent increase in government consumption raises output by 0.15
percent. Given that in the model the share of public consumption in GDP is assumed to
be 17 percent, it follows that the government spending multiplier implied by the model is
slightly below unity. The model predicts that the government should increase interest rates
in response to a positive government spending shock, which is in line with conventional
wisdom.
   Figure 7 displays the model’s response to a one percentage point increase in the growth
rate of investment-specific technological change. Ramsey policy calls for an easing of money
market conditions in response to a positive investment-specific productivity shock. Again,
our intuition is that the Ramsey planner tries to mimic the flexible-price equilibrium. In
the absence of price stickiness, real interest rates would fall. Hence, the Ramsey planner

6       Optimal Operational Interest-Rate Rules
Ramsey outcomes are mute on the issue of what policy regimes can implement them. The
information on policy one can extract from the solution to the Ramsey problem is limited
to the equilibrium behavior of policy variables such as the nominal interest rate. But this
information is in general of little use for central banks seeking to implement the Ramsey equi-
librium. Specifically, the equilibrium process of policy variables in the Ramsey equilibrium
is a function of all of the states of the Ramsey equilibrium. These state variables include all
of the exogenous driving forces and all of the endogenous predetermined variables. Among
this second set of variables are past values of the Lagrange multipliers associated with the
constraints of the Ramsey problem. Even if the policymaker could observe the state of all of
these variables, using the equilibrium process of the policy variables to define a policy regime
would not guarantee the Ramsey outcome as the competitive equilibrium. The problem is
that such a policy regime could give rise to multiple equilibria.
   In this section, we show that a simple interest-rate feedback rule implements the Ram-
sey equilibrium in the medium-scale model under study. Specifically, we focus on finding
parameterizations of interest-rate rules that satisfy the following 4 conditions: (a) They are
simple, in the sense that they involve only a few observable macroeconomic variables; (b)
They guarantee local uniqueness of the rational expectations equilibrium; (c) The associated
path of the nominal interest rate does not violate the zero bound.7 and (d) They maximize
the expected lifetime utility of the representative household conditional on the initial state
of the economy being the deterministic steady state of the Ramsey economy. We refer to
rules that satisfy criteria (a)-(c) as operational. We refer to operational rules that satisfy
criterion (d) as optimal operational rules.
    The family of rules that we consider consists of interest-rules whereby the nominal interest
rate depends linearly on its own lag, the rates of price and wage inflation, and the growth
rate of output. Formally, the interest-rate rule is given by
                                  π                                                        
                 Rt                   t            πtW                  yt                   Rt−1
        ln                = απ ln          + αW ln            + αy ln                + αR ln            .   (48)
                 R∗                  π∗            πW ∗               yt−1 µ∗y                R∗
                                           ∗
The target values R∗ , π ∗, π W and µ∗y are assumed to be the Ramsey steady-state values
    7
     We approximate this constraint by requiring that in the competitive equilibrium two standard deviations
of the nominal interest rate be less than the steady-state level of the nominal interest rate.

of their associated endogenous variables. (The steady-state growth of output is indeed
exogenous and given by µz∗ .) The variable πtW denotes nominal wage inflation and in the
                                             ∗
nonstochachstic steady state we have that π W ≡ µz∗ π ∗ . It follows that in our search for the
optimal operational policy rule, we pick the four policy parameters (απ , αW , αy , αR) so as to
                            P∞
maximize welfare, Vt ≡ E0 t=0 β tU (ct − bct−1, ht), where expectations are taken conditional
on the initial state being the non-stochastic steady state of the Ramsey equilibrium. Given
the complexity of the model, an exact numerical solution does not exist. We therefore
approximate our conditional welfare measure to second-order accuracy using the numerical
method developed in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004c).


6.1    The Optimal Operational Rule
We find that the optimal operational interest rate is given by
                                   π                                                                             
                 Rt                     t                  πtW                         yt                          Rt−1
        ln                = 5.0 ln          + 1.6 ln                  − 0.1 ln                      + 0.4 ln                  .
                 R∗                   π ∗                  πW ∗                      yt−1 µ∗y                       R∗

The optimal operational interest-rate rule is active in both price and wage inflation because
both coefficients are greater than unity. In addition, the rule prescribes virtually no response
to output growth. In this sense the optimized interest-rate rule can indeed be interpreted as a
pure inflation targeting rule. According to the above rule, the policymaker reacts positively
to lagged nominal interest rates. Because the interest-rate coefficient is less than unity,
the rule is inertial but not superinertial. Thus, the policymaker is backward looking in its
response to inflation deviations from target.
   To quantify the difference in the level of welfare under the Ramsey policy and under the
optimal operational rule, we compute the welfare costs of the optimal operational interest-
rate rules relative to the time-invariant equilibrium process associated with the Ramsey
policy.
   We assume that at time zero all state variables of the economy equal their respective
Ramsey-steady-state values. Because the non-stochastic steady state is the same across all
policy regimes we consider, computing expected welfare conditional on the initial state being
the nonstochastic steady state ensures that the economy begins from the same initial point
under all possible polices.
   Consider the Ramsey policy, and denote the contingent plans for consumption and hours
under the Ramsey policy by crt and hrt . Similarly, denote the contingent plans under the
alternative policy regime by cat and hat . Let λc denote the welfare cost of adopting policy
regime a instead of the Ramsey policy conditional on a particular state in period zero. We

define λc as the fraction of regime r’s consumption process that a household would be willing
to give up to be as well off under regime a as under regime r. It follows that λc is implicitly
defined by8

                    ∞                                                   X
                                                                        ∞

Similarly, one can derive an unconditional welfare cost measure. That is one can ask which
fraction of consumption under the Ramsey policy are agents willing to give up, to attain
the same unconditional expectation of lifetime utility as under the alternative policy. Let λu
denote this unconditional welfare cost measure. Then λu is implicitly given by
               (                                           )           (∞                                             )

                   ∞                                                    X
           E             β tU (cat − bcat−1), hat )              =E            β t U ((1 − λc )(crt − bcrt−1), hrt ) .

We restrict attention to approximations of λc and λu that are accurate up to second order.
See the appendix for a derivation.
   Table 4, displays the central result of this section. Namely, that the welfare costs of fol-
lowing the optimal operational interest rate rule rather than the Ramsey policy are virtually
zero; agents are willing to give up less than one one-hundreths of one percent of the Ramsey
consumption stream (or less than 23 cents per annum) to be as well off under the optimal
   8
    Note that for analytical convenience we apply the factor (1 − λc ) to c−1 eventhough this variable is
predetermined at the time of the policy evaluation. In Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004d) we show that if one
were not to apply the factor (1 − λc ) to c−1, then one would obtain a welfare cost measure that is slightly
smaller than the one we obtain here. However, because the alternative welfare cost measure is proportioal
to the one we use here, the welfare rankings would be unchanged. Furthermore, our conclusion that the
opotimal operational rule yields virtually the same level of welfare as the Ramsey policy would only be
strengthened.


                                                                       45
operational rule as under the Ramsey policy.
   A central characteristic of the optimal rule is that its response to output is mute. Forcing
the output coefficient, αy , to be zero, increases the welfare cost by less than one cent per
year. This finding has an important policy implication. Central banks need not respond to
a measure of output in order to implement an equilibrium that provides virtually the same
level of welfare as the Ramsey policy.
       While it is true that responding to output has virtually zero welfare gains, one can show
that it may have significant welfare costs. In table 4 we consider a Taylor rule with a
coefficient of 0.5 on deviations of output from trend (ln(Yt /Y )) and an inflation coefficient
of 1.5. This rule is associated with welfare costs of almost $50 per person per year, or $ 200
per 4-person household per year.
   Interest-rate smoothing is not essential from a welfare point of view in the present econ-
omy. Under the optimal rule the interest rate smoothing coefficient is 0.4. If one eliminates
interest-rate smoothing by setting αR = 0 while keeping the other rule coefficients at απ = 5,
αy = 0, and απW = 1.6, the welfare costs of the rule increase by 3 cents per year to 26 cents
per year, which we regard as negligible.9
       Next, we address the question of how important it is for the central bank to respond to
both wage and price inflation rather than to just price inflation. Setting απW = αy = αR = 0
and leaving απ at the optimized value of 5 increases welfre costs to 81 cents per year per
person (or 0.003 percent of annual consumption). This is still a fairly small number, which
leads us to conclude that a simple policy prescription, namely, responding aggressively to
price inflation only, can bring about an equilibrium in which agents are virtually as well off
as under the Ramsey policy. In this sense, we can interpret our findings as supportive of
inflation targeting policies.
    Table 4 presents the optimal operational rule when wages are reoptimized every 10 quar-
ters, or α̃ = 0.9. In the baseline calibration, we draw from the work of Altig et al. (2005)
and assume that wage contracts are reoptimized about every third quarter (α̃ = 0.69). As
mentioned earlier, the model of Altig et al. (2005) adopts the Erceg et al. (2000) model of
nominal wage stickiness. Under this formulation, wage dispersion generates heterogeneity in
work intensity across households. In our formulation, all households supply the same amount
of labor. In equilibrium, these two alternative modeling strategies result, up to first order,
in a different labor markup coefficient in the wage Phillips curve. Specifically, under the
assumption of no growth, µυ = µz = 1, the log-linear approximation to the wage inflation
   9
    In Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2006) we study a simpler model without nominal wage rigidity or growth.
In that model we also find that the optimal interest-rate rule delivers virtually the same level of welfare as
the Ramsey policy, that the optimal response to output is nil, that responding to output can entail significant
welfare costs, and that the welfare gains from interest-rate smoothing are negligible.

is about 0.9. With this degree of wage stickiness the optimized interest-rate rule calls for a
more aggressive response to wage inflation and a less aggressive response to price inflation.
In addition, the optimal rule now displays a superinertial response to lagged interest rates.
The rule continues to call for a mute response to output variations. The welfare differences
between the optimal operation rule and the Ramsey policy are still small at 0.005 percent
of the Ramsey consumption stream.
   In computing the coeffcients of the optimized policy rule, thus far we have restricted
attention to maximizing lifetime utility of the representative household conditional on a
particular initial the initial state of the economy being the nonstochastic Ramsey steady
state. Alternative, one could pick policy-rule coefficients so as to maximize an unconditional
measure of lifetime utility. Our results are robust to adopting this alternative. Specifically,
under the unconditional welfare objective we obtain απ = 5.1, αW = 1.6, αy = −0.1,
αR = 0.4, 100 × λc = 0.001, and 100 × λu = 0.001.
   Figures 8, 9, and 10 compare the impulse responses of all variables of the model to the
three shocks driving aggregate fluctuations under the Ramsey-optimal policy (solid lines)
and under the optimized operational interest-rate rule (broken lines). In the figures, inflation
and the nominal interest rate are in percent per quarter deviations from their steady-state
values. All other variables are expressed in percent deviations from their deterministic steady
state. As described earlier in section 2.6 variables in capital letters are stationarity-inducing
transformations of the corresponding variables in lowercase letters. The figures suggest a
remarkable match between the Ramsey responses and the impulse responses associated with
the optimized operational interest-rate rule.


6.2    Interest-Rate Rules and Equilibrium Determinacy
For an interest-rate feedback rule to be operational, we require that it induce a locally
determinate rational expectations equilibrium. A natural question is what restrictions this
requirement imposes on the values that the parameters defining the interest rate rule can
take. Figure 11 displays with dots the values of the price- and wage-inflation coefficients

(απ and αW ) in the interest-rate rule (48) for which the equilibrium is locally determinate.
In producing the figure, the remaining two policy parameters, αy and αR , associated with
output growth and the lagged interest rate are set to zero. It is clear from the figure that
to a first approximation a condition for determinacy is that the sum of the price- and wage-
inflation coefficients be greater than unity. That is, local determinacy of equilibrium requires
that
                                                    απ + αW > 1.

The result that the inflation coefficient must be greater than unity for the equilibrium to be
unique is easily established in small models with few frictions (see, for example, Leeper, 1991).
It is of interest that the same principle applies to a much richer theoretical structure like the
one studied in the present paper. Also noteworthy is the apparent perfect substitutability on
the margin between the price- and wage-inflation coefficients in ensuring local uniqueness.
In effect, at the southwest frontier of the uniqueness area the price- and wage-inflation
coefficients satisfy απ + αW ≈ 1.
   Local uniqueness of equilibrium is related to the long-run values of the inflation coeffi-
cients of the interest-rate rule. In the example discussed thus far, the inertial term of the
policy rule, αR , is assumed to be nil. As a result, the short- and long-run values of the price-
and wage-inflation coefficients coincide and are equals to απ and αW , respectively. Increasing


                                                              51
the value of αR to its optimal level of 0.4 results in a local-determinacy area defined by the
relation απ + αW > 0.4. This result appears to generalize to other values of the interest-rate
coefficient. Thus, the pattern that appears to emerge implies roughly a determinacy area
defined by the relation [απ + αW ]/(1 − αR ) > 1. In words, the long-run value of the price-
and wage-inflation coefficients of the interest-rate rule must add up to a number larger than
unity for the equilibrium to be locally unique.


7     Discussion and Conclusion
The central focus of the present study is the characterization and implementation of optimal
monetary policy in the context of a rich model of the macroeconomy with parameters and
sources of uncertainty estimated to fit observed fluctuations at business-cycle frequency.
    The central recommendation that emerges from the solution of the Ramses optimization
problem is that the central bank should aim at a low and highly stable rate of inflation. This
prescription is very much in line with those proposed by advocates of inflation targeting.
    At a deeper level, however, the inflation predictions of the Ramsey equilibrium are neither
robust nor coincidental with the inflation targeting principles. With respect to robustness,
the Ramsey-optimal inflation target varies enormously with the parameter determining the
degree of price stickiness. For empirically plausible values of this parameter, the optimal
inflation target ranges from the Friedman rule (i.e., minus the real interest rate) to price
stability. This apparent hypersensitivity of the optimal rate of inflation calls for an increased
effort aimed at obtaining tighter estimates of the amount of nominal sluggishness present in
the economy.
   An important difference between the predictions of the Ramsey equilibrium studied in
the present paper and the observed behavior of central banks adhering to inflation targeting
regimes is that the Ramsey optimal rate of inflation is negative (although possibly close to
zero) whereas inflation targeters around the world set targets for the inflation rate that are
significantly above zero. We establish that in the context of the estimated medium-scale
model studied in this paper fear of confronting the zero-bound on nominal interest rates
can hardly represent an impediment to adopting the Ramsey-optimal rate of inflation. In
effect, in the Ramsey equilibrium the nominal interest rate takes an average value of about
4.5 percent per year, with a standard deviation of about half a percent. It follows that
the chances that a shock would push the nominal interest rate to zero are negligible. This
result poses the challenge for future researchers of finding a theoretical explanation for the
optimality of positive inflation targets. Some have argued that the presence of downward
inflexibility in nominal prices and wages may provide a justification for setting positive

                                               52
inflation targets. Formalizations of this idea have been limited to highly stylized models. It
remains to be seen whether medium-scale models incorporating a realistic degree of nominal
downward rigidities can generate optimal inflation targets similar in magnitude to those
observed across inflation targeting countries.
  The issue of the interaction between optimal fiscal and monetary policy in the context of
medium-scale models was touched upon in this paper but requires much further research. We
find that the hypersensitivity of the optimal inflation target to the degree of price stickiness
alluded to above may disappear under certain fiscal arrangements. This is the case, for
instance, when fiscal policy is also set optimally and the fiscal authority has access only
to distortionary income taxes. But under alternative fiscal scenarios the hypersensitivity
problem may be exacerbated. This is the case, for instance, when the fiscal authority has
access to a combination of distortionary and nondistortionary taxes, but distortionary taxes
are fixed (even if at the level prescribed by the Ramsey steady state) so that lump-sum taxes
are used on the margin to achieve intertemporal solvency.
   In this paper we limit attention to an economy driven by three shocks that have been
shown to account for a sizable fraction of business cycles in the U.S. economy; namely, neutral
and investment-specific productivity shocks and government spending shocks. Ideally, the
study of optimal monetary policy would incorporate into the model all of the sources of
uncertainty that are important drivers of business cycles in the real world. The current
study is admittedly far from this theoretical desideratum. Progress in this area is in order.
There is no clear guideline on how to go about in this endeavor. We are skeptical of the
approach—recently adopted in some studies—of using the estimation residuals obtained from
econometric estimations of the DGE model as structural economic sources of uncertainty.
In many instances, these estimation errors are hardly interpretable as structural economic
shocks and are more likely a reflection of the fact that theory lags behind business cycles.
The dimension of the challenge that the presence of these ‘nonstructural’ errors pose for
macroeconomic theory is demonstrated by the fact that in most of the available estimates of
relatively large macroeconomic models, this class of shocks explain the majority of observed
business-cycle fluctuations.

Appendix: Deriving the Welfare Costs Measure
Consider the Ramsey policy, denoted by r, and an alternative policy regime, denoted by a.
We define the welfare associated with the time-invariant equilibrium implied by the Ramsey
policy conditional on a particular state of the economy in period 0 as

                                                            X

                                             Ṽ0r = E0            β tU (crt − bcrt−1 , hrt ),
                                                            t=0


where crt and hrt denote the contingent plans for consumption and hours under the Ramsey
policy. Using the particular functional form for the period utility function given in equa-
tion (46) and setting φ3 to its baseline value of one, we can express the above expression in
terms of the stationary transformation of consumption, Ctr ,

                             X
                             ∞                                            X
                                                                          ∞
               Ṽ0r   = E0              t

                                                                                               r
                                                                                                   /µz∗ ,t, hrt ).

Similarly, define the conditional welfare associated with policy regime a as

                                                            X

   Let λc denote the welfare cost of adopting policy regime a instead of the Ramsey policy
conditional on a particular state in period zero. We define λc as the fraction of regime r’s
consumption process that a household would be willing to give up to be as well off under


                                                                     54
regime a as under regime r. It follows that λc is implicitly defined by

                                         X
                                         ∞
                           Ṽ0a   = E0         β t U ((1 − λc )(crt − bcrt−1), hrt ).
                                         t=0


Using the definitions given above, this expression can be written as

                                                      (1 − φ4 )
                                  V0a = V0r +                   ln(1 − λc ).               (49)
                                                      (1 − β)

We restrict attention to an approximation of λc that is accurate up to second order. In
equilibrium, V0a and V0r are functions of the initial state vector x0 and the parameter σ
scaling the standard deviation of the exogenous shocks (see Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2004c).
Therefore, we can write V0a = V ac (x0, σ ) and V0r = V rc (x0, σ ). This implies that λc must
be a function of x0 and σ as well

                                               λc = Λc (x0, σ ).

Consider a second-order approximation of the function Λc around the point x0 = x and
σ = 0, where x denotes the deterministic Ramsey steady state of the state vector. Because
we wish to characterize welfare conditional upon the initial state being the deterministic
Ramsey steady state, in performing the second-order expansion of Λc only its first and
second derivatives with respect to σ have to be considered. Formally, we have

                                                                    Λcσ σ (x, 0) 2
                          λc ≈ Λc (x, 0) + Λcσ (x, 0)σ +                        σ .
                                                                           2

Because the deterministic steady-state level of welfare is the same across all monetary policies
belonging to the class defined in equation (48), it follows that λc vanishes at the point
(x0, σ ) = (x, 0). Formally,
                                                 Λc (x, 0) = 0.

Totally differentiating equation (49) with respect to σ , evaluating the result at (x0 , σ ) =
(x, 0), and using the result derived in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004c) that the first
derivatives of the policy functions with respect to σ evaluated at (x0, σ ) = (x, 0) are nil
(Vσac
   
      = Vσrc = 0), it follows immediately that

                                                Λcσ (x, 0) = 0.

Now totally differentiating (49) twice with respect to σ , and evaluating the result at
