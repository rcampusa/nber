           U.S. Coimnercial Banks and the Developing Country Debt Crisis




                                     ABSTRACT




          The major theme of this paper is that the commercial banks have
     weathered the debt crisis, while many debtor countries remain in
     economic paralysis or worse. There is a growing consensus that much of
     the LDC debt will not be fully serviced in the future, and that
     consensus is reflected in at least two ways: in the discounts observed
     in the secondary market prices for LDC debt, and in the discounts in
     the stock market pricing of banks with exposure in the LDCs.

      The debt crisis of the less developed countries (LDCs) broke out

 in August 1982, with the announcement by Mexico that it would be
 unable to meet its debt obligations then falling due.     Since then,

more than 40 developing countries have been forced to reschedule their

 debts with commercial bank creditors and to seek additional lending

and other forms of relief from the international financial coimnunityJ

From its inception, the debt crisis has been viewed as posing serious

risks to the major U.S. commercial banks, since the exposure of these

banks in the developing countries has significantly exceeded their

total bank capital.

     Table 1 shows the exposures of the U.S. banks in the major debtor

countries as of the end of 1986. The exposure is divided by size of

bank (the large money center banks versus the rest of the U.S. banks),

and by type of claim (on the public sector of the LDCs versus private

sector borrowers).    Note the high concentration of the claims.   The

exposure of the top 9 banks in just the top 4 countries (Argentina,

Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela) accounts for $41 billion, or 45 percent

of total U.S. exposure in the developing countries shown in the table.

The top 9 banks account for a remarkable 65 percent of total exposure

of U.S. banks in Latin America, Note also that sovereign loans (i.e.

loans to foreign public sector borrowers) account for about two thirds

of U.S. bank lending to the LDCs.2

 has been geared towards the protection of the large commercial banks,

 at least on a short-mn accounting basis. The weight of U.S. foreign

 policy    has been to maintain current interest servicing by the debtor

 countries to the U.S. banks, and to avoid any explicit debt

 forgiveness or even capitalization of interest payments.3          U.S.

 regulators have also taken an easy line in applying prudential
 standards to banks with large LDC exposures.       The banks have been

 allowed to carry almost all of their LDC exposure on the books at face

value, and they have been able to count as current income all the

 interest payments they receive on the loans, even when the interest

payments are made possible only by new "involtintary" loans to       the
debtor    country.
          By acting as if all is normal regarding the bulk of LDC loans,
the regulators have hoped to accomplish three things: to keep the
debtor     countries from halting interest payments or promoting

alternative proposals for debt forgiveness; to keep the banks from

withdrawing precipitously from the debtor countries; and to keep
depositors and other creditors of the banks from withdrawing
precipitously from the banks.      In a limited sense this strategy has
worked.     Worst-case scenarios of financial panic have been avoided,

and the banks have been given time to increase their capital ratios,

U.S. bank exposure in the problem debtor countries as a percent of the

book value of primary capital has declined significantly since 1982,

as shown   in Table 2.
    At a deeper level, however, the regulatory treatment has not

hidden certain economic truths from debtors, the banks,         or the

 marketplace more generally. Despite the official optimism of the U.S.

 and the creditor community regarding the debt crisis, and the

 seemingly relaxed attitudes of the U.S. regulators, most market

participants have conceeded that much of the LDC debt will not be

fully     serviced on market terms In the longer term.    Moreover, the
regulatory laxness may have had deleterious effects on the adjustment
of the U.S. banks to the crisis, by allowing the banks to move slowly
in the process of rebuilding their capital base. Some banks have been
allowed tb pay unduly large dividends at the expense of their capital

in recent years, since they have been allowed to overstate their
economic incomes.

        A good indicator of long-term expectations regarding LDC claims

is the price of those claims on the secondary market.      Column 5 of

Table 1 records the secondary bid price for a $100 claim, as of July

1987.      The price for claims on the major debtors, Argentina, Brazil

and Mexico, is in the range of $45-55. The weighted average price for

the entire U.S. bank portfolio weighting by exposure in the various

countries, is $55.9 per $100 claim.         (Specifically, the $ 57.0

billion of U.S. bank exposure in Table 1 had a secondary market value

of $ 31.9 billion).4

        A major theme of this paper is that the stock market prices of

the commercial banks also reflect the secondary-market valuation of

the LDC exposure.      Specifically, since the stock market values the

commercial banks according to the value of the underlying portfolios

of the banks, equity prices of banks have weakened in line with the

growing pessimism over the value of the LDC claims.5       This is an


                                        3
important finding since many bankers and U.S. Administration officials

have argued erroneously that the secondary market price of LDC debt is

a poor guide to more general market sentiments concerning the LOC

debt.      In fact, the secondary market prices of the debt and the

implicit stock market valuations of the debt are closely in line as of

mid-1987.

        The fact that stock market prices have been discounted helps to

explain the current eagerness of banks to sell their LDC exposures at

a discount, since the banks can accept a capital loss in the books

without further depressing the market value of the bank. It appears

that Citicorp's decision this past spring to increase its loan loss

reserves against Latin Anerican exposure (an action that was followed

by the other major banks in the U.S. and abroad) is a prelude to a

policy of selling off the LDC exposure at a significant discount. As

we discuss later, this new policy of selling off debt may have

important implications for public policy in this area.

        We organize our discussion in the following manner.   The next

section of the paper briefly considers some of the underlying causes

for the growing market discount on the LDC debt. Then, we turn to an

analysis of how the banks and regulators have responded to the crisis

since 1982. Next we examine the effects of the crisis on the market

valuation of the commercial banks, showing the clear evidence that the

stock market is now valuing the LDC debt at the substantial discounts

reflected in the secondary market.     In the final section, we explore

some of the implications of the market discount for the future of debt

negotiations and for various debt relief proposals.


                                        4
 Why the LDC Debt Sells at a Discount

      Many of the shortcomings of the current debt management strategy

were outlined in Sachs (1986).   It was pointed out in that study that

most of the optimistic assessments of the debt crisis ignored the

internal economic dislocations caused by the Large debt overhang.

Most optimistic observers such as William dine, have viewed the

problem for the debtor countries purely in terms of various external

parameters: OECD growth, world interest rates, and global commodities

prices.   They have failed to factor in the economic and political

disarray within the debtor countries that has resulted from, or has at

least been greatly aggravated by, the debt crisis: low rates of

national savings and investment, large budget deficits, recourse to

inflationary finance

     Most of the debtor countries have little prospect of servicing a

large proportion of the interest due on their external debt in the
next few years.     In the past five years, the debtor countries have

made significant net resource transfers to the creditors (in Latin

Anerica, amounting to about 5 percent of CNP per year). &it as we see

in Table 3, these transfers have not been enough to prevent a rise in

the debt-export ratios of the major debtor countries, not the fall

that was predicted in influential studies in 1983 and 1984 by dUne
and DeVries.

    Recently,     some   primary corodity prices have       increased

significantly, apparently in a lagged response to the depreciation of

the dollar, giving hope that the export prospects of the LDCs will

significantly improve.     Ironically, however, most of the improvement

in prices has been for non-food primary commodities produced mainly in

the developed countries (e.g. primary metals) or in the developing

countries in Asia, most of which are not in crisis.7 The prices for

the main Latin American commodity exports (for sugar, wheat, beef,

coffee, cocao) continue to be deeply depressed, so that the modest

commodity price recovery has so far given little respite to the
crisis.      Moreover,   international   interest   rates   have   risen

significantly in 1987.

     Moreover, many of the major debtor countries are in fiscal

turmoil, even after the sharp cuts in government spending in recent

years.    The interest due on the foreign debt constitutes a large

proportion of budgetary expenditures (around 30 percent of government

spending in many of the debtor countries), and stands in the way of

budgetary reform.8 The voters in the new democracies in Latin America

are not content to absorb further austerity for the sake of foreign

creditors. The recent rise in world interest rates will intensify the

pressures.     For several years, inflation has been at triple digit

annual rates in Argentina, Brazil, and Peru, and has recently topped

150 per cent annual rate in the spring and summer of 1987 in Mexico.

The 20,000 per cent hyperinflation in Bolivia was brought under

control only after Bolivia's complete cessation of interest payments

on the external bank debt.

    One result of the internal economic disarray has been a

burgeoning of unilateral actions on the debt, particularly in the

democratic countries in Latin Anerica. Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica,


                                         6
 the Dominican Republic, Ecuador      Honduras, and Peru have all

unilaterally suspended part or all of the interest servicing on their

 foreign debt in the past two years. In the two major debtor countries

that have not suspended (Argentina and Mexico), the banks have found

it necessary in 1987 to relend almost all of the interest due in order

to forestall a unilateral suspension of payments.     Mexico received

approximately $6 billion in bank credits and Argentina recently signed

an agreement for $2 billion in new bank credits.9

     Three other large debtors, Chile, the Philippines, and Venezuela

have been servicing their debts recently without substantial
refinancing of interest.    Chile, of course, is not so much a model

debtor country as a model authoritarian country: the government can

indeed impose the requisite domestic austerity to make it possible to

service the debt)° In the Philippines, the government was fearful of

tough negotiations because of the internal instability of the Aquino

government.11 The Aquino government therefore signed a rescheduling

agreement in 1987 with no concerted lending from the banks. There is

now a good chance that a unilateral partial suspension of debt

servicing will be declared by the Philippine Congress.   In Venezuela

as well, the government is under fierce political pressure to abandon

its recent debt rescheduling agreement.    Even the government's own

political party has called for a reopening of negotiations with a view

towards achieving debt relief.

     In the cases where debt agreements have been reached in the past

year, the tens for the banks on aspects other than new lending have

also worsened.   In the first round of reschedulings (1983), debt was


                                      7
recontracted with an interest rate spread of about 2 percentage points

over LIBOR (the London Interbank Offered Rate).    In the second round

of reschedulings (1984-85), the spreads were reduced to about 1..2

percentage points. In the recent round of reschedulings, the spreads

have fallen further, to less than one percentage point.     Similarly,

commissions have declined, and the maturities and grace periods on the

rescheduled debts have also increased.12

       It is thus not difficult to understand the growing discount on

LDC paper in the secondary market.    The economies in most cases are

not getting better, and the countries are increasingly demanding more

concessional terms in reflection of that reality.     Many are simply
taking unilateral actions in response to their deepening continuing

crisis.     Moreover, the international macroeconomics environment,

particularly regarding interest rates and comnodities prices, remains

unsatisfactory.    Price quotations on the secondary market have only

been available on a detailed basis for the past year (several

investment banks now circulate price sheets), but all indications

suggest that the discount has been growing, i.e. the prices falling,

over the past few years, as shown by the data in Table 4.

      On a cross-country basis, the magnitude of the discount on the

LDC   debt seems to be well explained by four variables: the debt-GNP

ratio, denoted D/GNP (the debt-export ratio works about as well); the

rate of real CNP growth. GNPCROt4TH; a dummy variable SUSP indicating

whether the country has unilaterally suspended debt service payments;

and a dummy variable (Ama) indicating whether 13.5. bank regulators

have mandated an allocated reserve (i.e. a writedown) for the

 regression model does well in accounting for the secondary market

(The variable SUSP is a dummy variable equalling 1 if the country

suspended interest payments in 1987, and 2 if the country suspended

interest payments prior to 1987 and is still in suspension.)
According to the equation, a claim on a debt-free LDC with 6 percent

annual growth would command a secondary market price of $90.4 (— $77.2
+ 6 x 2.2).     On the other hand, a country like Bolivia with a D/CNP

ratio of 136.8, a per capita GNP growth of -4.5 per year, a required

writeoff for U.S. banks (ATRR—1), and more than two years in debt

suspension (SUSP —        2),   has a predicted price of $3.7 (— $77.2       -   9.6   -


17.2 x 2 - .15 x 136.8 - 2.2          x 4.5),       compared with an actual price of

$10.

       A key problem with interpreting the secondary market prices

involves the role of SUSP. Ott its face, the pricing equation suggests

that a country can manipulate the secondary market price of its debt

by  suspending debt servicing. To the extent that debt service relief
is then tied to the secondary market price of debt, as in some of the

                                                    9
relief proposals discussed later, there might be the moral hazard
problem of countries unilaterally suspending debt payments as a
strategic maneuver to benefit from relief. The moral hazard argument
is   overdrawn, however, to the extent that SUSP is oroxyina for other

country characteristics that make debt servicing particularly

difficult for that country: political instability, adverse export

structure, financial collapse, etc. In that case,       SUSP is simply

another indicator of "ability to pay' rather than an manipulable

strategic variable.



 Patterns of Debt Management by the Banks and Bank Regulators

      In this section1 we consider the response of the commercial banks

and banic regulators to the crisis since 1982.     The key facts about

this response are well known.        The banks have virtually stopped

making new loans to the problem debtor countries, with the little

lending that remains taking place in the context of specific bailout

packages. During this period of little lending, the banks increased

their primary capital base, and thereby reduced the ratio of LDC

exposure to capital.

      In our summary of bank behavior, we focus on three variables:

changes in bank exposure in the LDCs, bank earnings, and changes in

the capital base of the banks.



Bank Exposure in the LDCs

      The change in bank lending behavior is shown in Table 5.     U.S.

amount during the period 1982-86, after rising rapidly during the

period 1979-82.     The absolute decline in lending belies one of the

myths of the management of the crisis, that the banks have continued

to provide net "new money" to the debtor countries though at a reduced

rate of increase.     (Remember that the widely publicized negotiated

loan agreements are termed "new money" packages).

     The common perception that the banks have continued to lend to

the LDCs on a net basis can best be explained by looking at a

breakdown of the bank loans between public sector borrowers and

private sector borrowers in the LDCs.        Claims on the public sector

have risen by 53 percent during 1982-1986, while claims on the private

sector have decline by 48 percent. This difference reflects the fact

that the widely publicized concerted lending agreements in recent

years have been loans to governments. But at the same time that the

banks have been providing "new money' to governments, they have been

withdrawing loans from the private sector.

     Three other factors can also account for the differential growth

in claims on the public and private sectors.     To some extent, private

sector debts have become public sector debts as governments have taken

over some of the foreign obligations of the private sector since the

beginning of the debt crisis. Secondly, the decline in exposures to

the private sector represents, in part, a writeoff of claims on the

private sector, rather than an amortization of loans. Third, declines

in exposure also reflect sales by the banks of their LOC claims, or

declines due to debt-equity swaps.    Given the published data it is

impossible to distinguish changes in exposure due to new loans,


                                      11
amortizations, writeoffs, sales, swaps, or public-sector assumptions

of private sector debt.

     We should stress that the notion of "new money" is also
misleading when account is taken of the fact that most "new money"

packages after 1982 have involved considerably less in new loans than

is due to the same creditors in interest. Thus, even when Mexico or

Argentina gets a "new loan" after months of hair-raising negotiations,

the check is still written     the debtor governments to the commercial

banks, rather than in the other direction.       Technically, the net

resource transfer (equal to new lending net of amortizations and

interest payments) to the countries is negative. The fact of negative

net resource transfers points up one of the fallacies in a popular

argument as to why debtor countries should not default.          It is

sometimes said that if a country defaults, it will be not be able to

attract new bank money.    This is obviously not a major concern to a

debtor country if the reduction in interest payments achieved by

default systematically exceeds the amounts of new money that the

country is able to borrow by not defaulting I

     The pattern of concerted lending packages among the debtor

governments also highlights Keynes' famous adage that "If you owe your

bank 100 pounds, you're in trouble, if you owe your bank 1,000,000

pounds than he's in trouble". Very systematically, it is the countries

with lar2e debts that have been able to bargain for new lending from

the banks. This is evident from the data in Table 6. For each country,

we measure the size of concerted loans in year t (CL) as a proportion

of disbursed debt at the end of year t-l, Dtl. On average, the ratio

CL/Di is far higher       for the large debtors (Argentina, Brazil,

Chile, Mexico) than for the rest. Venezuela is a significant exception

to this rule, since the current Venezuelan administration has,

curiously, never tried to bargain for new money. To summarize the data

in Table 6, the fifteen small debtor countries in the table had 3.4

percent of the debt at the end of 1983, but have received only 0.3 per

cent of the concerted loans during 1984-1986.



Bank Earnings

          Ironically, during 1982-86 the debt crisis did not have a

serious adverse effect on the reported current earnin2s of the banks,

even though it fundamentally called into question the very solvency of

the banks. While doubts grew about the long-term willingness of the

debtor countries to service their debts, and while principal

repayments were postponed for many years in the course              of

reschedulings, most of the LDCs continued to service the interest due,

though sometimes only after the banks loaned the countries much of the

money needed to make the interest payments.       Even when interest

payments were clearly tied to new loans, the bank regulators allowed

the banks to report the interest received in full as current income

(rather than, for example, requiring that part of the interest be

allocated to loan loss reserves, and therefore not be counted as

current income)

     The reported net income for the top nine banks is shown in Table

7. We see that reported income rose for most of the major banks, with

the conspicuous exception of Bank of Arerica, which suffered major

 losses on its domestic loan portfolio.      In some cases the measured

 income was even enhanced by the crisis, since in 1983 and 1984 many of

 the rescheduling agreements involved significant front-end fees and an

 increase in the interest rate spreads built into the loan agreements.

 Table 8 shows the share of DC assets that were on a nonaccrual basis

 as of the end of 1986.13 Note that this ratio is only slightly higher

 than the ratio of domestic loans on a nonaccruaj. basis.

     In assessing the effects of the debt crisis on measured earnings,

a distinction must be drawn between the bank claims on the public

sectors and the private sectors in the LDCs. For the sovereign loans,

the vast bulk of interest due has been paid on a timely basis. Among

the major debtors prior to 1987, only Argentina fell behind on

interest payments on sovereign debt, in 1984 and early 1985. In 1987,

Brazilian sovereign debt has been in suspension since February 20. As

for private debt, all of the major debtors except for Brazil (i.e.

Argentina, Mexico      and Venezuela) have had periods of fairly

significant arrearages on private debt, though by the end of 1986 most

of those arrearages had been eliminated. Also, an unknown proportion

of the private debt has been lost forever in the form of firm-level

bankruptcies, or in debt workouts with the creditors at significantly

concessionary rates.

     Only in 1987 have the income statements of the banks begun to

suffer, as some of the larger debtors (especially Brazil) have

suspended interest payments, and more importantly, as significant

additions to loan loss reserves have been made. Because of loan loss

provisions, the large U.S. banks posted losses of about $10 billion in

 the second quarter of 1987.

        It is useful, here to make clear the meaning of the recent

provisioning by Citicorp and the other leading banks.      Table 9 shows

the size of provisions taken, and the share of Latin American exposure

that is now 'covered" by the the loan loss reserves. This share is

calculated by taking the banks' total loan loss reserves, and

subtracting off all domestic nonperforning assets. The net reserves

are then compared with the exposure in Latin America.         Citicorp's

stated goal was to cover 25 percent of its Latin American exposure.

        Since the provisions are "unallocated" (i.e. not tied to
particular loans, or even to particular countries), they do not
involve a writedown in value of particular assets.     (A fortiori, they

do not involve any forgiveness by the banks of any part of the debts

owed by the developing countriest).          The increase in provisions

reduces reported income of the banks1 but it does not reduce taxable

income, since taxable income is not reduced by a general, unallocated

provision.     On the balance sheet, the increased provisioning is a

transfer from shareholder's equity to loan loss reserves. As pointed

out below, this shift does not affect measured primary capital of the

bank.

        The provisioning does not affect the cash flow of the banks. In

that sense it is a cosmetic move only. In the future, if the banks

write off some portion of their LDC exposure (e.g. by selling the

assets at a discount, or by settling with the countries at below

market terms), they will be able to charge the losses to the loan

reserves without any effect on reported income at the future date. At

 that point the capital base of the bank would shrink, and the taxable

 earnings of the bank would fall in line with the writeoff. Thus, by

 accepting large reported losses now, the banks will be better placed

 to report positive earnings in the future, even if the LDC loans go

sour.




Capital Adequacy



        Even before the debt crisis hit, U.S. bank regulators had judged

that the capital-asset ratios of U.S. banks were insufficient. New

regulations promulgated in the early l980s called for a rise in the

ratio of primary capital to total assets, from the prevailing low

levels of about 4 percent to levels of 5.5 percent.       Total capital

(equal to primary capital plus certain types of qualifying
subordinated debt) was required to rise to 6.0 percent of total bank

assets.

     A vast literature on banking regulation has stressed the need for

such prudential limits.14     Banks are highly leveraged institutions,

giving rise to the possibility of large fluctuations in net worth, and

also to various incentive problems.      A small change in the average

value of the bank's assets can dramatically reduce the net worth of

the bank, and even drive the bank into bankruptcy.'5 Moreover since

banks are operating with borrowed funds, and since most of those funds

are insured by federal deposit insurance, bank managers may have the

incentive to take excessive risks if bank capital is too low a share

of total assets. If the net worth of the bank is low relative to the


                                       16
total assets of the bank, then the bank managers (on behalf of the

shareholders) have the incentive to take large gambles with borrowed

funds.   If the gamble goes well, the shareholders enjoy an enormous

proportional return to their assets. If the gamble goes poorly, the

shareholders lose only the small, amount of the net worth, and the

deposit insurance institution must make up the difference to the

depositors.

     Another aspect of prudential supervision, one that was obviously

overlooked in the 1970s and early l9BOs, is the requirement that the

bank not commit more than 15 percent of bank capital in loans to any

borrower.     In fact, the loans to the Brazilian government and to the

Mexican government greatly exceeded 15 percent of capital for many of

the large U.S. banks, but the rule was not invoked since the

regulators allowed the banks to treat the various official borrowers

(e.g. parastatals, central government, development banks, etc.) in

Mexico and Brazil as distinct borrowers even though all of the

institutions were backed by the same government guarantee16.     In the

event, all of the Loans to the various official borrowers in each of

the countries went bad at the same time.         Moreover, repayments on

private-sector debts were generally suspended at the same time as

repayments on the debts of official borrowers, and a considerable

amount of private-sector debt was taken over by the public sector

(often on the behest of the commercial banks).

     On paper, the capital adequacy rules have been enfnrrrd. and the

capital base of the U.S. banks has been strengthened.      But at least

some of this is due to accounting convention rather than to an actual


                                        17
strengthening of bank balance sheets. For bank capital to protect the

bank from bankruptcy and to forestall, adverse incentive problems, the

bank capital should consist mostly of shareholder's equity, and it

should be properly valued.    In fact, the measure of primary capital

used for capital adequacy requirements includes both equity and loan

loss reserves.    Thus, even when the banks make loan loss provisions

because they anticipate future losses on assets measured primary

capital is unaffected, because the loan loss provision involves a

transfer between shareholders equity and loan loss reserves, both of

which are fully counted in primary capital. Moreover, since the LDC

claims are carried in the books at full face value, and until recently

were not covered by loan loss provisions, the book values of
shareholders     equity clearly overstated the market value of
shareholders equity on this account,

     Thus, the pattern of U.S. banks has been one of rising
capital-asset ratios during 1982-87, as shown in Table 10, but with a

significant decline in the ratio of shareholder's eQuity to assets as

of mid-1987 (Table 11), when the banks made a substantial increase in

loan loss reserves.   The conclusion seems to be that the regulators

have not succeeded in raising the ratio of shareholder's equity to

total assets by much at all in the l9BOs.         Since the loan loss

reserves on the Latin American claims still cover no more than 25

percent of the Latin exposure, and since the markets are signalling a

discount on the debt of perhaps 45 to 50 percent, it seems clear that

shareholders equity is still overstated on account of the LDC debt,

even after the substantial provisions.      The conclusion seems to be

that the regulators have not succeeded in raising the ratio of

shareholder's equity to total assets by much at all in the 1980s.

The regulatory laxness, i.e. "business as usual" attitude, certainly

contributed to the failure of the banks to make a greater advance in

rebuilding their equity base. It was clear from the beginning of the

debt crisis that at least some of the interest earnings on the LDC

debt should have been regarded as fictitious, particularly when

leading debtors required new involuntary loans to meet interest

payments     on existing debts.   Prudent   regulators might   have required

that   the   banks build up capital in part by reducing dividend payouts.

This did not in fact occur.         The major banks maintained dividend

payout ratios since 1982 as if the debt crisis had not occurred, as is

evident in Table 12. Bank of Anerica was a particularly flagrant case

of this behavior.       Even when earnings were falling because of bad

domestic loans, not to mention bad foreign loans, Bank of America

continued to pay significant dividends, leading to a sharp rise in the

ratio of dividends to income,        Of course, Bank of Anierica is now

fighting for its survival.

       Our conclusion on the slow pace at which the banks have rebuilt

capital must be tempered to the extent that other assets of the banks

are undervalued on the books relative to true market values. Indeed,

we shalt soon see evidence in the next section that the market values

of many of the large banks were at or above their book values as of

the summer of 1987, despite the clear evidence that the market values

of their LDC claims were far below their book values. This suggests

that other assets were being undervalued on the books.

     We have attempted to create an equity-asset ratio based solely on

market values rather than book values, by calculating the market value

of overall assets of the bank as equal to the market value of overall

assets   of the bank as equal to the market value of bank equity plus
the book value of bank liabilities (we assume that the bank's
liabilities, which are mostly short-term fixed-income liabilities,
have a market value equal to book value). We then take the ratio of

the market value of equity to the (constructed) market value of

assets. We found that on average for the large 10 banks, the ratio of

equity (at market value) to assets rose from 3.2 percent in 1983, and

3.6 per cent in 1984, to 5.5 percent in June 1987, suggesting some

real increase in capital adequacy. On the other hand, the sharp

decline in the stock market in October 1987, after the completion of

this analysis, has probably pushed the market-based ratio of equity to

assets back down sharply, close to the levels of 1984.

     There would be one important practical implication for LDC debt

if the banks' non-LDC claims are carried on the books at below market

value. As the losses on the LDC assets are realized, e.g. by sales of

debt in the secondary market, the banks will be able to cushion the

effect on their overall capital by selling off other assets that are

undervalued on the books, and taking the capital gains. Citicorp has

begun to adopt this strategy in the Fall of 1987, by selling a part of

its real estate equity at a significant capital gain, in order to

offset the reported losses on its LDC portfolio.



Pending Regulatory Decisions


                                      20
     Two important regulatory matters are now pending. The first, and

specific matter, is the question of future accounting treatment of the

Brazilian debt. The federal bank regulators can require the banks to

make allocated provisions for loans to foreign governments under the

system of Allocated Reserve Transfer Risks (ATRRs) established in the

1983 International Lending Supervision Act.       In this system, an

inter-agency committee of the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal

Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Comptroller of the Currency,

can declare the loan to a country to be value-impaired, and c mpel a

writedown of the assets (technically, an allocated reserve is

created).    Generally1 for loans to be declared value impaired they

must meet more than one of four conditions: (1) interest is more than

180 days overdue; (2) the country has no IMF program and no prospect

of negotiating one; (3) the country has not met its rescheduling terms

for a year; and (4) the country does not exhibit any definite prospect

for an orderly restoration of debt servicing in the near futurej7 The

final decision is at the discretion of the bank regulators.

Typically, the required writeoff is 10 percent in the first year, and

15 percent in the second year and each succeeding year that the loans

are deemed to be value impaired.    The ATRR has so far been applied

only to a few smaller debtor countries, specifically Bolivia,

Nicaragua, Peru, Poland, Sudan, and Zaire.

     In the case of Brazil, the suspension of interest payments on the

sovereign debt was announced on February 20, 1987.       On April 2,

somewhat less than sixty days after the suspension, several banks


                                      21
announced that they were placing Brazilian loans on a nonaccrual

basis.    As of August 20, 1987, the loans were in suspension of

interest for 180 days. The interagency taskforce is scheduled to meet

on October 26, 1987, to decide whether the Brazilian debt should be

declared value impaired. This will be a discretionary decision. An

partial payment of interest by Brazil before October 26, for instance,

may be enough to forestall a declaration that the loan is "value

impaired".

     The second, a much more general matter is the question of future

capital adequacy regulations. The Federal Reserve Board and the Bank

of England have recently agreed to attempt to harmonize their

accounting treatment for the supervision of capital adequacy.      The

details of the agreement have not been fully worked out, and are in

any event not yet public.     It is presumed, however, that the new

system will involve a weighting of assets by quality in order to

arrive at a more refined measure of the capital of the bank.

     There are several areas in which existing accounting practices

differ markedly in the two countries. Presently, for instance, the

Bank of England requires that provisions of U.K. banks against LDC

debts must be allocated by country.        The provisions are charged

against the capital base of the bank, and also may be charged against

current income for tax purposes.     Recently, moreover, the Bank of

England has instituted a scoring system by which the U.K. banks must

evaluate their risks on all LDC loans, and thereby decide upon reserve

levels.




                                      22
Latin American exposure and the market valuation of commercial banks



     The regulators and accounts have so far             operated on the
presumption that claims on the LDCs are worth their full face value,

despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. In this section we

investigate whether the stock markets have seen through the accounting

veil, and written down the value of banks with heavy exposures in the

problem debtor countries.      The evidence suggests that a significant

writedown has in fact occurred, though its precise magnitude is open

to some question.

     One   of   the problems in getting a precise estimate of the stock

market valuation of the LDC    claims   is that of limited data: banks are

only required to report exposures in the LDCs when total loans to a

country exceed 1 percent of total assets.        Therefore, while we know

quite a bit about the exposures of individual banks in Argentina.

Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela, (hereafter ABMV) we know very little

about the holdings by individual banks of claims on the other problem

countries (which account for about 30 percent of exposure as shown in

the data in Table 1).

     An initial look at bank share prices supports the view that the

markets have reacted to the bad news of recent years.           Table 13
shows a comparison of ten banks with the heaviest recorded exposure in

ABVM (relative to book value of shareholder's equity) to ten banks

with no exposure. For the heavily exposed banks, the average exposure

is 130 percent of book value. At the end of 1986, these banks had an

average ratio of their stock market value to their book value of 1.0,

in comparison with a ratio of 1.5 for the banks with zero exposure.

Similarly, the heavily exposed banks had a price-earnings ratio of

6.6, compared with a price earnings ratio of 10.3 for the banks with

zero exposure. This shows that the difference in market value is not

a function of the difference in current earnings, but rather the price

which the market is assigning to those current earnings. Put another

way, the market is casting doubt on the future earnings of the heavily

exposed banks by capitalizing those banks at a lower price-earnings.

     The   last two   col.umns highlight two considerations discussed

earlier.    Leaving aside Bank of Mnerica, with its extremely weak
domestic   portfolio, the heavily exposed banks had a rate of earnings

in 1986 relative to book value that is comparable to that of the banks

with zero exposure.    Once again, through the end of 1986 (before the

loan loss reserves in 1987 and the Brazilian moratorium) the debt

crisis posed a problem of future earnings, not current earnings. The

last column highlights the fact that the dividend payout ratios of the

heavily exposed banks have not been systematically lower that the

dividend payout ratios of the lightly exposed banks (note, however,

the two outliers: Bank of Anerica, which suspended its dividend in

1986; and First-Security Utah, which paid dividends in excess of

current earnings in 1986).

    More generally, bank analysts concur that the current market

discounts are in line with, or even greater than, the quoted prices on

the secondary market.18 This view   also helps to explain the market's
reaction   to Citicorp's unanticipated announcement of $3 billion in

increased loan loss reserves in mid-May. The markets reacted to the


                                      24
prospect of billions of dollars of newly announced losses by raisin

Citicorp prices by more than 10 percent in the week of the
announcement I    Clearly, the news from the announcement was not the bad

news of losses, but the good new of a management strategy to confront

the losses agressively.           One investment analyst was quoted as

explaining "There was a huge sigh of relief that the bad news was
        19
out".

        The remainder of this section presents regression results that

provide a somewhat more precise estimate of the market valuation of

LDC loans to the banks, as implicit in the banks' stock prices. Four

parallel approaches are taken that yield largely consistent results.

The first approach starts from the observation that the market value

of a bank's    assets should equal the market value of the fin's equity
plus    its liabilities. As the market value of a bank's equity is

observed in the stock market, and the market value of a bank's

liabilities can be reasonably assumed to be very close to book value,

we can get a measure of the market value of a bank's assets. Then, by

comparing the market and book values of bank assets on a cross-

sectional basis, we can estimate the market value of of LDC claims

held by the various banks.

        The second and third approaches relate the banks' price- earnings

ratio's and the returns to holding bank stocks to measures of LDC

exposure. The final approach studies the movement of bank share prices

in    response to important LDC   exposure-   related news.


(a)    Valuing bank assets


                                              25
        The market values of the securities on the two sides of bank

balance sheets should be equal. Thus the market value of a bank's

assets should equal the market value of its combined shareholders'

equity and liabilities. As a bank's liabilities are primarily

short-term liabilities such as customers' bank deposits and short-ten

CDs, we can assume that the market value of a bank's liabilities are

valued close to book value. Also, we assume that the market value of a

bank's preferred equity, which for most banks is less than 10 per cent

of shareholders' equity, is equal to book value.20

      Using O to denote the market value of one dollar of claim on the

LDCs (i.e. 1 -       is   the market discount on the LDC claim) and 82 to

denote the market value of one dollar of other assets, we use the

following relationship:



(1)          MVc + BVp + BVl —        +
                               B1Aldc   e2Aother


where



      MVc — market value of outstanding coimnon equity

      BVp — book value of preferred equity

      BVl — book value of liabilities

      Aldc — book value of LDC exposure

      Aother — book value of other assets



      Using Atotal to denote total assets, we can substitute Atotal -


                                          26
Aldc for Aother, and divide by Atotal to get the relationship:


               Nyc + Blip + BVl           Aldc
(2)                               —a+fl
                       Atotal         Atotal

where a —
              02
         fi   —1   -
                       02


        The above equation is estimated for a cross section of banks for

each of the years 1982 through 1986 and for June 1987. The regression

for June 1.987 uses the end-of-1986 data for exposure and asset values,

but uses the June 1987 stock prices to compute the market value of

assets.       Because the banks are required to disclose LDC exposure to

individual countries only if exposure is in excess of one percent of

assets, we can obtain comprehensive exposure data only for the major

borrower countries. In particular, Aldc is limited          to include the

exposure to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela.           This

introduces a bias in the point estimate of p      which we discuss below.
       Table 14 reports the estimation results. Note that for each of

the years 1983 through June 1987 the estimated value of - has a

negative value and is statistically significant. As the coefficient -

is    equal to the difference between the market values of other assets

and mc loans, it is clear that a dollar on the books to the LDCs

contributes less to bank market value than a dollar lent elsewhere.

As noted, the exposure variable only covers part (about three fourths)

of LDC exposure. The omission of other LDC loans biases the
coefficient upward in absolute value to the extent that banks that are

heavily exposed in ABVN are also heavily exposed elsewhere, and to the

                                             27

extent that other LDC assets are also selling at a discount. Thus we

should adjust the estimated coefficient downward.

     If a bank's exposure to ABVM were perfectly correlated with other

LDC exposure, if the markets (unlike usi) knew about the remaining

exposure, and if the rest of the DC sold at the same discount as

ABVM, then an unbiased estimate of fi      for all   DC debt would be

approximately three fourths of the actual estimate, since AZVM

accounts for about three-fourths of the total bank exposure. As there

is not perfect correlation nor perfect knowledge of the rest of the

banks' DC portfolios, an adjustment factor of something greater than

three-fourths is appropriate.     We choose to decrease the point

estimate by a factor of 0.8 to get our preferred point estimate of the

value of the DC debt.

     Then, using the estimates of Table 13 we find the following

implicit market prices per $100 of face value of claim:



   1987 (June)      57

   1986             53

   1985             64

   1984             82

   1983             85

   1982           102



    The series shows that the market started discounting the LDC debt

not in 1982 when Mexico first announced its inability to

service its foreign debt, but in 1983. Ever since 1983 there has been


                                      28
a trend towards greater discounts, a finding consistent with the trend

in secondary market prices observed in Table 4.



(b) Bank excess return equations



     These results are supported by the results of a set of bank stock

excess return regressions represented in Table 15. Excess returns for

a particular bank in a particular period are measured as the

difference between the holding-period yield for the bank (capital

gains plus dividend yield) and the holding-period yield of the

Standard & Poor 500 stock market index multiplied by the individual

bank's beta coefficient. The regressions relate excess return to

exposure to Argentina, Brazil, Chile Hexico, and Venezuela divided by

bank book value. The Table first reports an excess return equation

spanning the entire 1982 - June 1987 period, and also a set of yearly

regressions. The 5-year excess return regression and alternative

regressions for 1986 and January- June 1987 include a dummy variables

that is set equal to 1 for banks located in Texas. This dummy is meant

to capture the effects of the oil slump on the profitability of Texas

banks.

     The 5-year regression indicates that a bank with a exposure to

book value ratio of one would have suffered a negative excess return

of 65 percent. From the yearly regressions, we find a statistically

significant effect of exposure only for 1983. However, the estimated

coefficients are negative for all years except 1986. By summing the

coefficient estimates for each of the years, we can get an alternative

     As a third way to test the relationship between stock prices and

LDC expbsure, we regress the banks price-earnings ratios on the ratio

of AZVM exposure to book val,ue. As the sovereign borrowers have been

current in their interest payments, with the major exception of

Argentina during 1984, earnings associated with Latin exposure have

not suffered considerably.      Low expectations about future debt

servicing however, should be expected to depress the price-earnings

ratios.     Table 16 shows that the estimated coefficient on the

exposure variable is indeed negative for all six years, and it is

statistically significant after 1984.

     The relative value of the constant term and the coefficient on

the exposure variable provides an indication of the discount on LDC

exposure relative to other assets.      A bank with no exposure has a

price-earnings ratio given by the constant term. A bank with the same

book value but with assets that are only LDC claims (with an

exposure-capital ratio of 1.0) has a price earnings ratio equal to the

constant minus the coefficient on the exposure variable.     Assuming

that current earnings are proportional to book value, regardless of

the distribution between DC claims and other assets, we can divide

claims relative to the price other assets (for the sane size book

value of each type of asset).      Assuming that other assets have a

price of 1.0, and that the coefficient on the exposure variabLe is

overstated by a factor of (1/0.8) for reasons described earlier, we

get the following alternative estimates of the LDC prices:

      1987 (June)   72

     1986           70

     1985           68

     1983           85

     1982           97




    These estimates are broadly consistent with the estimates from the

asset value approach, though the implied discounts are somewhat

smaller. Note that if the measured current earnings on the LDC assets

are smaller than the earnings on the alternative assets per dollar of

book value, then our procedures in this section would understate the

discount of on the LDC claims.



(d) Event studies



     The section concludes with a series of event studies. Here we

look at the movements of bank prices over a period of a day or a few

days, following the some important news related to the value of LDC

claims.   This kind of evidence can help to bolster the view that the


                                      31
markets react sensitively to news concerning the value of the LDC

claims.
        We choose four events: (1) the announcement of the Mistral plan

in Argentina; (2) the announcement of the Cruzado plan in Brazil;   (3)
the announcement by Brazil of a unilateral suspension of interest

servicing in February 1987; and (4) the announcement by Citicorp of

the increase in loan loss reserves on Latin American exposure. On

Friday night of June 14, 1985 President Alfonsin of Argentina
announced an accord with the IMF on an imaginative stabilization

program and monetary reform.      Simultaneously, the U.S. Treasury in

Washington announced that it had succeeded in assembling a
multilateral 480 million dollar short-term loan for Argentina to

assist it with its immediated loan obligations. Even though on the

following Monday the Wall Street Journal printed an article with the

heading        Argentina's latest austerity program is greeted with

skepticism by analysts,"     bank stock prices did well that day. The

results of a regression of bank stock returns on Monday on the ratio

of Argentine exposure to bank book value is shown in the first
regression in Table 17.    According to the equation, Argentine assets

as valued in the stock market rose in value by approximately $12.0 per

$100 of claims (the coefficient 0.097 is scaled up by the ratio of

MV/BV   to   get 0.12.

    On Monday March 3 1986, Brazil announced a similar austerity

program that included an agreement with foreign private creditors

reached the previous Saturday. The agreement called for a reduction in

interest paymnents of $ 150 million in 1985 and 1986 on $1.5 billion

of debt and a refinancing of $ 6 billion that matured in 1985. The

second regression of Table 17 shows that the combination of the

rescheduling negotations and the new program was disappointing to bank

stock investors, as bank stock returns on that day are significantly

negatively related to the banks' Brazilian claims.        Each $100 of

Brazilian public claims is estimated to have declined in value by $

8.1,   and each $100 of private claims by $   2.7.
       Almost a year later, on Friday, February 20, 1987, the Brazilian

Minister of Finance, Mr. Dilson Funaro, sent a telex to Brazil's 700

creditorbanks announcing a moratorium of interest payments on
medium-term and long-term commercial bank debt. The Wall Street
Journal commented that international bankers had grown used to debt
alarms and that they were taking Brazil's action in stride. Indeed,
the    third regression in Table 17 shows that on February 20 bank stock

returns were only weakly negatively related to the ratio of exposure

to Brazil      to book value. However, during the following week, bank

stocks tumbled as Brazil took further steps that indicated its

resolve. On Monday, February 23, Chase Manhattan Bank, Chemical Bank

and Citicorp each lost more than 5 per cent of their stock values. On

Wednesday, February 25 Brazil tightened its policy by telling its

banks not to repay foreign creditors seeking to recall short-term

credit. The fourth regression in Table 17, which relates the return on

bank stocks between February 20 and February 26 to the exposure to

book value ratio shows that the cumulative effect during the week of

Brazil's interest moratorium on bank stock prices is significant and

highly negative.

price movements between the day before and the day after Citicorp's

announcement. The added dummy variable is for Citicorp itself. The

bank's   stocks went        down slightly      (and   without   statistical

significance).



Stock Market Values and Debt Renegotiation

     The evidence      on the market value of LDC     debt has a crucial

implication   for   future negotiations between debtors and creditors, as

well as for the policy options of the official            community.        The

commercial banks should be willing to trade their LOC debt of a given

face value for a safer asset with a lower face value (we will term

such a trade a "cjebt   conversion").   In the simplest   case (and   for   the
moment ignoring tax and accounting          complications), if the stock

market values the debt at $60 per $100 of face value, then the bank's

shareholders will benefit if the bank sells each $100 of debt for

cash at any price in excess of $60. Of course, the swap need not be

with cash; any marketable security, such as a bond or an equity

claim, with a       market value in excess of $60 will do. Such a debt

conversion could result from direct negotiations between creditors

and debtors, or possibly through the policy actions of the official

comimxnity as illustrated below. Several benefits are likely to result


                                          34
from debt conversion schemes that convert the current       debt, now

priced at a discount, into cash, or into new claims at a reduced face

value (but which are then priced near the new lower face value). We

shall suggest that there is a strong case for policymakers to take

positive actions to support such debt conversions.



Debt Conversions through Bilateral Debtor-creditor Arrangements

     There are many ways that debt conversions may be arranged

directly between debtors and creditors.    The simplest case, with a

long historical tradition, is for the debtor to enter the secondary

market for its debt, and repurchase some or all of the debt for cash

at a deep discount. As tindert and Morton, Jorgensen and Sachs, and

others have recorded, such repurchases     of heavily discounted bonds

took place in the 1930s._l/ There are, however, several problems

with a widespread use of debt repurchases.

    A first problem is contractual.      In most of the existing debt

contracts with the commercial banks, there is a "sharing provision',

which requires that all payments by the debtor to the creditors must

be equally shared by the participating banks.      Technically, a debt

repurchase violates this clause, since the bank that sells its claim

gets a lump sum payment that is not received by the other banks. The

creditors and debtor can negotiate a waiver to eliminate the sharing

provision, though    such a waiver generally requires the nearly

unanimous consent of     the bank creditors.      A waiver has been

negotiated during 1987 in the case of Bolivia, under the restrictive

condition that Bolivia will repurchase its debt only with funds that


                                      35
have been donated to Bolivia by foreign governments expressly for the

purpose of debt repurchases.

     A second problem with direct repurchases involves the regulatory

environment facing the banks. The main problem is that when a bank

sells its claim for cash, it must record a       capital loss on the

transactions, equal to the difference of the face value of the claim

and the purchase price. This capital loss reduces the book value of

bank capital, and may trigger regulatory problems by reducing the

ratio of primary capital (measured at book value) to assets. Suppose

the bank sells a $100 claim, valued in the secondary market at $60,

for $65. At market prices, it would enjoy a $5 gain. In book value,

however,   it would have to record a $35 Loss. We have seen that, in

general, the stock market responds to the change in market valuation,

and not in book valuation. However, if the decline in book value is

large enough to cause the bank to come close to or        fall below

regulatory limits on capital-to-asset ratios (measured       at book

values), then the freedom of manuever of the bank might            be

Jeopardized.

     Clearly, the regulatory environment imposes a bias against debt

sales, since it now allows an asset worth $60 to be held on the books

at $100 until that asset is actually sold at its reduced value. One

possible response of the regulators could be to ease the regulations

to allow the capital loss from debt sales     to be amortized over a

period of several years (such an approach was recently introduced for

some kinds of bad farm loans.) Other "tricks' are also available,

that disguise the debt repurchase in such a way that an immediate


                                      36
writedowu is avoided.21

     A related regulatory problem is that if a bank sells some of its

claim on a country at a discount, then the regulators and the bank's

own auditors might force it to write down the rest of the its claims

on the debtor.    The regulatory treatment here remains murky. That

murkiness has apparently prevented many banks from selling off small

portions of their exposure in a particular country, because of the

risk that the resulting capital losses would be imposed over their

remaining claims on the country as well.

     A third problem with repurchases is that the debtor country

generally does not have the cash available to make a major repurchase

of its debt.     If the required large amount of cash were available,

the debt itself would likely not sell at a deep discount.          To the

extent that debt conversions are desirable, it might make sense for

the official community to give or lend money      to debtors in large

amounts to enable a large-scale repurchase to take place.         This is

essentially the experiment now underway with Bolivia. We return to

the possible involvement of the official community to support debt

conversions in the next section.

     Other forms of debt conversion have a similar effect as debt

repurchases, though they may be of a very different appearance.      In a

debt-equity swap for example, a potential foreign direct investor

purchases some debt from the banks on the secondary       market, and

bringing the debt to the debtor country's central bank. The central

bank purchases the debt using local currency, under the restriction

that the domestic currency then be used to     make a foreign direct


                                      37
investment.     As long as the central bank repurchases the debt from

the investor at close to the secondary market price (i.e. at the

price, converted into local currency, that the investor paid to the

banks), then the transaction is essentially a cash repurchase of debt

when viewed from the perspective of the central bank. The key (and

perhaps only advantage) of such a mechanism from the debtor country's

point of view relative to a direct repurchase of debt is that it

allows      the debtor to get around the sharing provision discussed

earlier22 Otherwise, debt-equity swaps have the same advantages and

disadvantages of direct debt repurchases.

       A new possthle form of debt conversion that may be similar to a

repurchase, though less costly to the debtor in terms of current cash

flow, is an exit band,       With an exit bond, the creditor swaps his

bank debt (say of $100) for a bond of the         debtor country with the

same face value (i.e. same eventual principal repayment) but with a

below-market coupon rate.        The    bond therefore has a contractual

present value (i.e. a present          value assuming no default) that is

below the face value of the existing bank debt.23

      Why   should   a creditor swap a bank loan for an exit bond of the

same debtor that has a lower contractual present value? The bond is

supposed to be superior to the existing bank debt for             several

reasons. First, holders of the bonds are explicitly relieved of the

obligation to make contributions to "concerted lending't packages that

may   be negotiated between the banks and the country in the future,

Second, the debtor undertakes, either expliéitly or implicitly, to

give the bonds a senior status relative to the remaining bank debt


                                          38
(i.e. to      fully service the bonds before servicing any of the bank

debt). If the senior status is credible, the bond may be a very       safe
         24
claim.

      Third, as discussed in a later section1 the creditors as a group

may benefit from the introduction of exit bonds          since     certain

efficiency gains may    arise   from the fact that the exit bonds reduce

the debtor country's contractual debt service obligations. We shall
see that the debtor country's ability and willingness to service its
debts may well rise as the contractual obligations to do so fall.

Some Tax and Regulatory Aspects of Debt Conversions


      There are two details that are important in understanding the
full regulatory and financial ramifications of debt conversions. The
first     involves book accounting.      As indicated     earlier, debt

conversions     may or may not require immediate     writedowns of book
values of the banks' claims, depending on how the transaction is
carried out. In general, if an asset is swapped for cash (a direct
repurchase)     or some non-debt claim   (e.g. a debt-equity swap), the

bank must book the new asset at its current market value, and write

down any difference between the face value of the debt and the market

value of the asset received in return. Thus, if debt with face value

of $100 is priced at $60, and is traded for cash or equity worth $65,

the bank records a loss of $35.

      This loss is important for two reasons. It reduces the banks

book capital, which is the measure used for regulatory           purposes.


                                         39
Second, the loss can be charged against taxes. If the bank pays the

corporate tax rate on the margin (34 percent in 1988), then the tax

savings would be worth $40 x 0.34. or $13.6.        Thus, the full value to

the bank of selling a debt for $60 would be $73.6. Put differently,

if the stock market is valuing the debt at $60, the bank should be

willing to sell the debt for $39       in cash, since $39 plus the tax

saving of $21 (equal to (1- .39)x.34), equals $60.

     If the bank debt is swapped for a new form of debt, however,

then the accounting and tax rules may be different. If $100 of bank

debt at market interest rates is swapped for a $100 exit bond with a

sub-market interest rate, the bank does na     in   general have to write

down the value of its claim unless and until the exit bond is sold on

the market, at which time the writeoff would be the difference of

$100 and the price received for the bond.            This accounting rule

(biown as FASB 15), gives the banks great flexibility with respect to

exit bonds. They can choose the time to take the capital loss on the

debt even after they swap the debt for exit bonds.



Why Debt Conversions are Attractive

    There are reasons to believe that debt conversions can make the

creditors (as a group) as well as the debtors better off relative to

the current situation in which the bank debt is kept on the books at

full face value, whether or not it is fully serviced.25           For most

countries, the current amount of debt        significantly exceeds the

expected discounted value of net debt servicing (i.e. debt servicing

net of new concerted lending).        We    suggest that there may be


                                       40
important efficiency losses from keeping on       the   books an amount of

debt far in excess of the amount that can reasonably be expected to
be repaid. These efficiencies losses are often ignored, but they are
a   central aspect of the case for debt conversions.

       The efficiency losses that we   will discuss are widely recognized
in   the context of corporate or personal bankruptcy, but not yet in

the context of excessive sovereign debt. There are good efficiency

reasons why a corporation or individual with greatly excessive debts

is allowed to discharge those debts in the context of bankruptcy. In

a corporate reorganization (i.e. a         Chapter 11 proceeding), it is

recognized that: (I) economic efficiency may dictate that an overly

indebted firm should continue      to operate; but that (2) efficient

operations require an exolicit conversion of the debt into claims

with a reduced contractual debt service obligation. (Otherwise, the

firms cannot      operate except in a crisis mode: they are denied

suppliers credits; they are subjected to creditor lawsuits; they have

a hard time collecting on accounts receivable; they cannot get new

financing for investment projects; they cannot get workers to invest

in job-specific training; and so forth).       Bankruptcy courts do not

tell the corporation to continue to operate with          all of its debt

intact, i.e. to simply roll over the debt and to "pretend" that it

can service all of the debt in the future. It is recognized that the
overhang of debt itself prevents the smooth operation of the firm, to

the ultimate detriment of the creditors.

       The same kinds of efficiency losses apply in the context of

sovereign debts. The overhang of the debt itself can hamper economic


                                          41
performance, even if the excessive debt is being             concealed by

concerted loans or by arrears.      To see this, we will consider some

simple illustrations.     Suppose that a country owes   $10 billion of

debt.      The safe market interest rate is 10    percent.     To begin,

suppose that the country's debt servicing capacity (i.e. capacity to

make a net resource transfer) every year is $600 million assuming no

chanEe in policies. The country repays all that it can each period,

though its repayment capacity may depend on the kinds of policies

that it follows. The market value of the debt would simply be the

discounted value of $600      million, or $6 billion at market interest

rates. The secondary market price would therefore be $60 per $100 of

debt.

        In the present debt management arrangements (assuming no
breakdown in negotiations, and without debt conversions), the country

would pay the full $1. billion of interest in the first year, and get

a concerted loan of $400 million, so that its net resource transfer

would be $600 million, which is its ability to pay. Next year, the

debt would be $10.4 billion, with interest due of $1.04 billion. The

country would again make a net      resource transfer of $600 million,

requiring a new concerted loan       of $440 million.    Each year the

country would get a new concerted       loan in order to keep the net

transfer at $600 million. The debt would eventually grow at a rate

approaching 10 percent per year,     the rate of interest. Obviously,

the debtor and creditor are engaged in a simple "Ponzi scheme" to

hide the fact of partial default.

        Suppose that instead of this arrangement all of the debt were


                                       42
converted into exit bonds with 6 percent interest. The bonds would

be perfectly safe, since the country would and could pay $600 million

per year on the bonds. There would be no defaults and no concerted

lending, since the debt conversion          would obviate the need for

concerted lending.    It would leave the position of the debtors and

creditors unchannd with respect to net resource transfers each year.

The debt   conversion would impose no losses to the creditors regarding
debt service receipts, and would offer the benefit to both debtors
and    creditors of avoiding the costs of negotiating the concerted

loans each year.

      Perhaps more importantly, the debt conversion would avoid the

risk of an actual breakdown in debt negotiations at some point in the

future, leading to an outright default.       The risk of a negotiating

breakdown is present    in most kinds of negotiations, but is
particularly acute in the bargaining between banks and debtor
countries,   since both the creditors and debtors are negotiating on a

wide variety of fronts, and so have the          incentive to stake out

"tough positions to avoid the appearance          of weakness in other

settings. Actual breakdowns of negotiations (which have occurred with

Nigeria, Peru, and several other countries) are very costly.         The

debtor's international      trade can be hampered by a drying up
international trade credits,     or other forms of disruption.      This

disruption represents a debt- weight loss to both the debtor and the

creditors, a loss that can be avoided by the debt conversion.

      Note that the market price of debt will in general reflect the

fears of such a future breakdown.      In our example, therefore,     In


                                       43
which the country can service 60 percent of the debt, the       market

price of the debt would generally sell at below 60 percent, say $55

per $100. Then, a switch to exit bonds would involve a capital gain

from $55 to $60 that would be shared by the creditors and debtors.

    Next, suppose that by undertaking a structural reform program in

the current year, which would require the nation to       forego $100

million in current consumption, the country could raise its output,

and therefore its debt servicing capacity, by $12 million this year

and every year in the future. Debt servicing capacity, and therefore

debt servicing (under the assumption that the country   pays   all that

it can) would rise to $618 million per year.      The secondary market

value of the debt would rise to $61.8 per $100.

     If this reform is carried out, the debtor would sacrifice

consumption for the sake of the foreign creditors since the returns

to the structural reforu effort would be appropriated by future debt

servicing. There would be little incentive to make such a structural

change, and indeed it might be politically suicidal, since opposition

parties would attack the government        for sacrificing current

consumption for the sake of foreign creditors.      The key assumption

of course is that the creditors would appropriate a large portion, if

not all, of the improvements in the economy. This is a reasonable

assumption.     Concerted lending and reschedulings are granted to

countries in dire economic difficulties.   Once an economy improves,

the debtor is expected to service its debts in full, and the debtor's

bargaining power to resist debt servicing is dimin1s       No player,

neither the banks, the IMF and World Bank, or the              creditor


                                      44
governments, will excuse a country with a healthy economy from debt
servicing,    on the grounds that it   was once in trouble and chose to
undertake    needed reforms!

        Could the reforms be financed by the foreign creditors in order
to    increase the country's debt servicing capacity, rather than via a
reduction in debtor-country consumption?            Probably not.    Supposing
that    $100 million is lent to the country          in addition to the $400
million    of interest refinancing (the overall concerted loan would be

$500 million).       There is no guarantee         that the structural reforms

would actually be undertaken.          The        country might promise" to
undertake the reforms, receive the                loan,   use the money for
consumption purposes instead, and continue to pay $600 million in net

resource transfers in the         future.        They would benefit from this

policy choice, by raising current consumption by $100 million at no

real future cost.      Since promises to reform are notoriously difficult

to    regulate,   (most IMF and World Bank conditionality requirements are

not    net by borrowing countries), it is a good bet that such lending
would be dangerous indeed, and thus would not be undertaken.

       Now suppose that the debt conversion exercise is undertaken
instead.     The contractual debt burden is reduced to the level.        $600

million per year through the use of exit bonds. Now, if the country

undertakes the reform effort, it would reduce current consumption by

$100 million, but increase future consumption               potential by $18

million per year. The foreign creditors would no longer appropriate

the benefit, since their claims have been reduced to a fixed $600

million by the debt conversion. As long as the consumers' rate of


                                            45
time discount is sufficiently low, the           reform will now look
attractive.       The creditor's welfare is     unchanged by the debt
conversion,     and the debtor's is raised.
      As a result of the efficiency gains, it would generally be

possible to structure the debt conversion to benefit both the debtor

and the creditors. For example, the debt worth $60 in this example

could be swapped into exit bonds worth $61 (e.g. paying 6.1 percent

interest), still leaving the debtor with enough incentive to carry

out thereforms.

        key point of this extended example is that an overhang of
      The

debt creates various inefficiencies.   First, the debt overhang
requires    continuous and costly renegotiation of the debt. Second, it

raises the spectre of a costly breakdown of negotiation, which would

disrupt the trading arrangements of the debtor, and thereby impose

costs on both the debtor and the creditors. Third, and perhaps most

important, the debt can act as a heavy tax on economic reform. Under

the   current     arrangements, the returns to reform are appropriated
heavily, if not entirely, by the foreign creditors. The result is
twofold:     (1) no individual government has an incentive to undertake

adjustments; and (2) political parties that are opposed to reform

have an attractive case to take to the electorate.         This latter
concern is far from abstract.      In recent legislative elections, the

reformist government of President Alfonsin in Argentina lost heavily

to the Peronists, who have been arguing against reforms to increase

foreign debt repayments, urging a debt moratorium inm'ad.




                                         46
A Crucial Caveat on Exit Bonds


      The previous discussion has highlighted the potential usefulness

of   exit bonds. We have given examples in which the       conversion of

all bank debt into exit bonds could reduce the                contractual

obligations of the debtor country while at the same time maintaining,

or even raising, the market value of the resulting claims held by the

creditors. The example was chosen to make this point, but for this

reason it may mislead as well.          In a more general setting, the

conversion of bank debt into exit bonds may result in a fall in the

value of the creditors       claims     rather than a rise, thereby
undercutting the case for exit bonds.

      Consider an additional illustration.        Suppose that a debtor

country will be able (and willing) to repay its debts fully if world

commodity prices recover (probability 0.6), and will default entirely

if commodities prices stay the same or fall         further (probability
0.4). $100 of debt would sell for $60 in the       secondary market. Now

suppose that the debt is converted to exit bonds, carrying a coupon

interest rate at 60 percent of the           market interest rate.   The

contractual present value of a $100 long-term bond would be reduced

to $60. What would be the new market value of the creditors' claims?

Evidently, the new exit bonds would also have a 60 percent chance of

being fully      serviced, and a 40 percent chance of being fully
defaulted.    Thus, the exit bonds would sell at a 60 percent discount

relative     to the contractual obligations of the bonds.       In other


                                        47
words, the     market price would by 60 percent of $60, or $36.

Obviously, in this case, the creditors lose substantially by giving

up their bank claims (worth $60) for an exit bond (worth $36).

     Therefore, a discount on the bank debt in the secondary market

does not mean that creditors can automatically benefit (or at least

not suffer) from a conversion of debt into exit bonds.           In the

example that we just cited, there is no efficiency gain to making the

debt conversion, since payoffs depend purely on the exogenous world

commodity price, not on the policies of the debtor. There is however

a loss to the creditors, since with the conversion to exit bonds, the

banks give up the chance of        receiving the full $100 repayment of

their debt in the event of           favorable world corodity prices.
Technically, part of the value         of the creditors' claims on the

country is the option value of sharing in high commodities prices.

When the debt is converted into exit bonds with a lower contractual

value, part of that option value is lost.

    Exit   bonds   therefore have the following minuses and plusses when

viewed from the perspective of the creditors as a group. On         the

negative side, since exit bonds reduce the contractual present value

of future debt repayments, the banks lose the option value of getting

fully or substantially repaid on their bank debt if exogenous events

are highly favorable.       On the positive side, the exit bonds offer

various efficiency benefits, which can raise the market value of the

resulting claims.      To    reiterate, these efficiency gains include:

avoiding the costs of        continuous debt negotiations, avoiding the

chance of a costly          breakdown in future debt negotiations, and


                                         48
stimulating economic reform in the debtor country.      The balance of
costs    and benefits    depends on the relative importance of these

considerations.

       We are inclined to believe that the benefits of debt conversion

considerably outweigh the possible costs, though our       reasons are

necessarily impressionistic, and must be considered on a case-by-case

basis.     The 50 percent discount on bank debtfor most countries
reflects the fact that the debt is twice too large to be serviced
with    regularity, rather than the fact that    exogenous events will

result in all or no repayment with probability 0.5. In other words,

the option value of waiting for full or nearly full repayment is of

little value.     Moreover, as we have pointed out, it is likely to be

seriously self-defeating,      since if the creditors wait for full

repayment, the debt overhang will stifle reform and tend to bring to

power less reformist and       more radical regimes, that indeed will

choose to suspend all debt repayments.

        Put yet another way, if the creditors really face a probability

distribution involving complete versus no repayments on the debt, it

is a probability distribution that they themselves can influence. A

reduction in the contractual debt burden through some form of debt

conversion will bolster the     political standing of those who would

repay the debt.



Debt Conversions and Public Policy



       To the extent that debt conversions are desirable for improving


                                       49
the efficiency of the debtor economies, there may be a         role for

pubLic policy is facilitating such transactions. At the minimum, the

regulatory environment can be modified so that arbitrary book value

calculations do not stand in the way of desirable exchanges.

     Many commentators have proposed going further, and using public

money to smooth the debt conversion operations.      In one      popular

proposal, the debt conversion would be intermediated by a            new

international debt facility.   The facility (which could be part of

the World Bank for example) would accept the exit bonds of the debtor

country, and issue its own bonds to the commercial banks in return

for the existing bank debt, which then would be extinguished.        The

country would owe money to the facility in the form of exit bonds.

The facility would owe money to the banks in the form of guaranteed

bonds.   The banks would get a safe claim       (the bond of the debt

facility) rather than a risky exit bond of the debtor country.

     This proposal is obviously nearly identical to two other

alternatives which have also been discussed. The first alternative

is that the official creditor community (e.g. the World Bank) would

provide a guarantee on the exit bonds issued by the debtor country.

The second alternative is that the official creditor community would

lend the debtor countries the money         necessary to make cash

repurchases of debt in the secondary market. In all three cases, the

contractual debt burden of the debtor country is reduced in line with

the discount on its debt in the secondary market, and the claims on

the debtor country are effectively shifted to the official creditor

community and away from the commercial banks.


                                     50
      It is easy to see that the capital cost to the official
community of this operation would be the difference in value of its

own   bonds (which would sell at par, since they are a safe asset) and
the exit bonds of the debtor country.26        Suppose,   for

exariple, that the countrys debt now sells at $60 per $100. If the

facility issues $60 of guaranteed bonds to the banks, and accepts

exit bonds from the debtor country with a contractual value of $60,

the facility's net worth will depend on the actual market value of

the debtor country's exit bonds relative to the                 $60 contractual

value,      We have given examples in which the $60 of exit bonds will

indeed be worth the full $60, (with            costs to the facility, and

cases in which the bonds would be worth only $36 (with the facility

losing $24 in present value terms).

      Why   is   such a facility needed at all? The main reason is that a

large-scale debt conversion poses significant collective                 action

problems that can best be overcome with official                  intervention.

Bankers' fears about regulatory problems, the legal status of exit

bonds, the problem of contagion effects (in               which terms to one

country influence negotiations with other                 countries), and the

difficulty of collective decisiorimaking among the a large number of

banks, make it difficult to carry out a large-scale debt conversion

without considerable support of the official community.              Therefore,

the significant efficiency gains       that might be generated by a debt

conversion are not achieved.

       Importantly, the likely costs to the official community of

intermediating a large-scale conversion would be modest.                Suppose


                                          51
that each creditor country participates in the international debt

facility in proportion to the exposure of its banks in the problem

debtor countries.       As we saw in Table         1,   U_s. banks hold
approximately $57 billion in claims on governments of the problem

debtor countries. The secondary market value of those claims was $32

billion in July 1987.     If the debt facility gave the U.S.        banks

guaranteed bonds worth $32 billion in return for the debt             and

accepted exit bonds from the debtor countries with a          contractual

obligation of $32 billion, the capital cost to the U.S. would be the

market discount on the $32 billion of exit         bonds.   At best, the

claims on the LDCs would be worth the full $32 billion: there would

be no residual cost to the U.S. At the very worst, the bonds would

sell, at the same discount as the      original bank debt (i.e. at 55

percent of contractual value).     The claims on the LDCs in that case

would be worth $17.60     billion, and the transaction would cost the

U.S. government $14 billion. Presumably, this capital loss could be

amortized over many years, so that U.S. taxpayers would end up paying

$1 - $2   billion each year for several years.

     Even this upper limit of $14 billion seems a modest cost in

order to achieve a reduction in LDC debt to the secondary market

levels for all thirty problem debtor countries in Table 1.       Consider

what is achieved from the U.S. perspective:      (1) the debt is reduced

to levels deemed manageable from the point of the view of the market;

(2) the U.S. banks are taken out of the game,           and out of risk,

without imposing further losses than have already been incurred; (3)

the potential is enhanced for     significant efficiency gains in the


                                       52
debtor countries by virtue of eliminating the debt overhang; (4)

relatedly, the political     positions of moderates in the LDCs is

bolstered relative to political forces that are urging a suspension

of debt servicing; and (5) by the same token, new democratic regimes

in much of     Latin America and the Philippines would likely be

strengthened by    a reduction of their contractual debt servicing

obligations.   Finally, this kind of relief is a very efficient form

of foreign aid, since the U.S. contributions would also be matched by

the other creditor governments. The Germans, Japanese, British, and

other countries, would also be contributing their ro rata share, so

that the U.S. would avoid carrying an undo part of the burden.     To

look at the costs from the point of the view of the entire creditor

community, we turn to the data in Table 18. As of the end of 1985, the

world's financial institutions (almost exclusively banks), had medium

and long-term claims on the governments of the problem debtor

countries of $194 billion, with a secondary market value of $105

billion. Thus a complete swap of debts into exit bonds for the thirty

countries in Table 18 would require official guarantees of $105

billion. At best, the capital cost of these guarantees will be zero:

the debtor countries will fully service the reduced burden of the exit

bonds. At the very worst, the exit bonds would be valued at the same

discount as the current bank debt, about $54 per $100 of face value

(the discount is slightly different from the discount for the 13.5.

banks because of the composition of the global portfolio). Then, the

capital loss internationally would be on the order of (1-54) x $105,

or $48 billion for the entire creditor community, of which the U.S.

Conclusions



      The   major theme of this paper is that the commercial banks have
weathered the debt crisis,       while   many debtor countries   remain in

economic paralysis or worse. There is a growing consensus that much

of the LDC debt will not be fully serviced in the future, and that

consensus is reflected in at least two ways: in the discounts observed

in the secondary market prices for LDC debt, and in the discounts in

the   stock market pricing   of banks with exposures in the LDCs.

      The fact that the bank share    prices   of heavily exposed banks are

already discounted in reflection of the decline in value of the LDC

claims demonstrates that the banks could absorb a significant book

loss on their LDC exposure.

      Our analysis suggests that certain debt conversion schemes now

under discussion could offer debt relief to the debtor countries

without causing a further deterioration in the market values of the

commercial banks.

2. To give an idea of the global distribution of bank claims in
the problem debtor countries, Latin America has about $200
billion of bank debt outstanding, of which about $75 billion is
owed to U.S. banks, $30 billion to Japanese banks (with $13 in
Mexico and $1.0 in Brazil). $40 billion to U.K. banks, and the
remaining $55 billion or so divided among German, French,
Canadian, Swiss, and other banks. The estimate for Japan is from
Doherty, "Japan's Role in the International Debt Crisis", Japan
Economic Institute, and for the U.K. from the IMP International
Capital Markets, 1986.

3. The term "debt forgiveness" is used to refer to any
restructuring of the debt that reduces the expected discounted
value of future payments. Interest capitalization refers to any
scheme by which a portion of interest due is automatically relent
to the debtor for later payment.      Interest capitalization is
distinguished from "involuntary lending" packages, in which loans
are made on an ad hoc basis so that the country can finance some
of the interest due.

4. Since completing the analysis in this paper, the secondary
market prices have fallen further for most of the debtor
countries. As of October 6, 1987, Salomon Brothers quoted the
following prices for the largest countries: Argentina. 34:
Brazil, 38; Mexico, 47; and the Philippines 55. Some of the
reasons for the further drop between July and October 1987
include: the toughening of the Brazilian negotiating position in
the fall of 1987 (including Brazil's call for a major conversion
of debt to exit bonds at sub-market interest rates); the Peronist
electoral victory in Argentina in September 1987; the political
instability in the Philippines; and the sharp rise in U.S. -
denominated interest rates.

5. An initial attempt to analyze the links of stock market prices
and LDC debt was carried out by Steven Kyle and Jeffrey Sachs,
"Developing Country Debt and the Market Value of Large Commercial
Banks," YBER Working Paoer No. 1470, september 1984. That study.
which used data until 1983:111, also found a significant negative
effect of LDC exposure on bank share prices.

6. Of course, many of these problems pre-dated the debt crisis,
and indeed were contributing factors to the onset of crisis, a
point stressed in J.      Sachs, "External Debt and Economic
Performance in Latin America and East Asia", Brookings Papers on

                                       55
Economic Activity, 1985:2.     In most cases, the excessive
budgetary deficits reflect deep social and political divisions
within the debtor countries that have been exacerbated by the
need to service a heavy foreign debt burden.

7. In Latin America, Chile has been the main beneficiary of the
rise in metals prices, since copper accounts for more than 40 per
cent of Chile's merchandise exports. Copper prices have risen
from 64 cents per pound at the end of 1985, to a price of 91
cents per pound in October 1987.

8. For a discussion of the budgetary burden resulting from the
foreign debt, see Helmut Reisen and Axel Van Trotsenburg, "The
Budgetary and Transfer Problem of Major Debtor Countries", OECD
Development Centre, Paris 1987, and J. Sachs, "Trade and Exchange
Rate Policies in Growth-oriented Adjustment Programs," NBER
Working Paper No. 2552, 1987.


9. Mexico received approximately $6 billion in bank credits and
Argentina recently signed an agreement for $2 billion in new bank
credits.    These amounts correspond to approximately one year's
interest payments on medium and long-term sovereign debt.


10. Moreover, the banks more than fully refinanced Chile's
interest payments during 1983-84 (i.e. the "converted lending" to
Chile in 1983-84 exceeded Chile's interest payments), so that
Chile actually received a net resource transfer from the
commercial banks as late as 1984. Interestingly, concerted
lending to Chile has been more generous on average (when the new
lending is measured as a ratio to the existing debt) during 1983-
86 than has concerted lending to any other problem debtor
country.

11. In her speech upon the opening of the Philippine Congress,
President Aquino declared, "We cannot help but feel our foreign
creditors took undue and unfair advantage of the internal
differences we had with factions intent on subverting this
Covermaent and destroying our democracy." (As quoted in the
Financial Times, July 28, 1987). The first act of both houses of
the new Philippine Congress was to call for an investigation into
the foreign debt.

12. See the IMF 'Internatinonal Capital Markets, December 1986,
for details on spreads and Maturities in debt reschedulings
through 1986. See 'The Economist' (March 22, 1987, p. 18) for an
update.

13. Non-accrual loans are loans in which interest servicing is
behind schedule or sufficiently sporadic so that interest is
credited to the bank only as it is received (i.e. on a cash

                                       56
basis), rather than the more typical procedure of crediting
interest as it accrues.

14. For a good discussion of the issues, see George .1. Benston,
et. at. Safe & Sound: Perspectives on Bankin2, MIT Press, 1986


15. Consider a bank that has deposits of $95, loans of $100, and
primary capital (in this case equal to shareholder's equity) of
$5.  A 5 percent reduction in the value of the assets wipes out
100 oercent of the bank capital!


16. The exposures to the Brazilian and Mexican public sectors at
the end of 1983, as a percentage of primary capital, were rather
large for many of the large banks. For Brazil, the exposure
ratios were as follows: Bank of America, 28 percent; Chase 1;
Chemical 23; Citicorp 35; and Manufacturers Hanover, 36. For
Mexico, the ratios were: Bank of America, 21; Chase, 3; Chemical,
27; Citicorp, 8; and Manufacturers Hanover, 46.

17. For a further discussion, see the IMF International Capital
Markets, 1984, p. 17-18, and later issues, and the Wall Street
Journal, "U.S. Bank Regulators are Called Likely to Require
Write-Down of Brazil Loans", September 1, 1987.


18. Thomas Hanley of Salomon Brothers is quoted in Fortune
Magazine (March 30, 1987, p. 104) as declaring: "The discount [in
the stock marketJ is even greater than the price concessions
accorded Third World debt currently trading in the secondary
market.'

quoted in the Washington Post, May 21, 1987.


20. This latter assumption is made to ease problems of data
collection.

21. An example is a follows.    Instead of using the $60 cash to
repurchase the debt, the debtor country puts the cash in a
custodial account managed by the creditors to zuarantee a bond
with sub-market interest rates that has a present value equal to
the sale price (e.g. a $100 face value bone, with a coupon rate
40 percent below market interest rates, that gives the bond a
market value of $60). The creditors then swap their $100 of debt
for the guaranteed ("defeased") bond, also with a face value of
$100, but a safe market value of $60. Under standard accounting
rules, specifically FASB 15, a swap of $100 of debt for $100 of
bonds of the same debtor, generally does not require a writedown

                                       57
in book values of the claim.

22. Until recently, most central banks were redeeming the debt
at close to oar, rather than at close to the secondary market
price.   This gave the foreign investor the spread between the
secondary market priceand the face value of the debt.       In
principle. a repurchase at par may act as an investment
incentive, though as with many incentive schemes, the largest
effect was to give a large lump-sum transfer to infra-margina).
investors that would have invested in the country anyway.
Recently, central banks have been finding ways to recapture most
of discount on the debt.       They have done this either by
repurchasing the debt at close to the secondary market price, or
by auctioning the right to participate in a debt-equity swap
among potential foreign investors, thereby recapturing the
surplus previously accruing to the foreign investors.

23. Note that in contractual terms, the bank claim has a present
value equal to its face value, since it carries a market rate of
interest.

24. Consider the the case of Brazil for example, with about $70
billion of bank debt, and annual net resource transfers to the
banks in recent years of about $6 billion.     If Brazil were to
convert $10 billion of its debt into exit bonds with a very long
maturity and a fixed interest rate of 6 percent, given a safe
market rate of 10 percent, the interest due on the bonds would be
$600 million per year. If the $600 million is credibly senior to
the remaining bank debt, there would be little doubt about
Brazil's capacity to service the bonds, since the $600 million is
far less than Brazil's revealed annual capacity and willingness
to pay.   The bonds would therefore be a relatively safe asset,
and would therefore be priced at about $60 per $100 of principal
(that is, 6/10 of market interest rate x $100, assuming a long
maturity on the bond).   Assuming that bank claims on Brazil are
now selling at below $60 per $100, individual banks should be
willing to swap their bank debt for the exit bonds.


25. The argument in this section, that debt conversions or debt
relief, can provide efficiency gains for both debtors and
creditors, was first argued in J. Sachs, "The Debt Overhang of
Developing Countries, 1forthcoming in the Memorial Volume for
Carlos Diaz Alejandro, to be published by the WIDER Insitute,
Helsinki, 1988. Another recent paper that explores a similar
theme is Paul Krugman,    "Bootstrap   Debt Relief," mimeo, MIT.

26. The facility might even sell off some or all of the exit
bonds in the open market, to realize the capital loss, and reduce
future risks.
