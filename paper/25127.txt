Post-FOMC Announcement Drift in U.S. Bond Markets

                                         ABSTRACT

The sensitivity of long-term rates to short-term rates represents a puzzle for standard macro-
finance models. Post-FOMC announcement drift in Treasury markets after Federal Funds target
changes contributes to the excess sensitivity of long rates. Mutual fund investors respond to the
salience of Federal Funds target rate increases by selling short and intermediate duration bond
funds, thus gradually increasing the effective supply to be absorbed by arbitrageurs. The gradual
increase in supply generates post-announcement drift in longer Treasury yields, which spills over
to other bond markets. Our findings shed new light on the causes of time-series-momentum in
bond markets. A model in which mutual fund investors slowly adjust their extrapolative
expectations of future short rates after a target change can qualitatively match the dynamics of
yields and fund flows.

1    Introduction
Long-term nominal and real rates co-vary strongly with short-term rates (Cochrane and Pi-
azzesi, 2002; Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson, 2005a; Hanson and Stein, 2015; Hanson, Lucca,
and Wright, 2017). Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005a) dubbed this the excess sensitivity
of long rates. The sensitivity of long rates represents a challenge to standard macro-finance
models. The standard model predicts that higher short-term interest rates lower long-term
inflation expectations and leave long-term real interest rates largely unchanged, thus lower-
ing long-term nominal rates. In U.S. data, innovations to inflation expectations explain only
a small fraction of the variation in longer maturity Treasury yields (Duffee, 2018).
    Our paper demonstrates that there is post-FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee)
announcement drift in bond markets, which contributes to the puzzling relation between
short and long rates. Figure 1 plots the IRF (IRF) of Treasury yields to surprises in the
FFR (Federal Funds Rate). Treasury yields at longer maturities initially respond sluggishly
to FFR surprises. The same-day response of 10-year Treasury yields to a 10 bps. surprise
in the FFR is only 1.7 bps, but, after 50 days, yields on 10-year Treasurys have increased
by 14 bps. After 50 days, the yields on long-term Treasurys partially revert back. The
over-reaction in Treasury markets is wholly attributable to FOMC meeting days on which
the FF target rate was raised. As a result, long-term yields are even more sensitive to short
rates than you think.
    FOMC announcement days provide us with a natural asset pricing experiment to test
the expectations hypothesis. Only news about the short rate is released. We can control
for news about the path of interest rates. The surprise is orthogonal to current and future
fundamentals, except when the Fed has private information about the macro-economy. The
expectations hypothesis seems to hold on FOMC meeting days, but it fails thereafter, and the
failure worsens as we increase the horizon. Initially, the term structure of yield responses to
the short rate shock is steep and downward sloping when plotted against maturity, consistent
with the mean reversion that is observed in short rates. As time progresses, the entire impulse
response curve shifts up and flattens, counterfactually suggesting that shocks to short rates
are perceived to be quasi-permanent. Hence, the yield curve flattens on the announcement
but gradually steepens thereafter. Eventually, Treasury prices revert back partially.
    We find direct evidence that these deviations from the expectations hypothesis are due
to price pressure. After FF target rate increases, bond mutual funds experience strong out-
flows. Mutual fund investors directly contribute to the sluggish adjustment by withdrawing
investments from short and intermediate bond mutual funds, but only after the FOMC ac-

tually raises the Fed Fund target rate. Target rate changes are more salient to mutual fund
investors. Within a year, mutual funds collectively sell 5.4% of their Treasury holdings per
10 basis points positive surprise. We also find evidence that banks and GSEs eventually also
sell a significant amount of Treasurys.
    Larger rate increases lead to larger bond mutual fund outflows, increasing the supply
of bonds to be absorbed by the marginal investor. In doing so, mutual fund investors help
the Fed increase long-term rates. Consistent with the flow-induced price pressure hypothesis
(Coval and Stafford, 2007; Greenwood and Thesmar, 2011; Falato, Hortacsu, Li, and Shin,
2016), we show that these effects are due to mostly to positive surprises, and we show that the
response of government bond mutual fund returns to the FF surprises is even stronger and
more persistent than the response predicted from on-the-run Treasury yields. The average
fund has a duration of 5 years. After 50 days, the impact on returns is 12.86 bps per bps
surprise, far greater than the 7.05 bps (5 times 1.41) implied by the yield estimates; Treasurys
that are held predominantly by mutual funds decline more in value than others, and the effect
is more persistent. Mutual fund investors distort long rates away from the response implied


                                                                                 3
by the benchmark expectations hypothesis after changes in the FF target rate. Mutual fund
investors thus help the Fed control long rates. We also show that monetary surprises predict
subsequent fixed income mutual fund returns up to 50 days after the FOMC meeting.
     The post-FOMC announcement drift is pervasive in U.S. bond markets. We find even
stronger inertia in the responses of long yields in U.S. corporate bond markets and TIPS
markets, as well as swap rates. These effects are robust to controlling for news about the
path of future short rates and changes in growth and inflation expectations (Nakamura and
Steinsson, 2013). We also examined the foreign bond markets of countries which feature an
equivalent futures contract traded on the reference interest rate. There is a quantitatively
similar overreaction pattern in the response of long rates in Australia, the U.K., Germany,
and Switzerland to news about the short rates. Only Canada and New Zealand’s long rates
do not respond in the same way to news about short rates.
     After a surprise rate increase, a typical bond fund experiences negative fund returns on
the FOMC announcement day. In response to these exogenously induced negative returns,
mutual fund investors pull money out of government bond and other fixed income funds, even
though these returns are not informative about skill. These fund outflows are triggered only
when the Fed actually changes the target rate. On these days, the surprises are not only larger
but also more salient to mutual fund investors. This suggests that more attention on the part
of less sophisticated investors can contribute to larger drift in prices after a shock. While it
may be rational for mutual fund investors to pay more attention to monetary surprises when
the FOMC meets, simply because more payoff-relevant information is released on these days,
it is harder to rationalize why they only seem attentive to target rate changes.
     To account for the joint dynamics in yields and mutual fund flows, we develop a model in
which mutual fund investors have sticky expectations and extrapolate when forecasting future
short rates. When the Fed raises rates, extrapolative investors overestimate future FFR, and
as a result, mutual fund investors sell Treasurys, because they anticipate an increase in long
yields. Extrapolative expectations about future macro-economic variables emerge naturally
when investors run regressions with a limited number of regressors, which will lead them
to overestimate the persistence of macro-economic conditions (Fuster, Laibson, and Mendel,
2010; Fuster, Hebert, and Laibson, 2011). Cieslak (2018) demonstrates that survey forecasts
of the FFR put too much weight on the current short rate, when compared against statistical
forecasts. Mutual fund investors’ expectations inherit those extrapolative characteristics.




                                               4
2    Related Literature
There is a growing body of survey-based evidence which suggests that bond investors make
systematic mistakes when they forecast future short rates. These forecast errors can impute
return predictability to bond returns that is orthogonal to risk premia from the perspective
of investors (see Piazzesi and Schneider, 2011; Cieslak, 2018). Our paper contributes to this
literature by showing that fixed income mutual fund flows are consistent with mutual fund
investors systematically overestimating future short rates after the Fed raises the short rate.
    There is a large literature that documents excess volatility for long-dated assets going
back to LeRoy and Porter (1981); Shiller (1981); Campbell and Shiller (1988). More recently,
Stein (1989) documents overreaction in long-dated option prices, while Giglio and Kelly
(2017) confirm that the volatility of longer maturity claims is too large relative to that of
that short-dated claims to the same cash flows. In various derivatives and bond markets,
the longer maturity prices seem to abstract from the mean reversion in the underlying cash
flows. Finally, Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005a) show that long-run Treasury yields
are too sensitive to macroeconomic announcements. Our findings identify a similar maturity
puzzle in the excessive response of long yields to FOMC announcements, and we suggest a
mechanism that can help explain this phenomenon.
    Even in deep markets, demand curves slope down (see Shleifer, 1986; Mitchell, Pulvino,
and Stafford, 2004; Coval and Stafford, 2007; Lou, Yan, and Zhang, 2013). A large literature
investigates the effect of supply shocks in Treasury markets (Krishnamurthy, 2002; Han,
Longstaff, and Merrill, 2007; Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2011, 2012; Swanson,
2011; Greenwood and Vayanos, 2014). Our paper contributes to this literature by estimating
the elasticity of the demand for Treasurys using FOMC-induced exogenous variation in fund
flows. We use these exogenously induced flows to estimate the elasticity of the demand
curve. The implied elasticity of Treasury prices with respect to the quantity of Treasurys is
roughly 0.44: the price of outstanding Treasurys declines by 0.44% when the supply increases
by 1%. The implied semi-elasticity of yields is around 0.089: yields increase by 8.9 bps for
every 1% increase in the supply. This effect is not uniform across the maturity spectrum,
but it is more pronounced for longer maturity Treasurys: Funds which hold longer maturity
Treasurys experience larger negative returns.
    Our findings suggest a novel monetary transmission mechanism that operates through
delegated asset management, combined with downward sloping demand curves, but this
mechanism only applies to salient target rate increases that were not priced in by the market.
Thus, our findings raise additional questions about the external validity of studies that use

                                              5
these shocks to identify the effect of monetary policy on real outcomes (see Nakamura and
Steinsson, 2018b, for a discussion of the information channel and implications for external
vailidity).
    This outward shift in the supply of longer maturity Treasurys driven by backward looking
bond mutual fund investors generates time-series momentum in Treasurys and other fixed
income asset classes that covaries across asset classes, as documented by Moskowitz, Ooi,
and Pedersen (2012). Time-series momentum –a security’s own past returns predicts its
future returns in various asset classes –is pervasive across asset classes including Treasurys
(see Moskowitz, Ooi, and Pedersen, 2012). Asset classes that have performed well in the
past months or year continue to outperform. Time-series momentum returns are correlated
across asset classes, but the source of correlation is unclear. Our work identifies macro
announcements as a potential source of correlation across asset classes. We find that macro
announcements induce time-series momentum in long-term Treasurys. We refer to this as
macro momentum.
    Mutual fund flows respond to an individual fund’s past returns (Chevalier and Ellison,
1997; Sirri and Tufano, 1998). In general, past fund returns can be interpreted as a signal
of manager skill (Berk and Green, 2004), but this interpretation does not extend to FOMC
surprises. There is a large literature documenting slow incorporation of new information
into prices when investors pay less attention. Dellavigna and Pollet (2009) documents larger
earnings announcement drift on Fridays, when investors are less likely to pay attention (see
Hirshleifer, Lim, and Teoh, 2018; Fedyk, 2017, for more recent work).
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 3 describes the response of yields in
the frictionless benchmark model. Section 4 explains how we use monetary surprises in the
data, and estimates the dynamic impulse response of Treasury yields to surprises in the FFR.
Section 5 describes the response of bond mutual fund returns and mutual fund flows to FFR
surprises, and we estimate the elasticity of the demand for Treasurys. Section 6 describes a
model in which mutual fund investors have sticky and extrapolative expectations. Section 7
discusses the robustness of our findings: we control for news about the future path of interest
rates, we control for changes in expectations around FOMC meetings, and we control for
past FF surprises and the release of the Fed’s minutes. Our main findings do not change.

3    Pass-Through of Short Rate News to Long Yields
High-frequency identification of the effects of monetary policy shocks implicitly relies on
the assumption of frictionless asset markets. In frictionless markets, bond prices will adjust
instantaneously to the release of new information about the FF target within the event
window: A deep pool of arbitrageurs with access to large amounts of arbitrage capital is
always available to eliminate price discrepancies along the yield curve. The entire effect of
the target surprise on bond yields can be captured even in a short event window. To set a
frictionless benchmark for the pass-through of short rate news to long yields, we consider
the simplest version of the rational expectations hypothesis.
    When the FOMC meets, bond investors revise their forecasts of the short rate. By
iterating forward on the nominal bond return equation expressed in logs, we obtain the
following expression for the log yield on an N -maturity zero coupon bond as a function of
future log returns:
                                            " N            #
                                          1   X N −j+1
                                   ytN ≡         r       .                                 (1)
                                         N j=1 t+j

This expression has to hold for all sample paths. Investors use this nominal pricing equation
to value the bonds, which gives rise to the following yield expectation under their subjective
measure:
                                              " N          #
                                         1      X N −j+1
                                  ytN = E∗t         rt+j .                                 (2)
                                         N      j=1


Put differently, the yield is the sum of expected short rates, rt$ , and log bond risk premia,
rxN
  t :
                                   " N         #         " N           #
                        N     1 ∗ X N −j+1          1 ∗ X $
                       yt = Et          rxt+j    + Et         rt+j−1 .
                              N     j=1
                                                   N      j=1

FOMC surprises should mainly affect the second component because these reveal news about
short rates. In that case, the expectations hypothesis seems like reasonable starting point.
We start by imposing that the expectations hypothesis holds. If the expectations hypoth-
esis holds, the expected return on the long bond equals the short rate period by period:

                         and the yield desired by the investor equals:

   In our benchmark model, investors are endowed with rational expectations. Rational
expectations investors use the actual data generating process for the short rate when they
         $
update: rt+1 = (1 − φ)θ + φrt$ + ut+1 . The rational expectations yield instantaneously reflects
news about the short yield:
                                                1 1 − φN $
                               (ytN,RE − θ) =           (r − θ).
                                                N 1−φ t
   As can easily be verified, the IRF for nominal yields in our benchmark model is given by:
                                      N,RE
                                    ∆yt+k      1 1 − φN k
                                             =         φ .
                                      ∆rt$     N 1−φ
Figure 2 plots the IRF in the benchmark model for the 3-month yield, the 1-year yield, the
3-year yield and the 10-year yield. Yields instantaneously adjust to the news about the short
rate. As the short rate reverts back to the mean, yields decline. The full (dashed) line plots
the case in which the monthly persistence of the short rate is 0.90 (0.95). The IRFs shift
down as we increase the maturity of the zero coupon bonds. The response is strongest at the
short end of the maturity spectrum. As we consider longer maturity bonds, the IRF shifts
down. As the persistence of the short rate increases, the impact on long yields increases
significantly. For example, upon impact, the 10-year yield increases by more than 16 bps
after a 100 bps shock. Figure 3 plots the term structure of yield responses to a 100 bps shock
after 1 days, after 20 days and after 50 days. Maturity is on the horizontal axis. The term
structure is steeply downward sloping and shifts down over time.
    Even when the expectations hypothesis does not hold, eqn. (3) holds under the risk-
neutral measure in the absence of arbitrage opportunities. If short rates follow a mean-
reverting process under the risk-neutral measure, then the same equation describes yields:
                      N,∗
(ytN,RE − θ) = N1 1−φ
                   1−φ∗
                          (rt$ − θ), where φ∗ is the mean-reversion parameter under the risk-
neutral measure. This benchmark model cannot reproduce the impulse responses of yields
in the data, especially at longer maturities. In section 6, we develop a sticky version of
the expectations hypothesis: in our model, mutual fund investors have sticky, extrapolative
expectations when they evaluate the forecast of future short rates in eqn. (3) to price longer
bonds.

4       Dynamic IRF of Yields to News about Short Rate
4.1     Measuring News about the Short Rate
High-frequency identification of the effects of monetary policy has become standard in mod-
ern macroeconomics and asset pricing (see, e.g. Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2011;
Nakamura and Steinsson, 2013; Hanson and Stein, 2015; Gertler and Karadi, 2015, for recent
examples). To measure the actual shock to interest rates, econometricians use the innovation
in the FF futures prices in a short window. Typically, researchers have used the nearest FF
futures contract to extract the surprise shock to the FF target on FOMC announcement
days (Rudebusch, 1998; Kuttner, 2001; Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson, 2005b; Cochrane
and Piazzesi, 2002; Bernanke and Kuttner, 2005). News about future FF target rates can
be extracted from Eurodollar deposit contracts with longer tenors (Gürkaynak, Sack, and
Swanson, 2005b, 2007; Nakamura and Steinsson, 2018a).
    We use FF Futures changes to measure news about the level of the short rate. We use
Kuttner (2001)’s measure for the 1-day surprise on day t:
                                                             m
                                    ∆rtu = ft0 − ft−1
                                                  0
                                                        
                                                                .                               (4)
                                                            m−t
where m is number of days in month and ft0 is the Fed Fund futures price for contract that
                                                                                
expires at end of this month. On the last 3 days of month, we use ft1 − ft−1  1
                                                                                  instead,
        1
where ft is the Fed Fund futures price for contract that expires at end of next month.
After 1994, t is the date at which the target change is announced, typically the second
day of the FOMC meeting. Before 1994, t is the next trading day after the last day of the
FOMC meeting. Piazzesi and Swanson (2008) show that Kuttner (2001)’s and Bernanke and
Kuttner (2005)’s surprise measure is robust to risk premium contamination. Our identifying
assumption is that the risk premium component does not change between t and t − 1. Under
those conditions, this surprise measures the innovation in the expected FFR.1
   Panel A of Table 1 reports summary statistics for the surprise measure around regularly
scheduled FOMC meetings. The first column reports statistics for all trading days covered
by the sample. The second column considers all 157 regularly scheduled FOMC meetings
between 5-June-1989 and 29-Oct-2008. After October 2008, there are no changes to the

    We     downloaded     Kuttner’s    monetary     surprise  measure   from     his  web  site  at
https://econ.williams.edu/faculty-pages/research/.    There are several instances in which Kuttner’s
timing deviates from the official FOMC timing.           The Kuttner series ends in 2008.   We ob-
tain the dates of the remaining FOMC meetings from the Federal Reserve Board website at
http://www.federalreserve.gov.stanford.idm.oclc.org/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.

target until December 2015. We chose to end our baseline sample in October 2008, because
the FOMC changed its operating procedure when it increased the FFR in December 2015.
We will check that our results are robust to extending the sample. To do so, we compute
Kuttner’s surprise measure on the official dates of the regularly scheduled FOMC meetings.
    The volatility is more than three times higher on FOMC meeting days than on other days.
On FOMC meeting days, the mean surprise is -0.99 basis points with a volatility of 6.78 basis
points, compared to 1.84 basis points in the overall sample. The mean of the absolute value
of the surprises is 3.90 basis points. Surprisingly, there is substantial negative autocorrelation
in the ‘surprise’ measure; the first-order daily autocorrelation is -0.211. The Federal Reserve
FOMC changed its operating procedure in 1994, when it explicitly announced the FF target.
After this, the date of the change is the actual last day of the FOMC meeting. The moments
of surprises do not differ much across these subsamples.
    Panel B (C) of Table 1 reports the results same summary statistics for Kuttner (2001)
surprises around (non-)target change FOMC meetings. There are 59 recorded changes in the
FF target on regularly scheduled FOMC meeting days. The standard deviation on target
change days increases to 9.58 basis points, compared to 4.302 basis points on non-change
FOMC meeting days. Remarkably, the negative autocorrelation is not present when we
only consider target changes. Finally, Panel C of Table 1 reports the results same summary
statistics for Kuttner (2001) surprises around non-target changes. The standard deviation
on non-target-change days is only 4.30 basis points, but the surprises are more leptokurtic.
We detect strong positive autocorrelation of 0.15 in surprises on non-target-change days.
Clearly, the Kuttner surprises are not quite i.i.d over time. There is surprising evidence
of serial correlation that varies depending on whether the Fed announces a target change,
consistent with Cieslak (2018)’s findings of persistent short rate forecast errors. We will
devise econometric methods that are robust with respect to the serial correlation in surprises.
    We exclude inter-meeting rate changes from the baseline sample, because these are dif-
ferent. The FOMC decides to change the rate in response to new information that has
emerged on that day. In fact, a few of the early instances coincide with the release of the
employment report. In this time period, there are a total of 25 inter-meeting rate changes.
These inter-meeting changes tend to generate larger surprises. The standard deviation of
the surprises on these days is 17 bps, and it includes a number of outliers, like the 71 bps
surprise in January of 2008. Only 2 of these are rate increases. The average surprise is -18
bps.

4.2      Bond Data
The U.S. Treasury yields are from the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity Series (downloaded
from Datastream). These are par yields interpolated by the Treasury from the daily yield
curve using a cubic spline model on bid-side yields for on-the-run Treasury securities. The
Treasury uses other yields if no on-the-run yields are available for a given security. We use
Moody’s Seasoned AAA and BAA Corporate Bond Yield. These instruments are based on
bonds with maturities 20 years and above. Moody’s tries to include bonds with remaining
maturities as close as possible to 30 years. Moody’s drops bonds if the remaining life falls
below 20 years, if the bond is susceptible to redemption, or if the rating changes. We also use
the CMT TIPS series constructed by the Treasury (downloaded from Datastream). Finally,
we use the ICAP U.S. Swap rate series provided by Datastream available at daily frequencies
as a source of swap rates. We use Kuttner’s monetary surprise series, available from his web
site. We use the Bloomberg daily yield series for Australia, Canada, the U.K., Germany,
Switzerland, and New Zealand.

4.3     Estimation
We use ytk to denote the par bond yield on a Treasury bond with maturity k. To compute
the impulse responses, we run regressions of cumulative yield changes between t − 1 and
t + j − 1 on the monetary policy surprise at t:

                     yτki +j−1 − yτi −1 = ak,j + bk,j −∆rτui + εk,j
                                                            
                                                                τi +j , j = 1, 2, . . . .                (5)

where τi ∈ τ is the date of one of the regularly scheduled FOMC meetings. Researchers use
OLS methods in the event window to gauge the effects of monetary surprises on asset prices
(see Kuttner, 2001; Cochrane and Piazzesi, 2002; Nakamura and Steinsson, 2018a).2 Instead,
we will use a longer event window to study the response of yields. Typically, it is assumed
that the policy surprise is orthogonal to that day’s current bond yield innovations. Under
the null of efficient markets and rational expectations, these ∆rtu are i.i.d. over time and
uncorrelated with the residuals εk,j   3
                                  t+j . Under these conditions, the OLS estimator is unbiased
and consistent. The slope coefficients bk,j , j = 1, 2, , . . . trace out the impulse response of
the Treasury yields to a monetary policy surprise. Focussing on FOMC meeting days is a
sensible econometric strategy because most of the variation in yields on those days is due to
the FF surprises (Rigobon and Sack, 2004).
    These surprises are not truly exogenous, but these are controlled by the FOMC, who in
turn respond to information revealed on that day. As a result, the right hand side variables
potentially co-vary with the innovations εk,j
                                          t+j . That would render the slope coefficients biased.
In particular, we worry that the release of negative macro news at t would jointly lead to
negative surprises and increases in Treasury prices (and decreases in the yields). If anything,
this would bias the impact slope coefficients at j = 1 upwards. As a result, these slope
coefficients may not be reliable estimates of the effect of a monetary policy surprise on bond
yields. In addition, the Fed may respond to information at t that is only subsequently
revealed to the market. Finally, for short horizons of less than 20 trading days (j ≤ 20),
there is no time overlap between subsequent regularly scheduled FOMC meetings. However,
at longer horizons, the change in yields may comprise the subsequent FOMC meeting. We
will deal with each these of econometric challenges in section 7. There is recent evidence that
investors do revise their expectations about future fundamentals (Nakamura and Steinsson,
2018a) in response to monetary surprises, which could feed back into bond risk premia.
   2
     See Cook and Hahn (1989) for an early use of the event window approach.
   3
     Strictly speaking, these surprises are only conditionally mean zero and uncorrelated over time under the
risk-neutral measure.



                                                     13
We control for these effects in section 7. If news about future fundamentals is released
on announcement, bond risk premia will only change if the conditional covariance between
returns and the SDF is affected. Even if the stand-in investor has Epstein-Zin preferences,
news about long-run consumption growth will not have this effect.


4.4    Treasurys
We start in Treasury markets. The estimated slope coefficients are reported in Table 2,
which reports the impact of Kuttner surprises on all regularly scheduled FOMC meeting
days. For the 3-month bond, the same-day response of yields is 54 basis points. At the one-
year maturity, the initial impact is 54 basis points. However, the impact gradually increases
to 141 basis points at the 50-day horizon. The response of longer maturity bonds is more
puzzling. We observe similar patterns for bonds with maturities in excess of one year. For
the 10-year bond, the impact is only 17 bps at impact, but the cumulative effect after 50
days is 141 basis points. The cumulative impact on yields after 50 days is more than 100
basis points larger than the initial impact.
     We plot the dynamic impulse-responses of Treasury yields to monetary policy surprises
in Figure 1 for the 3-month, 1-year, 3-year and 10-year zero coupons with 2 standard-error
bands on each side. Consistent with the literature, we find that the initial pass-through of
monetary policy surprises to short-term bond yields (e.g., the one-year bond) is around 60%,
but the impact is only only 20% for bonds with maturities in excess of 10 years. However,
the long-run impact of the policy surprise at 50 days increases with the maturity from 1 years
to 5 years, and only gradually declines after that. Treasury yields on longer maturity bonds
initially underreact and subsequently overreact to the short rate surprises. This phenomenon
is similar to the drift that has been documented for stock prices after earnings announcements
(Bernard and Thomas, 1989; Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok, 1996), except that there is
no evidence of initial under-reaction in Treasury markets.

    Figure 4 plots the term structure of these responses at impact (left panel), after 20 days
(middle panel) and after 50 days (panel on the right). The initial impact varies from 60 basis
points at the short end to zero at the long end. The term structure of responses is quite
steep, as dictated by the expectations hypothesis. After 20 days, the impact varies from 75
basis points at the short end to 20 basis points at the long end. The term structure has
flattened. At 50 days, the entire curve has shifted up, and the curve is hump-shaped. The
impact varies from 100 basis at the short end to 150 basis points for intermediate bonds,
back down to 100 basis points for long bonds.
    It is natural to assume that the expectations hypothesis holds for monetary surprises. We
can then compare these responses to the responses in the benchmark (rational) expectations
hypothesis model in section 3 (see Figure 2 and 3). If we compare the initial impact across
maturities, then the one-day response of the one-year bond (54 bps) is consistent with a

monthly persistence in the short rate of 0.90. The response of the 10-year bond (0.17) bps is
consistent with a monthly persistence closer to 0.95: The response of the 10-year bond seems
too large relative to the response of the 1-year bond. If we back out persistence from the
ratio of the 10-year to the 1-year response, we get even higher monthly (annual) persistence
of 0.975 (0.69). Upon impact, the term structure of responses is strongly downward sloping
(see Figure 4), consistent with the expectations hypothesis.
    To summarize, the expectations hypothesis seems to approximately hold on FOMC meet-
ing days, consistent with the findings of Savor and Wilson (2014), but not thereafter. After
20 days, the term structure of responses is still downward sloping, but we need an even
higher monthly persistence of 0.995 to match the 10-year yield’s response (60 bps) to the
1-year response (76 bps). Finally, after 50 days, the response of the 1-year bond is 141 bps.,
while the response of the 10-year is also 141 bps. These estimates are impossible to reconcile
with the expectations hypothesis.
    This evidence is puzzling, mainly for three reasons. First, it is hard to see why the impact
on the 1-year exceeds the size of the FFR surprise itself. This could be due to news about
imminent interest rate changes in the next few months. In this case, we are overestimating
the effect of the FFR surprise. We will control for news about future interest rates in the
robustness section. Second, after 50 days, investors implicitly seem to assume that shocks
to the short rate are quasi-permanent; we need a unit root in the short rate process to
rationalize the impact on the 1-year and the 10-year. Clearly, the expectations hypothesis
seems to fail after impact. Third, the perceived persistence of the short rate seems to increase
over time, according to these estimates.


4.5    Changes in the FF Target Rate
These effects are entirely driven by changes in the FF target rate. Surprises on these days are
about twice as large, and the surprises are obviously more salient to mutual fund investors.
Next, we estimate separate impulse responses for FOMC meeting days on which the target
rate was changed. Figure 5 plots the impulse-response of yields to the monetary surprises
on target-change days. We plot 2-standard-error bands around the impulse responses. On
target-change days, the response of yields to the surprise builds up gradually over time. The
response is statistically significantly different from zero, even at longer horizons. After 50
days, there is evidence of mean reversion in the long rates.
    Figure 6 plots the term structure of responses on impact, after 20 days and after 50 days.
As we go out further in time, the deviations from the expectations hypothesis benchmark

become more pronounced. After 50 days, the entire term structure of responses exceeds
150% of the initial shock. The details are in Table 3. Panel A of Table 3 reports results for
the same regressions using only non-target change surprises; Panel B uses only target-change
surprises. The surprises on these non-target-change days have much lower explanatory power
for subsequent changes in bond yields, especially for longer maturity bonds. Most of the
explanatory power derives from surprises on target change days. As an example, take the
1-year Treasury. The R2 upon impact is 0.26 on non-target-change days, compared to 0.41
on target change days. More surprising is that the R2 stays high long after impact, but only
after target changes. Fifty days after a target change, the R2 is 0.22 for the one-year yield;
only 0.04 after non-target-change days. In fact, for longer maturity bonds, the R2 actually
increases from impact to day 50.

IRF in bps of U.S. Treasurys with Constant Maturity to1 bps. (Kuttner) surprise in FFR after k days. OLS (HAC) standard
errors in parentheses (brackets) reported on row (2) and (3) of each panel. The unadjusted R2 is reported in row (4). Full
sample contains 98 regularly scheduled FOMC meetings between 5-June-1989 and 29-Oct-2008 without target changes. The
sample contains 59 FF Target Changes on regularly scheduled FOMC meetings between 5-June-1989 and 29-Oct-2008. HAC
(Newey-West, Bartlett kernel) standard errors computed with bandwidth of 2 for k < 50, 3 for 50 ≥ k < 75 and 4 for k ≥ 75.




    The sluggishness in the quantitative response to surprises is much more pronounced on
days when the FF target rate is changed than on other days. The initial impact is similar
when we only consider target rate changes. For the 3-month bond, the same-day response
of yields is 55 basis points. At the one-year maturity, the initial impact is 54 basis points.
For all these bonds, we can reject the null that the initial impact equals 100 basis points.
However, the subsequent response at longer horizons is quite different. Twenty days after a
target change, the response of the 3-month (1-year) yield increases to a cumulative impact
of 108 (118) bps. Fifty days after a target change, the cumulative response has increased to
230 (264) bps at the 3-month (1-year)-maturity.
    For bonds with intermediate maturities, the initial impact is small but statistically sig-
nificant. For example, consider the 5-year bond. The initial impact is 33 bps. However,
after 50 days, the impact has increased to 237 bps per annum. This response is comparable

                                                                    20
to the response of the one-year.
    Finally, we consider the impact on bonds with longer maturities. For the 20/30 year
bonds, we cannot reject that the initial impact is zero. This is what the expectations
hypothesis predicts, given the limited persistence of short term interest rates, like the FFR.
However, after 50 days, the cumulative response has increased to 164 bps (143) for the 20
(30)-year bonds. Given the limited persistence of the FFR, it is puzzling that these long
yields respond one-for-one to the Kuttner measure of monetary surprises. Furthermore,
surprises explain about 14% of the 50-day variation in the 20-year yield, but none of the
variation on the actual FOMC meeting day.
    These results are robust across different samples. In the Appendix, Table A1 reports the
result obtained on the pre-crisis sample that ends in May of 2007; Table A2 and Table A3
reports the results obtained on the longer sample that ends in May of 2018. This sample
includes the zero-lower-bound episode from December of 2008 to 2015.
    We also report the results obtained when all rate changes, including the inter-meeting
changes, are included in Table A4 in the Appendix. This approach is more standard in this
literature (see Bernanke and Kuttner, 2005; Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson, 2005b; Gertler
and Karadi, 2015). Inter-meeting changes are different because these presumably occur
directly in response to new information about fundamentals released on that day.4 When
we include the inter-meeting changes, the post-FOMC announcement drift is considerably
weaker. This attenuation occurs largely because the 26 additional target changes induce
large surprises, but only 2 are rate increases. The post-announcement drift is almost entirely
due to surprise rate increases, as shown in Table 4 which only considers positive surprises.
The panel on the left includes the inter-meeting changes. The panel on the right does not.
After 50 days, the 10-year yield increases by as much as 47 to 48 basis points in response to
a 10 bps positive surprise; this effect is more than twice as large as the effect of all surprises
when the rate is changed. The impulse response for negative surprises is small and does
not show drift. This asymmetry is consistent with our fund-flow induced price pressure
hypothesis.

    In fact, before 1994, some of these meetings coincided exactly with the release of the Employment report.
In these instances, the FF target rate change was triggered directly by the release.

standard errors in parentheses (brackets) reported on row (2) and (3) of each panel. The unadjusted R2 is reported in row (4).
The sample contains 35 positive surprises due to FF Target Changes on regularly scheduled and unscheduled FOMC meetings
between 5-June-1989 and 29-Oct-2008. HAC (Newey-West, Bartlett kernel) standard errors computed with bandwidth of 2 for
k < 50, 3 for 50 ≥ k < 75 and 4 for k ≥ 75.

This evidence of sluggish adjustment is not limited to Treasuries. One potential concern
may be that the Treasury CMT yields are obtained by fitting a curve. As an alternative to
the Treasury Yields, we used ICAP Swap Rates. The results are reported in Table A5 in the
Appendix.
    Long-term corporate bond yields are directly relevant for cost of capital of U.S. corpora-
tions, which in turn determines the discount rate used when making investment decisions.
There is stronger evidence in corporate bond yields of post-announcement drift in response
to FOMC surprises. Figure 7 plots the impulse-responses for corporate bond yields. The

IRF in bps. of U.S. Corporate Yields to 1 bps. (Kuttner) surprise in FFR after k days. Sample consists of all 157 regu-

panel on the left (right) plots the impulse response for BAA (AAA) bonds. In the case of
corporate bonds, the deviation from the expectation hypothesis seems even stronger. The
initial impact is close to zero for corporate bond yields. The muted response makes sense
given that all of the bonds used to construct the index have maturities in excess of 20 years.
However, after 50 days, the impact has increased to 137 (116) bps for BAA (AAA) bonds.
These coefficient estimates are statistically significant as well. Table A6 in the separate Ap-
pendix reports the slope coefficient estimates. The slope coefficient estimates are significantly
different from zero at 5 % significance.
    Finally, we also confirmed that even larger effects are present in TIPS markets. The
sample only starts in Table A7 in the separate Appendix reports results for real yields on
5-year TIPS. However, these effects are much smaller if we end the sample before the onset
of the financial crisis, which suggests that this may reflect disruptions in TIPS markets in
2008 documented by Fleckenstein, Longstaff, and Lustig (2014).
    Outside of the US, we constructed the monetary policy surprises for Australia, Canada,
the Eurozone, New Zealand, Switzerland, UK, and the US. The surprises themselves are one-
day rate changes of interest rate futures (3M Eurodollar and its international equivalents)
around the announcement. The non-U.S. announcement dates and rates are pulled from
Bloomberg and are checked against each bank’s website. Our IRF methodology differs from

Bernanke and Kuttner’s (2005) use of FF futures since FF futures settle to an average FFR
over the month, while IRFs settle to the end of quarter intra-bank rate. The findings are
broadly similar. In all of these countries, there is considerable post-FOMC drift of Treasury
prices at the short end of the maturity spectrum. However, at the long end, there is no
evidence of drift in Canadian and New Zealand bond markets. In all other markets, we find
very similar results, including in the UK and German markets. Detailed results are reported
in section C of the separate appendix.

Delegated asset management plays a major role in bond markets. In 2017 Q2, The total
supply of marketable Treasurys is $14.933 trillion. $5.585 trillion is held by foreigners, much
of this is held by China and Japan at central banks and sovereign wealth funds. If we think
of foreign demand as inelastic, the relevant total supply of Treasurys is only $8 trillion.
U.S. mutual funds held $1111.5 billion in Treasurys and T-Bills. Money market mutual
funds hold another $728.6 bn in Treasurys and T-bills (Source: Federal Flow of Funds,
Table L 210). Mutual funds hold another $ 641 bn. in agency and GSE-backed securities,
$667.6 bn. in municipal securities and $1,995 bn. in corporate bonds and foreign bonds.
Money market mutual funds hold another $641 bn in agency and GSE-backed securities.
Another $146.7 bn is held in ETFs. (source: U.S. Federal Flow of Funds. 2017.Q2). This
means that U.S. mutual and money market funds hold about 13.30% of the total supply of
Treasurys, compared to 1.7% for insurance companies, 3.2% for pension funds and 3.3% for
banks. 30.7% of the federal government debt is held by foreigners, but foreign demand for
Treasurys is rather in-elastic (Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2007). Delegated asset
managed is quantitatively important in U.S. fixed income markets.


5.1    Bond Mutual Fund Data
We use the Lipper classification codes to identify government bond funds in the CRSP mu-
tual fund data. We define government bond funds as (IUT) Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities, Short U.S. Government Funds (SUS), Short U.S. Treasury Funds (SUT), Inter-
mediate U.S. Government Funds (IUG), Short-Intermediate U.S. Government Funds (SIU),
General U.S. Government Fuds (GUS) , and, finally, General U.S. Treasury Funds (GUT).


                                              24
We define corporate bond funds as Quality Corporate Debt Funds A Rated (A) and Cor-
porate Debt Funds BBB-Rated (BBB) . Finally, we define Money Market Funds to include
Institutional Money Market Funds (IMM), Institutional Tax-Exempt Money Market Funds
(ITE), Institutional U.S. Treasury Money Market Funds (ITM), Institutional U.S. Govern-
ment Money Market Funds (IUS), Money Market Fund (MMF) Tax-free Money Market
(TFM) Taxable Money Market (TMM), Money Market Funds (MM), Tax-Exempt Money
Market Funds (TEM) U.S. Government Money Market Funds (USS), U.S. Treasury Money
Market Funds (UST). Hence, we exclude the Muni market.


5.2   Mutual Fund Return Dynamics
The Treasury constructs the yield curve that we used from on-the-run Treasurys. We start
by looking at the impact of FFR surprises on mutual fund returns, because this provides
a sharper picture of the actual impact on the valuation of a portfolio that includes all
Treasurys, using actual transaction prices. We use CRSP Mutual Fund data to gauge the
effect of monetary surprises on mutual fund returns and flows. The flow data is collected
monthly. We have end-of-month data on Total Net Assets and Flows for all bond mutual
funds in the U.S. We have daily return data starting in 1998. We report equal-weighted
mutual fund returns, because we do not have daily TNA data. However, we checked that
value-weighted monthly results are essentially identical to the equal-weighted results. We
run the following regression of cumulative log returns on the surprise:

                  rτki →τi +j−1 = ak,j + bk,j −∆rτui + εk,j
                                                    
                                                        τi +j−1 , j = 1, 2, . . . .    (6)

where τi ∈ τ is the date of one of the regularly scheduled FOMC meetings.

(brackets) reported on row (2) and (3) of each panel. The unadjusted R2 is reported in row (4). Full sample contains 157
regularly scheduled FOMC meetings between 5-June-1989 and 29-Oct-2008. The sample contains 59 (33) FF Target Changes
(that induce positive surprises) on regularly scheduled FOMC meetings between 5-June-1989 and 29-Oct-2008. HAC (Newey-
West, Bartlett kernel) standard errors computed with bandwidth of 2 for k < 50, 3 for 50 ≥ k < 75 and 4 for k ≥ 75.




    Table 5 tabulates the response of returns on all government bond funds to a 100 basis
point surprise. Panel A considers all FOMC meeting days. On the first day, a typical investor
in a US government bond mutual fund loses 1.48 bps per 1 bps short rate surprise. In the
first 5 days, that number rises to 5.09 bps. And finally, the impact after 50 days is 12.86
basis points. After a target change, these numbers change to 1.38 bps, 4.91 bps and, finally,
14.45 bps per 1 bps surprise.
    Upon impact, the typical U.S. government bond mutual fund seems to have a duration of
roughly 5 years: 148 bps. divided by 5 is roughly 30 basis points, the response of the 6-year
yield reported in Table 2. However, the typical fund’s return after 50 days (12.86 bps per bps
surprise) is far greater than 5 times the 50-day response of the 6-year yield ( approximately
7.5 basis points per bps surprise). This evidence suggests that Treasurys predominantly held
by the typical mutual fund suffer larger price declines after a surprise rate increase. After
100 days, these funds are down 10.90 bps per 1 bps surprise, much larger than the 4.0 bps
implied by the 5-year Treasury yield’s response (0.8 bps.)
    Mutual fund returns do not respond significantly to short rate surprises when the target
rate does not change. Panel B and C break down the meeting days into days on which the
target rate was unchanged and changed, respectively. Fifty days after the target rate change,
a typical bond investor has lost 14.45 bps per one bps. surprise, which exceeds the implied

                                                                      26
estimate of 11.85 based on the response of the 5-year yield reported in Table 2. Clearly, as
can be seen from Panel C, the results are entirely driven by target rate changes: Surprises
have no significant impact on returns when the target rate does not change. Even on the day
of impact, returns do not respond significantly to the size of the surprise. The explanatory
power of these regressions is close to nil in the absence of a target change.
    These effects are not symmetric. In fact, these are much larger for positive rate surprises
that inflict losses on mutual fund investors. In Panel D, we report results for the same
regression as Panel B, but we only include Fed rate changes that induce positive surprises.
The effect doubles in size: Fifty (20) days after the target rate change, a typical bond investor
has lost 28.33 bps (22.26 bps.) per one bps. surprise. The 20-day return impact is almost
twice as large as the one inferred from the Treasury yield estimates (5 times 2.31). Positive
surprises also explain a surprisingly large share of the variation. At the 10-day horizon, the
R2 is 0.43.
    Table 6 provides a break-down of these return dynamics for different types of government
bond funds. Intermediate Government Bond Funds invest in bonds with maturities from five
to ten years. Short Government Bond Funds invest in bonds with maturities less than three
years. Short/Intermediate Government bond funds invest in maturities between one and
five years. After 50 days, intermediate funds have lost 11.80 bps per bps surprise, 9.08 bps
for Intermediate/Short bond funds, and only 3.72 bps for the Short funds. Hence, for funds
investing in Treasurys, the losses are monotonic in duration. However, the largest losses are
recorded by TIPS funds: 13.99 bps.

where τi ∈ τ is the date of one of the regularly scheduled FOMC meetings. Panel A looks at
no-target-change days. Panel B considers only target changes. After target changes, there is
evidence of return predictability for longer maturity funds (Intermediate/Short, Intermediate
and TIPS). The predictor variable is i.i.d.. The increase in R2 at longer horizons is not
an artefact of the predictor’s persistence, and there is no Stambaugh bias in these slope
coefficient estimates.
    Table 7 reports the return predictability results. These results imply that mutual fund
returns are indeed predictable by the surprise. Consider a 10 bps surprise, and let us abstract
from the fact that one cannot short a mutual fund. These estimates imply that investors
realize 73.6 bps in incremental return over 50 days by going long or short in these government
bond funds or 3.68% per annum. The annualized return increases to 5.38% per annum
for Intermediate Bond Funds (6.24% for TIPS). An R2 of 0.15 implies that the maximum
unconditional (annualized) Sharpe ratio increases from 0.48 to 0.98 (0.68) at the 50-day

                                                                          28
(100-day) horizon for a sophisticated investor.5 The 50-day window here yields most return
predictability. This evidence is consistent with the time-series momentum documented by
Moskowitz, Ooi, and Pedersen (2012). In government bond markets, they find that a look-
back window of 1 to 2 months is optimal, roughly in line with the reversal we see after 50
trading days.

    Corporate bond funds display similar return dynamics. After a rate cut, corporate bond
funds also experience losses that are increase over time in response to a surprise rate increase:
after 50 days, the loss equals 9.46 bps per bps of surprise rate increase. However, the evidence
after other FOMC meetings is decidedly mixed. We do not find similar dynamics in mortgage
fund returns. These results are reported in Table A10 of the Appendix.

5.3     Mutual Fund Flows Dynamics
FOMC meetings are salient. News reporting about the FOMC and interest rates spikes
around FOMC meetings. For example, Factiva reports that there were 166 news reports
about the ‘FOMC’ and ‘interest rates’ per week in the Fall of 2017, but the numbers spikes
to 659 (September FOMC meeting) and 396 (October/November FOMC meeting) in the
weeks of the FOMC meetings.6 Furthermore, more attention is devoted to FOMC meetings
when the target rate is changed, especially around turning points for interest rate policy.
Saliency plays an important role in accounting for the strong response of mutual fund flows
to target changes.
    In the CRSP sample, we only have monthly mutual fund flow and TNA data. In Oct.
2017, the government bond funds in the CRSP sample collectively manage $257 bn in AUM.
The corporate bond funds manage $256 bn, while mortgage funds manage $155 bn. There
are other bond mutual funds not included in our sample that hold Treasuries (e.g. mixed
bond-equity funds). We do not include municipal bond funds. Money market mutual funds
manage over $3 trillion.
    Mutual fund flows respond sluggishly and persistently to the initial bond returns induced
by short rate surprises generated, but only when these are accompanied by target changes.
Surprise rate increases generate large mutual fund outflows when the target rate is changed
for all fixed income funds, including government bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage funds.
These effects are quantitatively significant. Figure 8 plots the impulse response of flows
aggregated by type of bond fund, expressed as a fraction of aggregate TNA, in response
to surprises when the target rate is not changed in Panel A, and when the target rate is
changed in Panel B. Panel A shows that there is no statistically significant response of flows
to the surprises when the target rate is not changed, except for government bond funds. For
these funds, a positive surprise triggers inflows. However, as is clear from panel B, there is a
strong negative response when the target rate is changed across all funds. Per bps. surprise,
government bonds experience outflows of up to .5% of TNA per bps surprise, corporate bond
funds up to .20% of TNA per bps surprise, and, finally, mortgage funds up to 1% per bps.
The response of money market fund flows, as a fraction of TNA, is larger upon impact but
does not build over time is and is completely transitory. As a result, there is a persistent
shock to the supply of longer maturity assets when the Fed changes the target rate, but not
to shorter dated assets.

    After 6 months, the total outflow as % of TNA in response to 1 std surprise (10 bps)
is 3.2% of the Total Net Assets of all gov bond MFs. If we apply this number to the total
holdings of Treasurys by all mutual funds and money market funds, that is a $ 63 bn supply
shock over a period of 6 months. In addition, corporate bond funds experience outflows of
up to 1.5% of Total Net Assets ( $ 2.2 trillion in 2017.Q2), while mortgage funds experience
outflows of up to 6.2% of their Total Net Assets. (Source: ICI, Table 4: Total Net Assets by
Investment Objective. )
    Table 8 compares the responses on non-target-change (Panel A) and target-change FOMC
meeting days (Panel B). If anything, when the target rate is not changed (Panel A), surprise
rate increases lead to inflows for all fixed income funds, but the point estimates are not
statistically different from zero, except for the case of government bond funds. The monetary
surprises account for a much larger fraction for the variation in flows when the target rate
is changed.

IRF of cumulative U.S. mutual fund flows to 100 basis points (Kuttner) surprise in FFR after k months. Aggregate Fund flows
are divided by aggregate TNA. OLS (HC) standard errors in parentheses (brackets) reported on row (2) and (3) of each panel.
The unadjusted R2 is reported in row (4). Full sample contains 157 regularly scheduled FOMC meetings between 5-June-1989
and 29-Oct-2008. The sample contains 59 FF Target Changes on regularly scheduled FOMC meetings between 5-June-1989
and 29-Oct-2008.




   Panel A of Table 9 decomposes the fund flow responses for different types of government
bond funds. There is strong evidence that mutual fund flows in and out of government bond
funds mitigate the effects of FF surprises when the target rate is not changed. Panel B
confirms that mutual fund investors amplify the effects of the monetary shocks when the
target rate is changed. Table A11 in the separate appendix shows that these results continue

IRF of cumulative U.S. mutual fund flows to 100 basis points (Kuttner) surprise in FFR after k months. Aggregate Fund flows
are divided by aggregate TNA. OLS (HC) standard errors in parentheses (brackets) reported on row (2) and (3) of each panel.
The unadjusted R2 is reported in row (4). Full sample contains 157 regularly scheduled FOMC meetings between 5-June-1989
and 29-Oct-2008. The sample contains 59 FF Target Changes on regularly scheduled FOMC meetings between 5-June-1989
and 29-Oct-2008.




    Finally, Table A13 in the Appendix shows evidence suggesting that the quantitative
response of mutual fund flows is almost entirely driven by the actual change in the target
rate, not by the surprise itself, presumably because of the salience of the target change. The
table reports the slope coefficients in a bivariate regression of fund flows on the surprise and
the actual target rate change. This evidence is hard to square with rational investor behavior
and lends support to the hypothesis that mutual investors destroy wealth by reallocating after
an FOMC target change. Note that we can explain up to 50% of fund flow variation when
we control for the size of the target change.


5.4      Mutual Fund Returns and Mutual Fund Flows
Even in deep markets, demand curves slope down (see Shleifer, 1986; Mitchell, Pulvino, and
Stafford, 2004; Coval and Stafford, 2007; Lou, Yan, and Zhang, 2013). A large literature
investigates the effect of supply shocks in Treasury markets (Krishnamurthy, 2002; Han,
Longstaff, and Merrill, 2007; Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2011, 2012; Swanson,
2011; Greenwood and Vayanos, 2014). Our paper contributes to this literature by estimating

                                                                     33
the elasticity of the demand for Treasurys using FOMC-induced exogenous variation in fund
flows.
    This section estimates the elasticity of demand for Treasurys. Table 10 reports the re-
gression results obtained for all FOMC meetings. We run regressions of k-month cumulative
mutual fund log returns on the mutual fund flows in the k months after the FOMC meeting.
The k = 1 regression equation selects the month of the FOMC meeting. As a result, this is
not a predictive regression. The panel on the left reports the OLS estimates. The panel on
the right reports the IV estimate. The FOMC surprise creates exogenous variation in flows.
We use the exogenous variation in the fund flows induced by all FOMC announcements.
When we consider all government bonds funds, we find that a 10% outflow in excess of the
mean induced by an FOMC meeting reduces the cumulative log return by 51.9 to 62.1 basis
points over the following months. Given that mutual funds hold about 11% of the supply
of government bonds, the elasticity of the Treasury prices with respect to supply is roughly
0.0051/0.011 or 0.44. This implies a demand elasticity of 2.7 (i.e. the % change in demand
relative to % change in price). This estimate is at the low end of the range of demand elas-
ticity estimates for individual stocks (see Wurgler and Zhuravskaya, 2002, for an overview).
We use an average duration of about 5 years. This duration implies that yields decrease
by 10.38 to 12.42 basis points in response to a 10% outflow from government bond mutual
funds. Hence, the semi-elasticity of yields is around 0.089.
    The size of the effect depends on the maturity of the assets. For Short Government
Bond (Short/Intermediate) funds, the estimates of the effects vary between 20.5 (27.1) and
24.3 (31.7) basis points. Finally, the estimates vary between 80.0 and 99.1 basis points for
Intermediate Government Bond funds.

Time Series Regression of k-month Mutual Fund Returns on Mutual Fund Flows in month after FOMC meeting. Monthly
cumulative log returns in months after FOMC meeting, including the month of the meeting. Returns expressed in pps. Aggregate
Fund flows are divided by aggregate TNA. OLS (HC) standard errors in parentheses (brackets) reported on row (2) and (3) of
each panel. The unadjusted R2 is reported in row (4). Full sample contains 157 regularly scheduled FOMC meetings between
5-June-1989 and 29-Oct-2008. The sample contains 59 FF Target Changes on regularly scheduled FOMC meetings between
5-June-1989 and 29-Oct-2008.




    Mutual fund investors distort long rates in the wake of FOMC announcements. FF target
rate changes trigger large, gradual flows out of or into fixed income funds that cannot be
readily absorbed by other market participants.


5.5      Other Investors
There is a growing body of evidence that arbitrage capital moves slowly, even in response
to anticipated events, even in developed, liquid asset markets: index reconstitutions in the
stock market (Shleifer, 1986; Greenwood, 2008) and Treasury auctions (Lou, Yan, and Zhang,
2013) are two prominent examples of repeated, anticipated supply shocks that have large
price effects (see Duffie, 2010, for an overview of the emerging literature on slow-moving
capital in asset pricing). We argue that FOMC announcements are a textbook example of
shocks to the effective supply of Treasurys, because of the response of bond mutual fund
investors, and the slow subsequent response of arbitrage capital. As a result of the slow
response, the short-run demand for Treasurys is not perfectly elastic. In fact, rather than


                                                                     35
lean against the wind by providing liquidity to Treasury markets, speculative investors choose
to exploit time-series momentum by taking short (long) Treasury futures positions in the
days and weeks following surprise interest rate increases (decreases). These positions are
proportional to the size of the shock. Net short positions in 10-year Treasury Note futures
increase by 30% as a proportion of open interest after a surprise 100 bps increase.
    We use the Open Interest data from the CFTC to measure speculative positions. Fol-
lowing the literature, the size of the speculative position is defined as

    (NonCommercial Long minus NonCommercial Short)/NonCommercial Open Interest

We focus on the 5-year and 10-year T-Note futures contracts. Speculative interest is 10
percentage points lower in the week after the FOMC announcement following a surprise rate
increase. The decline peaks at 30 percentage points after 5 weeks, and then it gradually
reverts. At least based on this evidence, sophisticated investors choose to trade with mo-
mentum. Greenwood and Thesmar (2011) found that mutual fund flows have larger effects
on stock prices when arbitrageurs trade in the same direction. Arbitrageurs in Treasury
markets do not lean against the wind. However, there is not enough arbitrage capital for
prices to adjust quickly. In that sense, this evidence is consistent with the evidence from
index reconstitutions in the stock market (Shleifer, 1986; Greenwood, 2008) and Treasury
auctions (Lou, Yan, and Zhang, 2013).

    This section also provides some tentative evidence on the response of foreign investors,
other intermediaries and institutional investors. First, we use the monthly TIC data from
the U.S. Treasury to examine net purchases by foreign investors in the wake of rate surprises.
These results are reported in Table A8 of the separate Appendix. After a rate change, foreign
investors act as liquidity providers by purchasing Treasurys in response to a surprise rate
increase. In response to a 10 bps. surprise, foreign investors would on average purchase
Treasurys and Agencys equivalent to 2.7% of foreign Treasury holdings.
    Second, we use the quarterly Federal Flow of Funds data to examine Treasury purchases
and sales by other U.S. Investors. This data does not distinguish between T-Bills and other
Treasurys. Given the quarterly frequency and the nature of the data, these estimated impulse
responses are less precise. The results are reported in Table A9 of the Separate Appendix.
In 2018 Q.2, banks held 4.29% of the marketable supply of Treasurys. Insurance companies
held 2.41%, while pension funds held 17.04%. Money market funds hold 4.88%, while mutual
funds hold about 8.35%. Finally, GSEs hold 0.78%, broker-dealers hold .79%, and the rest
of the world holds about 42%. Holdings by banks, pension funds and insurance companies
are quite stable, but mutual fund holdings and broker-dealer holdings are quite volatile.
    Consistent with our other results, mutual funds sell up to 0.179% of the total supply of
marketable Treasuries (or 5.4 % of their Treasury holdings) after 4 quarters in response to
a 10 bps rate increase. Interestingly, GSE’s and banks sell another 0.52% after 4 quarters.
These highly levered financial institutions suffer losses in response to a rate hike because of
the duration mismatch on their balance sheet, and as a result, they may see fit to further
reduce holdings of long-dated assets as their Treasury holdings are marked down, because
of price pressure from mutual fund flows. Alternatively, some of these banks may decide
to front-run mutual fund and other slower investors. By contrast, the largest U.S. holder
of Treasurys, pension funds, do not significantly adjust their holdings in response to these
shocks.


6    Sticky Expectations Hypothesis
There is a growing body of evidence that some of the statistical evidence in favor of bond
return predictability is driven by investors’ expectational errors about future rates rather
than bond risk premia (see Piazzesi and Schneider, 2011; Cieslak, 2018). We develop a
model in which mutual fund investors are slow to update expectations about future short
rates. In addition, these investors extrapolate when forecasting future short rates.


                                              37
    We consider a model in which mutual fund bond investors do not have rational short
rate expectations. We use a simple version of the Mankiw and Reis (2002) model of sticky
information to analyze the impact on bond prices. After an FOMC target change, in any
given period, only a fraction (1 − λ) of mutual fund investors update their information set.
This model is similar to the one used by Katz, Lustig, and Nielsen (2017) to analyze the
response of stock prices to inflation news. Consistent with this hypothesis, Coibion and
Gorodnichenko (2015) document evidence of information stickiness in inflation expectation
surveys that is economically significant. Rational inattention could potentially rationalize
stickiness.
    There is a continuum of mutual fund investors. Each invests in a different bond fund.
When we aggregate across all mutual fund investors, we then end up with discount rates
that are sticky. Obviously, this creates profit opportunities for sophisticated investors who
are not subject to sticky short-rate expectations, but instead use superior and continuously
updated short-rate forecasts.
    Instead of pricing the bond funds, we will price the zero coupon bonds directly. Equation
(1) has to hold for every sample path. That means it also holds for every individual investor’s
expectation for his individual bond portfolio

where t − l(i) denotes the last period when i updated her discount rate forecasts. When
they update their information set, investors use the following stochastic process for the short
                      $
rate, specified as: rt+1 = (1 − φmf )θ + φmf rt$ + ut+1 , where 0 < φmf < 1 denotes the AR(1)
coefficient, while θ is the investor’s estimate of the unconditional mean of the nominal short
rate. We allow for the possibility that mutual fund investors extrapolate when forecasting
short rates: φmf > φ. This extrapolative behavior is what Cieslak (2018) documents in
survey forecasts of FFR compared to statistical forecasts; the survey respondents put more
weights on the current short rate and less weights on other information (e.g., the employment
report). The dynamics of survey forecasts of FFR are consistent with investors extrapolating
the current FFR and ignoring other information.
    Next, we aggregate across individual mutual fund investors to end up with the following
expression for the average log bond yield that is desired by mutual fund investors:
                                                   " N        #

                                              38
where Ft denotes the cross-sectional average of the sticky information forecasts. Reis (2006)
shows that the cross-sectional average forecast of a variable xt h periods from now is simply
given by: Fit xt+h = (1−λ) ∞       j
                           P
                              j=0 λi Et−j xt+h . We can substitute the AR(1)-forecast of inflation
                                                                                      $
into this expression to obtain the cross-sectional average short-rate forecast: Ft rt+h    = (1 −
   P∞ j j+h $
λ) j=0 λ φmf (rt−j − θ) + θ. The h-period rate forecast is an infinite moving average of past
rates. Plugging these expressions into the expression in Equation (9) yields the following
result for the average log yield perceived by mutual fund investors.

Proposition 1. The average ‘target’ nominal yield desired by mutual fund investors with
sticky expectations is given by:
                                    ∞     j               N

                                 1 X   (λ)  (1 − λ) 1 − φ mf
                 ytN,mf − θ =                                  φjmf (rt−j
                                                                      $
                                                                          − θ).
                                 N j=0         1 − φmf


    The average nominal yield that is desired by mutual fund investors is an infinite moving
average of past short rates. The moving average weights are governed by the relative degree
of information stickiness in short rate expectations. As expected, an increase in the current
short rate above the unconditional mean immediately increases the target nominal yield, but
not by enough. A fraction λ of agents fail to update short rate expectations. As a result,
the target nominal yield is too low. However, as more agents update in subsequent periods,
yields continue to increase, which explains the positive effect of lagged short rates on the
nominal yield perceived today.

Proposition 2. The impulse response of the average ‘target’ yield to a short rate shock k
periods ago is given by:
                                                N
                                                           φmf k+1
                                                                     
                      N,mf
                   ∆yt+k           (1 − λ) 1 − φmf 1 − (λ( φ ))
                               k 1
                           = φ                             φ
                                                                       .
                    ∆rt$        N         (1 − φmf )(1 − λ( mf )) φ




    The larger λ, the slower the adjustment to the shock.
    We start by assuming that the marginal investor has rational expectations, and bond
prices follow the benchmark model’s response. The full line in Figure 10 plots the the
rational expectations response to a 100 bps short rate shock when the monthly persistence
of the short rate φ is 0.95.

    The response of the target nominal bond yield desired by mutual fund investors with

 This overshooting condition can only be satisfied if mutual fund investors extrapolate:
φmf > φ, because when φmf = φ, this inequality cannot be satisfied. When this overshooting
condition is satisfied, the average mutual fund investor considers the nominal bond yield too
low (or, equivalently), the price is too high (low), after an increase (decrease) in the short
rate. The average mutual fund investor will sell (buy) after an increase (decrease) in the
short rate.
    The dashed line in Figure 10 plots the response of the average yield desired by mutual
fund investors when the perceived persistence is much higher than the actual one: φmf =
0.995. When the mutual fund investor’s yield target crosses the RE response, the average
mutual fund investor starts selling her holdings, after an increase in the short rate. This
crossing happens sooner for longer maturity bonds, because extrapolative investors who
update reprice longer maturity bonds more aggressively. The price pressure that results can
push yields up even further, especially for longer maturity bonds.


                                                                                                  40
    If the actual yield on each individual bond fund equals the target yield, then this mutual
fund investor who has just updated expectations will not sell her holdings. That being the
case, the actual aggregate bond yield in each period equals this target yield perceived by
mutual fund investors ytN,mf . Given these actual yields, none of the mutual fund investors
will sell in response to a short rate increase (decrease). In this extreme case, we can derive
a simple expression for the log bond returns. Then the nominal log return is given by the
following expression:

    A rational investor, when confronted with these sticky yields, would choose to short the
bonds in case of a rate increase, as can easily be verified from the first expression for the
expected excess return. As the fraction of agents updating converges to one (1 − λ) → 1, the
expected excess return converges to zero, provided that mutual funds investors use the right
DGP when they update: φ = φmf . The Sharpe ratio depends on the fundamental volatility
of the short rate process.


7    Dynamic IRF of Treasury Yields: Robustness
There are three concerns that we address in this section. First, our estimated IRF might be
biased up because news about the future path is released on the same day. That news may
be correlated with the shocks to the FFR. Second, the regression windows overlap. Given

                                              41
that the FFR surprised are weakly correlated, we may be picking up the effects of a future
surprise at the next FOMC meeting that are included. We also control for news on days
when the Fed minutes are released. Third, news about macro-variables may be released if
the FOMC has access to private information about macro variables.


7.1      Dynamic Response to News about Future Interest Rates
The response of long maturity bonds to monetary policy innovations seems puzzlingly large.
During FOMC meetings, new information about the path of future interest rate is typically
revealed. This release of new information may bias the slope coefficients upwards, because it
contributes to correlation between the innovations to yields –the residuals in our regression
equation–and the FFR surprises. To mitigate this, we control for new information about the
path of future interest rates by including the change in the price of Eurodollar futures on
the FOMC meeting day (see Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson, 2007, for a motivation of the
use of Eurodollar futures). We include the 4-quarter and 8-quarter contracts. These futures
will reveal news about changes in the path of future interest rates.
    To compute the impulse responses, we run regressions of cumulative yield changes be-
tween t − 1 and t + j − 1 on the monetary policy surprise at t, as well as the news about the
future path of the FFR revealed on the same day:

yτki +j−1 − yτi −1 = ak,j + βk,j −∆rτui + γ4,j (fτ4i − fτ4i −1 ) + γ8,j (fτ8i − fτ8i −1 ) + εk,j
                                       
                                                                                             τi +j , j = 1, 2, . . . .
                                                                                                              (10)
where τi ∈ τ is the date of one of the regularly scheduled FOMC meetings. Under the null of
efficient markets and rational expectations, these ∆rtu are i.i.d. over time and uncorrelated
with the residuals εk,jt+j . Under these conditions, the OLS estimator is unbiased and consistent.
      Table 11 reports the detailed results. Panel A looks at FOMC meeting days without
target rate changes. The initial impact varies from 44 basis points for 3-month bonds to 29
basis points for bonds with 1-year maturity. These regressions which includes news about
the path of interest rates account for more than 70% of the overall variation on the FOMC
meeting day. For shorter maturities, that fraction is closer to 90%, suggesting that the FF
futures adequately capture news about the path of future interest rates. For the 1-year bond,
the impulse-response increases to 135 basis points after 50 days. Panel B looks at the FOMC
meeting days on which the target rate was changed. After 50 days, these impulse responses
are all larger than 200 basis points, except for bonds with maturities in excess of 10 years,
even though the initial impact is less than 50 basis points for all bonds. The point estimates


                                                         42
are quite similar (See Figure A1 in Appendix.).
    When there was no target change, we note the largest effect of controlling for the path.
Without controls, these estimated impulse responses were significantly negative for short-
term bonds. After controlling for news about the path, that is no longer the case. The
impulse responses after target changes look similar to the ones obtained without the controls.
    To make sense of this finding, consider a simple example. Suppose that investors expected
a 25 basis point increase going into the FOMC meeting, but the Fed decided not to change
the target rate at the FOMC meeting. This is a negative interest rate surprise: the FFR is
25 basis lower than investors expected. However, the Fed could signal that it would increase
the FFR target by 50 bps at the next FOMC meetings. In this case, bond yields might
actually increase. The regression of yield changes only on current Kuttner surprises yields a
negative coefficient at longer horizons, but this effect disappears when we control for news
about the path by including future changes.

Under the null of efficient markets, the Kuttner surprises should be i.i.d. over time, but
there is some evidence of negative serial correlation in these surprise measures. Table 12

Forecasting the monetary policy surprise at the next (subsequent) FOMC meeting with the current surprise.
OLS (HC) standard errors in parentheses (brackets) reported on row (2) and (3) of each panel. The un-
adjusted R2 is reported in row (4). Full sample contains 157 regularly scheduled FOMC meetings between
5-June-1989 and 29-Oct-2008.



    There is some evidence of predictability. Autocorrelation in the predictors could bias our
coefficient estimates. The slope coefficient is statistically significantly different from zero in
the case of no target changes, and when we consider all FOMC meetings. The estimated
slope coefficients are economically large; they vary between 0.18 and 0.35.
    To guard against the effects of serial correlation in monetary surprises, we include the
actual surprise on the next two FOMC meetings or surprises due to inter-meeting rate
changes on the right hand side, provided that they happen during the event window. To
compute the impulse responses, we run regressions of cumulative yield changes between t − 1

where τi ∈ τ is the date of one of the regularly scheduled FOMC meetings; We report results
for k = 50, keeping only those observations for which we have another FOMC meeting within
the 50 day window. We also report results for k = 100, keeping those observations for which
we have another two FOMC meetings within the 100 window.
    Table A14 in the appendix reports the results for k = 50, 100. In Panel A of Table
A14, we report the results for FOMC meetings days without a target rate change. Clearly,
the dynamic response of yields to monetary surprises has shifted upwards relative to the
benchmark case. However, the standard errors on these slope coefficient estimates are quite
large. In Panel B, we report results for FOMC meeting days on which the target rate has been
changed. The slope coefficient estimates on the monetary surprises have increased slightly
relative to the benchmark case. For the 1-year yield, the point estimates are 3.02 (2.81) at
the 50 (100)-day mark. These estimates are statistically significantly different from zero.
Conditional on a target rate change, the next surprise at τi+1 ends to negatively correlated
with the surprise on the event day τi . In Panel C, we include all FOMC meetings; the effect
of negative serial correlation is mitigated.
    In addition, we also control for news about the path. We include the actual surprise on
the next two FOMC meetings on the right hand side, provided that they happen during the
event window. To compute the impulse responses, we run regressions of cumulative yield
changes between t − 1 and t + j − 1 on the monetary policy surprise at t:

we have another two FOMC meetings within the 100 window. Table A15 in the Appendix
reports the results for k = 50, 100. The results are in line with the other results.
    Finally, Table A16 in the Appendix reports the response of Treasury yields to monetary
surprises when controlling for the release of the Fed minutes that occur in the window,

for surprises on FOMC meeting days that occur in the window and the release of the Fed
minutes.


7.3    Changes in Macro-economic Expectations
Finally, another possible explanation is that news is released around the FOMC meeting
that causes agents to revise their expectations about future economic fundamentals (e.g.
inflation, GDP growth).
    We use the change in the Blue Chip Financial Forecasts around the FOMC meeting to
control for changes in expectations. Every month, the BCFF uses a panel of experts who
submit their expectations for GDP growth and inflation for the next 5 quarters and the
current one. The survey occurs between the 23-rd and 26-th of the preceding month. The
January survey occurs between the 17-th and 21-th of December. We look for the first survey
date after the FOMC meeting, and we use the one-month change in expectations ∆Flτi (x)
relative to the previous month as our controls. We use either all of the changes in GDP
forecasts or all of the changes in inflation forecasts as our controls:
                                                 X l
        yτki +j−1 − yτi −1 = ak,j + βk,j −∆rτui +       γk,j ∆Flτi (x) + εk,j
                                                                          τi +j , j = 1, 2, . . . .
                                                      l

where τi ∈ τ is the date of one of the regularly scheduled FOMC meetings; ∆Flτi (x) is the
change in expectations around the FOMC meeting on date τi . Table A18 in the Appendix
reports the response of the forecasts to the monetary surprises. ∆Flτi +j−1 (x) is the j-month
change after the FOMC meeting. We can only use 97 FOMC meetings. We report the slope
coefficients in regression of ∆Flτi +j−1 (x) on the monetary surprise. There is a strong contem-
poraneous response of the change in expectations about GDP in Q1 (current quarter) and
Q2. For example, after target changes, a 100 basis point FF surprise leads to an immediate
251 (182) basis point increase in the expected growth rate of real GDP for Q1 (Q2). When
there are no target changes, a 100 basis point FF surprise leads to an immediate 227 (178)
basis point increase in the expected growth rate of real GDP for Q1 (Q2), consistent with
the findings of Nakamura and Steinsson (2013). This expectations effect could be immediate
feedback from the Fed’s decisions to changes in expectations of the survey participants, if the
Fed has access to private information about the U.S. economy, or it could reflect feedback
from changes in expectations not fully reflected in FF futures prices to the Fed’s decisions.
Monetary surprises on FOMC meeting days account for between 16% (4%) and 41% (21%)


                                                46
of the changes in Q1 GDP forecasts.
    Table 13 reports the estimated impulse responses controlling for revisions in expected
GDP growth. The changes in expectations of future GDP growth around FOMC meetings
increase the explanatory power of these regressions at the 50-day horizon, especially for the
longer maturities. The regressions now accounts for about 1/4th of the variation in bond
yields with maturities in excess of 10 years. However, the point estimates for the impulse
response are even higher than before. The evidence for sluggish adjustment or initial under-
reaction is even stronger. The 50-day impact estimate for the 10-year yield has increased
from 141 bps. to 291 bps. Table A19 in the appendix considers target changes separately.
As before, the evidence for sluggish adjustment is much stronger following target changes.
Finally, Table A20 in the appendix checks the results obtained when controlling for changes
in expected inflation. Our results are robust to controlling for changes in expected inflation.

8    Conclusion
Recently, more attention has been paid to the institutional details of money markets (see,
e.g., Duffie and Krishnamurthy, 2016) and local banking markets (see, e.g., Drechsler,
Savov, and Schnabl, 2017) to better understand how monetary policy is transmitted to
the real economy. Our work points to an important role for fixed income mutual funds in
monetary policy transmission. FF target rate changes are particularly potent in affecting
long rates because their salience triggers a large response from performance-chasing mutual
fund investors, whereas forward guidance does not. Our findings suggest that mutual funds
may play a key role in the transmission of monetary policy to Treasury, corporate bond and
mortgage markets. This deserves further research on the role of delegated asset management
in fixed income in monetary policy transmission.
    Our paper also sheds new light on the excess sensitivity of long yields to short rates,
the excess volatility of bonds in general, and the sources of time-series momentum in bond
markets.

Proof. Note that: Ft rt+h               j=0 λ φ    (rt−j − θ) + θ. In the case of information

             Ft       $
                     rt+k−1 = Ft        $
                                       rt+k =       (1 − λ)    (λ)j φj+k  $

IRF of U.S. Treasurys in bps with Constant Maturity to 1 bps (Kuttner) surprise in FFR after k days. OLS (HC) standard
errors in parentheses (brackets) reported on row (2) and (3) of each panel. The unadjusted R2 is reported in row (4). Full
sample contains 98 regularly scheduled and unscheduled FOMC meetings between 5-June-1989 and 29-Oct-2008 without target
changes. The sample contains 84 FF Target Changes on regularly scheduled and unscheduled FOMC meetings between 5-June-
1989 and 29-Oct-2008. HAC (Newey-West, Bartlett kernel) standard errors computed with bandwidth of 2 for k < 50, 3 for
50 ≥ k < 75 and 4 for k ≥ 75.
