                                         ABSTRACT

What is the impact of granular credit risk on banks and on the economy? We provide the first
causal identification of single-name counterparty exposure risk in bank portfolios by applying a
new empirical approach on an administrative matched bank-firm dataset from Norway.
Exploiting the fat tail properties of the loan share distribution we use a Gabaix and Koijen
(2020a,b) granular instrumental variable strategy to show that idiosyncratic borrower risk
survives aggregation in banks portfolios. We also find that this granular credit risk spills over
from affected banks to firms, decreases investment, and increases the probability of default of
non-granular borrowers, thereby sizably affecting the macroeconomy.

1     Introduction
    What is the impact of idiosyncratic borrower risk on banks and the economy? It has
been understood for years that if individual loans are small enough relative to the over-
all size of the portfolio then credit risk pooling should achieve perfect insurability against
idiosyncratic shocks (Diamond, 1984). But what if some loans are large? What if the distri-
bution of loan sizes is fat-tailed: can the performance of a single large loan directly affect
portfolio-level outcomes and lending? A rapidly growing literature, originating from the
seminal contribution by Gabaix (2011), has emphasized the micro - or "granular" - origins
of macroeconomic outcomes in a variety of theoretical and applied contexts. According to
the granular hypothesis, shocks to large, non-atomistic agents generate non-diversifiable
"grains" of economic and financial activity, which can directly affect aggregate fluctuations
and, via general equilibrium effects, all other agents.
    Curiously, there are few empirical applications of the granular hypothesis to banking.
This is puzzling because in practice the hypothesis maps directly into the "large exposure
regulation" of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The BCBS has been
regulating bank credit concentration risk for decades, formally at least since the Basel I Ac-
cords. The Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision emphasize that local country laws
should "set prudent limits on large exposures to a single borrower" (BIS, 2013). In practice
however, the Principles admit that "material differences in scope of application, the value
of large exposure limits, methods for calculating exposure values, and more lenient treat-
ments for certain types of exposures exist". As a result, the document concludes, "although
a concentration risk adjustment could be made to mitigate these risks, these adjustments
are neither harmonised across jurisdictions, nor designed to control traumatic losses from a
single counter-party default".
    This paper is the first to provide causal empirical evidence on the importance and impli-
cations of "single-name" credit concentration risk1 . We develop a new empirical approach
and apply it to a novel administrative firm-bank matched dataset from Norway2 . We merge
our loan-level administrative database with firm and bank balance sheet data. We cover
every single bank loan made to limited liability companies (LLC) in Norway over the 2003-



    1 We follow the BCBS vocabulary where "single-name"refers to the level of an individual borrower or coun-
terparty. This is in contrast, for example, to how BCBS defines and treats sectoral or geographical exposures
where the unit of analysis is either a whole industry or region.
    2 Throughout the paper we focus on corporate clients and loans. Our empirical approach however, is
general and flexible enough to be applied to other borrower types such as households, state institutions, or
other intermediaries.

2015 period3 . This data-rich environment enables us to study the transmission mechanism
and heterogeneous treatment effects at many levels of aggregation.
    Our empirical strategy consists of five steps. First, we establish that the distribution
of loans shares in our dataset is fat-tailed. Our estimate of the Pareto power implies that
80% of all credit is concentrated in 20% of the loans. Interestingly, we provide therefore
another example of the famous "80-20" Pareto principle that occurs in a variety of settings
in economics as well as more generally in social and physical sciences (Gabaix, 2009).
    Second, we construct a measure of idiosyncratic borrower risk. We use data on firm
balance sheets and income statements to estimate idiosyncratic value-added shocks for the
universe of all LLC firm × years in Norway over 2003-2015. We extract non-systematic
variation in firm value-added by controlling for a variety of balance sheet items like firm
size and costs as well as firm, industry, year, and geographical fixed effects. Our approach
follows very closely a large literature in labor economics and macroeconomics (Guiso et al.,
2005; Hsieh and Klenow, 2009; Fagereng et al., 2018)4 .
    Third, we establish the pass-through from these idiosyncratic firm shocks to loan-level
returns. We investigate how such shocks affect returns on loans within the same bank, in-
dustry, county, year, and loan type. Importantly, our specification controls for any confound-
ing bank-side supply factors, potentially specific to a given industry, county, or contractual
type5 . We find that idiosyncratic firm shocks have a strong effect on loan returns. In our
preferred specification with a full set of controls and fixed effects, a one standard deviation
negative firm shock causes annual loan-level returns to fall by 36 basis points. We explore
numerous dimensions of heterogeneity, including firm characteristics, geographical loca-
tion, ownership, and sector.
    Fourth, we look at the impact of idiosyncratic borrower shocks on banks portfolio-level
outcomes. This is a critical step in our analysis. Once aggregated to the level of a bank, we
potentially lose the positive properties of loan-level analysis: the loan share-weighted firm
shock series could be potentially contaminated by bank × year confounding factors which
we no longer have the power to deal with. For this stage, we adopt the "Granular Instrumen-

   3 LLC   is by far the most commonly used organizational structure in Norway. For most years, our firm data
accounts for more than 90% of total employment in the private sector.
    4 We perform a variety of validation and robustness checks to discipline our measure. In particular, we
establish that shocks are not cross-sectionally correlated or persistent across time. We also run a variety of
placebo permutation tests. Finally, we show that these shocks only have contemporaneous and lead effects on
loan and bank outcomes, i.e. that there are no "pre-trends".
    5 Conceptually, this step can be viewed as a "reverse Khwaja and Mian (2008)". In Khwaja and Mian (2008),
authors trace out the impact of bank supply shocks onto firms that borrow from the same bank. This way, they
are able to control for any confounding firm-side factors. Our strategy is to compare loan outcomes within the
same bank in order to control for supply-side factors. Our approach is very "granular", since we zoom in on
firms within the same bank, and industry and county.

tal Variable" (GIV) approach, newly developed in a series of papers by Gabaix and Koijen
(2020a,b). Intuitively, the GIV extracts the variation in the share-weighted aggregated firm
shock series that can be attributed to "granular" borrowers. Specifically, the instrument is
simply the difference between size-weighted and unweighted aggregated firm shocks. The
GIV thus eliminates any bank × year factors. Conditional on the distribution of credit shares
being fat-tailed, idiosyncratic shocks to large borrowers allows us to achieve identification.
    One important result of our paper is that idiosyncratic firm shocks, instrumented by
the GIV, have a large and significant effect on portfolio-level return on loans (RoA). A one-
standard-deviation granular credit shock causes portfolio RoA to move by 11.6 basis points
on average. Given that in the estimation sample the standard deviation of RoA is 1.35,
our estimate can explain 8.6% of the total dispersion of bank returns. We also find that
the relationship is strongly concave, driven mainly by negative shocks. In particular, if we
condition on positive share-weighted shocks, the estimated coefficient becomes a noisy zero.
In contrast, when conditioning on negative share-weighted shocks, the estimate jumps to
as high as 19.4 basis points, which is 15% of the sample standard deviation of RoA - an
increase of 74% over the average estimate6 . We investigate heterogeneity at the bank level
and find that the pass-through is the strongest for banks that are small and have few credit
relationships. However, we also find that the effect is still large and significant for banks
with many credit relationships, indicating that granular credit risk is not merely a small-N
problem.
    Fifth, having established that shocks to granular borrowers have a direct effect on
portfolio-level returns, we ask whether banks pass on these shocks to the real economy.
In other words, are there macroeconomic spillovers from granular credit risk? We start by
examining credit supply effects, by comparing bank loan quantity and rate changes in re-
sponse to granular credit shocks. We restrict the sample to firms with multiple bank relation-
ships, and ask if banks that experience bad granular credit outcomes reduce credit supply
or increase prices. The within-firm analysis allows us to control for demand side effects
using time-varying firm fixed effects, thus isolating the supply side. We find strong evi-
dence, both in terms of quantity and price effects, that banks pass on granular credit shocks
to their non-granular clients, i.e. firms with a loan share that is less than a certain thresh-



    6 The  concave relationship is reassuring to us for the simple reason that it reflects the basic payoff structure
of the debt contract. While there is no upside for the lender from borrowers experiencing positive value-added
shocks, the downside is capped only by the principal of the loan, not counting default-related costs, be they pe-
cuniary or not. Apart from the intuitive economic interpretation, we also view our finding of strong asymmet-
ric effects as an important sign of validation that our measure of idiosyncratic shocks is indeed economically
informative.

                                                         4
old (such as the median) in the pooled distribution of all credit shares7 . We show that a
one-standard-deviation bank-level granular credit shock reduces loan supply and increases
interest rates by as much as 71.7 and 63.4 basis points, respectively. This identifies a leftward
shift of the credit supply curve: quantities fall while prices rise. There are "granular credit
risk spillovers": firms are affected by granular shocks of others via their bank.
    We then ask whether affected non-granular firms experience negative real economic out-
comes. We find that affected non-granular firms cut investment. Moreover, these firms ex-
perience elevated bankruptcy rates for up to 3 years after the initial shock. A one-standard
deviation negative granular credit supply shock increases the likelihood of bankruptcy by
roughly 32-60 basis points for all firms, and 68-98 basis points for non-granular borrowers.
Granular credit risk has therefore sizable implications for the aggregate economy.
    An important question is whether banks hedge granular risk with alternative sources of
income. For example, in states of the world where credit income is low derivative income
could be high. We collect detailed bank-level data on non-interest income and find that none
of the measures we have correlate with GIV-instrumented firm shocks. We see no correlation
between our shock measures and fees income, equity and bond appreciations, dividend
income, or derivatives income. Another issue is that banks could potentially pre-insure
against granular borrower shocks by charging higher markups for risky clients. But when
extracting value-added shocks we control for firm size, liquidity, credit ratings, leverage
and time-invariant factors. From the bank's perspective, unless markups are stochastic for
some very unique reason, any firm shock comes therefore as a surprise relative to the firm's
average performance and its creditworthiness, both of which would in turn be very highly
correlated with the loan contract's price.
    Finally, we supplement our empirical analysis by providing a theoretical motivation. We
introduce parsimoniously bank credit into the canonical framework of Gabaix (2011). We
model firm borrowing needs as a power function of firm size, which in turn is drawn from a
power law density. Under this assumption, the distribution of bank loans (or, equivalently,
firm borrowing) follows the Singh-Maddala (SM) family of densities (Singh and Maddala,
1976). The SM distribution has been used extensively to model wealth and income inequal-
ity. Our main contribution is the derivation of sufficient statistics-based parameter restric-
tions under which the bank loan distribution also has a fat tail. If that is the case, then shocks
to large borrowers may survive aggregation and impact bank-level portfolio outcomes. Us-
ing our dataset, we provide maximum likelihood estimates of the sufficient statistics and

   7 The  tendency to pass along adverse portfolio shocks to smaller clients is not uncommon for banks. In
a recent paper, Greenwald et al. (2020) show that banks that experience larger credit line drawdowns restrict
lending to firms that borrow through term loans - a negative spillover effect on smaller borrowers.

confirm that all the restrictions are satisfied on average.

Literature Review Our paper relates to several literatures. First, it builds on the rapidly
growing literature on the "granular hypothesis" and its applications. Some of the more
salient contributions across fields range from papers on business cycles (Carvalho and
Gabaix, 2013), to trade (Gaubert and Itskhoki, 2018), international finance (di Giovanni et al.,
2018), asset management (Choi et al., 2017), and banking (Amiti and Weinstein, 2018; Bre-
mus et al., 2018). The latter strand focuses on how idiosyncratic bank supply shocks can have
aggregate real implications whereas we focus on the transmission of shocks to (large) bor-
rowers onto banks and the real economy. This paper's contribution is to show the existence
of important granular credit risk spillovers on the economy.
    Second, we relate to the literature studying the trade-off between credit concentration
and diversification. On one hand, diversification enhances credit monitoring and informa-
tion provision capacity (Diamond, 1984; Boyd and Prescott, 1986). On the other hand, some
empirical studies found a positive correlation between portfolio concentration, returns, and
monitoring efficiency (Acharya et al., 2006). Beck et al. (2017) have shown that bank spe-
cialization and concentration potentially have positive implications for systemic financial
stability. Our paper contributes to this debate in at least two ways. We argue that as long
as the distribution of credit shares features a fat tail, banks remain exposed to idiosyncratic
shocks to their (granular) borrowers. Everything else equal, this is detrimental for financial
stability. Because we find that banks pass on granular credit shocks to the real economy,
credit concentration induces negative economic outcomes on average, ceteris paribus. But
a normative interpretation of our results depends on the precise theories generating loan
concentrations in the first place, an issue we discuss further in Section 6.
    There is an emerging new literature on credit concentration that, like us, takes advantage
of detailed microeconomic data. In a recent study, Agarwal et al. (2020) find that Mexi-
can banks that specialized in energy lending around the 2014 collapse of energy prices am-
plified the sectoral shock to the rest of the real economy. Paravisini et al. (2020) find that
persistent bank market-specific specialization can explain a significantly larger fraction of
within-firm variation in credit than actual bank supply shocks. Goetz et al. (2016) show that
geographic diversification by banks has no impact on average loan quality and is associated
with a reduction of exposure to local idiosyncratic risks. Finally, Huremovic et al. (2020)
and Dewachter et al. (2020) study the role of production networks in Spain and Belgium,
respectively, for the propagation of bank shocks8 . Our paper differs from this literature be-

   8 Wedo not have information on production linkages in our data so we cannot explore this potentially
complementary channel of propagation.

                                                  6
cause we work explicitly with single-name concentration risk, while most of the literature
deals with either sectoral or geographical specialization. In addition, we emphasize both
empirically and theoretically the importance of granularity of the loan share distribution for
the pass-through of idiosyncratic shocks to the aggregate bank portfolio9 .
   The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a description of
our data. Section 3 describes the different stages of our empirical approach. Section 4 reports
the main empirical results. Section 5 explores heterogeneity at different levels of aggregation
and reports results from various robustness checks. Section 6 discusses the assumptions we
make in our empirical approach and the implications of our findings. Section 7 lays out our
theoretical motivation. Finally, section 8 concludes.


2     Data
     Our empirical investigation is based on a unique dataset assembled from three major
sources: administrative data from the Norwegian Tax Authority, credit rating agency data
from Bisnode and supervisory data from ORBOF. They were merged using the unique iden-
tifiers for banks and firms. The Norwegian Tax Authority data is a high-quality matched
firm-bank administrative register. The unit of observation in this database is an individual
loan and the frequency is annual. For every loan, we observe the firm-bank identifiers as
well as the flow of interest paid during the year and the end-of-year stock of debt. Because
the data is collected and maintained by the tax authority as a basis for corporate taxation,
the variables are essentially measurement error-free.10 The data set covers all limited liabil-
ity companies for the time period of 2003-2015, which accounts for roughly 90% of private
sector employment for most years. We aggregate all loans into a single annual firm-bank
"relationship" unit. The terms loan and relationship are used interchangeably, and refer to
the sum of loans and interests paid across all individual loans between a bank and a firm.
     A key measure in our analysis is the return on a loan, or a credit relationship (RoL). This
is not directly observed, and hence we impute it. Specifically, we observe interest collected
throughout year t (Rt ) and the end-of-year stock of outstanding debt (Dt ). We then define
the RoL in year t as Rt /(0.5Dt­1 + 0.5Dt ), which is equivalent to interest received relative to
the average of debt outstanding at the beginning and end of the calendar year.

    9 Thus  our paper provides an empirical basis for the work of Mendicino et al. (2019) who show in a quanti-
tative model that if banks are not perfectly diversified, the interaction between borrowers' and banks' solvency
has important effects on the probability and severity of crises.
   10 Provision of false tax information carries substantial legal, financial and reputational penalties. Addition-
ally, the information about outstanding debt and interest paid is reported to the tax authority by the banks,
and not the firms themselves.

                                                        7
    We merge the loan-level data with detailed information on Norwegian firms and banks.
Our firm data comes from the credit rating agency Bisnode. In addition to information about
the firms' credit rating scores and firm characteristics such as age, location and industry, the
data set includes annual balance sheet and income statement items on all Norwegian firms
for 1999-2019. The bank data is from a supervisory registry (ORBOF) and includes annual
balance sheet and income statement information covering all Norwegian banks over 1987-
2019. The data set also provides us with confidential information on non-interest income,
including income from derivatives, equity and bond investment, dividends, and loan fees.
    We perform several cleaning and truncation steps on the raw data. First, we drop ob-
servations that are clearly erroneous, such as cases of liquidity ratios being greater than 1.
Second, following Foster et al. (2008) we truncate the distribution of cost-to-total-cost ra-
tios for each cost type at the 10% and 90% in each industry and year. Cost types include
wage bill, energy, material and other costs. This is important as firms could dump all their
operational costs to a particular fiscal year in order to receive tax advantages, and what
we would thus pick up are in fact endogenous outcomes rather than unanticipated perfor-
mance shocks. Third, we truncate the extracted firm shock distribution at the 1% and 99%
levels. All our main results at the loan and bank levels are quantitatively robust to alterna-
tive cleaning rules. Table 1 provides summary statistics for some of the key variables used
in our analysis.

3     Empirical strategy

3.1   Granularity of the Distribution of Loan Shares
    We begin by establishing that the distribution of loans shares in our dataset is fat-tailed.
In Figure 1 we plot the histogram of all loan shares, pooled across all banks and years over
2003-2015. Eyeballing the distribution is enough to notice its extreme skewness. More for-
mally, we fit the Pareto I density to the data and estimate a Pareto rate of 1.15. Any estimate
below 2 implies that idiosyncratic shocks to large loans potentially survive risk pooling and
cause portfolio-level disturbances. This follows directly from the proofs in Gabaix (2011).
Interestingly, our estimate of the Pareto power implies that 80% of all credit is concentrated
in 20% of the loans. Thus the loan share distribution provides yet another example of the
famous "80-20" Pareto principle that occurs in a variety of settings in economics as well as
in many social and physical sciences applications (Gabaix, 2009). In section 7, we introduce
a parsimonious model of bank credit into the canonical framework of Gabaix (2011). In our
model, the fat tail of the firm size distribution feeds directly into the fat tail of the loan share
distribution under certain parameter restrictions. We estimate the main parameters of the
model using our data and confirm that those restrictions are on average satisfied.

Notes: This graph presents the distribution of bank loan shares. The left picture plots the full distribution. The
right picture zooms in on the 99th percentile of the shares. The share of each loan is computed as the ratio of
a singular loan's amount to total corporate loans of a given bank in a given year. The figures plot the pooled
shares for all banks and years. The Pareto rate of the 99th percentile is 1.16.




3.2    Estimates of Idiosyncratic Firm Shocks
    The next step of our empirical approach consists of extracting idiosyncratic firm shocks,
measured as unexplained idiosyncratic variation in firm value-added. Our approach follows
closely a large number of studies in labor and macro economics that extract idiosyncratic
sales or performance shocks. (Foster et al., 2008; Hsieh and Klenow, 2009; di Giovanni et al.,
2014; Foster et al., 2017; Fagereng et al., 2018)11 . To extract unexplained variation in firm
value-added, we regress the log of firm value-added on a set of time-varying firm-level con-
trols that includes measures of input usage and firm riskiness. Importantly, since our focus
is on idiosyncratic variation, we remove common (across firms) components by controlling
for the interaction of time, industry and county fixed effects. Finally, across-firm variation
attributed to time-invariant firm characteristics is absorbed by firm fixed effects.
    Formally, for a firm j, operating in an industry s from a county z in year t, we estimate


  11 Using  idiosyncratic shocks as "instruments" for estimating microeconomic or macroeconomic elasticities
is increasingly common in applied microeconomics and finance (see Leary and Roberts (2014), Amiti et al.
(2019) and Gabaix and Koijen (2020a)).

                                                                11
the following regression:

                     ln VAj,t = j,t,s(j),z(j) + 1 ln Kj,t + 2 ln Wj,t +  Xj,t + j,t                         (1)

where VA stands for firm value-added12 , K represents book capital, W the wage bill, and X
are other controls including leverage, liquidity, credit rating, and a quadratic polynomial in
age. The term (·) captures a combination of fixed effects at the firm and industry × year ×
county levels. Here, K and W are proxies for capital and labor inputs, while X are various
measures of firm riskiness. These factors should capture the banks' information set well. In
addition to the specification in (1) we also consider a less conservative specification, which
only includes fixed effects but not any of the other controls, in the spirit of di Giovanni et al.
(2014).
    The object of interest is the residual from this regression, j,t , which is the main right-
hand side variable for the rest of the paper. Essentially, what we are capturing are unforeseen
changes in firm performance that banks, despite observing multiple layers of data, could not
have anticipated. Examples of such events include a factory collapse, labor union strike, op-
erational risk issues, mismanagement, human errors, etc.13 We trim the year-specific shock
distributions at the 1% and 99% levels in order to mitigate the influence of outliers. Figure 2
plots the distribution pooled across all years. It is noticeably left-skewed, with a larger mass
in the left tail.




  12 Value  added is measured as sales minus material, energy, and other costs.
  13 A  potentially important factor that is missing from this specification is market prices. The share of pub-
licly traded firms in our data is, however, very small. Moreover, credit rating arguably captures the same
information that would be embedded in the stock price (albeit updated far less regularly).

  Notes: This graph plots the pooled distribution of idiosyncratic firm shocks estimated from equation (1).



    In order to check that our extracted shock indeed captures non-predictable idiosyncratic
movements in firm performance, we conduct a series of robustness tests. First, we confirm
that the shock series is not correlated across firms. Second, for each main regression specifi-
cation at either the loan- or bank-level we also run a series of placebo regressions. We return
to these robustness checks in Section 5.


3.3    Loan Outcomes
    To identify the impact of idiosyncratic firms shocks on loan-level returns, we exploit the
granular nature of our dataset. Individual bank-firm relationships enable us to control for
time-varying bank supply factors, such as risk aversion or monitoring skills, by including
bank × year fixed effects. Bank supply factors could confound our demand-side shocks14 .
We also control for interacted county × year × industry fixed effects. This specification
implies that the impact of shocks is identified by comparing loan-level returns across firms in
the same county, industry, year, who are borrowing from the same bank. For some firm-bank
relationships in our dataset we also observe the fraction of total loan volume that comes

  14 Coimbra   and Rey (2019), among others, show that heterogeneity in risk appetite among financial inter-
mediaries is a determining factor for financial and business cycles. Our fixed effects specification takes care of
this issue.

                                                       13
from credit lines. This allows us to also consider specifications which include a loan type
fixed effect15 . Formally, we estimate the following specification:

                                   Ri,j,t = i,t,s(j),z(j),l(i,j) +  j,t + i,j,t                               (2)

where i is a bank that lends to firm j from county z, industry s, year t via loan type l. Rijt is
the loan-level return and jt is the estimated firm-level shock from our first step. Because the
main RHS variable is estimated, our standard errors are corrected for the estimated regressor
bias via bootstrapping. Importantly, our specification features a wide range of fixed effects
captured by the term (·) . Specifically, in our most conservative specification we include the
full interaction of bank × year × firm industry × firm county × loan type fixed effects.


3.4      Granular Credit Risk: Bank outcomes
    After investigating how idiosyncratic firm shocks affect loan returns, we then move up
to the level of the bank portfolio. We aggregate the realized idiosyncratic firm shocks to the
bank level by weighing the shocks with loan shares and refer to the resulting measure as
"granular credit risk". Intuitively, granular credit risk captures shocks to banks' clients that
eventually do not average out and instead impact portfolio-level outcomes.
    To evaluate the bank-level impact, we proceed by analyzing the following relationship
between bank-level returns on all corporate loans Rb   i,t and firm shocks for bank i at year t:


                                         Rb
                                          i,t = i + t +  ¯i,t + i,t                                           (3)

where i and t denote bank and time fixed effects, ¯i,t = jJi si,j,t j,t are bank-level firm
shocks that are weighted by loan shares si,j,t , and i,t the error term. The portfolio loan return
Rbi,t is computed as the loan-share weighted average of loan level returns.
     There is one key identification challenge associated with the naive specification above.
Our loan-level analysis exploited within-bank-year variation to control for confounding
credit supply shocks. This is no longer possible when we turn our focus to outcomes at the
bank level. Consider a generic time t relationship of bank outcome yi,t , bank-time supply
factor i,t , and demand-side idiosyncratic firm disturbance i,j,t :

                                        yi,t =         si,j,t i,j,t + i i,t                                   (4)
                                                   j


  15 Afirm-bank relationship is classified as a credit line loan in year t if more than 50 percent of total credit
comes from credit lines.

                                                       14
where si,j,t measures the normalized exposure of bank i to firm j ( j si,j,t = 1). Regressing
bank outcomes on the demand-side disturbance potentially results in a biased estimate of 
if the unobserved bank-time factor is correlated with the demand-side disturbance.
    In order to alleviate this concern, we adopt a newly proposed "granular instrumental
variable" (Gabaix and Koijen, 2020a) approach. Specifically, we assume that the demand-
side disturbance i,j,t can be written as

                                                 i,j,t = i i,t + ui,j,t                                    (5)

where i is the loading on the bank supply factor.
    The granular instrumental variable ("GIV") is the time-varying difference between the
size(exposure)-weighted firm shocks and the equally-weighted firm shocks aggregated to
the level of each bank. This way, the bank-time supply-side factor i,t , which is potentially
correlated with firm disturbances is purged out. The GIV is formally constructed in the
following way:

                                                       1                                        1
                 GIVi,t =       si,j,t i,j,t ­                  =         si,j,t ui,j,t ­         u        (6)
                                                       Ni i,j,t                                 Ni i,j,t
                            j                      j                j                       j

where Ni denotes the number of firm exposures of a given bank i. We now replace our naive
specification in Equation 3 with the following regression:

                                       Rb              ^ i,t + it
                                        i,t = i + t +  u                                                   (7)

where u  ^ i,t is the fitted value from the "first-stage" regression of the endogenous covariate
¯i,t on the granular instrument GIVi,t . This way, all variation in ¯i,t is driven by fluctuations
originating from the "granular borrowers", i.e. those with a large credit share. Naturally,
if there are no granular borrowers, this approach does not work as there is no variation
in the instrument. But as we have seen from Figure 1, the distribution of loan shares is
very skewed. The main identifying assumption of this empirical approach is the following
condition:
                                           N
                                                  E si,j,t ui,j,t i,t = 0                                  (8)
                                           j

for all i and t.
    In words, identification is achieved if the shocks si,j,t ui,j,t are orthogonal to the error-term
in the bank-level regressions. This is the "exclusion" assumption. The main concern is that
loan shares could be endogenous, i.e. correlated with firm shocks. This is not a problem

for us for several reasons. First, credit demand in absolute terms correlates with firm size.
Given how we extract idiosyncratic value-added shocks (i.e. controlling for size), our shock
series is mechanically orthogonal to firm size. Similar logic applies to other firm factors
such as leverage, liquidity, credit rating or age. Second, as a proxy for contemporaneous
loan shares, our loan share measure is computed using average debt between periods t and
t-1. This mitigates any contemporaneity concerns. Finally, loan shares and firm shocks are
reassuringly uncorrelated in our sample16 .
    To confirm the validity of the instrument, in Figure 3 we plot the relationship between the
GIV and the raw endogenous covariate ¯i,t . There is a strong, positive relationship between
the two variables with a Pearson correlation of 0.863.


3.5    Granular Credit Risk Spillovers: Credit Supply and Firms
    In order to study the economic consequences of granular credit risk, we investigate the
relationship between bank-level aggregated firm shocks and the credit supply. We follow a

large literature in banking relying on the methodology in Khwaja and Mian (2008). Specifi-
cally, we focus on a sub-sample of firms borrowing from multiple banks and compare - for
the same firm - quantity and rate outcomes from banks that experienced good or bad granu-
lar credit shocks. We test whether banks pass on shocks originating from their granular bor-
rowers to the rest of their credit portfolio (non-granular borrowers). We define non-granular
borrowers as firms whose loan share is below a certain threshold (such as the 50%th or the
25%th percentile) of the loan share distribution. In response to negative shocks due to gran-
ular clients, the bank may have to scale back their relationship with non-granular borrowers,
alter the pricing of the loans or both.
    We run the following regressions on yearly changes:

                                                                ^ i,t + i,j,t
                                  yi,j,t = i + j,t,s(j),z(j) +  u                               (9)

where u  ^ i,t is the fitted value from the "first-stage" regression of the endogenous bank level
shock ¯i,t on the granular instrument GIVi,t , j,t,s(j),z(j) is a firm x year x industry x county
fixed effect and i is a bank fixed effect. yi,j,t is either loan volumes or interest flows. The
regression is run either on firms with a loan share below the 50th or 25th percentile of the
loan share distribution.
    After investigating loan-level responses, we aggregate our data to the firm level and test
whether there are any spillover effects from granular credit shocks to firm balance sheet
aggregates such as investment or cash balances. We also look at the impact of granular
credit risk on firm bankruptcies, contemporaneously or with a lag. We run the following
firm-level regressions:
                                 yj,t = s,z,t +  u  ^ j,t + j,t                           (10)

with similar notations as above. yj,t are now firm level outcomes such as (changes in)
capital, sales, wage bill, cash as well as probability of bankruptcy (in levels). Essentially, in
these spillover regressions the bank × year series of GIV-instrumented firm shocks is treated
as a typical liquidity shock to the intermediaries' balance sheet, which is then passed on to
the rest of the economy as a supply-side disturbance. The difference between our paper
and the rest of the literature is that the origin of this bank-side liquidity risk is (uninsurable)
idiosyncratic risk from large, granular borrowers17 .




  17 We   test the insurability of granular credit risk in Section 4.3.

Notes: This table reports results from the regression of loan-level returns on loans on idiosyncratic firm shocks.
The exact specification is described by Equation 2. Columns (1)-(2) are based on firm shocks from specifications
where (log) value-added is regressed only on a set of firm and county×industry×year×loan type fixed effects.
Columns (3)-(5) are based on firm shock specifications that include additional controls: total assets, wages,
leverage, liquidity, credit rating, age, and age squared. The firm shock variable is normalized by its standard
deviation. For example, 0.334 should be interpreted as an increase in the return on loans of 33.4 basis points
in response to a 1 standard deviation idiosyncratic firm shock. Loan types include regular and credit-line
loans. Counties are 19 administrative areas (fylke) in Norway. Industries are 99 2-digit sectors. Standard
errors (in parentheses) are double clustered at the firm-year level and corrected for the estimated regressor
bias with bootstrapping. The last two rows report the unconditional sample mean and standard deviation of
the dependent variable.




4     Main Empirical Results
    We investigate how idiosyncratic firm value-added shocks affect loan returns in section
4.1. In section 4.2, we aggregate idiosyncratic firm shocks to the bank level, and see whether
the effect is still significant despite portfolio-level risk pooling. In section 4.3 we ask whether
granular credit risk goes unhedged at the bank level. In section 4.4, we investigate potential
spillover effects from granular credit risk onto other firms and their real economic conse-
quences.


4.1    Loan Outcomes
    Table 2 presents the effect of idiosyncratic firm shocks on loan returns obtained from es-
timating Equation 2. Idiosyncratic firm shocks have a large and significant (at the 1% level)
effect on loan-level returns. In columns (1)-(2) we proxy the firm shock by the residual of
firm value-added variation after controlling for fixed effects only (as in di Giovanni et al.

(2014)).18 In columns (3)-(5) the shock is measured by the residual obtained from estimating
(1) and controlling for different combinations of fixed effects to purge out potential con-
founding factors. Our preferred specification is reported in column (5). Here, the firm shock
captures fluctuations in firm value-added which are purged from fixed effects and orthog-
onal to a set of time-varying firm factors including leverage, liquidity, size, age, and credit
rating. Firm shocks are standardized so the interpretation of the regression coefficients in
the table is the following: a 1-standard-deviation firm shock affects returns by 36.1 basis
points as in column (5). In words, when comparing a bank's loan return across firms within
the same year, industry, county, and through the same loan facility, a 1 standard deviation
reduction in firm performance reduces loan returns by roughly a third of a percentage point.
    Figure 4 reports loan outcome estimates at different horizons: we regress loan returns
on leads and lags (in years) around the firm shock ("event" at date 0) and plot the dynamic
of the interval estimates over time. First, we observe that there is no effect for years prior
to the shock, which points at the absence of any pre-trends. Second, the impact of idiosyn-

                                                                           19
cratic firm shocks on loan outcomes is felt for a long time: at least for 3 years on average.
We interpret this result through the lens of relationship-based lending. Termination of a
credit relationship is costly, for either side, because of the presence of asymmetric informa-
tion in credit markets. Even if a bad idiosyncratic outcome reveals new information about
the borrower's "type", ex-post monitoring of the repeated borrower may still be a more
cost-effective alternative than forming a new relationship (Williamson, 1987). Lenders may
understand and internalize the adverse selection problem in the market for switching bor-
rowers (Sharpe, 1990). Finally, the cost of asymmetric information may be bigger for smaller
firms, which are also potentially more likely to experience a negative idiosyncratic shock and
have more to gain from sticking to the original lender (Chodorow-Reich, 2014). In equilib-
rium, the lender agrees that the borrower postpones a fraction of the loan repayment to the
future period. Our extensive margin analysis will later reveal that it is indeed the intensive
margin, i.e. temporary non-performance and payment delay, which drives our loan-level
results, and not necessarily firm exit.


4.2   Granular Credit Risk: Bank Outcomes
    The finding that firm-level idiosyncratic shocks impact loan returns merely reflects the
fact that individual loans are inherently risky investments. There is no margin of adjustment
for the bank to insure against loan-level bad outcomes. The natural next question is whether
these idiosyncratic shocks average out at the level of bank portfolios. In other words, can/do
banks take advantage of risk pooling and diversify idiosyncratic firm risk away? To answer
this question we proceed by estimating the relationship in (7). Results are reported in Table
3, where we have normalized the bank shock by its standard deviation.

Notes: This table reports results from regressing bank-level return on loans on bank-level aggregated firm
shocks ¯i,t . Columns (1)-(2) are standard OLS on Equation 3, while columns (3)-(8) instrument the aggregated
shock by the granular IV as in Equation 7. The GIV is constructed following Equation 6. Positive (negative)
shocks specifications include only observations in which the bank shock ¯i,t is above (below) zero. Bank con-
trols include lagged total assets, leverage, liquidity, number of loans, deposit to assets ratio and financial assets
to assets ratio. The last two rows report the unconditional sample mean and standard deviation of the depen-
dent variable. The F-stat is the Kleibergen-Paap rk Wald F statistic for the test of weak identification. J-stat is
the Hansen's J-statistic for the instrument overidentification test. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered
at the bank level and corrected for the estimated regressor bias with bootstrapping.



    We report two sets of specifications: with and without the granular instrumental variable
(GIV). In the first two columns (OLS estimates) we find that even at the level of banks'
portfolios, idiosyncratic credit risk is associated with large and significant effects on bank
returns. To address potential endogeneity concerns, columns (3)-(8) report results from the
IV regression19 . Our results show that a one standard deviation GIV-instrumented firm
shock, on average, affects bank loan portfolio returns by 11-12bps. We have specifications
with and without additional bank controls which include lagged values of bank leverage,
liquidity, total assets, number of loans, deposit-to-asset ratio, and financial assets to total



   19 Formal statistical diagnostic tests show validity for the GIV as a good instrument.

is above the Stock and Yogo (2005) criterion for 5% maximal relative bias. The Hansen J-statistic cannot reject
the null hypothesis of the instrument being exogenous.

Notes: This figure plots results in the form of an event study where we regress bank-level returns on leads
and lags of the bank-level aggregated firm shock ¯i,t instrumented by the granular IV. Specifications are based
on Equation 7. The GIV is constructed following Equation 6. The left panel includes all shocks, and the right
panel includes negative shocks only (¯i,t < 0). Coefficients are plotted by horizon (in years) of the dependent
variable. Dashed lines are 95% confidence bands.



asset ratio20 . The results are qualitatively and quantitatively robust to the exclusion of these
controls21 . In Figure 5 we report bank loan outcomes by horizon. We find that the impact
of GIV-instrumented firm shocks on bank RoA lasts for up to 1 year, i.e. a shock at t has a
significant effect on returns even at t+1. In addition, the effects of lags are not significant
implying the absence of any pre-trends.




  20 The   GIV approach theoretically does not require to include any further bank-time controls. The reason
is that GIV is by construction purged from any common bank-time factors. For robustness, we still include
bank controls. Interestingly, results do not change in any substantial matter, which further adds validity to the
method.
    21 Bank-level return on corporate loans is the main dependent variable in this section. We have also exper-
imented with loan writedowns and portfolio-level Sharpe ratios. Table 4 reports the results. We find some
evidence that granular credit risk is weakly associated with both with the expected sign when we use the GIV
instrument.

Notes: This table reports results from regressing bank-level (log) loan writedowns and the Sharpe ratio on
bank-level aggregated firm shocks ¯i,t . Columns (1) and (3) are OLS on Equation 3, while in columns (2)
and (4) the aggregated shocks are instrumented by the granular IV as in Equation 7. The GIV is constructed
following Equation 6. Bank controls include lagged bank total assets, leverage, liquidity, number of loans,
deposit to assets ratio and financial assets to assets ratio. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the
bank level.



    A second set of results is related to the asymmetric effects of granular firm risk. In
columns (4)-(5) and (7)-(8) of Table 3 we explore positive- and negative-only firm shocks
with and without bank controls. Specifically, we condition on the endogenous covariate ¯i,t
in Equation 3 being positive or negative only, and instrument it by the GIV. Only negative
shocks have a significant impact on bank returns. The impact of positive shocks is not sta-
tistically significantly different from zero. A one standard deviation negative granular firm
shock lowers bank returns by up to 19.4bps, which is much larger than the average effect
and amounts to roughly 15% percent of the standard deviation of banks' portfolio returns.
Due to the payoff structure of the debt contract this very concave relationship is not surpris-
ing. Because of debt contracts, banks find it difficult to extract higher dividends from firms
that are performing well, while at the same time remaining exposed to potential downside
risk from firms that perform poorly. In case of a negative shock, the firm's loan may become
nonperforming, the firm may default on the obligation, or exit the industry altogether22 .
    Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the concave relationship. The figure depicts
the (binned) scatter plot of the impact of GIV-instrumented firm shocks on banks' returns
on loans (RoA). Blue circles (red squares) represent positive and negative shocks, respec-

Notes: This figure visualises the relationship between residualized bank-level return on loans and residual-
ized instrumented bank-level aggregated firm shocks. The red squares (blue circles) are binned scatterplots
conditional on negative (positive) values of the weighted firm shock ¯i,t . The shock variable is normalized by
its standard deviation. We construct the conditional binned scatterplot in three steps, and each step is per-
formed separately on positive and negative values of ¯i,t . First, we residualize bank-level returns on loans and
instrumented firm shocks. The instrumented shocks represent fitted values from regressing ¯i,t on the GIV. The
residualized return and shock values are obtained from regressing each variable on bank and time fixed effects,
computing the residual, and adding back the mean of each variable. Second, we construct 50 equally-sized bins
based on the residualized shock. Third, we plot the mean residual bank return within each bin versus the bin's
mean residual shock. The red (blue) line represents the linear fit from regressing the bank-level loan return on
the instrumented shock, conditional on ¯i,t < 0(> 0).



tively. We construct the binned scatter plots by first regressing both bank RoA and the GIV-
instrumented firm shocks on bank and time FE, computing the residuals, and adding back
the mean of each variable. We then construct 50 equally-sized bins of the residual shock
variable. Figure 6 plots the mean residual bank RoA within each bin versus the bin's mean
residual shock. Finally, we overlay the linear fits for the respective specifications. The asym-
metry of the result is rather striking: the line of best fit for positive shocks is flat, while
the slope for negative shocks is downward-sloping and highly significant. The bins are all
equally-sized, so each dot represents 10+ underlying bank × time observations. Our results
are thus not driven by any individual outliers. We interpret the concave relationship as a
validation that our measure of firm shocks is indeed economically informative.

Notes: This table reports results from regressing bank-level year-on-year growth rate in non-interest income
components on bank-level aggregated firm shocks, instrumented by the granular IV. The top panel presents
results for all shocks, positive or negative. The bottom panel presents results for negative shocks only (¯i,t < 0).
The granular IV is constructed based on Equation 6. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the bank
level. Data on all bank non-interest income is from the financial supervisory database ORBOF.



4.3    Hedging
    We have so far established that idiosyncratic shocks to individual corporate clients affect
bank portfolio returns. However, it is possible that financial intermediaries hedge granular
credit risk with derivatives and other instruments. As a first pass attempt in answering
this question, we collect bank-level data on income from fees, derivatives, equity and bond
holdings, and dividends. We then correlate changes in returns from these sources with our
GIV-instrumented shocks. The conjecture is that in the same state of the world in which
banks are hit with bad idiosyncratic shocks to their loan books, returns are compensated
through alternative departments within the same bank. For example, banks could command
higher fees for late interest payments, hedge negative states with credit derivatives, short
stocks of firms they are also lending to, etc. Table 5 reports the results.
    As can be seen from the table, the data cannot consistently reject the null hypothesis
of little to no insurance against granular credit risk. None of the measures of non-interest


                                                           25
income are significantly associated with our shock measure. If anything, some forms of
income are in fact positively correlated with idiosyncratic credit shocks, which questions their
usefulness as a hedging instrument.
    A drawback of this analysis is that the various hedging instruments analyzed in Table 5
are only observable at the bank level. A more detailed analysis would construct matched
derivatives holdings at the level of individual credit relationships. This would increase the
odds for banks to hedge firm-specific risk, something that we can not plausibly establish by
looking at portfolio-level data. This would be possible only for a very small subset of large
firms that are (a) listed and (b) have a liquid market for credit derivatives such as credit
default swaps (CDS). The mass of such firms is small and the CDS market is not very liquid
in Norway. Regardless, insurability of granular credit risk is an important question, to which
we can give only a partial answer given the data constraints.


4.4   Granular Credit Risk Spillovers: Credit Supply and Firm Outcomes
    The previous sections have documented that granular credit risk has quantitatively im-
portant effects on bank portfolio outcomes, and that this risk is unhedged. In this section,
we ask whether banks hedge these shocks "ex-post", i.e. by passing it on to the rest of their
corporate portfolio. We are interested to see whether banks react by reducing loan supply
or raising interest rates, in particular for non-granular firms.
    Table 6 reports our results on the supply of credit. Our approach follows closely Khwaja
and Mian (2008). In all specifications we impose a stringent configuration of interacted firm
× year × industry × county fixed effects. Our specifications regress year-on-year changes
in the granular credit shock on year-on-year changes in loan-level credit supply. In columns
(1)-(2), we look at the impact of bank-level granular credit shocks - either instrumented or
not - on all firms and find no significant relationship. In columns (3)-(4) we restrict the
sample to non-granular firms only. Non-granular firms are defined as those whose bank
loan shares are below the 50th (column (3)) or 25th (column (4)) percentiles of the loan share
distribution. For example, the median loan share is 0.000211 percent across all loans. We do
find a statistically significant relationship in this case, particularly when the threshold for
non-granular firms is the 25th percentile. In columns (5)-(6) we add a bank fixed effect to
the baseline specification and results do not change substantially. Overall, a one-standard
deviation decline in the granular credit shock reduces loan supply growth to non-granular
borrowers by up to 71 basis points. This effect is strongly significant. These results are
suggestive of a "pecking order" of credit relationships where banks keep credit relationships
with their main clients unchanged but adjust lending conditions with their non-granular

borrowers in order to compensate for portfolio losses.
    In Table 7 we repeat the same exercise but with interest flow as the left-hand-side vari-
able. We find a strong negative relationship between year-on-year changes in granular credit
risk and yearly growth in loan-level interest flows. We interpret these changes in flows as
an effect on the loan interest rate. A one-standard deviation decline in the granular credit
shock increases interest rate growth on loans to non-granular clients by up to 63.4 basis
points. Taken together with the positive association with credit quantities, we have identi-
fied granular credit risk as a textbook supply-side disturbance: a negative granular credit
shock results in a leftward shift in the supply schedule, leading to a reduction in quantities
and elevation in credit market prices. In addition, the pass-through mechanism can also be
interpreted as operating through a kind of bank credit supply network: two firms that may
otherwise not be connected can impact each other's performance through their association
with a common lender23 .




   23 We control for firm county and industry fixed effects as well as the bank fixed effects. We cannot fully
rule out, however, that these firms are not also associated through a production network as we do not have the
data on firm linkages to test that hypothesis.

Notes: This table reports results from regressing year-on-year changes in (log) interest flows at the bank-
firm level on the year-on-year change in bank-level aggregated firm shocks, which are either instrumented by
the granular IV (columns (2)-(6)) or not (column (1)). Specifications are based on Equation 9. The granular
instrument is constructed based on Equation 6. Columns (1)-(2) includes all firms. Columns (3)-(6) include
only non-granular firms. Non-granular firms are defined as firms whose bank loan shares are less than the 50th
(columns (3)-(4)) or the 25th (columns (5)-(6)) percentiles of the loan share distribution, which is pooled over
all banks and years. The full distribution of loan shares is plotted on Figure 1. Standard errors (in parentheses)
are double clustered at the bank and firm level.



    Next, we ask whether the impact on non-granular firms ultimately leads to significant
economic consequences. We aggregate our data to the firm level and consider several firm
outcomes as dependent variables. Those include growth in sales, the wage bill, capital and
the cash position. In all of the specifications, we include year × industry × credit rating,
as well as firm and bank fixed effects. In addition, we focus on the sample of non-granular
firms where non-granular firms are defined as those whose bank loan shares are below the
50th or 25th percentile of the global distribution of loan shares. In other words, we trace out
the economic consequences of a credit supply shock on the same non-granular firms that we
show were impacted in Tables 6 and 7. Results are reported in Table 8.

Notes: This table reports results from firm-level regressions where the outcome variable is either firm-level
year-on-year change in log(capital), log(sales), log(wage bill), or log(cash). The control variable is the year-on-
year change in bank-level aggregated firm shocks which are instrumented by the granular IV. Specifications
are based on Equation 10. The granular instrument is constructed based on Equation 6. Non-granular firms are
defined as firms whose bank loan shares are less than the 50th or 25th percentile of the loan share distribution.
For firms with multiple banking relationships, we define a firm as non-granular if the largest loan share of that
firm across all credit relationships is less than the 50th or the 25th percentile of the loan share distribution. For
these firms, the bank shock is computed as the average across all lending relationships. The full distribution
of loan shares is plotted on Figure 1. All specifications include interacted year x industry x county fixed effects
and firm fixed effects. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the firm level.



    The most notable results are columns (2)-(3), where we document that a change in the
granular credit shock at the bank level is positively associated with capital growth at the
firm level for non-granular borrowers. This suggests that a one-standard deviation negative
credit supply shock causes a decline in firms fixed capital investment growth by roughly
13-24 basis points. The impact on non-granular firms defined by the median loan share cut-
off is strongly statistically significant. This result has immediate implications for the real
macroeconomy. We also considered outcomes such as sales, the wage bill and the firms cash
position. For these variables our coefficient estimates are imprecise, and in all of these cases
we are unable to reject the null hypothesis.
    Even if non-granular firms have relatively low loan shares, they constitute an important
fraction of the economy. Specifically, non-granular firms that are defined by the median
loan share cutoff account for at least 15% of total aggregate capital in the sample in any
given year. Granular credit shocks therefore affect a sizable fraction of aggregate capital

Notes: This table reports results from firm probit regressions of likelihood of firm bankruptcy on the bank-
level granular credit shock. In columns (1)-(7), the outcome variable is probability of contemporaneous firm
bankruptcy. In column (8), the outcome variable is the probability that a firm ever goes bankrupt. In columns
(1)-(3), the control variable is the contemporaneous mean (change in the) bank-level credit shock which is
instrumented by the granular IV. In columns (4)-(7), the RHS variable is the GIV-instrumented bank-level
credit shock lagged by either one or three years. Columns (1) and (4) are for all firms in sample. Remaining
columns restrict the sample to non-granular firms only. Non-granular firms are defined as firms whose bank
loan shares are less than the 50th or the 25th percentiles of the loan share distribution, which is pooled over all
banks and years. For firms with multiple banking relationships, we define a firm as non-granular if the largest
loan share of that firm across all credit relationships is less than the 50th or the 25th percentile of the loan
share distribution. For these firms, the bank shock is computed as the average across all lending relationships.
The full distribution of loan shares is plotted on Figure 1. Standard errors in parentheses. Firm bankruptcy
information is from the credit rating agency Bisnode.



via credit spillovers. It is also important to emphasize that our estimates constitute a lower
bound - we can not rule out further second- and third-order spillover effects to granular
clients as well. Granular credit risk can therefore potentially affect an even larger fraction of
aggregate investment through the broader credit supply network as well as through general
equilibrium effects.
    Finally, we investigate whether the reduction in credit not only affects firm balance sheet
outcomes but ultimately firm default. We ask whether a change in the granular credit shock
at the bank level is associated with a higher frequency of bankruptcies at the firm level. Table
9 reports the results from our baseline probit regressions. In column (1), we include all firms
in the estimation sample. In column (2), we restrict the sample to non-granular firms only,
with the threshold being the 50th percentile of the loan share distribution. For both specifi-
cations we find a strong negative association. For columns (4)-(6) and (7) we trace out the

impact of granular credit shocks in t-1 and t-3, respectively, on the probability of bankruptcy
at t. In columns (3) and (6) we run the same regressions but restricting the sample to firms
with a loan share below the 25th percentile of the distribution. Finally, in column (8) we
regress the probability of a firm filing for bankruptcy at any point over its existence in our
dataset on its average granular credit shock. That is, we ask if firms that ever default also ex-
perience, on average, worse granular credit supply shocks from their lenders. Overall, across
all 8 specifications, we find a very strong negative association between granular credit risk
and firm bankruptcy probability. The impact is quantitatively very large - a one-standard
deviation negative granular credit supply shock increases the likelihood of bankruptcy by
roughly 32-60 basis points for all firms, and 68-127 basis points for non-granular borrow-
ers. Additionally, we do find that firms that went bankrupt at some point in the sample are
also those that experienced abnormally bad granular credit supply shocks. Our results have
direct implications for the aggregate economy and consumer welfare, considering that firm
bankruptcy proceedings are very costly in practice.
    We conclude this section by reiterating our main findings. First, idiosyncratic firm shocks
have a large, long-lasting and significant effect on loan-level returns. Second, these shocks
survive portfolio aggregation and impact bank-level outcomes. Importantly, these shocks
originate from granular, i.e. large, borrowers which is precisely the reason why they do
not wash out. Third, banks do not hedge granular credit risk with income from non-loan
businesses such as derivatives or equity investments. Fourth, there are considerable loan-
level spillovers of granular credit shocks on non-granular borrowers: affected banks reduce
loan supply and increase interest rates on their less important, non-granular clients. Fifth,
those affected clients in turn reduce their investment in physical capital and are much more
likely to file for bankruptcy. Overall, our results show that idiosyncratic shocks to granu-
lar borrowers have important implications for the broader financial and real economy. In
the language of financial regulators, single-name credit concentration risk is quantitatively
important.


5    Heterogeneity and Robustness
   In this section, we first provide further evidence on the underlying mechanisms behind
our findings. In 5.1 we focus on whether certain firms are more likely to transmit idiosyn-
cratic firm performance shock to their banks, and in 5.2 whether certain banks are more
exposed to granular credit risk. In 5.3 we conduct several important robustness checks.




                                               31
5.1   Firm Heterogeneity
Loan Outcomes - Balance Sheet Heterogeneity We start by exploring heterogeneous ef-
fects of idiosyncratic firm shocks originating from firms with different characteristics. Specif-
ically, we interact extracted shocks obtained from specification (2) with lagged firm charac-
teristics. We are interested in how the transmission mechanism differs for firms with high
leverage, low asset size, low equity, short average debt duration, high bank credit reliance,
low credit rating, and young age. Each characteristic is thus a dummy which equals 1 for
firms in that particular category of interest.
    Figure A.1 in the Appendix illustrates the results. There is overall rich firm heterogeneity
behind our loan-level outcomes. The pass-through of idiosyncratic firm shocks is particu-
larly strong for firms with high leverage, low assets, short debt duration, high reliance on
bank debt, lower-than-"A" credit ratings, and firms younger than 3 years. All these firms,
relative to the average firm, are more likely to be more "risky" from the bank's perspec-
tive. Interestingly, we find that interactions with firm size and debt duration are statistically
different from other characteristics. For macro-prudential purposes, these results offer a
new dimension for regulation of concentration risk: banks which are heavily exposed to, for
example, small, risky, young firms are at much greater risk of suffering from detrimental id-
iosyncratic credit shocks than intermediaries that lend to liquid and non-levered corporates.

Loan Outcomes - Extensive Margin Are our loan-level results driven by the intensive or
the extensive margin? We are interested in seeing whether the transmission of idiosyncratic
firm shocks is different among firms that enter/exit the industry or go bankrupt. Our strat-
egy is to construct a dummy variable for each of the three groups of firms. For entrants,
the dummy takes the value of unity in the year following the entry, while for leavers and
bankrupt firms the variable equals unity in the year prior to the event. We also consider an
"ever-bankrupt" dummy which takes the value of unity for firms that filed for bankruptcy
at any point during the 2003-2015 period. The latter variable captures potentially some un-
observed intangible characteristics such as poor management skills, which are common for
unsuccessful firms but cannot credibly be inferred from balance sheet information.
    Table A.1 in the Appendix reports the results. We see that the shock transmission mech-
anism is stronger (weaker) among firms which have just entered (about to exit) the industry.
We do not find that the channel is stronger among firms which go bankrupt. Overall, the
extensive margin is active but does not dominate our results. In other words, even condi-
tional on firms being non-entrants, non-leavers, and not in bankruptcy, negative idiosyn-
cratic shocks can cause lower bank returns. That implies that our results are driven mostly


                                               32
by the intensive margin.

Loan Outcomes - Ownership and Industry Heterogeneity Next, we investigate whether
our results are driven by firms with a particular ownership structure or industry affilia-
tion. For example, is the shock transmission stronger among special financial vehicles or
construction firms? In Appendix Table A.2 we report firm ownership heterogeneity results,
along with our baseline estimates. We see clearly that our results reflect conventional pri-
vately owned firms and not state, community, or special financial vehicles. Privately owned
firms dominate our sample by a wide margin.
    Table A.3 explores heterogeneous effects by firm sector. Our baseline estimates are almost
identical to results from manufacturing firms. Overall, there doesn't appear to be any abnor-
mality across different industries; the real estate sector is the only one where pass-through
appears to be smaller.

Loan Outcomes - Geographical Heterogeneity Are our loan-level results driven by id-
iosyncratic shocks to firms located in particular geographical regions of Norway? Figure
A.2 in the Appendix plots a coloured map of Norway, where each of the 19 counties is col-
ored with a different shade of blue. Darker regions represent a higher local pass-through
coefficient of idiosyncratic firm shocks onto loan-level returns. Recall that our baseline av-
erage pass-through estimate at the loan level is 0.361. Based on the map we document two
main results. First, there is interesting cross-regional heterogeneity in the estimates that is
potentially worth exploring in future research. Second, this heterogeneity is not too drastic:
county-wide averages are in the [0.19,0.44] range24 . Finally, we see that our result is not
driven solely by Oslo and neighboring counties but is in fact present throughout the coun-
try. We therefore conclude that our results are likely not driven by some unusual regional
clustering of correlated idiosyncratic shocks.


5.2    Bank Heterogeneity
   In this section, we explore whether different banks - conditional on the realization of the
granular credit shock - are affected differentially. Our main focus is understanding whether
portfolio concentration as a factor is important for the transmission of idiosyncratic firm
shocks, or whether this factor can be absorbed by bank size (total assets) or the number
of credit relationships that the bank has. Intuitively, idiosyncratic borrower shocks may
impact only banks that are small in size or have a small number of loans: in both cases the
  24 The exception is the northernmost county, Finnmark, where we find a point estimate of -0.10. However,
this county is also the least populated area of Norway.

                                                   33
bank's margin of adjustment in response to borrower shocks is relatively weaker25 . Hence
we explore whether the relationship between granular credit shocks and bank outcomes
varies by bank size, the number of loans, or the loan portfolio Herfindahl index (HHI) - a
commonly used measure of concentration.
    In Appendix Tables A.4 and A.5 we focus sequentially on the role of the number of loans
and bank size (total assets) in the transmission of granular credit shocks. In Table A.4, we
find that idiosyncratic firm shocks affect portfolios regardless of the number of loans. In
line with theory, point estimates for portfolios with few loans or with high concentration
levels are relatively larger. Interestingly, in column (1) we find that the pass-through for
banks with a large number of loans is still statistically significant. This result suggests that
granular credit risk is not merely a "small N" problem. In column (2) we find that portfolios
that are more concentrated, as measured by the loan HHI, are more susceptible to granular
credit shocks. This observation is consistent with the granular hypothesis. In Table A.5,
column (1), we find that the pass-through is strong for small banks with a limited impact on
large institutions.
    To conclude, we have shown that idiosyncratic borrower shocks have a stronger impact
when bank portfolios are more concentrated. Consistent with existing theories, we do find
stronger effects for banks that are small or have few loans. Granular credit risk does not
appear to be absorbed by the number of credit relationships: the pass-trough is strong for
banks with few or many loans. The impact is, however, muted for institutions with high
total assets.


5.3    Robustness Checks
    In this section, we provide several additional robustness checks. We show that our results
are robust to excluding the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). We check that idiosyncratic firm
shocks have a pairwise correlation of approximately zero. Finally, we conduct two placebo
tests at various levels of aggregation to lend further support to our baseline results.

Robustness to GFC In order to investigate whether the relationship between granular
credit risk and loan/bank outcomes is robust to the Great Financial Crisis, we redo our es-
timation focusing on years before or after the GFC. Appendix Table A.6 reports results. We
highlight three main observations. First, our results do not vanish for either of the two sub-

  25 Theoretically  we expect that as the number of loans in the portfolio falls, loan-specific shocks begin to
matter more at the bank level. Furthermore, the literature has distinguished between small and large banks
in terms of their capacity to transmit and withstand exogenous shocks (Davila and Walther, 2020; Stavrakeva,
2019)

                                                      34
periods. Second, this is true for both loan-level and bank-level estimations. Third, estimates
are slightly noisier for the pre-GFC period, although still statistically significant.

Pairwise Correlations Test An important question that must be addressed is potential
piece-wise correlation of our idiosyncratic firm shocks. Systematic residual correlation
across firms may indicate that our shocks are still driven by common factors, which would
invalidate our conjecture that fluctuations are truly idiosyncratic. For example, we could be
capturing some unobserved network effects such as the ones induced by firm trade credit
relationships. To test this, we compute pairwise correlation coefficients across any two pairs
of firms in our sample. Appendix Figure A.3 presents the result. In total we have 1,794,321
pairs across a balanced panel of firms over 2003-2015. The average piecewise correlation is
0.019 and the standard deviation is 0.342. This implies that the average correlation coeffi-
cient can not be statistically distinguished from zero. This provides reassuring evidence in
support of our idiosyncratic firm shocks being truly idiosyncratic and not being driven by
unobserved factors that induce cross-sectional correlation, such as production networks.

Placebo Regressions To ensure that we do not falsely reject the null hypothesis due to
potentially serially correlated error-terms, we follow Chetty et al. (2009) and implement a
nonparametric permutation test for whether the true effect of idiosyncratic firm shocks on
loan returns is zero. In order to do so, we randomly reassign the estimated firm-level shocks
and redo the analysis at the loan and bank levels. Placebo Monte-Carlo permutations results
are reported in Appendix Table A.7. We find that we can reject the null hypothesis of no
association (at the 1% level) under this non-parametric distribution. In words, it's highly
unlikely that our results are due to random chance. Furthermore, at the level of the bank, we
confirm that our finding of strong asymmetric effects is not coincidental since the permuted
positive-only shock estimate has a p-value of 68% while the negative-only shock estimate
has a p-value of 0.008.
   Further, to illustrate how our idiosyncratic shocks pick up economically meaningful in-
formation, we run a series of placebo regressions where firm shocks are randomly drawn
from a uniform distribution instead of being extracted from the economic specification 1.
The results from using these drawn shocks at the loan- and bank-level are reported in Ap-
pendix Table A.8. Across all specifications and levels of aggregation we find no association
between the random shocks and loan returns.

Fitting an Fixed Effects Model with AR(1) Disturbance We run our firm shocks through
an autoregressive linear model of order 1 in order to establish whether shocks are persis-


                                             35
tent or not. We also want to facilitate future structural analysis of models with a financial
sector that is subject to "idiosyncratic granular borrower risk". Specifically, we fit the full
cross-section of firm shocks into a linear fixed effects model with an AR(1) disturbance term.
Results are reported in Appendix Table A.9. Parameters of the process - autoregressive coef-
ficient and the standard deviation of the error term - are reported for all levels of aggregation.
Overall, we find that the idiosyncratic firm shock is volatile (standard deviation of roughly
0.2) and not persistent at all (auregressive coefficient of roughly 0.12-0.32). A volatile iid
process is likely to approximate granular credit risk rather well.


6     Discussion
   In this section, we discuss several issues relevant for our empirical analysis. First, we
discuss the literature on firm and bank credit networks and its implications for our results
and methodology. Second, we discuss the origins of large exposures.


6.1   Network Effects
    A vibrant new literature emphasizes the role of bank and firm credit networks in the
amplification and propagation of non-systematic shocks. One stream of the literature shows
that bank credit supply shocks propagate along firm production networks, causing sizable
real economic effects (Huremovic et al., 2020; Dewachter et al., 2020). We relate to this lit-
erature in two ways. First, in our analysis of economic spillovers, we essentially identify a
credit supply network: there exists a pass-through mechanism for idiosyncratic borrower risk
between two potentially unrelated firms that are "connected" via the balance sheet of their
common lender. Second, a negative granular credit shock, passed onto non-granular bor-
rowers via higher rates or lower quantities of credit, is a leftward shift of the credit supply
curve and maps into the bank credit supply shocks in Huremovic et al. (2020) and Dewachter
et al. (2020). We establish the first-degree direct effect of these shocks on firm performance
and bankruptcy rates. However, because we do not observe the Norwegian input-output or
firm trade-credit network, we can not speak of higher-degree effects from these networks.
Thus, our analysis of economic spillovers of granular credit shocks in Section 4.4 establishes
a lower bound on the total pass-through to the real economy.
    Another stream of the literature such as Elliott et al. (2020) has recently shown that when
banks are individually exposed to the same set of firm industries, idiosyncratic industry-
specific risk gets amplified as opposed to getting mitigated by wholesale interbank trading
markets. More broadly, mismeasured idiosyncratic firm disturbances could actually mas-


                                               36
querade some unobserved/unmeasured borrower-side network-level risk. In the first stage
of our analysis, it is possible that our measure of firm value-added shocks is in fact some
kind of common local production network risk. This problem is mitigated considerably
by the following three factors. First, when extracting firm value-added shocks, we impose a
stringent combination of industry, location, and time fixed effects. Any unobserved network
factor would have therefore to operate within the same year, industry, and county. Obser-
vations are sufficiently dispersed across geographical regions, with four out of 19 counties
having more than 100,000 loan × year observations and the average being just over 50,000.
In addition, our industry identifiers are very granular with only 3 out of the 99 two-digit
industries having more than 100,000 loan × year observations. Second, we plotted in Figure
A.3 the pairwise cross-sectional correlation of firm shocks and found no indication of com-
mon shocks. Third, the presence of local production network effects would not invalidate
our GIV approach. As long as the sequence of idisoyncratic shocks is unrelated to bank-side
factors, our exogeneity assumption in equation (8) holds regardless of whether the firm-
level shocks truly are firm-level or composite outcomes of very local network structures.
The question of networks is therefore a matter of composition, not of identification.


6.2   Origins of Large Exposures
    Credit concentration is an equilibrium object that is an outcome of more fundamental
factors such as monitoring technology, risk preferences, information structure and expecta-
tions. Although writing down a micro-founded model of banking concentration is beyond
the scope of this paper, discussing theoretical causes of concentration is useful for at least
two reasons. First, the orthogonality of loan shares to idiosyncratic firm shocks is a key com-
ponent of our empirical strategy, as highlighted in equation (8). Second, our paper is related
to a large literature on the trade-off between risk concentration and economic performance
and any normative implication would have to take into account the underlying causes of
concentration.
    One reason for the large degree of credit concentration observed in our data is home bias.
Juelsrud and Wold (2020) document a substantial degree of within-county bias in the Nor-
wegian banking system (see Figure A.4). Using loan-level data, Juelsrud and Wold (2020)
show that over 2003-2015 the average proportion of bank credit to firms that are headquar-
tered in the same region as the lender was 55%. This compares to a random-assignment
counterfactual of less than 10%, implying a home bias of 45%. Home bias is, of course, a
perennial stylized fact in international finance, banking, and macroeconomics (Coeurdacier
and Rey, 2013).


                                              37
  In what follows, we highlight three potential causes of portfolio concentration: asym-
metric information, behavioral biases and the distribution of firm sizes. Asymmetric infor-
mation and behavioral biases are also potential factors behind home bias in portfolios.

Asymmetric Information. Concentrated lending could be a by-product of persistent credit
relationships. When information acquisition on new clients is costly, lenders may find it
optimal to do business with a recurring set of borrowers, for instance by increasing the
number of new commitments per relationship such as offering additional fixed-term loans
or extending new credit lines (Sufi, 2007). Along the intensive margin, an increase in the
exposure of an informed lender signals a higher quality of the underlying borrower, thereby
reducing the cost of asymmetric information (Leland and Pyle, 1977). Van Nieuwerburgh
and Veldkamp (2009) show in a rational inattention framework that investors may choose to
learn only about assets for which they had an information advantage to start with (such as
home assets), thus amplifying initial information asymmetries.
    Ivashina (2009) proposes and tests a theory where the price of a loan is determined by a
trade-off between diversification and asymmetric information. If a bank raises its exposure
to a single borrower, two effects take place. First, the lender demands a higher premium for
being more exposed to borrower-specific idiosyncratic risk. Second, assuming that expendi-
tures on monitoring scale with exposure, concentration also reduces information asymmetry
between the lender and the borrower, thus reducing the premium. In equilibrium, the price
of the contract depends on the degree of information asymmetry and the magnitude of id-
iosyncratic fluctuations.
    In our data, we observe a substantial degree of credit concentration. This is true at all
levels of aggregation: single name, geographical, sectoral. In light of Ivashina (2009), this
may suggest that Norwegian lenders attach large benefits to information acquisition. This is
intuitive, given that the majority of firms in our data are not publically listed and are instead
locally-focused small enterprises. Information collection and monitoring is therefore costly,
and potentially increases with distance. This could explain both the regional home bias
and the single name credit concentration facts. Banks' portfolio-level (over-)exposure to
single borrowers solves the structural asymmetric information problem, but at the cost of
an elevated vulnerability towards idiosyncratic shocks. Sensitivity to a given distribution
of idiosyncratic borrower shocks (the loan share distribution si,j,t ) can be explained by the
banks' decision to invest in localized information acquisition, which is in turn driven by pre-
determined factors such as the returns to information acquisition. This class of explanations
validates our empirical approach.



                                               38
Behavioral Biases. A second theory that could rationalize credit concentration rests on be-
havioral biases and overconfidence26 . Huberman (2015) shows that some investors tend to
ignore portfolio theory and invest in familar assets. In recent work, Bordalo et al. (2018) de-
velop a theory of "diagnostic expectations" and apply it to canonical macroeconomic models
of credit cycles. In their theory, agents persistently overweight future outcomes that have
become more likely given recent data. Investors in this framework would make predictable
forecast errors and could be "over-" or "underconfident" relative to the rational expectations
benchmark.
    The diagnostics expectations theory could potentially explain why lenders engage in
excessive, unhedged credit concentration. Having established a credit relationship with a
client that a bank trusts, the bank "specializes" in that client conditional on having exu-
berantly positive expectations about for instance the bank's own ability to pick superior
portfolios and generate above-average returns based on own skill. Conditional on this ex-
pectations formation mechanism, the bank therefore "rationally" ignores the considerable
downside risk of the strategy, i.e. the concentration risk. Our exogeneity assumption (8) is
valid under diagnostics expectations at the bank-level. In that case, overexposure of bank i
in firm j at time t is largely independent of the firm's present characteristics but is instead a
function of i's subjective beliefs. Thus, behavioural biases of this kind would also be com-
patible with our empirical approach.

Distribution of firm sizes. Finally, credit concentration could be a by-product of the un-
derlying firm size distribution also being fat tailed, which is definitely the case for Norway.
Studies by Carvalho and Gabaix (2013) and Carvalho and Grassi (2019), among others, have
shown that the presence of a small number of large firms can explain a substantive percent-
age of aggregate macroeconomic fluctuations. Similarly, Gaubert and Itskhoki (2018) show
that up to 20% of international export intensity can be attributed to granular firms. In the
case of bank lending, if large firms are also large borrowers - a condition which is true in
our data - the Pareto rate of the credit share distribution is driven by the Pareto rate of the
firm size density. While this is a very natural explanation for the observed credit concentra-
tion and the one we pursue below in Section 7, it is worth nothing that in our data we also
observe substantial heterogeneity in portfolio Herfindahl indices across banks, even among
lenders of the same region. Banks do not all hold the same portfolio. Thus, (local) firm size
concentration is not enough to completely explain either the home bias in bank lending or
portfolio concentration. Financial frictions - be it informational, technological, or behavioral

and macroeconomics.

- are important as well.
    For the purpose of the empirical analysis, we note that the three classes of models that
we put forward to explain the origin of credit concentration (asymmetric information, be-
havioural biases, distribution of firm sizes) are all compatible with our empirical approach
and identification strategy.27


7      Theoretical Motivation
    Throughout the paper, we have exploited the stylized fact that the distribution of bank
credit exhibits a fat tail. In this section, we provide one simple possible theoretical rational-
ization for this observation.28 In the data, the right tail of the loan distribution is populated
by a small number of very large loan contracts (as a share of the bank portfolio). These large
loan contracts are almost always underwritten to big firms, a fact which we verify from our
dataset. It is well known that the size distribution of firms is fat-tailed. If firm credit is a func-
tion of firm size, then we can precisely derive how the granularity of the firm distribution
translates into the granularity of credit and affects portfolio-level outcomes.
    A theoretical challenge encountered when formalizing this intuition is the fact that both
firm loan and firm size distributions could potentially have infinite variances. In this particu-
lar case, standard central limit theorems break down. Following Gabaix (2011), we therefore
resort to Lévy's generalized central limit theorems that can accommodate distributions with
fat tails. In this section, we provide sufficient conditions for distributional parameter values
to ensure that - assuming the firm size distribution has a fat tail - the firm credit distribution
also has a fat tail.

A Simple Model of Firm Debt Suppose there are N firms in the economy29 . Before pro-
duction can begin, firms must obtain funding. By assumption, each firm i is cash-strapped
and has to start the period by borrowing Lit from a bank. The growth rate of firm debt
demand evolves according to:
                                    Li,t+1
                                            = i i,t+1                                 (11)
                                       Lit




    27 Thosetheories would have, however, different normative implications.
    28 Asnoted in section 6.2, other frictions would have to be added to fully account for the data.
   29 Alternatively, suppose there are N borrowers in a given bank's portfolio and we treat the bank as the
"economy".

                                                    40
where i is the volatility of firm-level debt growth and i,t+1 are i.i.d. random variables.
Economy-wide total stock of firm debt is:

                                                     N
                                         Dt =             Lit                               (12)
                                                     i

   and growth of financial debt in the economy is

                                                 N
                                   Dt+1                   L
                                        =                i it i,t+1                         (13)
                                   Dt                     Dt
                                                 i

    The variance of growth of total debt is the weighted sum of the variance of the volatility
of idiosyncratic shocks to debt demand, with the shares equaling the squared share of firm
i's borrowing in the total economy. Assuming i =  , we have:

                                            N                     1
                                                          Lit 2   2
                                    D =          i                                          (14)
                                                          Dt
                                             i

    It is clear from equation 14 that the variance of total debt depends on the distribution
of firm-level debt demand Lit . In our data, we see that firm-level borrowing is strongly
positively correlated with firm size. Let firm size, proxied by either total assets or sales,
be yit . Assume idiosyncratic volatility of firm growth y is constant and common to all
firms. Following Gabaix (2011), we assume that y1 , . . . , yN are drawn from a power law
distribution:
                                     P(y > x) = (1 + x)­                                 (15)

    with the exponent   1. Note that we set the location and scale parameters to zero and
unity, for simplicity. In the literature, this precise specification of a power law corresponds
to a Pareto distribution of Type II.
    Now, we assume a specific functional form for the amount of borrowing Lit as a function
of size yit :
                                                     
                                              Lit = yiti                                    (16)

    where i > 0  i. We proceed with the assumption that i =  is homogenous across all
firms.
    Drawing from the literature on statistics, economics, and actuarial sciences, we know
that once yi follows a power law, then yi follows a Champernowne (1952) distribution, also
known as the Burr Type XII, with parameters {, } where  = 1/ (Rodriguez, 1976). In


                                                 41
economics, this distribution is commonly referred to as the Singh-Maddala (SM) density
(Singh and Maddala, 1976). It has been used widely to model household income and wealth
inequality. Formally:
                                   P(L > x)  (1 + x )­                             (17)

    with  > 0. For the special case of  = 1, firm debt becomes linear in size, the distribution
collapses to a Pareto Type II, and we are back to Gabaix (2011). In general, the rate of decay
of D , as the sample size grows, will depend on the value of structural parameters. For the
special case of 1 <   < 2, the SM random variable has an infinite variance and standard
limit theorems break down. There is therefore a direct link between the fat tail of the firm
distribution and of the credit distribution. This result is summarized in our main proposition
below:

Proposition 1. Let firm sizes yi . . . yN be drawn from a power law distribution with exponent   1.
Suppose each firm has non-rationed access to the credit market, through which on demand it borrows
a fraction y­1 of its size, with >0. Firm-level borrowing is thus L = y , which grows with a
constant idiosyncratic volatility  . L follows the Singh-Maddala distribution with power and shape
parameters {,  }:
                                         P(L > x)  (1 + x )­

with  = 1/. Then, as N  :

   · For 1 <  <2, by the Lévy's central limit theorem, the volatility of aggregate debt D is given
                      
     by D   1­11 /( )  , where  is a Lévy random variable with exponent 2
                                                                               
                 N

   · For   2, by the Lindeberg-Lévy classical central limit theorem, the volatility of aggregate
     debt D is given by D   11  , where  is a constant
                              /2N

Proof. The strategy of the proof follows closely Appendix 1 and Proposition 2 in Gabaix
(2011). First, we show that L, which follows the Singh-Maddala distribution, satisfies
Assumptions 1-2 below:

   Assumption 1: liml P(L1 > x)/P(|L1 | > x) =   [0, 1]

   Assumption 2: P(|L1 | > x) = x­ B(x) with B(x) a slow-moving function.

   Assumption 1 is verified trivially because SM is defined on the non-negative real line.
Assumption 2 holds once we re-write: P(|L1 | > x) = x­ ( 1+ x ) . So, B(x) = ( x ) . For
                                                             x                1+x



                                                42
 = 1, the function is clearly slow-moving. Generally, for  > 0 we must show that:

                                                        lim B(tx)
                                lim B(tx)/B(x) =                  =1                      (18)
                                x                        lim B(x)
                                                                                          
for any t>0 and for as long as the denominator is = 0. limx B(x) = limx 1+x                  =
                                                                           x

   Next, we construct three sequences (an , bn , sn ) that constitute the infinite sum across
                                                              1/       1

                            lim     N               Li -

                                               i

In the remainder of the proof, we apply Equation 19 to the case of constant  , i.e. when firm-
liability volatility is constant over time and not correlated cross-sectionally. When  > 2,
standard Lindeberg-L´    evy applies. When 1 <  < 2, the loan portfolio Herfindahl decays
according to:

                                       ­2 N 2 1/2
                                1    N    i Li       evy1/2

                                                                                          (20)

                                                     E(L)

When 1 <  < 2, the denominator (mean of Singh-Maddala) is finite. Since firm-level
volatilities are constant, and L´
                                evy is a stable random variable, the volatility of loan growth
                                                           1
will be therefore decaying at the rate proportional to N1­  :
                                                   1

For  = 1 we are in the special case of Singh-Maddala collapsing to the Pareto II distribution
and standard results in Gabaix (2011) are obtained up to the slow-moving function B(.). For
 = 1 but  > 0, the sufficient statistic for the comparison of rates of convergence across
finite and infinite variance cases is  .


                                                  
   Our notation means that D   1­11        / (  )   implies convergence in distribution of

D N1­1/( ) to   , where  is a stable Lévy random variable. What we have shown is
that the distribution of firm debt could have either thin or fat tails. If   2, D decays

                                                   43
according to   1 . However, if 1 <  < 2, then  decays at the rate of          1 , i.e. more
                N                                  D                         1­ 1
                                                                           N
slowly. In this case, idiosyncratic shocks to borrowers could drive the total debt portfolio
and, as in our main empirical experiments, affect aggregate outcomes.


7.1   Model Parameter Estimation
    In this section, we test whether the parameter restriction 1 <  < 2 can be supported
by our data. First, we fit the Generalized Pareto density into the size distribution of firms.
Most studies in the literature treat sales as the size proxy. We, apart from sales, also consider
total equity and total assets as alternative size proxies that could be relevant for deciding
on how much bank credit to request. This step grants us three estimates of . Second, we
back out firm-specific i directly from Equation 16 and then take the median of the resulting
distribution. We conduct this step for all three definitions of size as well. As a result, we
have three estimates for  - the sufficient statistic that determines the speed of decay of D .
    Table A.10 reports the results from maximum likelihood estimation of  and other pa-
rameters. Our estimates confirm that the 1 <  < 2 restriction is supported in the data.
We find that  is in the [1.26, 1.49] range and  is between 1.38 and 1.64, i.e. firmly within
the (1,2) bounds. Our estimation results suggest that both the firm size and the firm loan
distributions can be reasonably approximated with fat-tailed densities. The aggregate credit
distribution can be affected by firm-level disturbances: credit risk is granular.


8     Conclusion
    This paper has developed the first, bottom-up causal quantification of single-name credit
concentration risk. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide evidence on
single-name (individual firm-level) as opposed to sectoral or geographic exposure risk. Em-
pirically, we show there is a causal link between idiosyncratic firm shocks and returns on
bank credit. Unexpected shocks to firm value-added affect loan-level and bank-level per-
formance. We capture strong asymmetries associated with the debt contract structure by
showing that negative firm shocks lead to a reduction in bank returns, while positive shocks
have zero impact. We explored numerous dimensions of heterogeneity at all levels of aggre-
gation.
    We find strong evidence of a second-level pass-through effect of granular borrower risk
onto other firms. Banks, in response to negative shocks to their granular borrowers, cut
credit supply and increase interest rates on loans to their non-granular borrowers. Af-
fected non-granular firms, in turn, reduce investment in physical capital. Affected firms


                                               44
are also more likely to file for bankruptcy following a negative granular shock to their credit
provider. These results suggest that single-name credit concentration risk carries significant
implications for the macroeconomy.
    The first key message of the paper is therefore that idiosyncratic firm shocks do not wash
out and still matter at the level of the bank portfolio. Conventional wisdom that banks are
subject only to aggregate risk due to pooling and the law of large number is not borne out in
the data. Concentration risk matters quantitatively. Our evidence from non-interest income
data further suggests that banks do not compensate for loan book losses through earnings
from alternative sources such as derivatives or equity holdings. The second key message of
the paper is that there are important granular credit risk spillovers affecting the real economy.
    Methodologically, we make progress on identification of firm demand-side shocks at the
level of bank portfolios by employing the "granular instrument variable" approach devel-
oped in recent work by Gabaix and Koijen (2020a,b). This method takes advantage of the
fact that the distribution of loan shares features a fat tail and allows for a tightly-identified
pass-through of granular risk.
    Our results have implications for the regulation of large credit exposures. Our pass-
through estimates in Table 3 could be used to compute the granular value-at-risk, i.e. the
bank capital that is at risk if a granular borrower suffers a bad negative shock. Our esti-
mate of the loan share Pareto power of section 7 could be used as a tool for understanding
when banks are becoming prone to granular credit risk. A drop in the Pareto power estimate
to 2 or below could constitute a regulatory "red flag". In practice, the parameter could be
computed for each financial institution in the cross-section. The system wide weighted av-
erage Pareto estimate could become a novel time-series indicator of aggregate concentration
whose changes could track fluctuations in system wide concentration risk.

Notes: This figure plots results from loan-level regressions of loan returns on idiosyncratic firm shocks inter-
acted with various lagged firm characteristics. Each characteristic is a dummy which takes the value of 1 for
firms which are in the highest decile of leverage, share of bank credit to total credit and share of short-term
debt to total debt; firms in the lowest decile of total assets and total equity; firms with an below-A credit rating;
and firms younger than 3 years. Bars are 95% confidence bands. Baseline is the pooled estimate from Table 2.

                   Figure A.2: Geographical Origins of Granular Credit Risk




Notes: This picture is a colored map of 19 administrative counties (fylke) of Norway. Each shade of blue
represents the county-specific strength of the pass-through from idiosyncratic firm shocks to return on loans.
These correspond to county-specific slope shifters (slope dummies) introduced into the main loan regression
2. Shapefiles are from the Norwegian Mapping Authority (Kartverket).

Notes: These figures report all pairwise cross-sectional correlation coefficients for idiosyncratic firm shocks.
The sample includes a balanced panel of firms over 2003-2015. Panel A presents the histogram, and Panel B
reports summary statistics. Firm shocks are extracted based on specification 1.

Notes: This figure shows the extent to which there is home-bias in the Norwegian corporate credit market.
Source: Juelsrud and Wold (2020). Specifically, red bars show the observed fraction of loans within a given year
in our sample where the firm and the bank are located in the same county (within-region loans). The blue bars
show the counterfactual share of within-region loans, where we assume random matching between firms and
banks. Given random matching, the probability that a firm i borrows from a bank j operating in that region is
the sum of the aggregate/national market share of bank j.

Notes: This table reports estimates from loan-level regressions of loan returns on firm shocks interacted with
firm entry, exit, and bankruptcy dummies. Firm entry (exit) dummies equal 1 for firms which entered (exited)
the year before (following) the firm shock. Firm bankruptcy is a dummy that equals 1 for firms which declare
bankruptcy the year following the firm shock. Ever bankrupt is a dummy that equals 1 for firms which have
ever declared bankruptcy during the 2003-2015 period, and not necessarily directly following the firm shock.
All specifications include Bank x Firm Industry x Year x Loan-type x Firm County interacted fixed effects.
Standard errors (in parentheses) are double clustered at the firm-year level.

Notes: This table reports results from bank-level regressions of return on loans on firm shocks, instrumented
by the granular IV. The granular IV is constructed following Equation 6. The RHS is interacted with dum-
mies for percentiles of the loan portfolio Herfindahl index (HHI) and number of loans. Each dummy cuts the
distribution of each characteristic into two halves based on the median, denoted as: few and many loans and
low and high HHI. Columns (1)-(2) interact the RHS shock variable with the indicator variable for number of
loans and HHI, respectively. All specifications include bank controls, which are lagged values of: total assets,
leverage, liquidity, number of loans, deposit to assets ratio and financial assets to assets ratio. Standard errors
(in parentheses) are clustered at the bank level.

are regressed on firm shocks that are randomly permuted. The last two rows report results when permuted
shocks are positive or negative only, respectively. Columns report the number of simulations, the true coef-
ficients based on Table 2 column (3) and Table 3 columns (3)-(5), the number of events where permutations
produced estimates that are as large as the true estimate (in absolute value) by chance, and the associated
p-values.

Notes: This table reports results from a placebo exercise where loan or bank outcomes are regressed on se-
quences of randomly generated numbers. In each row, placebo shocks are randomly drawn from the interval
of the true shock. The last two rows report results when shocks are positive or negative only, respectively.
Columns report the number of random draws and summary statistics of the regression coefficients: mean,
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.

Notes: This table reports parameter estimates of a linear unbalanced panel fixed effects model with a distur-
bance that follows an autoregressive process of order 1. Estimates for the autoregressive coefficient and the
standard deviation of the error term are reported. Columns report results for various levels of aggregation.
Idiosyncratic firm shocks are extracted based on specification 1 and then aggregated to different levels with
loan shares as weights.
