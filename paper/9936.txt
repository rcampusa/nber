                                             ABSTRACT

This paper employs survival analysis to study the duration of US imports. We find that the median

duration of exporting a product to the US is very short, on the order to two to four years. Our results

also indicate that there is negative duration dependence meaning that if a country is able to survive

in the exporting market for the first few years it will face a very small probability of failure and will

export the product for a long period of time. This result holds across countries and industries. We

find that our results are not only robust to aggregation but are strengthened by aggregation. That is,

as we aggregate from product level trade data to SITC industry level trade data the estimated

survival increases. We rank countries by their survival experience and show that our rankings are

strongly correlated with the rankings in Feenstra and Rose (2002), implying that product cycle

followers also experience particularly short duration.

1. Introduction

Positive trade theory usually asks questions which address the “who, what, when, and why” of

international trade. One question that is not often addressed is “how long?” When countries

trade, how long do their trade relationships last? Are they exchanging products over long or

short periods of time?

    In order to answer these questions we study the duration of trade relationships. To our

knowledge we are the first to do so and several important findings emerge from our analysis.

First, we demonstrate not only that there is a remarkable amount of entry and exit in the US

import market but also that the period of time a country is “in” the market is often fleeting.

We find that some trade relationships are long-lived, by which we mean a country exports

a product for many years. We find, however, that it is far more common to observe short-

lived trade relationships wherein a country trades a product for a few years and then stops. In

particular, more than half of all trade relationships are observed for a single year and 85 percent

are observed for fewer than five years.

    Second, because our analysis is performed at a highly disaggregated (7-digit) level we show

one must carefully account for censored observations. As we explain censoring issues are more

severe when working at the product level because of reclassifications. Once we account for cen-

soring we can estimate survival and hazard rate functions of exporting to the United States. We

find the median duration that a country exports a product to the US is very short, somewhere be-

tween two and four years depending on the censoring approach employed. Moreover, although

duration does vary by source country and region, we show that short-lived relationships charac-

terize trade by most countries. Said differently, we find short relationships are prevalent for both

OECD and non-OECD countries although we find systematically higher survival experience for

OECD trade relationships.


                                                 1
    Third, we find that our results are not only robust to aggregation but in fact are strengthened

by aggregation. That is, as we aggregate from product level trade data to SITC industry level

trade data the estimated survival decreases. We show that this paradoxical result is related to

the unique censoring problems that are only present when the analysis is done at the product

level. As a result, it is more straightforward to conduct industry level analysis although doing

so makes it somewhat more difficult to interpret what the relationship represents. It should be

noted, however, that the results across SITC aggregations are intuitive with higher aggregations

having longer durations. The aggregation exercise confirms that our main finding — that trade

relationships tend to be quite short — is not an anomaly.

    Fourth, our results also indicate that there is negative duration dependence, meaning that

the conditional probability of failure decreases as duration increases. Conditional on observing

a trade relationship surviving the first five years, the hazard rate for the rest of the sample is

just 12 percent. The results suggest the presence of a type of a threshold effect where once a

relationship is established and has survived the first few years it is likely the relationship will

survive a long time.

    All things considered, the results in this paper suggest that more is happening at the micro-

level than suggested by either existing theory or empirical studies. For instance, according to

the factor proportions theory trade is based on factor endowment differences, and since such

differences change gradually trade patterns are likewise expected to evolve slowly. Unhappi-

ness with this implication spurred the development of trade models with richer trade dynamics

(Krugman, 1979; Dollar, 1990; Grossman and Helpman, 1991). In this literature Vernon’s

(1966) seminal product cycle theory is probably the best known. Vernon’s model generates a

particular pattern for trade relationships. The technological leaders develop and export a prod-

uct until others learn how to manufacture it and enter the market. As the technology becomes

more and more standardized, other countries will begin to produce and export the product. If


                                                2
these follower countries have relatively low costs, they will eventually take over the market and

push out the leaders. All of these models, however, imply a fairly predictable pattern of trade

dynamics — trade dynamics either evolve slowly or in logical progression from developed to

developing countries; none of the models suggest that short-lived trade relationships would be

the norm.1 None of the models suggest that trade relationships would be as fleeting as implied

by our results.

    Until relatively recently there has been little direct evidence of the product cycle.2 Gagnon

and Rose (1995) and Feenstra and Rose (2000) stand out for their use of disaggregated industry

data to look for systematic evidence of trade dynamics. The results from these papers have

different implications for trade dynamics. Gagnon and Rose study the persistence of trade

balances and obtain results that support the view that trade dynamics are gradual. They find that

industries characterized by trade surpluses (deficits) in the early-1960s were extremely likely

to also be characterized by trade surpluses (deficits) 25 years later. Gagnon and Rose conclude

that “there is little evidence of dynamic patterns” in trade (p. 230).

    Feenstra and Rose take a different approach toward identifying the product cycle and pro-

vide compelling support for Vernon’s hypothesis. Rather the modelling the entire product cycle

dynamics, Feenstra and Rose identify the phenomenon by focusing on a single datum: the date

that a country first exports a product to the United States. Their work is an excellent example of

how one can gain great insight by simplifying the task at hand. Using panel data for US imports,

they find certain countries tend to be first to export a product while others tend to begin to export

at a later date. They also find that the order in which countries first export a good is consistent

with macroeconomic rankings typically associated with technological progress which further
   1 In Grossman and Helpman’s (1991) “quality ladder” variant of the product cycle model the leader and follower
exchange dominance of exports of a particular good over time, as leaders re-enter the market for a given good by
innovating and offering a more advanced version.
   2 The earlier empirical evidence in support of the product cycle was based on indirect measures (Deardorff, 1984;
Audretsch, 1987; Cotsomitis et al., 1991).


                                                         3
supports Vernon’s hypothesis. Feenstra and Rose conclude that “there is strong evidence of

intuitive ordering of countries and commodities, consistent with the product cycle (p. 378).”

    Our findings both challenge and complement these earlier results.3 On the one hand, we find

that even though a trade balance perspective may indicate little or no dynamics, each competitor

(supplier) in the marketplace may perceive the market to be very fluid and highly dynamic. In

addition, our approach shows that entry, whether early or late, can be associated with a highly

ephemeral trade relationship. On the other hand, our estimated survival functions do imply that

some countries systematically perform better than others. We then take the next logical step

and use our estimated survival functions to rank each country’s survival experience. We show

that our rankings are consistent with Feenstra and Rose’s rankings. In other words, our results

confirm the notion that there is a product cycle and that leaders not only tend to be the first to the

market (Feenstra and Rose) but also tend to have longer spells of service. The results suggest

that later in the product cycle products become standardized and competitive market pressures

create short-term relationships.

    This paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to examine the issue of the

duration of trade relationships. The issue is stimulated in part by the findings of Haveman and

Hummels (2001), Feenstra and Rose, and Schott (2001) who document that in any given year

and for any given product, many countries do not trade, which means there are a lot of zero trade

observations.4 While this is an important realization, none of these previous studies examined

whether a country’s current state (i.e., being “in” or “out” of the market) was a permanent

feature. We show that being in the market is often a transitory phenomenon.5
   3 Moenius and Riker (1999)’s findings are also related to this paper. They examine the empirical relevance of the
quality ladders model of Grossman and Helpman and confirm most of the volatility implications of the model.
    4 Feenstra and Rose’s approach depends on the fact that many of the zero value observations become positive in
later years.
    5 Other research on dynamics of trade has focused on examining the evolution of patterns of industrial special-
ization over time rather than the dynamics of trade per se (Proudman and Redding, 1998; Redding, 2002).

    The paper proceeds as follows. The next section presents the data, and offers an example.

We also examine the distribution of the length of trade relationships and discuss some com-

plications such as multiples spells and censoring. Section 3 discusses modeling of duration

and presents estimation techniques. Section 4 presents estimates of survival and hazard rate

functions and discusses differences across countries and products as well as the effects of ag-

gregation. In section 5 we examine the robustness of our results. We show that our findings are

not particularly sensitive to changes in how we measure trade relationships, define failure, or

level of aggregation. In fact, we find that the median duration is often shorter in these alternative

formulations than for our benchmark data. The most significant changes occur when we give

greater weight to relationships with large trade values. While a weighted analysis does increase

duration, we still find that 50 percent of trade weighted relationships are observed for fewer

than five years. In section 6 we relate our findings to Feenstra and Rose’s country rankings.


2. Data

Our analysis is based on US import statistics as compiled by Feenstra (1996).6 From 1972

through 1988 import products were classified according to the seven digit Tariff Schedule of

the United States (TS).7 Since 1989 imports have been classified according to the ten digit

Harmonized System (HS). Given that all products were recoded in 1989, we limit our analysis

to the period 1972-1988 in order to avoid potential concordance issues.8 In simplest terms, for

each commodity and year we can identify all of the countries from whom the United States

purchased. Over the entire period there is a total of about 22,000 different products in the TS
   6 The data is available from http://data.econ.ucdavis.edu/international/.
   7 We only study imports because there is no concordance between the disaggregated import and export codes. In
addition, the export data is self-reported making it more likely that exports are misreported.
   8 Many TS products are mapped into multiple HS codes and vice-versa making impossible to discern actual exits.
See Schott (2001) for more discussion of the TS-HS concordance problem.

data. On average, in each year we observe import trade for about 10,000 products sourced from

about 160 countries.


Trade relationships and spells of service

We are interested in studying the length of time until a country ceases to export a product to the

US, an event that we will refer to as a “failure.” As a result calendar time is not as important

as analysis time, which measures the length of time that a country exports a product to the US.

Hence, for each product and country we use the annual data to create spell data. By this we

mean that if we observe trade in product i from country c from 1976–1980, we would say that

the ci th trade relationship has a spell length of five.

    Most of our analysis is based on the most disaggregated data available, 7-digit TS data,

which means our analysis is at the product level, not the industry level. Inferences are based

on trade in tangible products rather than aggregate summaries. Until relatively recently such

disaggregated data was not widely available and empirical studies were based on industry clas-

sifications, such as the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC). We chose to base our

benchmark results on the 7-digit TS data primarily because it does the best job of measuring

trade in a specified product. For instance, the TS data reports information on more than 30 dif-

ferent types of ball bearings, differentiating by specialized application (e.g., automobiles), size,

and chemistry. By contrast, if we were to perform our analysis using SITC classifications (as

we do later in our robustness checks) we would aggregate all of these ball bearing codes along

with other similar, or perhaps not so similar, products to create spells of service. For instance,

the dozens of ball bearings codes map into a single SITC category “Ball, roller or needle roller

bearings” (4 digit code=7491). Further aggregation is possible, say to “Non-electric machinery

parts” (3 digit code=749) or “Industrial machinery” (2 digit code=74), but doing so makes it

increasingly difficult to interpret the results since each classification includes highly disparate

                                                   6
products.

   For duration analysis we believe that using highly disaggregated data is imperative. First,

the more aggregated is the data, the more the analysis identifies industry trends rather than

competitive dynamics at the product level. The fact that country c in industry j has a long

duration tells us little about the duration of commodity trade or underlying trade dynamics. For

instance, suppose we observe three countries exporting “Industrial machinery” and that each has

a long trade duration. This might lead us to surmise that the dynamics among these countries are

very similar. This need not be the case. For instance, country c1 might be uniformly superior:

every product it sells could have a long duration. On the other hand, country c2 might be

a dismal failure: the success (i.e., long duration) of one product could hide a multitude of

failures (short-lived spells). Finally, country c3 could be a classic example of Vernon’s product

cycle: the observed long duration at the industry level could reflect a progression from simpler

products (say, ball bearings) to very complicated products (say, engines). If nothing else, the

more aggregated is the data the more cautious we should be interpreting the results; a less

munificent view might be that aggregated data makes it impossible to measure dynamics.

   Second, if the products are too broadly defined, we cannot expect to see any source countries

exit the data. For instance, at the extreme if we aggregate all imports from each country, we

will never observe any exit since the United States purchases some product from each source

country every year. Simply put, higher aggregations can hide a great deal of dynamics and

competition in the import market.

   For each product we create a panel of countries which export the product to the US. Table 1

provides an example of what the dataset looks like for a representative product, “Milled Corn

(TS=1312000).” The “X”s in the table indicate years in which each country exports the product

to the US. As shown, there are countries that export corn every year, such as Canada and Portu-

gal. This pattern illustrates a spell of length 17 years. Another dozen or so countries have one


                                               7
spell. Mexico begins exporting corn in 1974, South Korea in 1976, and Peru in 1984, and all

three service the US market in every year after entry. The remaining countries with one spell

all export corn for just one year.

    There are several countries with two spells. The United States imports corn from Venezuela

in every year but 1981. Ecuador exports corn in 1973 and 1974 (the first spell, length 2) and

then services the US market for the second time starting in 1979 and continuing through 1988

(the second spell, length 10). The Dominican Republic also has two spells, but both of length 1.

Colombia and Italy each have three spells, both starting with two short ones (of length 3 and

1, and 1 and 2, respectively), before entering the US market for the third time (1981 and 1980,

respectively) and staying for the remainder of time. Of the remaining countries most have very

short spells, with the exception of the Netherlands whose first spell is five years long. However,

its remaining four spells are all just one year long.

    Once we think of the data in terms of spells our data set has 693,963 observations (see

Table 2). The observations have a median (mean) spell length of 1 (2.7) years. We will discuss

how aggregation affects our results in more detail in section 5, but we note here that Table 2

also includes statistics when we use the more aggregated SITC industry classification system

to construct trade relationships.9 We have 157,850 observations when we use the 5-digit SITC

classification, 90,035 observations when we use the 4-digit level and just 2,484 observations at

the 1-digit level. As expected, when we aggregate the data our ability to observe entry and exit

diminishes and the mean spell length increases, from 2.7 years in the TS data to 3.9 years in the

5-digit SITC data to 8.4 years in the 1-digit SITC data.

    In Figure 1 we plot the distribution for each observed spell length. On the x-axis we plot

the observed spell length. On the y-axis we plot the percentage of observations whose observed

spell of service is greater than a given length. In the benchmark 7-digit TS data, more than half
  9 SITC imports are also reported in Feenstra (1996).



                                                         8
of all spells are just one year long. About 70 percent of the spells are observed for two or fewer

years. About 80 percent of the spells are observed for three or fewer years. On the opposite

side of the spectrum less than two percent of all spells are observed for all 17 years. Simply

put, there is a plethora of short spells. In Figure 1 we also plot the distribution for alternative

measures of trade relationships; these other distributions will be discussed later in the paper.


Multiple spells

Looking at Table 1, one sees that some trade relationships re-occur or have multiple spells of

service. That is, a country will service the market, exit, then re-enter the market, and then

almost always exit again. As it turns out, about a quarter of trade relationships experience

multiple spells of service. About two-thirds of those trade relationships with multiple spells

experience just two spells; less than one percent of trade relationships with multiple spells have

more than three spells. All told we have 495,763 trade relationships as compared with 693,963

spells of service.

    We will begin by treating multiple spells as independent. While this assumption is made

primarily in the interest of simplicity in section 5 we explore alternatives and find our results

are likely not overly sensitive to this assumption. To get a sense of why this is the case, it is

instructive to look at the distribution of spells when we exclude multiple spells. First let’s restrict

the analysis to those trade relationships with just a single spell. As reported in Table 2, these

observations have a median (mean) spell length of 1 (3.2) years; thus, the median is exactly

the same as the benchmark data (all 7-digit TS observations) and the mean is just a half a year

longer. In Figure 1 we show the entire distribution. In both cases we see that more than half of

all spells are just one year long and about 75 percent of the spells are observed for fewer than

four years; further, in both distributions only about 5 percent of the spells are observed for 10

or more years.

                                                  9
    Alternatively, we can restrict the analysis to just the first spell of a trade relationships. This

alternative includes those relationships with just a single spell and also the first spell of those

relationships with multiple service spells. As was the case in the first comparison, the distribu-

tion is very similar to the benchmark. This similarity among these distributions suggests that

the independence assumption is a reasonable starting place.


Censoring

Once we begin to think of the data in terms of spells it becomes apparent that we need to

account for censoring in our analysis. By this we mean that we often do not know whether a

trade relationship ends because of failure or for some other reason. In practice this means that

we are uncertain about the beginning and/or ending date for some trade relationships.

    As it turns out, censoring is pretty common in US import data — about half of the trade

observations are censored and about 20 percent of spells are censored at one year. The censoring

problem comes in two flavors. First, we have no information on trade relationships for the years

before the beginning (pre-1972) and after the end of our sample (post-1988). As seen in Table 1

we observe that the US imported corn from the Philippines in 1972 and that this relationship

was observed for exactly one year. This trade relationship may have begun in 1972 or it may

have begun in some prior year. The most appropriate interpretation is that this relationship had

a duration of at least one year. Similarly, we also observe that the US imported corn from Peru

from 1984 to 1988. Unfortunately, our data does not continue beyond 1988 and hence we cannot

be sure how long that spell ultimately lasted. Once again, the most appropriate interpretation

is that this relationship had a duration of at least five years. About 10 percent of spells are

observed in 1972, while about 22 percent are observed in 1988.10 This first type of censoring is

typical in survival studies and is incorporated in all of our subsequent analysis.
 10 Remember, less than two percent of all spells are observed both in 1972 and 1988.



                                                      10
    The second type of censoring is somewhat unique and stems from the fact that our analysis

is done at the product level. US Customs revises product definitions for the tariff codes on an

ongoing basis, sometimes splitting a single code into multiple codes and other times combining

multiple codes into fewer codes. Unfortunately, information does not exist to allow us to map

the old TS codes into the new TS codes. When a code is changed we no longer observe trade

in the old product code. But, is this due to the end of a relationship or does it simply mean

that trade stopped due to the redefinition? Throughout much of our analysis we choose to be

cautious and classify all such “exits” as censored, which means that we interpret reclassified

relationships as having duration of at least x years (where x is the number of years where trade

in the original code was observed).

    An analogous problem exists for the new codes. When a code is changed we begin to

observe trade in the new product code. But, is this really the beginning of a new relationship

or does it simply reflect the redefinition? Once again for much of our analysis we choose to be

cautious and assume the relationship had a duration of at least y years (where y is the number

of years where trade in the new code was observed). About 20 percent of the spells are censored

due to reclassification. This second type of censoring is a peculiar characteristic of our particular

application; it is incorporated into what we refer to as our benchmark estimates.

    The issue is that our decision to interpret all product code changes as being censored is very

conservative — certainly some of the new codes were truly measuring new products and some

of the obsolete codes were measuring products that were no longer traded. In other words, in

our benchmark data we have probably classified some spells as being censored when they were

truly associated with either an entry or an exit. If more information were available we would

be able to identify such births and deaths.11 Unfortunately, this additional information does
  11 Xiang (2002) uses the changes in the verbal description of 4-digit SIC industry codes to identify new prod-
ucts. Even using relatively aggregated industry data (about 450 industries) Xiang describes a time-consuming and
painstaking process.


                                                      11
not exist. This means that our benchmark results will overstate the true duration of the typical

trading relationship.

    An alternative that we explore is to classify these product code changes as indicating entry

and exit. It should be noted, however, that this alternative classification scheme will undoubt-

edly understate the true duration. As a result, the “true” duration will lie somewhere between

these two approaches toward censoring.


3. Modeling Duration

Duration models

Let T denote the time to a failure event. Since time in our analysis is discrete we assume T is a

discrete random variable taking on values ti , i = 1, 2, . . . , n with probability density function

p(ti ) = Pr(T = ti ), i = 1, 2, . . . , n where t1 < t2 < · · · < tn . The survival function for a

random variable T is given by

                                                           
                                   S(t) = Pr(T > t) =               p(ti ).
                                                            ti >t


The hazard function is

                                                          p(ti )
                     h(ti ) = Pr(T = ti | T ≥ ti ) =              , i = 1, 2, . . . , n
                                                         S(ti−1 )

where S(t0 ) = 1. The survival and hazard functions are related through the following expres-

Nonparametric estimation

The two functions of interest in this paper are the survivor and hazard functions. To estimate

them we will assume we have n independent observations denoted (ti , ci ), i = 1, 2, ..., n,

where ti is the survival time and ci is the censoring indicator variable C (taking on a value of

1 if failure occurred, 0 otherwise) of observation i. Assume there are m ≤ n recorded times

of failure. Denote the rank-ordered survival times as t(1) < t(2) < ... < t(m) . Let n i denote the

number of subjects at risk of failing at t(i) and let di denote the number of observed failures.

The Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator of the survivor function is then

the Kaplan-Meier estimator is given by Greenwood’s formula

4. Empirical Results

7-digit TS data

We begin by examining the benchmark 7-digit TS data dataset. In Table 3 we report the distribu-

tion of the Kaplan-Meier estimated survival time. Begin by looking under the columns labelled

“TS7-benchmark.” The row “Total” shows the overall distribution of survival time. The other

rows report the Kaplan-Meier estimates for particular regions and industries.

    First note the difference between Kaplan-Meier estimated survival time and the spell lengths

reported in Table 2: the Kaplan-Meier estimates are significantly longer. The difference, of

course, is that the Kaplan-Meier estimator accounts for censoring while the spell lengths re-

ported in Table 2 do not; this comparison highlights the importance of accounting for censoring

when working with product level data.

    The second important finding involves how sharply the risk of failure falls. The analysis

indicates that the risk of failure is quite high in the early years, but then rapidly falls once a trade

relationship survives a threshold duration. The 25th percentile of the distribution is one year,

which means that after the first year, more than 25 percent of the spells fail. The median duration

is just four years, indicating that a considerable number of observations fail over the following

three years. After about four or five years, however, failure becomes a lot less common: the

75th percentile spans the whole data set (which we denoted by a period). In other words, more

than 50 percent of the observations fail within the first four years, but over the next 13 years

less than one quarter of the observations fail. This suggests that countries exporting to the US

face a large conditional probability of failure in the early stages of their trade relationship and a

much smaller conditional probability once they have survived a few years.

    The estimated overall survival function, 
                                             S(t) is graphed in Figure 2 together with the 95%

confidence interval. The confidence interval is very tight (imperceptible), which is not sur-


                                                  14
prising given the size of the data set used. The survival function is downward sloping with

a decreasing slope. The estimated survival function suggests that the hazard rate should be a

decreasing function and this is confirmed in Figure 3 where we present the estimated hazard

function. As shown, the probability of failing in the first year is 33 percent. The hazard rate

between year one and five is an additional 30 percent. The hazard rate for the remaining twelve

years is just 12 percent.

    Figures 2 and 3 indicate that after a large decrease in the probability of survival over the first

few years, the survival function levels off and decreases very little. Both the survival and haz-

ard functions indicate that there is negative duration dependence, meaning that the conditional

probability of failure decreases as duration increases. This result indicates the presence of a

type of a threshold effect. In other words, it appears that once a relationship is established and

has survived the first few years it is likely the relationship will survive a long time. This finding

is similar to that documented by Pakes and Ericson (1998) for retail trade establishments.13

    It is somewhat surprising that the Kaplan-Meier estimate of probability of exporting a prod-

uct for more than 17 years is so high (0.41) given that we previously showed that less than two

percent of all trade relationships span the entire sample (Figure 1). These seemingly inconsis-

tent findings are explained by the prevalence of censoring when using the product level data.

Many of the relationships that are observed to end are censored and thus in our benchmark

results we do not classify them as failures.

    The impact of censoring due to product codes changes can be identified if we estimate the

Kaplan-Meier survival function using the modified censoring approach discussed above. Under

this alternative scheme we consider all changes in TS codes as indicating births and deaths

which means we will observe much more entry and exit in the data. We report the results
 13 Pakes and Ericson interpret their results as supporting Jovanovic’s (1982) theory of learning.




                                                        15
in Table 2 and Figure 4.14 In Table 3 we see that under this modified censoring scheme the

median duration falls to just two years as compared with four years in the benchmark data; the

75th percentile is just six years under modified censoring. In other words, at least 75 percent

of the spells fail within six years. In Figure 4 we depict the Kaplan-Meier survival function

for both the benchmark 7-digit TS data and for the modified censoring data. As expected, the

hazard rate is substantially higher during the first years under modified censoring; by year four

the survival rate is about 20 percentage points smaller under the modified censoring scheme.15

Nevertheless, as was the case with the benchmark data, the hazard rate falls sharply after about

four or five years and there is little additional failure. Overall, we find that the probability of

exporting a product for more than 17 years under modified censoring is only 0.18 — less than

half of that of the benchmark data — but still considerably higher than the observed two percent

of trade relationships that span the entire sample.


Region and industry survival functions

In Table 3 we also report statistics broken out by individual regions and industries for both the

benchmark and modified censoring data. For all regions we observe that a substantial fraction

of trade relationships quickly end in failure: the 25th percentile of the distribution is one to

two years for all regions. There are differences across regions in the severity of the initial

wave of failures with Northern regions tending to outperform Southern regions. When using

the benchmark data we find that the Northern regions (as represented by Canada, Asia, and

Western Europe) have a median duration of at least six years; of this set, Canada has by far the

longest median survival time, which spans the whole data set. In other words, less than half of
  14 Recall that in this modified scheme products traded in 1972 or 1988 are still classified as censored.
   15 As we showed previously, there is a connection between the hazard function and the survival function: when
the probability of survival decreases significantly the hazard rate is large; when the probability of survival decreases
slightly the hazard rate is small.



                                                          16
the observations on Canadian trade end in failure within the our 17 year sample.

    Quite a different story emerges for the Southern regions. Using the benchmark data, the

Southern regions have a median duration of no more than two years — half of all trade rela-

tionships from these regions will fail within two years.16 We also point out that the difference

between Northern and Southern regions is also observed under the modified censoring scheme,

where once again the Northern regions have uniformly higher median survival times.

    In Figure 5 we use the benchmark data and estimate the survival functions for individual

regions. As one can see the shapes of the survival functions are similar and all reflect the basic

dynamics described above. For each region there is a significant probability of failure in the first

four or five years of the relationship, but thereafter the hazard falls substantially. Nevertheless,

survival varies substantially across source region. In the case of Canada about 60 percent of

trade relationships survive 10 or more years. By contrast, in the case of Africa only 20 percent

of trade relationships survive 10 or more years.

    The results clearly suggest that duration can broadly be thought of as a North versus South

story, with Northern sources having longer median survival times. This insight can be drawn

more sharply by estimating the Kaplan-Meier survival functions for OECD and non-OECD

countries separately. We present the results in Figure 6. On average, the estimated survival

for OECD countries is about 10 percentage points higher than for non-OECD countries. Thus

while the survival pattern is qualitatively similar across regions, Northern countries clearly fare

better.

    When we look at survival functions by industry we again see broadly similar trends — a

wave of initial failures which are followed by a significant decrease in hazard. As seen in Table 3

and depicted in Figure 7 the 25th percentile of the distribution is one year for every industry.
  16 The category “Other” contains the following countries that we did not assign to any region: Bermuda, Green-
land, St. Pierre Miquelon, and Unknown Partner.




                                                      17
Looking at the benchmark data, with the exception of two industries the median survival time

is three years or less. In other words, in most industries more than half of all observations fail

within two years.

    In two key industries, Machinery (SITC 7) and Miscellaneous Manufactures (SITC 8), the

estimated duration is far longer, more than 11 years. An explanation for the distinct difference

between these two industries and the others lies at least in part to the apparently high prevalence

of product reclassification censoring that occurs in these two industries. Evidence of this can be

found when we look at the distribution under our modified censoring scheme where we observe

that these two industries have a median survival time of two years, the same as all but one

industry (whose median survival time is one year). The higher than average incidence of product

codes changes might reflect that these two industries are characterized by the most innovation

and shortest product cycles; a dynamism which results in numerous TS codes changes. If

this is the case, then the modified censoring scheme probably does a better job capturing the

actual dynamics as the code changes probably reflect true entry and exit (i.e., births and deaths).

On the other hand, the high incidence of code changes might reflect other factors that are not

associated with economically meaningful entry and exit. For instance, the code changes might

simply be a way to mitigate the impact of GATT negotiated tariff reductions or expand the scope

of the Multifibre Agreement. In this case, the benchmark censoring scheme is probably more

appropriate, implying that these two industries really are outliers. A resolution of this issue is

beyond the scope of this paper but certainly merits further analysis.


5. Robustness of results

The results indicate that trade relationships are quite short: estimated median survival is between

two and four years. We now examine whether our findings are robust to how we measure trade



                                                18
relationships and spells.


Aggregation concerns — SITC level analysis

We begin by exploring whether our finding is possibly due to the highly disaggregated nature

of our data. Perhaps 30 different ball-bearing codes represents an overly fine parsing of the data

that leads us to observe excessive entry and exit.17 If so, a trade relationship might be better

measured using SITC industry classifications.

    To address this concern we also calculated spells of service using SITC industry (revision 2)

definitions ranging from the 1-digit to the 5-digit level. As mentioned above, summary statistics

for the SITC classifications are given in Table 2 where we show that the median observed spell

length is two or fewer years in the 1-digit SITC through the 4-digit SITC data. The distribution

of duration time based on the Kaplan-Meier estimates are presented in Table 3; the estimates

themselves are depicted in Figure 4.

    A number of interesting insights are gained by examining trade relationship using industry-

level data. First, note that within the SITC classifications aggregation works exactly as expected.

Higher levels of aggregation are associated with longer survival times. As depicted in Figure 4

the survival function for the 4-digit SITC lies above the 5-digit SITC, the 3-digit SITC lies above

the 4-digit SITC, and so on. Nevertheless, although aggregation creates longer survival times

the estimated survival times remain remarkably brief. There remains a large number of short

spells of service until the data is fairly highly aggregated. In particular, as shown in Table 3, the

median survival time is two years for the 3-digit, 4-digit, and 5-digit SITC data.

    Second, in comparison with the median survival time for the 7-digit TS benchmark data the

brevity of duration times for the SITC data is somewhat surprising. Specifically, despite the
  17 It is not obvious that the TS classification system is too fine. To the contrary, Schott (2000) presents evidence
that the TS categories may be too broad.



                                                         19
higher degree of aggregation the 2-digit through 5-digit SITC data all have a shorter median

survival time than the benchmark 7-digit TS data. As depicted in Figure 4 only the 1-digit SITC

data has a higher survival function than the 7-digit TS benchmark.

    This result seemingly implies that aggregation from products to industries lowers survival.

Taken at face value, this is an odd result. This unusual finding, however, has a completely

logical explanation. The SITC classification system (revision 2) is unchanged throughout our

sample. As a result only the first type of censoring (which is driven by the beginning and

end of our sample) is present in the SITC analysis. In other words, it is more appropriate

to compare results based on the SITC classifications with the 7-digit TS modified censoring

data. As shown in Figure 4 when we do that comparison we get the expected result: survival

experience for product level data is lower than for the 5-digit SITC industry level data and

aggregation increases estimated survival time.

    In effect, the SITC data shows that both approaches toward handling censoring in the 7-digit

TS data are imperfect. In an ideal world we would be able to truly identify all births, deaths, and

censored product changes. But, since we cannot do so we are left with two imperfect measures:

(i) the 7-digit TS benchmark data which overstate the “true” survival experience (since all prod-

uct code changes are censored) and (ii) the modified censoring data which understate the “true”

survival experience (since all product code changes are interpreted as births and deaths).

    Moreover, given that survival experience at the product-based level must be shorter than at

the 5-digit SITC industry level, the results shown in Figure 4 indicate that the true 7-digit TS

survival experience indeed lies between our two measures. In effect, the SITC results imply that

the “true” median survival experience at the 7-digit TS level is two to four years and probably

is closer to two years. In either case, the evidence is clear: duration is very brief.




                                                 20
Multiple Spells

As mentioned, about a quarter of trade relationships experience multiple spells of service. In

the above analysis we have assumed that duration is independent of spell number. We now

investigate whether this assumption biases our findings.

    To check the sensitivity of our results, we considered several alternative approaches toward

the issue of multiple spells. First, we simply limited our analysis to only those relationships with

a single spell. In Figure 1 we plotted the distribution for trade relationships with a single spell.

And as discussed above there is very little difference between the distributions for single spell

and all 7-digit TS data — under this alternative formulation about half the observations have a

spell length of just one year and more than 75 percent of the spells last three or fewer years. The

Kaplan-Meier estimated survival function for the single spell data is depicted in Figure 8. The

survival function for the single spell data has a similar pattern as the benchmark data, namely

high hazard in the first few years followed by a levelling off of the survival function. Overall,

however, the single spell data exhibits significantly higher survival: about 21 percentage points

higher than the benchmark data in year 17.

    The similarity of spell length distributions (Figure 1) sharply contrasts with the differences

in the Kaplan-Meier estimates (Figure 8). This suggests that the censoring approach taken in

the benchmark data plays a role. Specifically, censoring is more common in the single spell

data which shifts up the Kaplan-Meier estimates. Moreover, as we discussed in the preceding

section, analysis based on the SITC data indicates that the benchmark data overstates the amount

of censoring in the data and that the modified censoring approach may yield a more appropriate

measure of true survival experience. To get a sense of the magnitude we re-estimate the single

spell data using the modified censoring approach and present the Kaplan-Meier estimates in

Figure 8. As shown, the median survival time is now 3 years as compared with 2 years when



                                                21
all observations are included. While the single spell data has a higher survival experience, the

effect is not as great as in the benchmark approach: about 7 percentage points higher than the

benchmark data in year 17.

    A second approach we explored was to limit the analysis to only first spells. This alternative

includes those relationships with just a single spell and also the first spell of those relationships

with multiple service spells. Since the results are generally similar to the single spell results

they will not be explicitly discussed.

    Another way we addressed the issue of multiple spells was to consider the possibility that

some of the reported multiple spells are due to measurement error. Specifically, if the time

between spells is short, it may be that the gap is mis-measured and that interpreting the initial

spell as “failing” is inappropriate. In this case, it may be more appropriate to interpret the

two spells as one longer spell. To allow for such misreporting, we assume that a one-year gap

between spells is an error, and hence merge the individual spells and adjust the duration length

accordingly. Gaps of two or more years are assumed to be accurate and no merging is done.

    The spell length distribution for this gap-adjusted data is depicted in Figure 1. As seen

this adjusting for this potential type of measurement error shifts the distribution but short spells

remain the norm. In Table 2 we report the summary statistics for the gap-adjusted data. In

comparison with the benchmark 7-digit TS data, the average spell length is longer by about a

half year.

    The Kaplan-Meier estimated survival function for the gap-adjusted data is depicted in Fig-

ure 8. As expected, the survival function exhibits less early failure and more failure in later

times. For example, after two years the survival function for the benchmark data is 0.57 as

compared with 0.66 in the gap-adjusted data. By contrast, the hazard rate for the last twelve

years is just 12 percent in the benchmark data but 14 percent in the gap-adjusted data. As was

the case with the single spell and first spell alternatives we find that using the modified censoring


                                                 22
approach reduces the difference between the gap-adjusted and 7-digit TS data.

    Taken together, these results suggest that the independence assumption likely leads to an

under-estimate of duration although our analysis indicates that the magnitude of the bias is

fairly small for most scenarios. In particular, if one believes the modified censoring approach

best captures the true survival experience, the independence assumption does not appear to have

a significant impact under any of these scenarios.


Trade Weighted Analysis

The final issue we explore involves putting more weight on the higher valued trade relationships.

Our benchmark dataset — and in fact all of the preceding analysis — is unweighted. Small and

large trade value relationships receive the same weight. If short spells involve small values

and long spells involve large values, an unweighted distribution might overstate the brevity of

spells. To examine this issue, we also compute a weighted distribution where each observation

is weighed by the value of trade in the first year of the relationship. This alternative formulation

de-emphasizes the low-value spells and gives more importance to the high-value spells.

    In Figure 1 we plot the spell length distribution under this weighted alternative. Comparing

it with the benchmark data we observe a significant shift in the distribution, far greater than any

of the other alternatives. In the benchmark data, more than half the observations are observed

for just a single year. In the weighted analysis, only about 15 percent of the data is observed for

a single year This clearly suggests that lower value trade relationships tend to be shorted lived.

Nevertheless, even under the weighted scheme there remain a surfeit of short spells — more

than 50 percent of the spells are observed for four or fewer years.

    In Figure 8 we present the Kaplan-Meier estimated survival function for the weighted 7-

digit TS data. The impact on survival is far greater than under any of the alternatives previously

considered. In particular, the impact on duration is more significant than aggregating to the

                                                23
1-digit industry level or restricting ourselves to single spell relationships.


6. Duration and the product cycle

Feenstra and Rose (2000) rank countries according to the first year they export a product to the

US. They find that the order in which countries first export a product to the US is consistent

with macroeconomic rankings typically associated with technological progress. In other words,

they find that the rankings are consistent with the product cycle.

    We use duration methodology to compute country rankings. In other words, rather than

base the rankings on the first year of export, we rank countries on their survival experience. In

what follows, we report countries ranked according to the probability of exporting a product for

more than four years (
                      S(4)). We note, however, that given that the estimated survival functions

rarely cross, the country rankings are not sensitive to what spell length we use.18 In Table 4 we

report countries rank using the 7-digit TS benchmark data, the 7-digit TS modified censoring

data, and also the 5-digit SITC industry classification. We also reproduce the rankings reported

by Feenstra and Rose.

    The rankings based on estimated survival are similar for all definitions of trade relationships.

As reported in Table 5 the pairwise correlations are about 0.90. Nevertheless, there are a couple

of anomalies in the rankings based on the 7-digit TS benchmark data. Most notably, Macao has

the 10th best survival experience, far higher than for our other two survival rankings or Feenstra

and Rose. Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Haiti are also ranked implausibly high. Trade from each

of these countries appears to experience a high incidence of product code reclassifications as

their rankings drop sharply under the other survival calculations. These results provide further

evidence that censoring is a significant hurdle for analysis at the product level.
 18 The rankings would be virtually the same if we ranked the estimated survival functions in any year.




                                                       24
    Overall, the results based on survival experience are quite supportive of those found by

Feenstra and Rose. As seen in Table 5 the pairwise rank correlations between the two rankings

from Feenstra and Rose (2000), goods and country based, and the rankings based on survival

are high. The highest correlation is between Feenstra and Rose’s ranking our ranking based on

the 5-digit SITC data. This is likely due to the fact that their analysis is also performed at the

5-digit SITC level. Both rankings based on the 7-digit TS data are slightly less correlated with

Feenstra and Rose and of the two, the benchmark data is somewhat more highly correlated.

    An interesting lesson can be learned by having both Feenstra and Rose and our rankings.

Feenstra and Rose show that developed countries tend to be the first in the market. Our results

show that these same countries tend to successfully sell their products for a much longer dura-

tion than do the followers. Taken together, these results highlight an often overlooked value to

being a leader. Namely, as a unique product becomes standardized and production moves to the

South, competition among the followers is often fierce. As a result, exports in one year are no

guarantee of further sales.


7. Conclusion

The type of highly dynamic trade patterns evidenced in this paper are unanticipated given im-

plications from standard theoretical models and existing empirical work. Our results indicate

that typical trade relationships are more fragile than previously thought — or at least, than has

been previously discussed in the literature. In particular, we have never seen a discussion that

trade relationships may systematically last only a year or two.

    This paper is the first one to ask the question of how long trade relationships last. The sur-

prising findings shed light on entry and exit in foreign markets. The results of this paper are not

important just for the understanding of dynamics of international trade, but are also important



                                                25
for policy makers. Different policies can have important impacts on trade relationships, from

creating them to extending them to ending them. The length of trade relationships adds another

dimension to what policy makers must pay attention to.

    The results indicate that most trade relationships are very short. We also show that the

phenomena are not driven by the highly disaggregated nature of the data set. Aggregating the

data results in significantly longer durations only at very high aggregation levels. While the

actual duration increases with aggregation, the relative survival experience of countries and

industries is not affected by aggregation. There is evidence that the product cycle theory can

explain at least some features of the duration of trade as the countries with longest survival

times are those who are conventionally defined as technological leaders.

    Future work should focus on identifying and discriminating among potential explanations.

The product cycle is a reasonable starting point but there are others. Insights and lessons from

industrial organization literature are likely to be helpful. For instance, Ericson and Pakes (1995,

1998) develop a dynamic model of market entry and exit with some implications which are

observed in this paper. They show that firms are more likely to die in the early years of their

lives than later on, a finding we show is true for import trade relationships.19 Alternatively, our

findings could be consistent with a search model where the domestic buyers are searching for

the best partners in other countries.




 19 Another potentially interesting starting point is the model developed by Asplund and Nocke (2003).
