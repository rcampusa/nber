                                              ABSTRACT

Non-representational painting was one of the most radical artistic innovations of the twentieth century.
Abstract painting was created independently by three great pioneers - the experimental innovators
Kandinsky and Mondrian, and the conceptual Malevich - virtually simultaneously, in the years immediately
before and after the outbreak of World War I. It became the dominant form of advanced art in the
decade after the end of World War II, as Pollock, de Kooning, Rothko, and their colleagues developed
the experimental forms of Abstract Expressionism. But in the late 1950s and early ‘60s, Johns, Rauschenberg,
Warhol, and a host of other young artists abruptly made a conceptual revolution in advanced art, and
in the process reduced abstract painting to a minor role. The pioneers of abstract painting and the Abstract
Expressionists had all been committed to abstraction as a vehicle for artistic discovery, and had believed
that it would dominate the art of the future, but since the 1960s abstraction has become at most a part-time
style for leading painters, and it is often used to mock the seriousness of earlier abstract painters.

Introduction

               The abstract painter denounces representation of the outer world as
               a mechanical process of the eye and the hand in which the artist’s
               feelings and imagination have little part. Or in a Platonic manner
               he opposes to the representation of objects, as a rendering of the
               surface aspect of nature, the practice of abstract design as a
               discovery of the “essence” or underlying mathematical order of
               things.
                                              Meyer Schapiro, 19371

       Abstraction is perhaps the single most distinctive development in twentieth-century

painting. It is also among the most misunderstood, not only by the general public, but also by

many in the art world. In part this is a consequence of its variety, for artists have made non-

representational art from many different motives, using many different techniques. This paper

will trace the changing role of abstraction in painting over time, considering the goals of some

of its most important practitioners, and examining their methods. Before presenting a

chronological treatment, however, it is valuable to begin with a cautionary lesson.

Deceptive Appearances

               [W]ith Mondrian, arriving at the idea was of exceptional
               importance. The conception came before the painting; it was the
               primary act of creation.
                                             Harold Rosenberg, 19712

       When Piet Mondrian died in 1944, the critic Clement Greenberg declared that his

painting “takes its place beside the greatest art.” Greenberg went on to defend the mechanical

nature of Mondrian’s art: “Perhaps Mondrian will be reproached for the anonymity with which

he strove for the ruled precision of the geometer and the machine in executing his paintings: their

conceptions can be communicated by a set of specifications and dimensions, sight unseen, and

realized by a draftsman. But so could the conception of the Parthenon.”3
                                                   4

       In 1995, the scholars Angelica Rudenstine, Yve-Alain Bois, Joop Joosten, Hans Janssen,

and John Elderfield called attention to a “a problem of perception” involving Mondrian’s art:

“Mondrian’s early partisans praised his work as a blueprint for modern architecture or

typography, as ‘formal experimentation’ destined to be ‘applied’ in various fields; and his neo-

plastic work has often been characterized (admiringly) as that of a geometric designer.” They

emphasized that their research had led them to a very different understanding of Mondrian’s

working process: “As becomes especially clear from this selection of unfinished works,

Mondrian’s abstract work was far from geometric or mathematical in its origin or expression;

rather, it was the product of a highly intuitive mind and hand, gradually working toward

carefully modulated but far from measurable composition solutions.”4

       Accounts by friends of Mondrian testify to the absence of preconception in his art. An

artist who knew him in Paris in the 1920s recalled watching him work: “If the black line was too

thick, he’d take a piece of white paper, or a paper of about the same color as the color planes

next to that line, and then he pasted it onto the canvas, and then held it at a distance to see ‘is the

line the way I want it or not.’”5 When the artist Charmion von Wiegand first met Mondrian in

New York late in his life, she recorded that “He explained that he did not work with instruments

nor through analysis, but by means of intuition and the eye. He tests each picture over a long

period by eye: it is a physical adjustment of proportion through training, intuition, and testing.”6

       Von Wiegand became a close friend of Mondrian’s, and studied his art. Interestingly, she

reported that although he famously restricted his palette to primary colors, their precise

composition was never constant: “his hues changed in every picture. His red was never the same

red, nor his blue the same blue. It had to be in perfect equilibrium with the whole painting and
                                                   5

the proportions of each plane. He was very aware of how color interaction can change a hue and

make a red look bluer or a blue look redder.” She was shocked when she first saw what would

prove to be his last completed painting, Broadway Boogie Woogie, with its many small colored

squares that violated Mondrian’s published generalizations about his art. She recalled that “I

exclaimed: ‘But Mondrian, it’s against the theory!’ I remember him standing back from the

painting, squinting his eyes, and saying, ‘But it works. You must remember, Charmion, that the

paintings come first and the theory comes from the paintings.’”7 The painter Carl Holty, who

also knew Mondrian in New York, wrote of his constant revision of his works in progress:

“Watching the pictures change into others as he worked, I asked him whether he wasn’t losing

good pictures in numbers because of his exigence. He said, ‘I don’t want pictures. I just want to

find things out.’”8

       On the basis of an intensive technical study of Mondrian’s late paintings, Ron Spronk

concluded that “He scraped away paint and often stripped parts of the paint surface and ground

layer to the bare canvas. These reworkings left their marks on the paintings. Many of them are

visible to the naked eye or can be seen with a microscope; others are hidden by (sometimes

multiple) layers of thick paint and need to be revealed by other means.”9 One example is

afforded by Composition with Red, Yellow, and Blue, which Mondrian dated as completed in

1942. The painting was photographed in 1934, and again in 1936, and it was recently X-rayed by

the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Spronk reported in part that “Close comparison of the

images from April-May 1934, 1936, the present state, and the X-radiograph shows changes to

the composition both before and after the first state was completed in 1935. Between the 1934

photograph and the completion of the first state, the left vertical black line was shifted to the left,
                                                   6

the yellow color field was enlarged downward and the top horizontal brought down accordingly,

and the lower horizontal line was moved up. The black bar at upper left was widened and moved

up, while the lower black bar was widened and moved down. In the final, 1942 state Mondrian

added the blue field, the black and red bars at lower left, and the central horizontal black line.

The upper black bar was changed to a red bar, moved upward, and widened. The lower black bar

of the first state was brought down still further.”10

        Technical examination of his paintings and eyewitness accounts by Mondrian’s friends

thus support the artist’s own claims that his art was made empirically and visually rather than

theoretically and mathematically. Both Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg were deceived

by the appearance of his completed paintings into drawing the false conclusion that Mondrian

worked mechanically, by preconception.11 Mondrian was not a conceptual artist, who privileged

ideas, and for whom conception preceded execution, but rather an experimental innovator, who

allowed theory to emerge from his paintings, who worked by trial and error, and whose primary

goal was to learn from the process of making his paintings. The cautionary lesson is clear. If

even highly respected critics can make such basic errors, it must always be kept in mind that

simply looking at a painter’s finished works is not sufficient to understand how and why they

were made: the appearance of paintings alone cannot be assumed to reveal the methods and goals

of the artist.

The Pioneers

                 We, the abstractionists of today, will be regarded in time as the
                 “pioneers” of abstract art, who had the good fortune, through
                 clairvoyance, to live perhaps centuries ahead of our time.
                                                Wassily Kandinsky, 192212

        Abstract painting was first developed in the years immediately before and after the
                                                 7

outbreak of World War I. The three great pioneers – Kandinsky, Mondrian, and Malevich –

independently arrived at very different forms of abstraction, through different means, from very

different motives. Yet all three made their discoveries with the confident belief that abstract art

would play an active role in creating a better world in the future, whether by directly affecting

social behavior or by complementing the impact of political institutions.

       In an essay titled “Reminiscences,” written at the height of his career in 1913, Kandinsky

described the development of his art. He recalled a key event that occurred in 1896, when he

was 30, which contributed to his decision to become a full-time artist. At an exhibition of the art

of the French impressionists in Moscow, for the first time he came upon a painting that was not

obviously realistic: “That it was a haystack, the catalogue informed me. I didn’t recognize it. I

found this nonrecognition painful, and thought that the painter had no right to paint so

indistinctly.” In spite of his discomfort, Kandinsky discovered that the painting had seized his

imagination: “I noticed with surprise and confusion that the picture not only gripped me, but

impressed itself ineradicably upon my memory, always hovering quite unexpectedly before my

eyes, down to the last detail. …What was… quite clear to me was the unsuspected power of the

palette, previously concealed from me, which exceeded all my dreams. Painting took on a fairy-

tale power and splendor. And, albeit unconsciously, objects were discredited as an essential

element within the picture.”13 Kandinsky’s account revealed that he was intensely affected by a

visual event, as his first sight of a Monet not only demonstrated the power of color, but also

planted the seed that would eventually grow into the realization that effective art need not be

representational.

       Another pivotal event occurred several years later, after Kandinsky had moved to Munich
                                                  8

to study painting:

               I was enchanted on one occasion by an unexpected spectacle that
               confronted me in my studio. It was the hour when dusk draws in.
               I returned home with my painting box having finished a study, still
               dreamy and absorbed in the work I had completed, and suddenly
               saw an indescribably beautiful picture, pervaded by an inner glow.
               At first, I stopped short and then quickly approached this
               mysterious picture, on which I could discern only forms and colors
               and whose content was incomprehensible. At once, I discovered
               the key to the puzzle: it was a picture I had painted, standing on its
               side against the wall.

The next day, Kandinsky was unable to recapture his enchantment with the picture: “even on its

side, I constantly recognized objects, and the fine bloom of dusk was missing.” He drew a

simple but momentous conclusion: “Now I could see clearly that objects harmed my pictures.”14

       The empirical and visual source of Kandinsky’s belief in the validity of abstract art points

to his experimental nature as an artist. The same is true of the extended process by which he

gradually developed his form of abstract art. Thus he reflected in 1913 that “Only after many

years of patient toil and strenuous thought, numerous painstaking attempts, and my constantly

developing ability to conceive of pictorial forms in purely abstract forms, engrossing myself

more and more in these measureless depths, did I arrive at the pictorial forms I use today, on

which I am working today and which, as I hope and desire, will themselves develop much

further.” He recognized that he had to proceed intuitively, letting forms appear as he worked:

“My only consolation is that I have never been able to persuade myself to use a form that arose

within me by way of logic, rather than feeling. I could not devise such forms, and it disgusts me

when I see them. Every form I ever used arrived ‘of its own accord,’ presenting itself fully

fledged before my eyes, so that I had only to copy it, or else constituting itself actually in the

course of work, often to my surprise.”15 What Kandinsky came to understand was that he could
                                                   9

only create his art gradually, and that abstraction could only come at the end of a “long path,

which I had to follow.”16

       Kandinsky considered painting as a “struggle with the canvas,” in the course of which he

“derived spiritual experiences from the sensations of colors on the palette.”17 While he worked

he was constantly sensitive to the appearance of the developing image: “The artist ‘hears’ how

something or other tells him: ‘Hold it! Where? The line is too long. It has to be shortened, but

only a little bit!’ ‘Just a little bit, I tell you.’ Or: ‘Do you want the red to stand out more?

Good! Then add some green. Now they will “clash” a little, take off a little. But only a little, I

tell you.’” Response to the work in progress was essential: “One must have the perception to

‘listen’ when the voice sounds. Otherwise, no art.”18 The importance of vision led Kandinsky to

reject systems: “My advice, then, is to mistrust logic in art.”19

       Kandinsky evolved gradually from a painter of landscapes into a painter of images

abstracted from landscapes. Unlike most experimental artists, he routinely made preparatory

drawings, watercolors, and even oil sketches for his early abstract paintings. Unlike conceptual

artists, however, for whom a painting is often an enlarged replica of a final preparatory image,

Kandinsky’s paintings are generally the last, most abstract, stage of a progression, in which the

image became progressively more divorced from reality as each sketch moved farther from the

recognizable forms of the first drawing. Thus when Kandinsky spoke of hiding or concealing

objects in the approach to abstraction, he was not referring to a process that occurred in the

course of application of successive layers of paint to single canvas, but rather one that was

carried out in a series of separate works. Once consequence of this is that ambiguous objects in

his early abstract paintings can often be identified by consulting the related preparatory works.
                                                10

Vivian Barnett made this point in discussing a key series of early abstractions:

               Kandinsky’s Improvisations... retain unmistakable references to
               his favorite, recurrent motifs. They contain multiple and abstract
               images of horses, riders, boats, rowers, waves, cannons,
               graveyards, citadels and reclining lovers... In formulating the
               Improvisations between 1911 and 1913, the artist made
               preparatory watercolor sketches. By studying a group of related
               watercolors with the final oil version, it becomes clear that
               Kandinsky moved away from the object, obscuring the specific
               motif so only allusions to its representational origins are retained.
               Sometimes he executed a detailed watercolor on which he based a
               canvas... In the large oil paintings the forms have been obscured to
               an even greater degree than in the preparatory study. The images
               have been abstracted from nature to such an extent that they cannot
               easily be identified or “read.”20

       Scholars have remarked on the causes and consequences of Kandinsky’s experimental

approach. Alan Bowness observed that during his approach to abstraction “Kandinsky was a

man struggling in the dark. He was aware of this – it is part of his historic importance that he

admitted that neither the creation nor the appreciation of a work of art is an exclusively

conscious process.”21 Kandinsky’s friend and biographer Will Grohmann stressed that he

achieved abstraction not decisively, from theory, but tentatively, from experience:

               It is only with the greatest caution that Kandinsky made the
               transition to abstract forms. Had he been guided by theory alone,
               he could easily, after he wrote On the Spiritual in Art (i.e., from
               1910 onward), have completely eliminated naturalistic elements
               from his painting. In actual fact it took him four years to reach that
               point, and he was still painting landscapes as late as 1913.
               Kandinsky did not want to paint decorative works, states of mind,
               or music. He consciously aimed at the pictorial, and for this
               reason he had to try to retain the forms he had intuitively
               experienced, but at the same time he filled them with the content
               of his lived experience.22

Analyzing Kandinsky’s work of this transitional period, David Sylvester compared his practice

to that of another great experimental painter: “The incompleteness of these paintings – the way
                                                 11

that passages are left unresolved – is something like the incompleteness of an unfinished

Cézanne still life.”23

        Mondrian’s development of abstract art also originated in a process of simplification of

real scenes: as he wrote in 1914, “I am seeking to approach truth as closely as possible, and to

abstract everything from it until I reach the foundations (always visible foundations!) of

things.”24 He carried out this process gradually and tentatively. A Dutch friend recalled being

with Mondrian in Domburg in 1914: “On a walk beside the ocean, late in the evening, under a

radiant, starry sky, he took a tiny sketchbook out of his pocket and made a scribbled drawing of a

starry night. For days he worked over that suggestive little scribble. Every day he took a tiny step

further away from reality and came a tiny step nearer to the spiritual evocation of it.”25 The

critic Michel Seuphor, a friend of Mondrian’s, recalled his extreme attention to detail, finding

progress in changes so small that others might fail to notice: “Even so, it’s another step,’ he

once said to a friend who was studying a new picture of his, ‘or don’t you think so? Don’t you

find that it represents even a little step forward?’”26 For Mondrian, this process of incremental

change made all his work part of a single continuous progression: “I began as a naturalistic

painter. Very quickly I felt the urgent need for a more concise form of expression and an

economy of means. I never stopped progressing toward abstraction. One period flows logically

from the one before.”27 The cumulative effect of Mondrian’s many marginal changes was very

great. David Sylvester observed that “A Mondrian retrospective is not just a procession of great

pictures, but a progression which in itself is an aesthetic experience: the trajectory of a man’s art

becomes as much a thing of beauty as the art.”28

        Mondrian not only made changes from one painting to the next, but also within the
                                                12

execution of individual works. Joop Joosten and Angelica Rudenstine stressed that “Mondrian’s

compositional method was anything but systematic or mathematical... Nothing was

predetermined. Reworking, rethinking, and refining characterized his resolution of every

problem.”29 His revisions often occurred over extended periods. So for example when Mondrian

traveled to New York in 1940, he took with him 17 paintings that he had started in Paris and

London during the preceding five years. He exhibited these “transatlantic paintings” in New

York in 1942, and he inscribed on them dates indicating the intervals during which he had

revised them: thus Composition with Red, Yellow, and Blue, which was discussed above, was

dated 1935-42.30 Technical analysis of these transatlantic paintings led Ron Spronk to conclude

that “Mondrian routinely reworked his compositions in his New York years, and these revisions

were often elaborate and invasive.”31 Even the size of his paintings was provisional, as

throughout his career, Mondrian’s uncertainty about his finished works led him “to create most

of his paintings on supports whose final size was determined during the working process.”32

Charmion von Wiegand recalled that “Mondrian was never finished with a painting, which

further proves that he had no predetermined compositional ideas. He would change a picture

over and over again.” When she asked him why he didn’t make a series of paintings instead of

repeatedly revising Victory Boogie-Woogie, the large work that remained unfinished at his death,

Mondrian replied, “It is not important to make many pictures but that I have one picture right.”33

       Although the appearance of their paintings differed enormously, the experimental artists

Kandinsky and Mondrian both arrived at non-representational images by a gradual and visual

process of abstraction from nature. The conceptual Malevich did not. In 1916, he declared that

“The artist can be a creator only when the forms in his picture have nothing in common with
                                                 13

nature.”34 Nor must progress necessarily be gradual: “in art it is not always a case of evolution,

but sometimes also of revolution.”35 He also believed that art should follow rules: “in

constructing painterly forms it is essential to have a system for their construction, a law for the

constructional inter-relationships of forms.”36 These rules should be derived from theory: “The

system, hard, cold and unsmiling, is brought into motion by philosophical thought.”37

       John Milner observed that by 1913, when he began the key period in his development of

abstract art, Malevich and his colleagues Lyubov Popova and Vladimir Tatlin “were all three

constructing figures on the basis of geometry.” Rather that simplifying natural objects, they

were using mathematical relationships to create generalized forms: “Individuality, likeness and

character were all of secondary importance.” Milner concluded that “In preferring generalized

form to specific detail, and the approach of constructing with geometry, these painters

relinquished the whole realist tradition.”38 Larissa Zhadova explained that Suprematism, which

Malevich designated as the successor to Cubism and Futurism, was intended to symbolize the

cosmos, but not to resemble it: “His pictures can be described as images of the world’s cosmic

space. But they are not copied from nature; this is not the space one sees by looking at the blue

sky above one’s head. They are hypothetical images, conceptual images, plastic formulation

images, ‘factorizations’ carried out by the artist’s imagination.”39

       Malevich considered Suprematism a radical new departure, that would effectively negate

all previous representational painting.40 The apocalyptic tone of the manifesto Malevich wrote

for the 1915 exhibition that announced the arrival of the new art underscored the drama of the

breakthrough, as he announced that “I have transformed myself into the zero of form, and

dragged myself out of the rubbish-filled pool of Academic art.” Denouncing the imitation of
                                                  14

nature as the cowardly act of artists lacking in creativity, he declared that “to gain the new

artistic culture, art approaches creation as an end in itself and domination over the forms of

nature.” The emblem of the new movement was to be his painting, Black Square: “The square is

a living, royal infant. It is the first step of pure creation in art.” Art would be changed forever:

“Our world of art has become new, non-objective, pure.” He closed with an appeal to all: “We,

Suprematists, throw open the way to you. Hurry! - For tomorrow you will not recognize us.”41

John Golding contended that Malevich’s art justified his rhetoric: “To be confronted by

Malevich’s work is like travelling in uncharted territory.”42

       Kandinsky’s early experiences in Russia, which included ethnographic research on folk

art and a commitment to the Russian Orthodox Church, gave him an awareness of the moral

aspects of art, and an abiding belief in its healing and redemptive properties.43 Mondrian

believed in Theosophy, and from it he became convinced that all life is directed toward

evolution, and that the purpose of art is to give expression to that evolution.44 Kandinsky and

Mondrian thus both believed that the beauty of abstract art could accomplish utopian social

goals, but they were vague in explaining how and when this might occur. Malevich had more

immediate goals, as in 1918 he took Russia’s political revolution as a model for art: “The social

revolution which smashed the chains of capitalist slavery, has not yet smashed the old tables of

aesthetic values.” He was confident, however, that art had a key role to play in the new society,

as the next year he asserted that “The aesthetic, the pictorial, takes part in the construction of the

whole world.”45

       The three pioneers of abstract painting were all important figures in early twentieth-

century art: Kandinsky was a leader of German Expressionism, Mondrian was initially the leader
                                                 15

of the Dutch De St−l movement, and Malevich was the founder of Russian Suprematism. Yet

Paris remained the center of advanced art, and the dominant figures there had the broadest

influence overall. The Cubists Picasso and Braque approached abstraction before World War I,

but their decision to stop short of it, together with Matisse’s steadfast dedication to

representation, prevented abstraction from taking the central place in advanced painting early in

the century.

Abstract Expressionism

               The consciousness of the personal and spontaneous in the painting
               and sculpture stimulates the artist to invent devices of handling,
               processing, surfacing, which confer to the utmost degree the aspect
               of the freely made. Hence the great importance of the mark, the
               stroke, the brush, the drip, the quality of the substance of the paint
               itself, and the surface of the canvas as a texture and field of
               operation – all signs of the artist’s active presence. The work of
               art is an ordered world of its own kind in which we are aware, at
               every point, of its becoming.

       It was only after World War II, with the emergence of Abstract Expressionism in New

York and Tachisme in Paris, that abstraction became the dominant form of advanced art. The

leading Abstract Expressionists, including Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko,

Arshile Gorky, Barnett Newman, and Robert Motherwell, became more influential than their

counterparts in Paris, the most prominent of whom were Pierre Soulages, Jean Fautrier, Hans

Hartung, and Nicolas de Staël.47 Although the two groups had little contact during their

formative years, and had little direct influence on each other artistically, they shared a number of

basic characteristics, including their belief in the need to create new forms of art and their

conviction that this should be done experimentally, by trial and error, rather than conceptually,
                                                  16

by the application of theory. Although these artists came to maturity little more than three

decades after the pioneers of abstraction, two world wars and a great economic depression had

occurred in this brief span, so it is not surprising that they did not share either the optimistic

utopianism of the pioneers, or their belief in the power of art to improve society. Instead, the

artists who led the new movements in both New York and Paris were individualistic, and their

goals were more personal and introspective than those of their predecessors. So for example in

1948 Barnett Newman declared that American painters, “free from the weight of European

culture” and its “outmoded images,” were creating a new art for a new age: “Instead of making

cathedrals out of Christ, man, or ‘life,’ we are making them out of ourselves, out of our own

feelings.”48

        The Abstract Expressionists were deeply influenced by Surrealism, which was perhaps

the most important European development in advanced art between the wars. Most generally,

the Abstract Expressionists took from the Surrealists the idea of drawing on the subconscious to

produce new, personal images. So for example in 1943 Mark Rothko and Adoph Gottlieb wrote

a statement of their beliefs, which included the propositions that “To us art is an adventure into

an unknown world,” that “This world of the imagination is…violently opposed to common

sense,” and that “It is our function as artists to make the spectator see the world our way - not

his way.”49 Jackson Pollock explained in 1950 that modern artists wanted to express the aims of

contemporary society: “we have a mechanical means of representing objects in nature such as

the camera,” and consequently, “The modern artist, it seems to me, is inventing and expressing

an inner world.”50

        A number of the Abstract Expressionists, including Pollock, borrowed the device of
                                                17

automatism from the Surrealists, in order to accomplish their goal of painting from the

unconscious. Yet the Americans used this technique differently from the Europeans. André

Masson, Joan Miró, and other Surrealists often began their paintings with random markings, then

finished them by developing the figures and symbols they found to be suggested by these

markings. In contrast, the Americans did not use automatism to create figurative works, but

instead used the initial markings as the basis for coherent but still abstract compositions. Pollock

and other Abstract Expressionists thus adapted automatism to their own purposes, in order to

create a new and more spontaneous way of producing abstract images. Pollock explained in

1948 that “When I am in my painting, I’m not aware of what I’m doing. It is only after a sort of

‘get acquainted’ period that I see what I have been about.”51 Pollock’s celebrated drip method of

applying paint, with the inevitable spattering and puddling that could not be completely

controlled by the artist, was one means of escaping from preconceived ideas and forms.

       Whether or not they used the technique of automatism, the Abstract Expressionists

almost unanimously subscribed to the belief that the artist should work without preconception.

Indeed, perhaps the most basic shared characteristic of the group was their goal of allowing

unexpected forms to emerge during the process of painting. Pollock declared that, while

working, “I have no fears about making changes, destroying the image, etc., because the painting

has a life of its own. I try to let it come through.”52 Rothko explained that “I think of my

pictures as dramas; the shapes in the pictures are the performers. Neither the action nor the

actors can be anticipated, or described in advance.” The painter’s initial ideas were only a point

of departure: “Ideas and plans that existed in the mind at the start were simply the doorway

through which one left the world in which they occur…The picture must be for [the artist], as for
                                                 18

anyone experiencing it later, a revelation.”53 De Kooning reflected that “I find sometimes a

terrific picture… but I couldn’t set out to do that, you know.”54 The importance of the working

process to their art in fact led one of the group’s leading supporters, the critic Harold Rosenberg,

to suggest in 1952 that they should properly be called “action painters,” on the grounds that their

paintings were records of the act of their own making. Rosenberg argued that “At a certain

moment the canvas began to appear to one American painter after another as an arena in which

to act – rather than as a space in which to reproduce, re-design, analyze or ‘express’ an object,

actual or imagined. What was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event.”55 To increase

the visual impact of their gestures, many of the Abstract Expressionists worked on wall-sized

canvases that allowed the viewer to become engulfed by their images.

       For most of the Abstract Expressionists, repeated revision of their works in progress was

a routine consequence of their uncertain goals. The painter and critic Elaine de Kooning

described how intensively her husband worked on his paintings in the early ‘50s: “He worked

on these one at a time – just all day, every day. Even the small ones. Even if it took a year…[0]n

any given canvas, I saw hundreds of images go by. I mean, paintings that were masterpieces. I

would come in at night and find they had been painted away.”56 Because they wanted to

discover new forms and images, for some of the artists much of this time was spent looking at

their works in progress. An assistant who worked for Rothko during the ‘50s recalled that he

“would sit and look for long periods, sometimes for hours, sometimes for days, considering the

next color, considering expanding an area.” A biographer concluded that “since the late 1940s

Rothko, building up his canvases with thin glazes of quickly applied paint, had spent more time

considering his evolving works than he had in the physical act of producing them.”57
                                                 19

       Their uncertainty about their goals equally led to difficulties in deciding when a painting

was finished. During the last decade of his life, Pollock painted on lengths of canvas unrolled

and laid flat on the floor, and he often began without determining either the size or orientation of

the finished work. His widow, the painter Lee Krasner, recalled how this complicated the

process of completing a picture: “Sometimes he’d ask, ‘Should I cut it here? Should this be the

bottom?’ He’d have long sessions of cutting and editing…Those were difficult sessions. His

signing the canvases was even worse. I’d think everything was settled – tops, bottoms, margins

– and then he’d have last-minute thoughts and doubts. He hated signing. There’s something so

final about a signature.”58 Barnett Newman stressed the continuity in his own enterprise by

declaring that “I think the idea of a ‘finished’ picture is a fiction. I think a man spends his

whole lifetime painting one picture or working on one sculpture.”59

       The Abstract Expressionists worked for long periods to create their mature styles, and the

eventual results were so novel and radical that even the artists themselves were uncertain about

their achievement. Thus for example Robert Motherwell wrote of helping a friend, William

Baziotes, hang the paintings for Baziotes’ first gallery exhibition in 1944. When they finished,

Motherwell recalled that Baziotes was seized by anxiety: “Suddenly, he looked at me and said,

‘You’re the one I trust; if you tell me the show is no good, I’ll take it right down and cancel it.’

At that moment, I had no idea whether it was good or not - it seemed so far out; but I reassured

him that it was - there was nothing else I could do.” Motherwell’s doubt went beyond the

immediate issue of the quality of Baziotes’ paintings: “You see, at the opposite side of the coin

of the abstract expressionists’ ambition and of our not giving a damn, was also not knowing

whether our pictures were even pictures, let alone whether they were any good.”60 Similarly, Lee
                                                 20

Krasner remembered that during the early 1950s, even after he had been recognized as a leader

of the Abstract Expressionists, Jackson Pollock had shared the same doubt, as one day “in front

of a very good painting... he asked me, ‘Is this a painting?’ Not is this a good painting or a bad

one, but a painting! The degree of doubt was unbelievable at times.”61

       The Tachistes were as diverse stylistically as the Abstract Expressionists, and each of

them also developed signature abstract forms based on distinctive gestures. Their commitment

to an experimental method was strikingly similar to that of the Americans. So for example

Pierre Soulages explained that he painted by instinct: “Often I decide to do something, to

intervene in a certain way and I don’t know why, and I don’t seek to know why.” He discovered

forms as he worked: “It’s a kind of dialogue between what I think is being born on the canvas,

and what I feel, and step by step, I advance and it transforms itself and develops, becomes

clearer and more intense in a way that interests me or not. Sometimes it surprises me; those

aren’t the worst times, when I lose my way and another appears, unexpectedly.” The decision

that a painting was finished was made on visual grounds, over a period of time: “When I see that

I can’t add much without changing everything, I stop and consider that the picture is finished for

the moment…Then I turn the picture to the wall and I don’t look at it for several days, several

weeks, sometimes several months. And then when I look at it again, if it still seems to

accomplish something, if it seems alive, then it can leave the studio.”62

       The generation of artists who came to maturity after World War II represented the high

point of abstraction in the twentieth century: this was the one generation in which virtually all of

the most important painters made their greatest contributions in an abstract idiom.63 The

pioneers of abstraction had confidently believed that abstraction would be the art of the future,
                                                21

but for them this had been a matter of faith. During the early 1950s the Abstract Expressionists

and their supporters could legitimately feel that abstraction had become the dominant form of

advanced art. Remarkably, within a decade after the end of World War II, Pollock, de Kooning,

Rothko, and a few dozen other artists had simultaneously shifted the center of the art world from

Europe to the United States, and made Abstract Expressionism the dominant style of advanced

American painting.64 And unlike the diverse attitudes of the pioneers, the abstraction that

emerged at mid-century was based on a shared set of attitudes and practices. David Sylvester

summarized these, observing that “Most of the artists whose styles were formed in the 1940s

subscribed to the idea that making art meant feeling one’s way through unknown territory … Art

was the lonely journey of existentialist man… This common ethical ideal led to a generally

shared attribute of style: the way in which the work was made was more or less visible in the

end-product.”65

After Abstract Expressionism

               Especially in the last fifty years, a lot of abstract art has
               demonstrated that our intelligence innovates not by making things
               up out of whole cloth or by discovering new things about nature,
               but by operating with and upon the repertoire of the already
               known; by adapting, recycling, isolating, recontextualizing,
               repositioning, and recombining inherited, available conventions in
               order to propose new entities as the bearers of new thought.
                                               Kirk Varnedoe, 200366

       Although a number of important Abstract Expressionists worked through the 1960s, the

demise of Abstract Expressionism as the central form of advanced art began when Jackson

Pollock died in an automobile accident in 1956, progressed further when Jasper Johns had his

first gallery exhibition in New York in 1958, and was effectively completed when Andy Warhol

and Pop art exploded on the art world in 1962. Nearly all of the forms of abstract painting that
                                                 22

have been developed since Pollock’s death have been reactions to Abstract Expressionism.

       A basic division appears among the abstract painters who came to maturity during the

late 1950s and the ‘60s. One group followed the Abstract Expressionists, trying to extend their

art while accepting their basic attitudes and methods. Another group rebelled against Abstract

Expressionism, and created a variety of new forms of abstraction that nearly always consisted of

a direct and negative comment on the older art. This basic division followed a clear pattern, for

the followers of the Abstract Expressionists were experimental artists, whereas those who

repudiated Abstract Expressionism were conceptual.

       The following discussion will briefly examine the motives and methods of some of the

key figures in each of the two camps. It should immediately be emphasized that during the past

five decades, styles of abstraction have proliferated. The reasons for this will be seen here, but

one consequence is that no treatment on the scale of this one can possibly be complete in

coverage: there are too many important artists, who have created too many different approaches

to abstraction, to examine all of them even briefly. What this discussion will do is to consider

how, and why, some of the most important painters from the late 1950s on have gone about

making abstract art.

       Most of the key experimental abstract painters of recent times first emerged during the

late ‘50s, as direct followers of the Abstract Expressionists – often students and friends of the

older artists. These were primarily younger artists who were inspired by the beauty of the

Abstract Expressionists’ art, and excited by their conviction and commitment to existentialist

ideals. So for example Helen Frankenthaler recalled that when she first saw Pollock’s paintings

in 1951, shortly after she had graduated from college and moved to New York to become an
                                                  23

artist, “It was if I suddenly went to a foreign country but didn’t know the language, but had read

enough and had a passionate interest, and was eager to live there. I wanted to live in this land; I

had to live there, and master the language.”67 Frankenthaler followed Pollock in applying paint

without touching the canvas. She achieved novel results, however, by pouring thinned pigment

onto canvas that had not been primed: the diluted paint soaked into the fabric of the canvas, and

produced a visual effect closer to watercolor than to traditional oil painting. Kenneth Noland

and Morris Louis emulated Frankenthaler’s new technique, and produced new forms of

abstraction that featured pure colors stained into canvases that were often as large as Pollock’s

late works. The paint was absorbed into the canvas, and the pigment consequently did not create

the surface texture that was visible in Pollock’s paintings. Because there was nothing to distract

from the effect of the areas of color, this art was often called “color-field” abstraction.68

       A number of younger experimental painters followed the Abstract Expressionists in

developing their own distinctive abstract forms, that became recognizable as their signature

marks or gestures. Joan Mitchell and Sam Francis were prominent among these. The beauty of

their work was based on the interaction of their imaginative use of color and their free, often

calligraphic brushstrokes.69

       The first-generation Abstract Expressionists were all born before 1920. Most of their

second-generation followers, including Frankenthaler, Noland, Mitchell, and Francis, were born

between 1920 and 1930. Relatively few important experimental abstract painters emerged from

later birth cohorts. One who did is Brice Marden, who was born in 1938. Marden is an avowedly

visual artist who works without preconception: “If you’re not working with preconceived forms

and thinking, then you can concentrate on expression.” He hopes to make discoveries while
                                                  24

working: “There are times when a work has pulled ahead of me and goes on to become

something new to me, something that I have never seen before; that is finishing in an

exhilarating way.”70 Marden admires Cézanne’s “intense, long, slow process of working,

looking, assimilating.”71 Marden has also acknowledged his debt to Pollock. In 1989, he

explained that Pollock’s approach had affected his attitude toward his own art: “The great thing

about Pollock ... was his conviction that each work is part of a continuing quest. To be an artist is

not about making individual works. To be an artist is to do your work and let your work express

the evolution of a vision.”72

       Marden’s comments about Cézanne and Pollock focus on central elements of the

experimental approach to art in general. The long, slow process of development and the

conviction that the artist is engaged in a quest for a personal vision together point to a shared

characteristic of all the experimental abstract painters discussed here, from Kandinsky and

Mondrian through the two generations of Abstract Expressionists - namely the goal of creation

by the individual of a unique signature style. At some point in their careers, each of these artists

became committed to abstraction, and for nearly all of them this subsequently became a lifelong

commitment to that form. Even in those cases, including Pollock and de Kooning, in which the

artist returned to varieties of figuration, this occurred gradually, and within an aesthetic of color,

brushstrokes, and forms that demonstrated clear continuities with their earlier non-

representational work.

       The conceptual approaches to abstraction that have been developed since Pollock’s death

are generally very different. Not only are they extremely diverse in style and purpose, as will be

described below in a number of specific cases, but almost without exception they do not have the
                                                 25

characteristic of commitment. Since the demise of Abstract Expressionism, conceptual painters

have developed the novel practice of part-time abstraction - of alternating between making

representational paintings and abstract paintings. And beyond this absence of commitment to

abstraction, most of these artists have lacked a commitment even to a single style of abstraction.

One of the most important painters of the era, Andy Warhol, clearly demonstrates both of these

practices. Thus although Warhol’s most celebrated paintings, including those of Marilyn Monroe

and Campbell’s soup cans, were based on photographs, he made non-representational paintings

at a number of points in his career, and he made these abstract paintings in a number of

completely different ways, in completely different styles. Not surprisingly, Warhol explained

that this should not be a source of concern: “an artist ought to be able to change his style without

feeling bad.”73 Many of his fellow conceptual artists shared this opinion, and this is a distinctive

feature of conceptual abstraction since the late 1950s.

       The aesthetic of Abstract Expressionism and Tachisme was a powerful presence in the

advanced art world of the 1950s, and ambitious young conceptual artists quickly rebelled against

it on both sides of the Atlantic. Robert Rauschenberg is a prominent early example of an artist

who was deeply influenced by the Abstract Expressionists, but who reacted against their art in a

number of ways. Rauschenberg conceded that he owed a great debt to the Abstract

Expressionists, but he stressed that “I was never interested in their pessimism or editorializing.

You have to have time to feel sorry for yourself if you’re going to be a good Abstract

Expressionist, and I think I always considered that a waste.”74 His artistic rejections of Abstract

Expressionism were not subtle. So for example in 1953 the 28-year-old Rauschenberg carefully

erased a drawing by de Kooning that the older artist had given him, somewhat reluctantly, for
                                                 26

this purpose. Rauschenberg framed the work, and titled it Erased de Kooning Drawing. He

considered it “a legitimate work of art, created by the technique of erasing.”75 Harold Rosenberg

described this as a turning point: “Art-historically, the erasing could be seen as symbolic act of

liberation from the pervasive force of Abstract Expressionism... ‘Erased de Kooning’ became the

cornerstone of a new academy, devoted to replacing the arbitrary self of the artist with

predefined processes and objectives.”76

       Many of the conceptual reactions to Abstract Expressionism not only appear to comment

on that style, but to do so ironically. In 1957, Rauschenberg produced Factum I and Factum II,

two paintings with collage elements, done in an Abstract Expressionist style, that appear

identical, even to the drips of paint that run down from the smeared brushstrokes. The two

paintings have been widely interpreted as a parody of the Abstract Expressionists’ insistence on

spontaneity and uniqueness.77 Their somewhat obscure titles may underscore this challenge, for

an obsolete definition of “factum” is from mathematics: “the product of two or more factors.”

The two paintings are in any case early examples of preconceived, conceptual abstract paintings

that are designed to appear unplanned and experimental.78

       As a young artist in Paris during the 1950s, Yves Klein explored the use of pure color to

represent the infinite in nature, an interest that he had developed looking at the sea and sky

during his childhood on the Mediterranean coast of southern France. He wanted to make abstract

paintings, but he strongly rejected the attitudes of the Tachistes, and their emphasis on the use of

gesture as personal expression: “ I detest artists who empty themselves in their paintings, as is

often the case today... In place of thinking of beauty, goodness, truth, they render, ejaculate, spit

out all their horrible, impoverished and infectious complexity in their paintings as if to relieve
                                                   27

themselves.”79 In 1955, Klein began to make monochrome paintings, each a single uniform

color, most often the intense ultramarine pigment he patented as International Klein Blue, or

IKB. Initially he gave each of these paintings its own distinctive surface texture, but within a few

years he stopped doing this, and began applying the paint to uniform flat surfaces with a roller,

to eliminate any gestural traces of the artist’s hand. Klein explained that “My personal

psychology does not impregnate the painting when I paint with a roller, only the color value

itself radiates in pure and inherent quality.”80

        In 1960, Klein began to make what a friend, the critic Pierre Restany, named his

“anthropometries,” in which nude models pressed themselves against canvases tacked to the

wall, or rolled on canvases laid on the ground, after covering themselves with blue paint. From

then until his premature death in 1962, at the age of 34, Klein devised a series of other ways to

produce abstract paintings. So for example he painted with fire, by using a blow torch to scorch

the surface of a specially prepared canvas; with wind, by coating a canvas with wet paint,

strapping it to the roof of his car, and driving from Paris to Nice; and with rain, by putting a

freshly painted canvas outside to be marked by a spring shower. (He also attempted to record the

impact of lightning on a canvas, but noted that “Needless to say, the last-mentioned ended in a

catastrophe.”) In a 1961 manifesto, Klein discussed these methods, and specifically responded to

critics who claimed that the anthropometries were a form of action painting: “I would like now

to make it clear that this endeavor is opposed to ‘action painting’ in that I am actually completely

detached from the physical work during its creation.”81 Throughout his brief career Klein made

abstract paintings without using the traditional method of applying paint with a brush. In effect,

much of his oeuvre can be thought of as answering a question: how many ways could a
                                                 28

conceptual artist think of to make paintings that resembled gestural abstractions, but in which the

forms were created by means other than the artist’s personal gestures in applying paint to a

canvas?

        Jasper Johns’ famous early work reacted against the attitudes of the Abstract

Expressionists, in its preconceived depiction of everyday objects. As he later recalled, “There

was this idea associated with Abstract Expressionist painting that the work was a primal

expression of feelings, and I knew that was not what I wanted my work to be like.”82 Johns’ most

celebrated works remain his early, representational paintings of flags, targets, numerals, and

maps, but at several points in his career he has made non-representational paintings. Many of

these have consisted of groups of parallel cross-hatched line segments, fitted together like

flagstones on a patio. Kirk Varnedoe has observed that these paintings parody Pollock. Like

Pollock’s large, all-over compositions, Johns’ abstractions have no central point of interest. Yet

in each case, Johns’ composition presents “a systematization of the idea of gestural abstraction.

Its complexity can be reduced to modular form.” Johns thus transforms Pollock’s improvised

experimental art into a planned conceptual form: “It is a calculated program, quite the opposite

of Pollock’s sense of automatic release. You do not need a roadmap to recognize that there is an

order to this picture; you understand that it is fragmented, not continuous, and that it is

plotted.”83

        The entire Pop art movement was in large part a reaction against Abstract Expressionism,

and many of its members mocked the older artists not only with words but with works of art.

Warhol’s famous statement of 1963, that “The reason I’m painting this way is that I want to be a

machine,” was an obvious affront to artists whose goal was self-expression, but he did not limit
                                                29

his challenges to interviews.84 The most insulting of Warhol’s parodies of Abstract

Expressionism was the series of Oxidation paintings he produced during 1978. Large canvases -

up to 25 feet long - were spread on the floor of his studio and coated with copper paint. Warhol,

his assistants, and occasionally visitors to his studio then urinated on the canvases, producing

abstract images where the acid in the urine oxidized the metallic base, turning it from copper into

shades of green and brown.85 Their large size, their flowing liquid forms, and their execution on

canvas laid flat on the floor all made these works immediately recognizable as references to

Pollock’s drip paintings, which had emerged as the most famous emblems of Abstract

Expressionism.86

       The Warhol paintings that are generally considered his most important abstractions are

the series of 102 works, titled Shadows, that he made during 1978-79. Large paintings, each 6' x

4', were produced by silkscreening a single enlarged photograph that an assistant took of the

shadows cast by cardboard cutouts.87 In each painting, a black form that resembles the bold

brushstrokes of the Abstract Expressionist Franz Kline is placed on a colored monochrome

background. Although the use of a number of different ground colors makes the appearance of

the paintings differ, the same shape recurs in every work, making the series an ironic comment

on Abstract Expressionist uniqueness and spontaneity.

       Warhol subsequently produced other abstract works. In 1983, he made a large

silkscreened painting from an enlarged photograph of lengths of yarn of various colors tangled in

interlocking loops against a white background. The resemblance to Pollock’s drip paintings is

obvious.88 In 1984 Warhol made the Rorschach series. After pouring black paint onto a large

canvas laid on the floor, he folded the canvas to duplicate the image. Warhol improvised his own
                                                30

abstract compositions, in the mistaken belief that psychiatric patients created their own ink blots

for Rorschach tests. He later explained that he would have preferred to enlarge the standard

images: “I wish I’d known there was a set.”89 The symmetry of the black forms has been

considered to be an ironic comment on the paintings of the Abstract Expressionist Robert

Motherwell, which often consisted of abstract black forms on a white ground, while Warhol’s

method of pouring paint onto unprimed canvas parodied the stain paintings of Helen

Frankenthaler and Morris Louis.90

       In addition to his famous early paintings based on comic strips, during the 1960s Roy

Lichtenstein made a series of works based on paintings by great modern artists. Having quoted

paintings by Cézanne, Picasso, and Mondrian by reproducing specific paintings by each artist

using his trademark benday dots, he found himself “inevitably led to the idea of a de Kooning.”

Instead of reproducing the image of a painting, however, as he had done for the earlier artists,

Lichtenstein found that he “was very interested in characterizing or caricaturing a brushstroke.”

During 1965-66, he made a series of large Brushstroke paintings, each of which presented

stylized characterizations of one or more magnified brushstrokes: thick black outlines, the spaces

enclosed by them filled with solid colors, set against backgrounds of Lichtenstein’s imitations of

benday dots. Lichtenstein made these forms by brushing black paint onto transparent plastic

sheets, allowing the paint to shrink and dry, then projecting the result onto a canvas, and tracing

the enlarged contours. Although the brushstrokes were not actually copied from de Kooning,

Lichtenstein conceded that they “obviously refer to Abstract Expressionism.”91

       Lichtenstein’s Brushstrokes, which he intended to look as brushstrokes would appear in a

comic strip, are clearly parodies. David Sylvester observed that “we see his meticulous
                                                  31

imitations of slashing brushmarks as a joke about the Abstract Expressionist cult of heroic

spontaneity... [T]he basic irony is simply the notion of representing the appearance of any

spontaneous daub with obvious deliberation and care.”92 Kirk Varnedoe agreed: “He takes the

lavish, heated, inimitable, signature brush stroke of painters like de Kooning... and shows that it

can be codified - freeze-dried, if you will - as if in comics, undermining as insincere the rhetoric

and scale of these painters. Everything that is supposed to be ethereal, ineffable, ambiguous, or

soulful about abstract expressionism is rendered as die-cut, stamped form, reduced literally to

comic formulae in these hard-won brush stokes by Lichtenstein.”93

        Frank Stella rejected representational painting when he was in junior high school: “I

wasn’t very good at making things come out representationally, and I didn’t want to put the kind

of effort that it seemed to take into it.” During his high school and college years, he painted in a

style derived from Abstract Expressionism. In his senior year of college, however, he saw Jasper

Johns’ first exhibition in New York, and he was strongly affected by the patterns of the targets

and flags, “the idea of stripes... the idea of repetition. I began to think a lot about repetition.” He

soon began to react against “the romance of Abstract Expressionism... which was the idea of the

artist as a terrifically sensitive ever-changing, ever-ambitious person... I began to feel very

strongly about finding a way [of working] that wasn’t so wrapped up in the hullabaloo,... that

wasn’t constantly a record of your sensitivity.” 94

        Stella promptly devised a new approach, based on his rejection of the idea of the painting

as a record of process: “I didn’t want to record a path. I wanted to get the paint out of the can and

onto the canvas.” He also rejected the goal of recording the artist’s subconscious feelings: “I

always get into arguments with people who want to retain the old values in painting... [T]hey
                                                  32

always end up asserting that there is something there besides the paint on the canvas. My

painting is based on the fact that only what can be seen there is there.” He disliked the visual

complexity of gestural abstraction: “One could stand in front of any Abstract-Expressionist work

for a long time, and walk back and forth, and inspect the depths of the pigment and the inflection

and all the painterly brushwork for hours. But I wouldn’t particularly want to do that and also I

wouldn’t ask anyone to do that in front of my paintings. To go further, I would like to prohibit

them from doing that in front of my painting.” Toward this end, he wanted his paintings to

present simple and straightforward images: “All I want anyone to get out of my paintings, and all

I ever get out of them, is the fact that you can see the whole idea without any confusion... What

you see is what you see.”And he rejected the older artists’ uncertainty: “We believe that we can

find the end, and that a painting can be finished. The Abstract Expressionists always felt the

painting’s being finished was very problematical.”95 Stella left no doubt that he valued ideas over

technique: “I do think that a good pictorial idea is worth more than a lot of manual dexterity.”96

        Stella’s objections to gestural abstraction led him to make a series of abstract works

called the Black paintings, which he completed at the age of 24. These paintings, which remain

his most important works, effectively made the repetitive patterns of Johns’ targets and flags

non-representational, as he used housepainters’ brushes to fill large canvases with parallel stripes

of black paint, each approximately 2 ½” wide, in a variety of simple geometric patterns.97 Harold

Rosenberg belittled Stella’s paintings as “the most professorial paintings in the history of art,”

arguing that they represented the result of formalist art criticism rather than artistic self-

discovery: “He wished to negate not only the content of Abstract Expressionism but its gesture,

too.”98 Stella followed the Black paintings with a series of paintings which used aluminum paint
                                                  33

to create geometric patterns. These effectively enacted his wish to prohibit viewers from

standing in front of his works for an extended period, for as he conceded, the aluminum paint

was “repellent” to look at: “these would be very hard paintings to penetrate... It would appear

slightly reflective and slightly hard and metallic.”99 Stella’s “slap in the face” to Abstract

Expressionism had a considerable impact, for his avoidance of the gestural brushstrokes and

tactile surfaces of Abstract Expressionism in favor of simple geometric patterns produced with

anonymous techniques and industrial materials gave a powerful stimulus to the young artists

who went on to create Minimalism, by making simple geometric sculptures out of industrial,

manufactured materials.100

       Gerhard Richter is widely considered one of the most influential painters of recent

decades. His reputation rests largely on an innovation of the early 1960s, in which he responded

to Pop art’s revival of figuration by devising a new, distinctive style of representational painting

based on photographs. But he is also known for the great stylistic variety of his work, and it is

consequently not surprising that he has made abstract paintings. What is striking is how many

distinctly different styles of abstraction he has devised, each based on a different method. His

output is so large and varied that no simple summary of his approaches is possible, but many of

his paintings fall into groups, to which he gives collective titles.

       In 1966 Richter began making large paintings he called Color Charts, which consisted of

grids of rectangular blocks of color that were copies of sample cards from paint manufacturers.

The earliest Color Charts had small numbers of colors, but over time Richter increased these by

mixing colors to make new shades; by 1974 he made a painting with 4096 different colors.101

The paintings were made systematically, as Richter and his assistants applied the paint as
                                                 34

smoothly as possible, and distributed the blocks of color randomly on the support. The Color

Charts thus blended accident and preconception, as Richter observed that “I found it interesting

to tie chance to a wholly rigid order.”102

       In the early 1970s Richter made the Gray Paintings, monochrome works with a variety of

surface textures, some with visible brushstrokes, others with smooth surfaces. In the late ‘70s he

began several series of Abstract Pictures, which he continued over the following decades. Some

of these, often called the “soft abstractions,” were made by taking photographs of small sections

of earlier paintings, then enlarging them by projecting them onto new canvases. With scale

enlargements of 100:1, the new works become both non-representational and blurred. Another

series of abstract paintings was made by drawing rigid squeegees vertically or horizontally over

the surfaces of large canvases that had been covered with a variety of colors, often chosen at

random. Richter would repeat this process many times, each time applying more paint, then

scraping the surface - in one documented case, a painting went through 33 discrete stages - with

the effect that the final paintings generally bear visible traces of many colors in many layers.103

       A theme that runs through Richter’s statements in interviews and published writings is

that his art is motivated by ideas. In considering Richter’s alternation between forms, Varnedoe

remarked that he was “programmatic in his gambits between abstraction and representation,” and

in pondering Richter’s methods in making non-representational paintings, Varnedoe further

observed that “He comes to his abstraction from a climate of dead cynicism and irony.”104

Conclusion

               The standard history of abstraction, and the one that the satirists
               and ironists of the 1980s would write, smugly and in self-
               congratulation, is a history of faith and its loss, a history of
               illusions replaced by knowing, of dreams dispelled by reality.

       Early in the twentieth century, three great artists pioneered a radical new form of

painting. All three came from places that lay outside the central traditions of western art -

Kandinsky and Malevich from Russia, Mondrian from Holland - but each was heavily influenced

by mainstream artistic movements of their time - Kandinsky by Fauvism, Mondrian by Cubism,

and Malevich by both of those movements, as well as by Futurism. They proceeded in very

different ways, the experimental Kandinsky and Mondrian gradually and visually, the conceptual

Malevich precipitously and conceptually, in arriving at their discoveries. Their specific goals for

their art also differed greatly, but they shared a basic optimism, and a belief that the new forms

of art they were pioneering would not only be the advanced art of the future, but would directly

and powerfully contribute to improving human society.

       Abstraction became the dominant form of advanced painting during the decade following

the end of World War II. The rise of abstraction coincided with the rise of New York as the

center of the advanced art world, as a group of ambitious young experimental artists worked for

decades in what proved to be a successful attempt to transform themselves from art world

outsiders into the new leaders of modern art. Only thirty years, but also two world wars and a

worldwide depression, separated their arrival at their mature art from the pioneers’ original

discoveries, so it is hardly surprising that the Abstract Expressionists were less optimistic than

their predecessors, and few if any of them genuinely believed that their art would have a real

impact on society at large. They were committed, however, to using art as a vehicle for learning

about themselves: as they experimented with new ways to use paint to create novel images, they

hoped that the forms they discovered on their canvases would reveal new insights into the
                                                   36

sources of their own feelings and motivations.

        The dominance of abstraction as the leading form of advanced painting was cut short

abruptly during the late 1950s and early ‘60s by the innovations of a succession of young

conceptual artists; the hegemony of Abstract Expressionism did not last a millennium, as some

of its leading members had expected, but barely a decade. The rise of conceptual approaches in

advanced art, from the late ‘50s on, greatly reduced the importance of abstract painting. In part

this was a consequence of the return to figuration in painting, while in part it was also a product

of a general deemphasis of painting in favor of new genres of art, many of which were devised as

rejections of Abstract Expressionist painting.

        Yet although abstract painting declined in importance, it did not disappear altogether

from advanced art after 1960. It persisted, but in a new role that many analysts have found

puzzling. So for example in an essay of 2002 the critic Arthur Danto, a thoughtful observer of

the contemporary art world, looked back to what he called “the art wars of the mid-twentieth

century,” and reflected that “it says something about human passion that the distinction between

figuration and abstraction was so vehement that, in my memory, people would have been glad to

hang or shoot one another, or burn their stylistic opponents at the stake, as if it were a religious

controversy and salvation were at risk. It perhaps says something deep about the spirit of our

present times that the decisions whether to paint abstractly or realistically can be as lightly made

as whether to paint a landscape or still life - or a figure study - was for a traditional artist.”106

Although Danto did not attempt to explain the difference between these two eras, the answer in

fact appears to lie in the analysis outlined in the two preceding sections of this paper. At mid-

century, disputes over the relative merits of figuration and abstraction were spearheaded by
                                                  37

experimental artists, who were deeply committed to just one or the other as a superior path to

artistic truth. Thus an Abstract Expressionist who returned to figuration - as both Pollock and de

Kooning did, temporarily, during the ‘50s - might be denounced by his colleagues or the critics

who championed abstraction as reactionary traitors to the cause.107 In contrast, by 2002 a host of

conceptual artists alternated between these forms frequently and at will, since they considered

them no more than different languages, each with its own advantages in expressing certain ideas.

No critic would have thought to call them traitors, for there were no commitments or causes at

stake.

         Abstract painting thus underwent a series of remarkable transformations within little

more than five decades. When it first appeared on the eve of World War I, its creators had no

doubt that it would not only dominate the future of art, but that it would play a central role in

creating a better world. Three decades later, it did become the central form of advanced painting

in the hands, and gestures, of the Abstract Expressionists. The cataclysmic events that separated

Pollock and his colleagues from the pioneers of abstraction produced a radical diminution in the

later artists’ expectations for the role of art in society at large, but they were nonetheless

committed to a quest for the personal image, and to abstraction as a vehicle for exploration and

personal discovery. Within a decade after Pollock’s death, however, abstract painting was

largely taken over by conceptual artists, the most prominent of whom saw it as no more than a

part-time style, and many of whom used it primarily to mock the seriousness of earlier abstract

painters. Today abstraction is considered by most artists as a particular strategy, and considered

by most of those who employ it as merely one available means among many of making their

personal artistic statements.
