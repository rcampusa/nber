        Measuring productivity growth has been a growth industry within economics for half a

century. Over this period, there have been substantial changes and improvements in the construction

of the underlying data and methods. Particularly notable are improvements in measuring output and

prices and in implementing improved indexes, notably the use of “superlative” price and output

measures by government statistical agencies.2

        Productivity growth is usually taken to be an obvious index of welfare. Paul Krugman put

it succinctly, “Productivity isn’t everything, but in the long run it is almost everything.”3 The link

between productivity growth and economic welfare is actually not obvious. There has, however,

been surprisingly little attention to the construction of productivity measures.

        The present paper is part of a larger study which is devoted to analytical and empirical

questions in productivity measurement.4           The present paper makes three contributions to

understanding the measurement of productivity. First, it examines the welfare-theoretic basis for

measuring productivity growth. Second, it lays out a technique for decomposing productivity growth

which divides aggregate productivity trends into three factors that contribute to the growth in

economy-wide productivity. Finally, it discusses the appropriate way to apply the ideal welfare-

theoretic measure in practice.

        The major practical result of this study is that current measures of productivity growth are

generally inappropriate from the point of view of reflecting economic welfare. We propose an

alternative measure of productivity growth, the chain-weighted index of sectoral productivity growth

rates, which better approximates the ideal index.



I. Welfare Aspects of Productivity Measures

        We begin with the question of the ideal approach to measuring productivity growth. We

approach this issue using the tools of index number theory.5 For simplicity, we assume that all

output is devoted to consumption goods and that consumption goods are immediately used up (i.e.,

there are no durable goods).6 We further assume that the appropriate measure of real income is a

smooth utility function of the form

(1)     Ut = U(C1t, C2t, ..., Cnt)

where Cit is the flow of services from consumption goods at time t, and there are n goods, i = 1, ... n.

We do not assume any particular form for U, but we do assume that the utility function is

homothetic. Under this assumption, we can construct Divisia indexes of real income changes by

taking the weighted average growth of individual components.

        It will be convenient to simplify by assuming that each good is produced by primary factors

alone, so Cit = Fi(Sit), where Fi is a constant returns to scale production function for industry i and

Sit is a scalar index of inputs into the industry i (for example, S might be a Cobb–Douglas function

of the relevant inputs). If Ait is total factor productivity in sector i, we can then write the production

function as Cit = Ait Sit.



        5
         There are many excellent references to the theory of index numbers. A succinct formal statement
is W. Erwin Diewert, “Index Numbers,” in J. Eatwell, M. Milgate, and P. Newman, eds., The New Palgrave:
A Dictionary of Economics, Vol.1, London: The Macmillan Press, 1987, pp. 690-696.
        6
         Durable goods and investment can be added by using the approach introduced by Martin Weitzman,
“On the Welfare Significance of National Product in a Dynamic Economy, Quarterly Journal of Economics,
Vol. 90, 1976, pp.156–162.

                                                    3
         For this discussion, we assume that the economy is characterized by perfect competition, that

all factors are priced at their marginal products, and that all goods are priced at their marginal costs.

This assumption removes influences of imperfect competition and the distortions that may arise from

indirect taxation.      Finally, we assume that households have identical utility functions and

endowments.

         In addition, we make three simplifying normalizations. First, each household supplies one

unit of the composite input, S. Second, we normalize the price of the composite input S to be unity.

These normalizations imply that each household has 1 unit of income. Third, we assume that initial

price and level of productivity are equal to 1. Under these assumptions, the price of each good is

given by:

(2)      Pit = 1/Ait.

         We now consider the expenditure function, V, that comes from maximizing the utility

function in (1) subject to the budget constraint:

(3)      Et = V(P1t, P2t, ..., Pnt, Ut)

where Et is expenditure. Note that the income term has been suppressed because we normalize

income to be unity. Differentiating (3) with respect to time yields:

         dEt/dt = (MV/MP1t)(dP1t/dt) + (MV/MP2t)(dP2t/dt) + ã + (MV/MPnt)(dPnt/dt)

Using the properties of the expenditure function, we have

         dEt/dt = C1t dP1t/dt + C2t dP2t/dt + ã + Cnt dPnt/dt

Dividing by Et and multiplying and dividing each term on the right hand side by the relevant Pit

yields

(4)      [dE t/dt]/Et = C1tP1t[(dP1t/dt) P1t]/Et+ C2tP2t[(dP2t/dt)P2t]/Et + ã + C2tPnt[(dPnt/dt)Pnt]/Et

or using (2):


                                                      4
(5)     g(E t) = –[       1t   g(A1t) +     2t   g(A2t) + ã +     nt   g(Ant)]

where   it   = CitPit/Et = the share of good i in total nominal spending at time t.

        We now proceed to determine the growth in real income due to changes in the total factor

productivities in different industries. Defining real income as Rt, the growth in real income can be

calculated as the growth in Rt over time. We use the notation that g(Rt) = Rt/Rt–1 = the rate of

growth of Rt. Since (5) represents the decline in total expenditure or income necessary to attain a

constant utility, by homotheticity the growth in real income that can be attained with the actual

consumption shares, productivity levels, and prices is therefore:

(6)     g(Rt) =     1t   g(A1t) +     2t   g(A2t) + ã +     nt   g(Ant).

In words, the growth rate of real income or real output is the chain-weighted index of sector-level

productivity growths. The weights in the index are the current nominal shares of each good in total

nominal consumption. With discrete time, equation (6) should be calculated as an equation in

growth rates using Fisher or other superlative weights.

        We now see how equation (6) applies to the question of the ideal welfare-theoretic measure

of productivity in an economy with many sectors experiencing varying rates of productivity growth.

The major result is that the ideal measure of productivity growth is a weighted average of the

productivity growth rates of different sectors. This formula is very similar to that currently used in

constructing superlative indexes of prices and output. The important point is that the indexes used

in the appropriate measure are chain indexes of productivity growth rather than differences in the

growth rates or indexes of output and inputs.



II. Decomposing Actual Productivity Growth into its Components

        In this section, we turn to the question of how productivity growth is actually measured. It


                                                                        5
will be convenient to begin with aggregate measures of productivity growth and break them into their

major components. We will see that the welfare analysis of the previous section fits very neatly into

this decomposition.



        Productivity Accounting

        Consider aggregates of output (Xt), composite inputs (St), and total factor productivity (At

= Xt/St). These aggregates are the sum (or chained indexes) of industry output, inputs, and

productivity (Xit, Sit , and Ait). We can rewrite these as built up from industry values (i = 1, ..., N)

as follows:7

        At ' Xt/Xt ' (j Xit)/(j Sjt)
                           i            j

             ' j [(Xit/Sit)(Sit/(j Sjt)]
                i                   j



or

(7)     At ' j Aitwit
                i


where wit = share of total inputs devoted to industry i, that is, wit ' Sit/('jSjt) . Note that in the ideal

case of perfect competition and constant returns to scale, with no indirect taxes, the share of inputs

is also the share of nominal outputs.

        We can calculate the change in total factor productivity as follows:

            At ' j Aitwit & j Ait&1wit&1
                    i           i

               ' j Aitwit & j Ait&1wit % j Ait&1wit & j Ait&1wit&1
                    i           i               i               i




        7
         This treatment ignores the discrepancy between chained real GDP or inputs and the sum of the
industry chained real outputs or inputs.

                                                     6
or

            At ' j wit Ait % j Ait&1 wit.
                  i                  i


        Now dividing by At–1, we have

            At/At&1 ' j wit( Ait/Ait&1)(Ait&1/At&1) % j (Ait&1/At&1) wit.
                          i                                               i


Define productivity relatives as Rit = Ait/At. This leads to

            At/At&1 ' j wit( Ait/Ait&1)Rit&1 % j (Ait&1/At&1) wit
                          i                                       i


We now define sit ' witRit&1 ' Sit/StAit&1/At&1 ' (Sit/S t)(Xit&1/Xt&1)/(Sit&1/St&1) . For smooth time

series and small time steps, sit ï Xit/Xt '                1t .


(8)     g(At) ' j sitg(Ait) % j Rit&1 wit.
                      i                  i


Finally, add and subtract 'isitg(Ait) from equation (8), where k is the base year. This yields the final

equation:

(9)     g(At) ' j sikg(Ait) % j (sit & sik)g(Ait) % j Rit&1 wit.
                      i                  i                                    i


As long as all series are smooth series and with small time steps, this becomes

(9’)    g(At) ' j         ikg(Ait)   % j(        it   &   ik)g(Ait)       % j Rit&1 wit.
                      i                      i                                    i




        Interpretation

        Equations (9) allows an interesting interpretation of the trend in aggregate productivity

growth. This equation shows that the aggregate can be broken into three components: a pure (fixed-

weight) productivity term which uses fixed base-year expenditure or output weights, a term that

reflects the difference between current nominal output weights and base-year weights, and a third

term which reflects the interaction between changing weights and relative productivity levels in

different sectors. For convenience, we will designate these three terms as follows.

                                                                      7
       Pure Productivity Effect. The first term on the right hand side of equation (9) is a fixed-

weighted average of the productivity growth rates of different sectors. More precisely, this measures

the sum of the growth rates of different industries weighted by base year nominal output shares of

each industry. Another way of interpreting the pure productivity effect is as the productivity effect

if there were no change in output composition among industries.

       The Baumol effect. The second term captures the interaction between the differences in

productivity growth and the changing shares of different industries over time. This effect has been

emphasized by William Baumol in his work on unbalanced growth.8 According to Baumol, those

industries which have relatively slow output growth generally are accompanied by relatively slow

productivity growth (services being a generic example and live performances of Mozart string

quartette being a much-cited specific example).

       Denison Effect. The third term captures the effect of changing shares of employment on

aggregate productivity. This is the Denison effect, after Edward Denison who pointed out that the

movement from low-productivity-level agriculture to high-productivity-level industry would raise

productivity even if the productivity growth rates in the two industries were the same. Denison

showed that this effect was an important component of overall productivity growth.9 The Denison

effect is the sum of the changes in output shares of different industries weighted by their relative

productivity levels.

        Appropriate Treatment of the Different Effects

        A major question in measuring productivity growth concerns the appropriate construction

of indexes. Which of the three components of equation (9) or (9’) should be included if our

productivity measures are to be a useful measure of welfare?

        For this discussion, we turn as an application to changes in labor productivity – that is, we

interpret the variable S as labor hours worked. The question then becomes what is the ideal measure

of labor productivity? This question can be answered by comparing measured productivity growth

in equation (9') with the ideal productivity growth measure shown in equation (5). Abstracting from

differences in timing that lead to differences between    it   and sit , a comparison of the two equations

shows that the ideal index of productivity growth from a welfare-theoretic perspective includes the

first two terms in (9) or (9') but excludes the third term.

        This implies that the pure productivity effect and Baumol effect should be included in a

welfare-oriented measure of productivity growth. The reason for the pure productivity effect is

intuitive. Additionally, the Baumol effect reflects the impact of changing expenditure shares on the

overall productivity measure. If spending is primarily devoted to sectors that have low productivity

growth, then this implies that our economic welfare will indeed be growing relatively slowly.

        This approach also indicates that the Denison effect should normally be excluded from an

ideal productivity index. To understand the reason for its exclusion requires some discussion of the

potential sources of the Denison effect. Recall that the Denison effect arises primarily because of

differences in the levels of productivity by industry. We can identify three major reasons for

differences. The first is that differences in productivity levels reflect differences in inputs which are

not captured by our productivity measures. For this first case, the Denison effect should be excluded

from a welfare-oriented measure of productivity because interindustry shifts produce spurious


                                                   9
changes in productivity growth. If in fact the levels of total factor productivity are equal in all

industries, then the Denison effect would by construction be zero.10

        A second reason for differences in productivity levels would arise because of differences in

indirect taxation. A third reason would arise from disequilibrium in input or output markets, because

of slow migration of labor from farming to industry, or because of market power. If the second and

third reasons were the major source of differences in productivity levels, then the treatment is more

complex and some or all of the Denison effect would be appropriately included in a welfare-theoretic

measure of productivity growth. As in other cases where tax wedges or other distortions apply, the

appropriate treatment will usually be somewhere between inclusion and exclusion depending upon

the relevant elasticities.

        An examination of the actual patterns of labor productivity across sectors suggests that the

differences in productivity arise primarily because of the first reason, differences in inputs which are

not captured by our productivity measures. In 1998, the level of labor productivity (gross output per

hour worked) differed by more than a factor of 100 across major industries. One major source of

difference comes from differences in capital intensity or in labor skills across industries. For

example, the highest gross output per person employed in 1998 at the two-digit level was in nonfarm

housing services, with a productivity level 34 times that of the overall economy. The high

productivity arose because this sector is essentially entirely imputed rents. Other high productivity

ratios are found in capital-intensive sectors such as pipelines, oil and gas extraction, and telephone

services. Similarly, high productivity levels are found in sectors with high human capital such as



        10
           This points to an important reason for constructing complete measures of inputs. In principle, if
all differences in productivity levels are due solely to differences in quality and quantity of all inputs, a
complete and accurate accounting system would show that total factor productivities were equal in all
industries. At this point, the Denison effect [the third term in equations (9) or (9’)] would be calculated to
be zero.

                                                     10
security and commodity brokers. At the other end of the spectrum are industries with low-skilled

workers, such as private households, personal services, and apparel.

       The second and third sources of productivity differences appear less significant today. The

industry which gave rise to the Denison effect, farming, had a productivity ratio of 90 percent of the

total economy in 1998. This suggests that disequilibrium in labor migration patterns is a relatively

unimportant source of productivity differences today. Moreover, there are few two-digit industries

where indirect taxes are a large share of gross output. The major case is tobacco products, where

indirect taxes were 60 percent of gross output in 1998. Among one-digit industries, the ratio of

indirect business taxes to gross output in 1998 ranged from a low of 2 percent in construction to a

high of 21 percent in wholesale trade. While these differences are not trivial, they are much smaller

than the differences in productivity due to differing capital intensities or labor qualities.

       We can illustrate the problems discussed here using a numerical example. Table 1 illustrates

how the Denison effect can provide misleading estimates of productivity growth if not properly

calculated. It shows an economy with two industries with differing levels of productivity. Industry

1 is a high productivity sector while industry 2 is a low productivity sector. The last three lines in

the table show three different ways of calculating productivity growth. Line 20 shows the preferred

measure of productivity growth from equation (9), which includes the pure productivity effect and

the Baumol effect. Line 21 shows the difference of growth rates methodology, which is the

difference of growth rates approach used by the BLS and many scholars. Line 22 shows the simplest

aggregate measure of total output per total hour.

       For the example in Table 1, both the aggregate and the difference of growth rates

methodologies give misleading results because they include the Denison effect. Because the high

productivity industry has a rising share of nominal output, aggregate productivity rises at 7.25


                                                  11
percent (line 22). However, because hours are declining in the low productivity industry, the

difference of growth rates approach shows a very low productivity growth rate of 0.52 percent (line

21). The correct number given in line 20 (including only the pure productivity and Baumol effects)

shows an intermediate productivity growth rate of 2.75 percent.

       Table 2 shows an example with a strong Baumol effect. Here, the initial levels of

productivity in the two sectors are equal, but industry 1 shows a declining share of output along with

strong productivity growth while industry 2 is technologically stagnant with strong demand growth.

In this case, the Baumol effect is strong (–3.33 percentage points in the last column of line 17).

Moreover, the difference of growth rates method again seriously understates the true productivity

growth rate.



       Application to aggregate U.S. data

       We can illustrate the procedures using actual data on labor productivity for the United States.

These data are derived from two companion papers on the subject. The first companion paper

presents a new data set on aggregate and industrial productivity derived from income-side data.11

The second companion paper applies the concepts in this paper and the data in the first paper to

estimating productivity growth and the role of the new economy in the recent productivity upsurge.12

       Figure 1 and Table 3, which are drawn from the second paper, show a comparison of two

measures of labor productivity for the overall economy over the period 1978-1998. The series called

“ideal measure” is the welfare-theoretic index derived in a manner defined in equation (6) above.

This shows the rate of productivity growth that best measures the growth in average living standards.

The measure labeled “GDI productivity” is the growth of total labor productivity, measured as

income-side GDP per hour worked.

        The results show a significant difference between the two concepts. The ideal or welfare-

theoretic measure is higher than standard labor productivity in every subperiod. The differences are

relatively small in the most recent period, but they are substantial in earlier periods. On average, the

ideal or welfare-theoretic measure over the entire period was 0.21 percentage points per year higher

than total income-side productivity growth. In the second companion paper, we show that this

difference is exactly equal to the Denison effect over the period, as is predicted in the discussion of

the decomposition of productivity growth above.



        Current Approaches to Constructing Productivity Measures

        Given the vast literature on productivity growth, there is surprisingly little discussion of the

welfare-theoretic interpretation of alternative measures. There is of course a vast literature on the

construction of ideal indexes of prices and output. One of the few studies to apply these to

productivity is by Caves, Christensen, and Diewert.13 This study does not address the issue of

differing levels of productivity in different industries, however. One important study of the

relationship between alternative measures of productivity and welfare theory was by Baumol and

Wolff, which recommended the use of what they called a “deflated index of total factor

productivity.”14 This index is constructed by deflating nominal labor productivity by the an

economy-wide average of the real wage. While this formula does correct for the Denison effect, it

does not appear to identify the need for a chain index to measure welfare improvements of

productivity growth.

        Early applied analyses of total factor productivity and labor productivity did not analyze the

appropriate index from a welfare-theoretic point of view.15 Alternative approaches were used in

these studies, but the central approaches were generally ones which weighted productivity growth

by fixed output weights. This approach is clearly inappropriate and can give misleading results if

productivity growth differs by sector.

        The work of Jorgenson and Griliches and later work by them and co-authors derive measures

of productivity growth from general transformation functions.16 This approach led to the suggestion,

pioneered by Griliches and Jorgenson, that productivity growth be estimated as the difference

between Divisia indexes of output growth and input growth. This approach, which we call the

“difference of growth rates” approach, will be close to the ideal approach if productivity levels in

different industries are close, but it will not in general provide the correct result from a welfare

theoretic point of view if the Denison effect is present. (See Tables 1 and 2.)

        The Bureau of Labor Statistics currently uses the difference of growth rates approach in its

productivity measures.17 The output measures are currently chain indexes of output using Fisher or

Tornqvist weights. Labor inputs are either hours or weighted hours at work. Measures of

productivity are calculated as the differences between the growth in output and the growth of inputs.

The BLS measures therefore suffer from the deficiency that it includes the Denison effect. More

generally, it is not a chain index of productivity growth, which is the preferred measure.

       In summary, none of the current approaches to estimating productivity growth appear to be

well-grounded in welfare economics. Rather, assuming that differences in productivity growth are

due to differences in unmeasured inputs, the appropriate measure would be a chain index of

productivity growth of different sectors weighted by current expenditure or current-value inputs

shares. In terms of the decomposition in equation (9), the appropriate measure would be total

productivity growth after removing the Denison effect. Alternatively, the appropriate measure would

be the pure productivity effect plus the Baumol effect. It is useful to note, that none of the current

measures of productivity follow the appropriate procedure for measuring productivity growth.
