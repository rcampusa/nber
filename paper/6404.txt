                                            ABSTRACT


       The standard measures of nominal capital formation show the United States investing a

proportion of GDP much lower than those of other developed countries throughout the last 25 years

and falling further behind over time. In contrast, measures we have calculated in real terms across

countries and over time indicate that US investment ratios have been rising over time and have been

coming closer and closer to those of the other countries.

       A broader measure of capital formation more consonant with economic concepts shows the

United States to have been close to the other countries since 1970 and to have been investing an

above average share of total output in the most recent period 1990-1994. Real capital formation per

capita and per worker, even conventionally defined, has been consistently between 15 and 25 percent

higher than in the other countries and broadly defined real capital formation per capita and per worker

has been 30 to 60 percent higher.
