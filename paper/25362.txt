                                           ABSTRACT

Many developing country governments determine eligibility for anti-poverty programs using
censuses of household assets. Does this distort subsequent reporting of, or actual purchases of,
those assets?We ran a nationwide experiment in Indonesia where, in randomly selected provinces,
the government added questions on flat-screen televisions and cell-phone SIM cards to the
targeting census administered to 25 million households. In a separate survey six months later,
households in treated provinces report fewer televisions, though the effect dissipates thereafter.
We find no change in actual television sales, or actual SIM card ownership, suggesting that
consumption distortions are likely to be small.

I. Introduction

A large literature in economics has studied the potential for targeted transfer programs in

developed countries to alter labor supply. These distortions may result from either the income

effects of the transfers themselves, or the disincentives to work that arise from the marginal tax

rate imposed by the phase-out of transfers as one’s income rises. This debate has influenced policy

in many developed countries: for example, a key goal of welfare reform in the United States in the

1990s was to eliminate the very high marginal tax rates on transfers, which were thought to

discourage work.

         As targeted transfer programs are becoming increasingly more common in developing and

emerging nations – currently, at least 67 (World Bank 2015) low- and middle-income countries

have such programs – similar debates have emerged as to whether targeted transfers distort

behavior in poorer countries. However, the way that these programs are targeted in poorer

countries means that the distortions that one might expect them to cause could be quite different.

In particular, since most poor country governments do not observe income for a majority of their

citizens, it is difficult to conduct means testing directly. This implies that individuals may not

necessarily be incentivized to distort their labor supply. 1 Instead, in a process called “proxy-means

testing,” developing country governments often rely on infrequently done censuses of assets and



1
  Labor supply distortions may be less theoretically relevant in developing countries where targeting is not directly
based on income. Nonetheless, individuals may still believe that if they earn more, the government would somehow
detect this and they would lose program benefits. Moreover, many programs have a subjective component built in
over the asset targeting (e.g. local leaders or communities can strike rich people off the list, determine who should
receive the asset surveys, or add excluded households), and individuals may surmise that increased employment and
income could reduce their odds of joining or remaining on a given program through this mechanism. The empirical
evidence, however, suggests labor supply distortions from these types of targeted transfer programs in developing
countries are minimal. For example, Banerjee et al. (2017) re-analyzed data from seven different trials of government-
run cash transfer programs throughout the developing world, and found no systematic evidence that any of these
programs—which provide income support between 4 to 20 percent of household consumption to beneficiaries—
reduce work. Similarly, Baird, McKenzie, and Özler (2018) review the literature and find little to no labor market
distortions in response to transfer programs in developing countries.
                                                                                                                    1
demographics, predict incomes based on these assets, and then create beneficiary lists based on

these predicted incomes. 2 This type of testing is quite common, and used in both large countries

such as Pakistan, Nigeria, Mexico, Indonesia, and the Philippines, and in smaller countries, ranging

from Burkina Faso to Ecuador to Jamaica (Fiszbein and Schady 2009).

        By conditioning benefits on which assets households own as measured by the proxy-means

census, these tests implicitly place a tax on asset ownership. A natural question, then, is whether

such a tax distorts consumption behavior. In the extreme, this could certainly be the case. For

example, in the 18th and 19th century, England and Scotland taxed windows as an easily observable

proxy for the wealth of households, and this famously led to windows being boarded up and

countless dark houses (Oates and Schwab 2015). However, modern proxy-means tests use a large

number of assets – 34 different types of housing characteristics and assets in our Indonesian

example – and governments deliberately keep the formulas that relate assets to eligibility opaque

to try to prevent manipulation around their results. On net, the implied marginal tax rate on

consumption from Indonesia’s proxy-means tested benefits is about 15 percent (Hanna and Olken

2018), which certainly seems large enough that it could cause distortions in aggregate. 3 However,

the fact that the relationship between assets and eligibility for benefits is complex and non-

transparent may mean that the distortionary effects could be small in practice (Chetty et al. 2009;

Finkelstein 2009). On balance, whether these censuses cause actual distortions in asset ownership

is an open, and as yet unresolved, but important question, particularly since these asset distortions




2
  Other methods used for targeting in developing countries include community based targeting (see, for example,
Alderman 2002; Galasso and Ravallion 2005; Dupas, Preciado, and Robinson 2018; and Alatas et al. 2012) and ordeal
mechanisms (Dupas et al. 2016; Alatas et al. 2016). See Coady, Grosh, and Hoddinott (2004) for an overview.
3
  A 15 percent tax is quite large and has the potential to distort behavior. For example, Chetty et al. (2009) showed
that consumers responded in magnitudes predicted by theory to a sales tax of 7.375 percent when the tax was posted.
                                                                                                                   2
could have real economic effects if the assets themselves are productive (e.g. livestock, cell

phones) or if they have potential health effects (e.g. better toilets for sanitation).

        To answer this question, we introduced a randomized experiment in the context of

Indonesia’s national targeting census of the poor in June to August 2015, which goes door-to-door

to collect data on 25 million households—generating data on 92 million individuals—to determine

their eligibility for benefits programs. Specifically, we randomized two additional questions onto

the questionnaire, by province. To keep the number of questions on the census constant, each

randomized question had one of two options. In half the provinces, households received (1) either

a question on flat-screen television ownership or a question on the number of rooms in their house

and (2) either a question on the number of active cell-phone SIM card numbers the household had

or whether they had a modern toilet installed. We specifically chose our two key treatment

questions – flat-screen televisions and SIM card ownership –because we had access to independent

data sources on actual asset ownership that did not rely on household self-reports. Questions (1)

and (2) were cross-randomized to create 4 versions of the census, randomized across Indonesia’s

34 provinces to create a nationwide experiment. Importantly, none of these questions were used

for actual targeting decisions (and so they have no real effects), but this was not known publicly,

so households would plausibly have forecast that these questions would likely have been used for

future targeting.

        We test whether these questions led to differences in both reported asset ownership, as

measured by subsequent government household sample surveys that have no link to targeting, and

in actual asset ownership, as measured by independent data on television sales that we obtained

from retailers and from administrative data on the number of SIM cards active in each province

that we obtained from the telecommunications providers.


                                                                                                 3
        To test the effect on reported ownership, we worked with the National Statistics Agency

(BPS) to include all four of these questions on the Indonesian National Socioeconomic Survey

(“SUSENAS”), administered annually to over 250,000 households. (For clarity, we hereafter refer

to the targeting census of the poor – which is our treatment – as the ‘census,’ and the subsequent

SUSENAS survey data that we use for outcomes as the ‘survey.’) Even though the SUSENAS is

not used for targeting—and in fact, the government agencies that conduct targeting cannot even

access identifiable data from it—it is possible that individuals may still inaccurately perceive that

the government may use it, and thus try to misreport and/or hide their assets. 4 The fact that

targeting based on assets may cause misreporting more generally in government data is a

substantial concern in itself as this data is used for calculating descriptive measures of the

economy, including the local and national poverty rates.

        Analyzing the national sample survey data about six months after the targeting was

complete (March 2016), we find that households who live in the provinces where the targeting

census asked about flat-screen televisions were in fact 16 percent less likely to report owning a

flat-screen television in the SUSENAS. We do not observe any effect of the other questions

(toilets, rooms or SIM cards) on reported ownership, but the effect on flat-screen televisions

nevertheless survives multiple-inference adjustment. One year later (March 2017), we no longer

observe any differences in flat-screen TV ownership across the experimental groups, nor do we

observe differences across the other asset variables.




4
 Anecdotally, one often hears that households hide their TV and motorcycles under a tarp when they see surveyors
approaching to conduct the targeting censuses in Indonesia. Moreover, both Camacho and Conover (2011) and
Martinelli and Parker (2009) show that households misreport in targeting censuses in ways that improve their chances
of eligibility. Thus, even if the SUSENAS is an independent survey and not used for the targeting of any social
programs, if people incorrectly believe that it could be, they may nonetheless misreport.
                                                                                                                  4
       To test whether the targeting questionnaire has distortionary effects on actual asset

ownership, we obtained data on television sales from a monthly retailer survey conducted by a

leading Indonesian marketing firm, and administrative data on yearly SIM card subscribers from

all major Indonesian telecommunications companies through the Ministry of Communications and

Information (KeMenKomInfo). We find no evidence of lower television sales, or fewer SIM cards

owned, in the provinces in which these questions were asked on the proxy-means tests. Moreover,

we can strongly reject a decline in actual television sales that would be required to produce the 16

percent decline in reported television ownership detected in the March 2016 SUSENAS. We find

no detectable changes in cell phone ownership, though the confidence bands are somewhat larger.

The results suggest, therefore, that observed differences in the survey data based on the

experimental groups are largely due to effects on reporting, rather than real distortionary effects

on asset purchases.

       Section II provides the setting, experimental design, and data. We discuss our findings in

Section III. Section IV concludes.



II. Setting, Experimental Design and Data

A. Setting

In developed countries, the selection of the beneficiaries for social protection programs

(“targeting”) is often accomplished through means-testing: only those with incomes below a

certain threshold are eligible. However, for many lower income countries, it is challenging to

conduct conventional means-testing as many people work in agriculture or in the informal sector,

and thus lack verifiable records of their income.




                                                                                                  5
        Instead, to determine program eligibility, many governments conduct “proxy” means

testing, where they use demographic and asset ownership data to predict poverty status. Typically,

they conduct periodic quasi-censuses of the poor where government enumerators go door-to-

door—visiting millions of households—to acquire information about pre-existing household

demographic composition and assets, such as the type of material used in the roof or the walls,

whether a household owns a refrigerator or a motorcycle, and so on. The government then takes

these variables and uses them to predict incomes, usually based on a formula derived from a

prediction exercise using survey data. Program eligibility is then determined by predicted income

or per capita expenditures.

        Indonesia is no exception. The government has conducted nationwide targeting censuses

of the poor approximately every three years since 2005, and has then used proxy-means testing to

determine each household’s eligibility for targeted transfer programs ranging from cash transfers

to health insurance for the poor. 5 The government canvassed 25 million households, generating

data for about 92 million individuals, in the most recent national targeting census—called the

Pemutakhiran Basis Data Terpadu, or PBDT—in June through August 2015 (see Appendix Figure

1). The three-page targeting questionnaire consisted of three sections: one on basic housing

characteristics (e.g. type of roof material, type of floor material, etc.), one on demographics, and

one on the assets owned by the household, including items such as refrigerators, A/C, motorbikes,

land, and livestock.



B. Experimental Design



5
 To derive the enumeration frame for the census of the poor, Indonesia, like other countries, uses a combination of
methods (e.g. past PMT score, community targeting) to exclude rich households from the data collection. Thus, the
census of the poor, in practice, covers 25 million households, or about 40 percent of the population.
                                                                                                                 6
We worked with the Government of Indonesia to test whether adding additional questions onto the

actual 2015 PBDT questionnaire would incentivize households to reduce asset acquisition in order

to maintain their eligibility in the future. We randomized two additional questions onto the actual

PBDT questionnaire, reaching 92 million individuals, so that while everyone canvassed received

the same number of questions, they were randomly asked different asset questions depending on

which province they lived in.

          Specifically, each household received (1) either a question on flat-screen television

ownership or a question on the number of rooms in their house and (2) a question about the number

of active SIM cards the household owns or whether they had a ‘swan neck’ toilet installed (see

Appendix Table 1 the for complete questions). 6 These questions were added to the forms at BPS

Jakarta, and were treated no differently by the regional offices administering the PBDT targeting

census from any other questions. We verified in-person that the forms used in the field followed

the randomization protocol in a number of selected provinces.

          There are at least two reasons to think that adding questions to the census could distort real

behavior. First, the questions on the poverty census generally do not change much from wave to

wave, so a reasonable way to forecast of what will be asked on the next poverty census is through

the questions on the current census. Second, households may also be concerned that the

government may verify their assets if eligible for the program. For either reason, households may

reduce their consumption of these assets following the addition of these questions to the targeting

census.

          However, it is important to clarify that these questions were not actually used by the final

PMT formula to select beneficiaries for government programs, so there is no mechanical

6
 A ‘swan neck’ toilet is the common Indonesian term for any toilet with a modern plumbing trap (typically known as
a P-trap) installed to prevent the venting of sewer gasses back into the house.
                                                                                                                7
relationship between which questions were asked where and the actual composition of

beneficiaries of government programs. It is also important to note that the fact that these questions

were not used was not public. In fact, this could not have been publicly known at the time of the

2016 household survey that we use to measure outcomes, since the 2015 PBDT data was not used

for targeting of government programs until January 2017. However, it was widely known that the

PBDT targeting census, in general, would be used for determining program eligibility, and hence

a reasonable presumption for a normal household is that all questions in it, including the randomly

added questions, would have been used.

           The randomization was conducted across the 34 provinces, since the enumerator training

and forms used occurred at the province-level (Figure 1). We stratified by 5 regions corresponding

to the main Indonesian island groups for additional statistical precision. 7 The fact that the

experiment spans all of Indonesia increases external validity, overcoming the fact that there are

significant differences in culture and institutions across Indonesia (Dearden and Ravallion 1988).



C. Data

We use three main datasets for this paper. First, we obtained household-level data from the

Indonesian National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS), a semi-annual national survey,

representative of the population at the district-times-urban/rural level, conducted by the

Government of Indonesia. We use SUSENAS data from after the PBDT targeting occurred—

specifically, March 2016 and March 2017, comprising about 300,000 households in each round—

to measure whether households report owning fewer of a particular asset if they were asked

questions on ownership of that asset on the PBDT (see timeline in Appendix Figure 1).


7
    The strata are Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Sumatra, and all other provinces.
                                                                                                   8
Importantly, not all of our outcomes of interest were initially included on the SUSENAS prior to

our study, and thus, we worked with Statistics Indonesia (BPS) to make sure all four questions

were included. We also obtained earlier years of the SUSENAS data—from 2005 to 2015—in

order to include baseline control variables at the district-times-urban/rural level to gain additional

statistical precision. For our purposes, we treat the SUSENAS as repeated cross-sections. 8

           The SUSENAS is a sample survey, where households are interviewed to collect their

information. If there is an effect of the treatment on asset acquisition using this data, it could be

due to two factors. First, treatment households could actually reduce their asset acquisition or

choose not to invest in new assets. Second, their asset ownership may not actually change, but they

may lie about it to the surveyors (i.e. “hide their income”). In fact, this is a common concern that

one often hears about during the targeting census—people hiding their televisions or motorcycles

under a cloth when an enumerator is arriving.

           Therefore, for two of our questions, we chose variables that we would be able to verify

using independently-sourced data that does not rely on household reports. This allows us to shut

off the “lying channel” and only measure real effects on asset acquisition.

           First, we obtained data on monthly television sales of flat-screen televisions—from January

2013 through December 2016—from an Indonesian market research firm. The data captures all

flat-screen televisions with screens 30 inches or larger, thus matching exactly the question we

added to the targeting census questionnaire. The market research firm collects monthly TV sales

data directly from their network of retailers in 20 regions in Indonesia, and accounts for between

85 to 90 percent of total sales of flat-panel TVs 30 inches and above. Given privacy concerns about




8
    A small number of SUSENAS households constitute a panel in some years, but this is not useful in the study period.
                                                                                                                    9
providing province-level data, the firm provided us with monthly data on total sales in each of our

four randomized groups of provinces (i.e. TV-phone, TV-toilet, room-phone, room-toilet). 9

         Second, we obtained data on yearly active SIM cards, by province, for 2015, 2016, and

2017, from the Indonesian Government Ministry of Information and Communications

(KeMenKomInfo), who compiled it from administrative data supplied by each of Indonesia’s

telephone providers. 10



D. Randomization Check

We report a balance check using data from the March 2014 SUSENAS, i.e., data from the year

before the intervention. We focus on demographics (e.g. urbanization status, household size) and

variables that are similar to our intervention questions. As shown in Appendix Table 2, out of the

16 coefficients that we consider, 2 are statistically significant, which is consistent with what we

would expect based on random chance. Nonetheless, in our regression analysis, we control for

baseline characteristics using a double LASSO procedure (Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen

2014) to account for any differences across treatment groups in the sample and to increase

statistical power.




9
  Broadly speaking, the SUSENAS and retail sales estimates provide similar magnitudes of televisions owned. The
SUSENAS estimates that about 11 percent of households own at least one flat-screen television, equivalent to 7.84
million households. Adding up the total television sales from the market research firm from January 2013 to March
2016 yields about 7.4 million TVs sold in that period. These will not be exact since some flat-screen televisions were
sold before 2013, they acknowledge that they cover about 85 to 90 percent of the market, some people will own more
than one TV, etc. However, the fact that the magnitudes appear broadly similar provides reassurance on the
consistency of the datasets.
10
   This includes data from Telkomsel, Sampoerna, 3, and Smartfren. Data from XL and Indostat are for 2017 only.
                                                                                                                   10
III. Results
A. Effects on Self-Reported Asset Acquisition

We begin by examining the impact of receiving the randomized asset questions in the PBDT on

each of the four considered assets. Specifically, we estimate:

        𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴ℎ𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑝𝑝 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑝𝑝 + 𝑿𝑿′𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝜸𝜸 + 𝛼𝛼𝑟𝑟 + 𝜀𝜀ℎ𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑   (1)

where 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴ℎ𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 is the self-reported asset measure in the post-period for household “h” in district

“d” in province “p.” We include two dummy variables to indicate which of the randomized

questions households received on the targeting questionnaire. Therefore, 𝛽𝛽1 provides the causal

effect of being randomized to the “TV question” rather than the “rooms” question, while 𝛽𝛽2

provides the causal effect of being randomized to the “SIM card” question rather than the “toilet”

question. We cluster the standard errors at the province level, our level of randomization.

        While the randomization should ensure balanced groups, one can gain additional statistical

precision by including controls of two types. First, we include fixed effects for the 5 regional strata

(𝛼𝛼𝑟𝑟 ). Second, we include baseline control variables to account for any differences across treatments

groups and improve statistical power. Typically, one would include the baseline data of the

outcome variable for a given observation. However, in this case, we could not do that for two

reasons—first, the SUSENAS is a repeated cross-section of households within a given district

rather than a panel, and second, we added new questions onto subsequent SUSENAS for the

purpose of this study. Thus, we instead first coded a total of 1,388 asset variables from the 2007

to 2015 SUSENAS, constructed averages by district and urbanization status (the smallest level at

which we can merge this data to the outcome data), and merged these averages into the household




                                                                                                                  11
survey data. We then selected control variables from this set using the double-LASSO approach

of Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen (2014). 11

        Table 1 provides these results. Panel A does so for our four asset outcome variables from

the March 2016 SUSENAS, while Panel B reports results using the March 2017 data. 12 In Columns

1 and 2, we report coefficients on 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇ℎ𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 (𝛽𝛽1 ) and 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇ℎ𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 (𝛽𝛽2 ); in Columns 3 and

4, we report coefficients on the Rooms Treatment (1-𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇ℎ𝑑𝑑𝑝𝑝 ) and the WC Treatment (1-

𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇ℎ𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ). We hypothesize that each treatment question would have the potential to influence

the ownership of the asset in question (i.e. randomized TV question on TV ownership, randomized

WC question on WC ownership, etc.), while the non-corresponding questions in each column act

as a placebo test (i.e. one would not expect the randomized WC question to necessarily have direct

effects on TV ownership). In the next to last row, we report the mean of the dependent variable for

interpretation, and in the final row, we report p-values adjusted to correct for the family-wise error

rate (FWER) to correct for multiple inference across the four key outcome variables (TV variable

affects TV ownership; cell variable affects SIM card ownership, etc.) following Anderson (2008).

        We first turn to the March 2016 SUSENAS (about six months after the targeting census

was completed), the first survey round post-treatment that includes our added questions (Panel A).

We find that being randomized to the flat-screen television question on the targeting census leads

to a reduction in reported flat-screen TV ownership, but the other randomized questions (WC,

rooms, and SIM cards) do not lead to any changes in the ownership of the respective assets. The


11
   The LASSO-selected controls vary from column-to-column, and are listed in Appendix Table 3. Appendix Table 4
replicates Table 1 with the strata, but no baseline controls. The findings are similar, but we obtained additional
statistical precision with the included controls.
12
   In the March 2017, one of our questions (Number of SIM cards) was dropped from the SUSENAS, and instead
there is a different question on number of people with active cell phones. We, therefore, use number of people with
active cell phones as the outcome in 2017. In Appendix Table 5, we show that using this same question in the 2016
data yields similar conclusions as when one uses the number of SIM cards variable as the outcome in 2016 (Panel A,
Column 2 of Table 1).
                                                                                                                 12
effect on TV ownership in 2016 is both statistically significant and large in magnitude—being

randomized to receive the TV question in the PBDT targeting census leads to about a 16 percent

(1.7 percentage point) reduction in reported flat-screen TV ownership in subsequent surveys; this

is individually significant at the 1 percent level, and has a FWER multiple-inference adjusted p-

value of 0.005.

         By March 2017 (Panel B), we no longer observe any significant effects of the experimental

treatments on any of the asset questions. In fact, we can easily reject that the magnitude of the

treatment effect of the TV treatment in 2017 is the same as in 2016 (p-value=0.005). This implies

that any observed effects of the treatments on reported assets may be short-lived.

         Why might households lie, and if they choose to lie, why might they choose to lie about

owning a flat-screen television? To quantify the gains from lying, we re-estimated the Indonesian

government’s PMT model, augmented to include each of the 4 new variables, using the 2016

SUSENAS in control areas (i.e. for the television variable, we use provinces which were not asked

the television question, and so on). 13 We then calculate, for each household that actually owns the

asset in question, the increase in probability of being below the eligibility cutoff that households

would receive by simply changing their response on that one variable. 14 The results, shown in

Figure 2, show that lying about television ownership has the highest return for the household,

increasing the probability of being eligible for benefits by 12 percentage points for a large number

of households; the remaining asset variables would yield between a 3.5 and 7 percentage point

increase.



13
   Specifically, we estimate the PMT regression in 2016 SUSENAS, and calculate the fraction of households eligible
in each province / rural-urban unit equal to the percentage of households under 1.5 times the official poverty line. We
use the estimated prediction errors in the Indonesian PMT system from Alatas et al. (2016).
14
   For count variables (SIM cards and number of rooms), we calculate the change by reducing one’s response by one
unit.
                                                                                                                    13
        Moreover, the number of rooms and presence of a WC are more easily observed since the

government enumerators typically walk from room to room during the surveys, and hence are

harder to hide. In contrast, televisions and cell phones are more easily hidden (e.g. hide the TV

under a tarp or in a box, keep your cell phone in your pocket). It is also worth noting that cell

phones are very common, with households on average reporting about 2.2 SIM cards per

household. In contrast, flat-screen televisions are rarer, with only about 11 percent of households

owning one, and are more likely to be perceived as distinguishing whether a household is wealthy.

While this discussion is of course speculative, it is notable that it is consistent with the patterns we

find in the data.



B. Effects on Asset Acquisition Measured in Independent Data

The findings from the household survey could be driven by real changes in assets, or they could

simply reflect hiding assets from or misreporting assets to the survey enumerators. We therefore

turn to the independent data to study real outcomes, thereby shutting off the second channel.



TV Sales Data: Given privacy concerns about releasing province-level data, the firm instead

generated for us monthly data on sales by each of our four randomized groups of provinces (i.e.

TV-cell, TV-toilet, room-cell, room-toilet). Due to the difference in the data structure (only 4

groups of provinces, but with monthly time series data for each of the 4 groups), we cannot analyze

the data using the same specifications as above, but instead estimate:

              𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 +

        𝛽𝛽3 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 + 𝛼𝛼𝑔𝑔 × 𝑚𝑚 + 𝜀𝜀𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔                                                                               (2)




                                                                                                                            14
where 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 is the sales in group “g” at month-year “m,” 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 and

𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 are indicator variables that equal 1 if you received that respective question

and it is the post-period, and 𝛼𝛼𝑔𝑔 ∗ 𝑚𝑚 is a group-by-month linear trend. The 𝛼𝛼𝑔𝑔 are group dummies,

which absorb the main effects of 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡𝑔𝑔 and 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡𝑔𝑔 . We use the full data set of data

available to us: January 2013 to December 2016. 15

         Table 2 provides the results. In Column 1, we estimate Equation (2) using OLS with robust

standard errors. However, to account for the time-series structure of the data, we provide two other

specifications to deal with potential serial correlation. First, in Column 2, we compute Newey-

West (1987) standard errors with 3 lags. Finally, in Column 3 (our preferred specification), we

estimate a panel-corrected model with AR(1) disturbances, which accounts for AR(1) serial

correlation within panels and allows for correlations in a given month across panels. 16 In the end,

all three models produce similar results: we do not observe a reduction in TV sales for those in the

treatment group, and if anything, the coefficient is positive.

         It is important to note that in Table 2, we are measuring a flow (sales of new televisions),

whereas in Table 1 we are measuring a stock (does the household have a flat-screen television).

To compare the two magnitudes, we note that to obtain a 16 percent reduction in the stock of

televisions reported by households in treatment areas in Table 1 by March 2016, just about 6

months after treatment, the flow of television sales in treatment areas would need to have declined

by 62 percent, equivalent to a decline in log sales of -0.97. We, therefore, test whether we can

reject a decline in log sales of 0.97 (last two rows of Table 2). We can easily rule out declines of


15
   In Appendix Table 6, we truncate the data to March 2016 for greater comparability with the time period in Panel A
of Table 1 (March 2016 SUSENAS). The findings are unchanged, so we use the full data for the main table.
16
   This model, estimated via the xtpcse command in Stata, specifies the functional form for the Ω matrix to compute
standard errors correctly in the presence of serial correlation within panels and contemporaneous time correlation
across panels, and deals with auto-correlation using the Prais-Winston correction. It does not use the Ω matrix fully
for estimation in FGLS, and is more conservative than FLGS in small-samples (Beck and Katz 1995).
                                                                                                                  15
that magnitude; indeed we can rule out any decline in log television sales larger in magnitude than

about 0.06. In short, the vast majority of the effects seem to be on reported television ownership,

not actual sales.



SIM Card Subscribership Data: For SIM card ownership, we have annual data (as of December

of each year) for each of the 34 provinces from 2015 to 2017. For each year, we estimate:

         𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑝𝑝 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑝𝑝 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑝𝑝 + 𝜀𝜀𝑝𝑝        (3)

where 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑝𝑝 is the log of the number of SIM card subscribers in province p, and

𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑝𝑝 and 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑝𝑝 are the experimental treatments. Standard errors are robust, and we

have one observation per province (the level of randomization) in each panel.

         These results are shown in Table 3. 17 We show results from December 2015 (about 4

months post-treatment) in Panel A, those from 2016 (about 16 months post-treatment) in Panel B,

and those from 2017 (about 28 months post-treatment) in Panel C. Column 1 estimates equation

(3) above. To obtain greater statistical precision, in Column 2, we add log population in the

province as a control, and we additionally add strata fixed effects in Column 3. Across all

specifications, the effect of the cell treatment is statistically indistinguishable from zero. Moreover,

given that we saw no effects on reported cell phone ownership, with much tighter standard errors

(we can reject a decline in the number of reported SIM cards of more than 3 percent in 2016 and

2017; see Table 1), a reasonable conclusion is that cell phone SIM ownership did not change either.



IV. Conclusion



17
  In Appendix Table 7, we replicate Table 3 dropping Jakarta because Jakarta SIM cards are easier to obtain elsewhere
in the country. The conclusions remain unchanged.
                                                                                                                  16
While targeted transfer programs have been shown to confer significant benefits, particularly on

the health and education of children as well as directly on household consumption, much of the

debate surrounding transfers often revolves around whether or not they distort the economic

behavior of households. The previous literature has shown that the likely effects of targeted

transfers on work behaviors in developing countries are indeed low to non-existent. However,

given that much of the targeting is based on asset ownership (rather than income) in these

countries, it is of key importance to understand whether these transfers distort household

consumption behavior.

       Using a nationwide experiment built into Indonesia’s real targeting system, covering 92

million individuals, we show that while the targeting may affect short-run reporting of assets, it

does not distort real consumption behavior in aggregate. Combined with the growing literature that

targeting does not greatly reduce labor supply in developing countries, this provides further

evidence that the fears around distortive effects of targeting in developing countries is unfounded

in the data, especially relative to these potential gains from redistribution.

Figure 2: Effect of Misreporting Asset Ownership on Probability of Receiving Benefit




Notes: This figure illustrates households’ increase in probability of receiving benefits if they were to misreport asset ownership. Four
different proxy-means test (PMT) scores are constructed in the control group of each respective outcome, each time using the same
categories of variables used in Hanna and Olken (2018), as well as the single relevant asset, as predictors of log per-capita
consumption. We then calculate the probability of being below the poverty line (defined for each province and for rural and urban areas
separately) and thus receiving a benefit, under actual reported assets and under misreporting ownership of the relevant asset. We then
graph the difference in these two probabilities as a function of the PMT score, limiting to the households that report owning at least one
of the relevant asset so that we do not double count the effect of not owning the asset in the PMT score.

Notes: This table provides estimates of the treatment effects of the different targeting questions in the PBDT
on household-reported assets in subsequent surveys. Panel A uses data from the March 2016 SUSENAS,
while Panel B uses data from the March 2017 SUSENAS. Each regression is estimated using OLS and
includes strata from the randomization and pre-experiment control variables selected using a double LASSO
(Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen 2014). Standard errors are clustered by province. The FWER adjusted
p-value is calculated within each panel following the free step-down resampling method from Westfall and
Young (1993), as described in Anderson (2008), using 1000 bootstraps.

Notes: This table provides estimates of the treatment effects of the different targeting questions in the
PBDT on actual television sales. Television sales data is in units and reported monthly from January 2013
to December 2016 for each of the four potential treatment assignments. Post is defined as starting in June
2015, corresponding with the start of the experimental treatment. Column 1 provides simple OLS estimates,
while Column 2 provide Newey-West (1987) corrected errors with a lag of 3. Column 3 provides panel-
corrected estimates with an AR(1) structure. The sales outcome in this table is a flow, while the TV
ownership in Table 1 is a stock. To compare the findings, in the final two rows, we also provide a test
against the estimate in sales that we would need to observe to generate the ownership effect observed in
Table 1.

           Notes: The SIM card question in 2016 was cut in the
           2017 survey. Instead, we used the number of people
           with phones as an alternative measure of SIM card
           usage in 2017 (Table 1, Panel B, Column 2). In this
           table, we show that the results would have looked
           similar in 2016 if we used number of phones rather
           than number of SIM cards.
