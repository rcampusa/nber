              Accelerating Inflation, Nonassunble Fixed-Rate
                 Mortgages,   and Consumer   Choice and Welfare


                                   Abstract

     This   paper measures the   impact of nonassumable, fixed-rate, long-term

mortgage   financing on household mobility and housing demand during
a periodof accelerating inflation (l965_71l). We calculate that typical
households who bought houses     during   the l96l7l period and utilized this
type of financing would not have moved until the 1975-77 period. And
this is in spite of rising    inccmies   and a sharp fail in the real rental
price or user cost of housing.
    We conclude that the nonassumable, fixed-rate mortgage is largely
responsible for bath sluggish housing demand in the l967_7i period and
its surge in the 1976-79 period. Housing activity would have been
far more stable had variable-rate mortgagee been employed. Finally,
the enormous gap between current mortgage rates and those existing in the
19705 and the resultant huge capital gains on existing mortgages does not
bode well for housing activity in the near term future.

                 Accelerating     Inflation, Nonassuinab i.e Fixed-Rate
                   Mortgages,     and Consumer Choice and Welfare

       It is well established that        the   rental price or real user cost of
owner-occupied     housing fell     significantly between the middle 1960s and.      the

late   1970s)' This decline follows from two            facts. First, the real user
cost   depends positively on real after-tax interest rates, Second, during

this period nominal interest rates rose about one-for-one with the increase

in the inflation rate. Thus, the real user cost fell for those paying

positive taxes on interest income, and the fall was greater the higher the

tax rate (income level) of the household. As a result              of   both this decline

and the failure of the real user costs for nonresidential investments to

fall similarly (in fact, those costs appear to have risen), some have

argued that the U.S. economy has overinvested in housing at the expense of

industrial capital and has thus suffered substantial productivity losses.2

       Somewhat surprisingly, the        implied    surge in housing demand did not develop

in the 1966-75    decade.     Housing starts were no greater than in the previous

decade; the average quality per single family start was up by less than

5   percent   from 1966-67   to   1974-75;   and   the real price of new single

family houses increased by less than 10 percent between 1965 and

Not until 1976-79 was there a        bonafide      housing boom. In this period

2See Hendershott and Hu (1980)(l981) and Rosen (1979). The analysis of
 de Leeuw and Ozanne (1981) is also consistent with this view.

3For the precise measurement of quality and price, see the notes on pages 17 and 28.

starts were up by 35 percent; the average quality rose by 7 percent;

and the real price of a constant quality house increased by 21 percent.1

       Explanations offered for the sluggishness of housing demand in the

1966-75 decade are based on increases in nominal, as opposed to real

after tax, interest rates. In a world with deposit rate ceilings, an

increase in open market interest rates retards deposit flows, restricting

mortgage purchases of depository institutions. If other lenders do not

make compensatory mortgage investments, then credit to homebuyers is

rationed and, in the absence of other sources of funds, housing demand

is impaired.5 Even if credit funds are ample, lenders may not be willing

to extend them in sufficient amounts to homebuyers. The real user cost

declines because the current greater interest costs (after tax) are more

than outweighed by future (expected) increases in the value of the house

being financed. If lenders are unwilling to make funds available on the

basis of these future expected gains and if households cannot either (i) meet

the higher   initial mortgage     payments by borrowing in other forms, rechanneling

their savings   from   other   assets to housing equity, or increasing total
income through greater work effort or (2) reduce the payments by allocating
more   wealth to   housing at the time of purchase, the housing demand of

these households will be reduced.6 While these explanations obviously



lThe quality increase came between 1975:3 (third quarter) and 1977:2;
 the price increase occurred between 1975:3 and 1979:3.


5me principal advocates of this position are Jaffee       and Rosen (1978)(1979).


6Kearl (l978)(1979) has emphasized this view.

 appeal to some, many find  their empirical importance severely limited by
 the extensive qualifiers attached to the explanations. When depository
 institutions have had insufficient funds to meet household demands           for

housing finance, other lenders have       acted   to fill the 'nortgage gap";
mortgage purchases by     the Federal National Mortgage Association, advances

by the Federal Home Loan     Banks, and   the growth   in   GNM& pass-through securities

are    all means of channeling   "capital market" money      to the mortgage market
Also   numerous households have obviously responded to lenders restrictions

by increasing their initial downpayment (especially those with capital

gains   on   previous house purchases), by rechanneling saving away from

financial assets, and by increasing labor force participation.

       In this paper we offer a third explanation for the sluggishness of

housing demand in the l96675      decade.     This explanation is also based

on   increasing nominal mortgage rates during a period of accelerating

inflation, but It does not require imperfect capital markets. Households

that   finance house   purchases with long-term, fixed-rate mortgages find

themselves with mortgage capital gains when        nominal   interest   rates rise.
If the mortgages are    nonassumable,   then the gains can     only   be reaped if
the households maintain their existing mortgage (continue low rate financing
while the house inflates rapidly in value). To the extent that this occurs,

housing   demand fails to rise not only in response to the decline in the

real user cost but also in response to increases in real income. That Is,

the housing-income ratio falls rather than rises.



7For arguments and evidence that the mortgage market has become integrated
 with the bond market, see Hend.ershott and Villani (1980)(l98l) and Hendershott
 (1980).
       The results reported below suggest that the mortgage capital gains

were likely   an    important deterrent to housing demand in the l967_72 period

for households that financed earlier purchases with nonassuxnable, long-

term, fixed-rate mortgages. During this period, such households had to

trade off expected rapid wealth accumulation (owing to a low mortgage

rate in conjunction with rapid anticipated housing capital gains) against

a progressively more "suboptimal" consumption bundle (too little housing

given its falling real rental price and the household's rising real      income).
Until   1975, the optimizing choice for most such households was consumption

of too little housing.

       The analysis of this paper is divided into three sections. Section I

contains a methodology for calculating the benefits and costs associated

with moving and for determining when particular households who purchased

houses in specific years would have subsequently moved. The calculations

are presented in Section II. For purposes of comparison, similar calculations

are performed based on the assumption that households had utilized variable

rate, rather than fixed rate, financing. A measure of the social costs

of   fixed-rate mortgages   owing to the subaptimal censumption pattern of

households   with   mortgage capital gains is reported in Section III.
                   I. Measuring the Net Benefit from roving

      in measuring the benefits from moving to a new house, we              use   the
 equivalent-gain approach of King (1981) which fellows the equivalent-variatio1i
 approach   of Hicks (191.3). For      this purpose,   assume that   the   preferences

 of the representative households are defined over two goods: housing (xh)

 and other (x0):



            u =
                  u(%,   x0).
                                                                                        (1)


Let the   nominal disposable income of the household be Y, the price of

                                                                           =
nonhousing goods be p, and the rental price of housing be

where p is the asset price of the house, r is the after-tax housing

financing rate, Â¶T   is   the inflation rate, and. 6 represents other costs

(depreciation, maintenance, net property taxes) as a percent of the asset

                                                                                              = Y
price. Maximizing        (1) subject   to the budget constraint that PhXh +        p6x0
gives the demand for each good as a function of income and prices.

Upon substitution of these two demand functions into (1), we can express

the household utility as        an indirect function of   income and prices:




            V = V(Y, h' p0).                                                            (2)




Because X, X and V         are homogeneous of degree zero with respect to their
arguments,   it is convenient to normalize       both disposable income        and. the
user cost of housing in terms of units of nonhousing goods. That                  is,

                 V(y/p0,   h'o' 1) = v(y,         c),                                      (2')

where   y is real disposable incone am-i c is the real user cost of housing.
       We now define the equivalent gain. SuDpose the budget position of
the household changes from an original vector (yÂ°, cÂ°) to a new vector
(y',   c"). More specificallr, assume         that the household's income has
risen   (y"> yÂ°) and that an increase in the inflation rate has lowered

the real user cost of housing capital (.r < 1Ti                 so           cÂ°). The equivalent

gain (EG) is defined to be the increase (above yÂ°) in income that would leave

the household as well off at the initial price vector as it is at the

n'- tu5ot    position. That iS, G is efinel by

        The equivalent gain is illustrated graphically in Figure 1, where

 yÂ°-(yÂ°/cÂ°) represents the original budget line and 10, the original

 indifference curve reached. The        new budget            line, y'-(y'1/c'1), allows

 the household to reach I'. The         demand for           housing   has   risen from x to

     The above analysis implicitly assumed that            the   household was   financing

the house with a one period loan or,            equivalently,   with a fully variable
rate mortgage.       Thus the real user cost fell to


                =        (r-6).
Alternatively,      suppose that the house was financed entirely (for simplicity)

by a nonassumable, long-term, fixed-rate mortgage. In this case, the

effective user cost facing the household that does not niove is

where r* =    r0.    Thus, thiz household is able to attain point E in Fire 1

that puts it on indifference curve 1* which, in this case, gives greater

utility than I. That is, the household maximizes its utility by maintaining

its existing housing (and low rate financing). Of course, the combination

of inflation and normal amortization erodes the value of the low rate

Blortgage over time. Thus r* will rise toward r11, c* will fall toward

and E* declines to E. When E* falls below the i curve, the utility

associated    with maintaining x   at x is less than that obtainable by shifting

to E and increasing housing dnd to                    At this point the household

will niove.

        Because r*, c*, and E* are not time invarient, it is convenient to

divide the maximization calcu1aton into two parts. In the first we

consider the gross gain         from moving   (the gain before accounting for the

cost of foregoing the existing mortgage). In terms of Figure 1, this is

the gain generated by shifting from point               to point Era.    (The gain from

EÂ° to         is achieved without moving.) In the second part we consider
                                                     +
the   costs from moving, i.e., the shift from E* to E . When the gain

exceeds the cost, the move will be made.



The Gross Ecuivalent Gain from Moving


        The   gross equivalent gain from moving       (EGM) is defined as the difference

between    the total equivalent gain (EG) and the equivalent gain from not
moving (EGN)..1 In terms of Figure 1, EGN is obtained by drawing a budget line
tangent    to the indifference curve (i) going through E              and parallel to
the original budget line yÂ°-yÂ°/cÂ°.            The   difference   between this line and.
                                                                                     e     e
the original line is EGN. For the         purpose of measuring        the EGN, let (y ,   c )

be   the solution to the following two demand equations

               o    d   e   e
              xh=xh(y,c)                                                            (6)

 values that would lead the household to choose                         on it Consequently,
 we can identify the utility of                      with the indirect utility measured at
  (e Ce).        That        is, EGN is but the solution to:

The Adjustment Costs

        The costs associated with moving this period, rather than next,

include the present (as opposed to later) payment of a realtor's fee,

as well as the low-interest mortgage that the household has to give up.

Assume that the real realtor's fee (F) is equal to a fraction g of the

real value of housing,



             F =   g(l-d)
                            toAi
                            Xh(ph/Pc)

where d is the rate at which the real housing services from the house depreciate.

By not postponing the sale of the existing house by one period, one

 foregoes the real interest saving associated with postponement of the realtor's

fee. The foregone after-tax saving is



             CF =
                    [(1_)i_rT]g(l_d)tx(p/p),                                     (15)



where       is the marginal tax rate of the household and i is the interest rate.1

       There is also the cost associated with exchanging the old mortgage

for   a new one â€¢                                               a fixed-rate,
                     Assume that the house was initially financed with

T-year mortgage with a loan-to-value ratio of vÂ°. Then the one-period real

cost of relinquishing the existing mortgage is equal to
        â€¢

It is assumed that no thange in pt/p is            expected   to occur between the

where i is the current mortgage interest rate, i0 is the interest rate on

the existing mortgage, and t is the number of years since the mortgage

was originated.5 (The ratio in brackets is the fraction of the initial

loan that is still outstanding.)

       The total one-period cost of moving is now equal to



            COST = CF Ã· CM,                                                    (17)



Optirnality dictates that the household should postpone the move at Least

until EGM> COST. Because the cost of giving up the mortgage falls

in real terms over time (p0 rises and the mortgage is amortized --

t   increases) and the gain does not, the household should move as soon

as EGM COST.



An   Illustrative Example
       In the following section we   report   estimates as to when different
classes   of households (defined by their particular marginal tax brackets

and future growth in real permanent disposable income), who bought houses

in particular years, would have maximized utility by moving. In this

section we provide an example in order to illustrate the precise method

of calculation. We also indicate some assumptions and data sources

underlying the calculations.




5Equation (16) is not symmetric with respect to I       i. When i d 1Â°
 households can refinance (reap a gain) without selling the house. Thus,
 we constrain CM to be nonnegative.

       The income and price elasticities of housing demand are assumed to

be plus and minus 0.75 respectively (# = B =          0.75).    These are consistent

with Polinsky and Elwood (1979), as well as other studies. The constant

A is set such that the size of the house purchased in the fourth quarter

of 1965   (1965: Ii.) by   a   household in the 30% marginal tax   bracket with

real   permanent disposable income equal to the average real disposable
income per household           in the economy was equal   to the per-household housing
stock   in that year.       The latter number is $13,866 and average disposable
income per household was $10,975. (These and all dollar numbers reported
below are 1972 dollars.) The real user cost of owner-occupied housing

for households in the 30% tax bracket in l965: was 5.77% (Hendershott

and Shilling, 1981). This determines A to be 0.2707, and thus


                = .2707(y/c)75.                                                   (ii')


       The household is assumed to have purchased this house in 1965:11 and

have financed it with a 75% loan-to-value, 25 year, 5.83% mortgage. The

household's real permanent disposable income is posited to have risen

by 1.5 percent per year.6 Given the observed movement in the

home mortgage rate and the measured change in the household's




      is one percent less than the 2 percent average growth rate in
 real disposable income per household in the U.S. observed between
 1965 and 1979. We have chosen            this
                                      lower rate for two reasons.
 First, the growth  in permanent income  will be less than the growth
 in current income to the extent that the former was anticipated.
 Second, some part of the growth was achievable only by households
 changing work location, and we are not modeling households that moved
 in order to achieve extraordinary income growth.

real user cost, this household would not have moved until 1975:1.             We

provide illustrative calculations for 19714.:14.   and   1975:1 below.

     In 1971+:14, the household's real income was $12,558, the mortgage

rate was 9.78% and the real user cost had fallen by 2.6 percentage

points to 3.19%. Using equation (11'), x was $23,927, a full $10,000

above x. The total equivalent gain, from (13'), would have been

$2,078 per annum, of which $1,612 was due to the rise in income and

$14.65 to the reduction in real user cost. Without moving, the household

would have to take the consumption bundle of x = $13,866 (the 1965:14

housing) and x = $12,116, $12,558-.0319($13,866). Making use of (6')

and (7'), we can translate this consumption into an equivalent budget
               e                 e
position of y = $13,068 and c = 6.87%.        From equation (114 ), we then

calculate EGN to be $1,932. Finally, EGM = EG-EGN is $1146.

     From equation (16), the real per annum cost of relinquishing the

existing mortgage is $285. and the foregone interest saving on the

realtor's fee is $14. from equation (15). Thus the total one-period

cost from moving is $289. Because this exceeds the one period gain,

this household should have remained in its existing residence.

     The combination of a decline in the real after-tax user cost of

capital from 14.27% to 3.25% and in the mortgage rate from 9.78% to

9.27% both increased the gross gain and lowered the cost of moving.

(During the same period the household's disposal income rose slightly

to $12,605.) Repeating the above calculations with these new values,

we obtain   the total equivalent gain between the 1965: 11. and   1975: 1 budget

positions to be $2,1459. The gain without nving is         equal to $2,1314
leaving   a $325 gain from moving. The fall in the nominal mortgage rate
reduced the total one-period cost of moving to $214.5. Thus a net one-

period gain of $79     could   be achieved, and the household should have

moved.



                     II. The Timing of Moves by Households


       The above analysis is employed in this section to determine when

households that purchased houses in the fourth quarters of the years

1959 to 1972 would have moved in order to upgrade (increase) their housing.

As noted above, a move will occur when the gross equivalent gain from

moving, which follows from the choice of a more satisfying consumption

bundle, exceeds the costs of giving up a below-market mortgage and paying

realtors' fees sooner. The optimal period to hold an existing house

depends on a host of variables from the rate of growth         in   real income and

housing   income and price elasticities to the tax rate of      the household

and   the type of financing    obtained.   We begin by considering our     standard

household -_ that    with   the same characteristics and financing described
in the illustrative example. We then examine the sensitivity of the
holding   period decision to the income and price elasticities, the rate
of   growth in real income, and the tax rate. Finally, we contrast the

decisions that would be reached with fixed and variable rate mortgage

financing.

the year (fourth quarter) and quantity of housing this household is assumed

to have purchased. Columns (3) and (14) list the optimal quarter for the

household to move and the new quantity of' housing purchased. As can be

seen, households that bought in the 1959-61 period moved in 1966; those

that bought in 1962-63 moved in the 1967-73 period; and those that                        bought
in 1964-72 generally moved in the 1975-77 period. An exception is the

move only nine quarters after the purchase in 1970:4. This                     is   due to a

sharp   decline   in the real user cost as can be seen in columns (5) and (6).

The nearly continuous decline in the real user cost throughout the 1963-77

interval provided    a strong impetus for one to upgrade housing, as did the

assumed rise in real income. On the other hand, the sharp rise in the

mortgage rate between 1965     and    19714    see   columns (7) and (8)1 generated

capital gains.     Column (9) reports the annual cost, in 1972                 after-tax
dollars, of giving up the mortgage in the quarter that the household is

calculated to have moved. Households that purchased

originally in 1964-67 and moved in 1975              gave   up 197   to   2148 of these dollars.

That is, in spite of the decline in the            real user    cost and rise in real

income,   these gains prevented households that             purchased in late 19614 and
early 1965 from moving for      10 years.

       Possibly the clearest way     to   illustrate the impact            of capital gains
on   mortgages on the timing of the upgrading of housing                  is the following.
During the   entire 8 year period l9677l1.,          only   households (with our

characteristics)    that   bought   in 2 earlier years (mid 1962            to mid   1964)

upgraded   their housing. In contrast, in 1975              alone,
households   that had bought in     the full 8 year period (mid 1964                to   mid 1972)
                                          17




moved up. It is thus not surprising that the sharpest percentage increase

in the 1966-79 period in the average quality of new houses sold occurred

during the mid 1975 to mid 19'77 period.7




Sensitivity Analysis

        Increasing the assumed growth rate in real income has two effects

on the timing of moves. With income rising at 2.5 percent per year,

households purchasing in the 1962-6k period should have moved 2 to .

years earlier (1966-71 rather than 1968-75). Further, households buying
in 1966 and       1969 moved in 1973 rather than   waiting until 1975. Lowering
the growth    rate   to 0.5 percent has a larger impact in the opposite direction.
Most strikingly, those who purchased as        early as 1962 do   not move until
1975. Also,       those purchasing in   1967 and 1968 now   do not move until late
1977,    rather   than early 1975.
        Increasing the assumed income elasticity has     an   effect similar to
raising    the income growth rate.      Lowering the assumed price elasticity
from    -0.75 to -0.5 has a similar impact to lowering the income growth

rate. Most importantly, households who purchased in 1967-68 do not move

until late 1977.

        For households in lower tax brackets, the decline in the real user

cost, and thus the incentive to upgrade housing, is reduced. Lowering the

assumed tax rate thus has the same directional impact as lowering the

price elasticity. When the tax rate Is assumed to be 0.15 and all the


7The increase in the ratio of the average price of a new house sold to the
 price of a constant qualIty (l974) house rose by 7 percent between 1975:3
 and 1977:2. The ratio of the value of subsidized i_It family starts to
 the value of total i_14 family starts was 0.05 in both quarters. EThe
 sharp increase in this measure of quality that occurred between 1971 and
 1973 can be attributed to a decline in subsidized starts; see Hendershott (l980).1
                                       18




original   parameter values are maintained (v =     B   = 0.75 and real income

grows at   1.5   percent per year), the Immobility is striking.      Except   for
the   sharp   downward blip in the user cost in 1971     and. 1972, which causes a

move after only two     years, no household purchasing     after 1963 moves by

1979. And those purchasing in      1961-63 do   not move until 1975-77.
       Owing   to both bracket creep and growth   in    real income, one would
expect the tax rate relevant to our hypothetical household to rise over
time,    expecially   in the late 19706. This exacerbates the decline in the
user    cost and lowers the after-tax cost of giving up the mortgage, both

of which increase the speed. at which households will upgrade their

housing. In reality, the tax bracket of a typical household purchasing

housing in the early and middle i960s was probably in the neighborhood

of 0.20 and likely rose to 0.30 by the 1975-77 period. The moving pattern

of such households would probably not       be zm.ch different than that    depicted

in Table 1.



Variable Rate Mortgages

        In the following analysis we assume that all housing purchased during

the 1959-72 period was financed with variable rate mortgages (VRM8).

The rate on these mortgages is assumed to equal the observed yield on

new issue fixed-rate mortgages (FRitis). As a result, there would not have

been any capital gains on existing mortgages, and we would expect that

households would have upgraded their housing more frequently in response

to rising incomes and a declining real rental price of housing.

       Table 2 presents the same type of data reported in Table 1 except

that the mortgage rates and capital gain (zero) are not listed. Comparing

the two tables, households that purchased in the 1959-61         period   would not

have   been affected by the type of mortgage instrument because mortgage

rates fell n the first half of the 1960s. With either a FRM or VRM,

the move occurs in 1966:2. However, strikingly different behavior would

have occurred for purchasers during the 1963-69 period. With FR}4s,

buyers in these years would have held their houses for 8 years, on average.

With VRMs, the holding period never exceeds 33 years, and the average

holding period is only 2 years. This heightened mobility can be illustrated

in   another way. With   FRMS, households   that purchased in i964:   and 1966: I.

did   not upgrade their housing until 1975:1. With VRMs, the households
that purchased in 1964:14 would have upgraded for the third time in 19714:14
having moved in 1967:14 and again in 1971:2. The household that purchased
in 1966:4 would have moved in 1969:1 and again in 19714:4.

                III. Efficiency Losses from Fixed-Rate Mortgages


      By definition, households always maximize         their   utility. Even when

they are not choosing the optimal         combination   of housing and   nonhousing
goods given their income and the "equilibrium" rental price of housing,

maintaining their mortgage capital gain allows them to achieve the greatest

utility (reach the highest indifference curve in Figure 1). Unfortunately,

maintaining this gain is tantamount to enforcing a capital loss on

mortgage lenders or, equivalently, on other households. The mortgage

capital gain does not provide any net utility or gain to society. On

the other hand, the suboptimal consumption pattern of households with

gains is an efficiency loss that is not matched by a gain elsewhere.

Thus any "reform" that    would reduce mortgage gains and thus suboptimal
consumption patterns would provide a net gain to society. The use of

variable rate mortgages is one such reform. What follows is an attempt

to obtain a rough    estimate   of the cost of the regulatory prohibition

against   variable rate mortgages during the 1966-79 period.


A Methodology for Measuring the Loss
      The loss due to the use of     nonassumable,long-term,fixed-rate mortgages

is   the difference between the equivalent gainwith a variable-rate
mortgage (EGv) and with a fixed-rate        mortgage (EGF), the gain being

a measure of the suboptimality of consumption. The           cummuiative   loss
for the entire economy during the 1966-79 period is then

                  1979
      iss   =       7 (EGF_EGV)H      ,                                           (18)
                J i=1966

where      is the number of households in the th category.8 To simplify

matters greatly, we assume that one-fifth of all homeowners in l965:1

had   purchased   houses during the fourth quarter of 1961, another fifth

during   the fourth quarter of   1962, etcetera through      the   fourth   quarter
of 1965.    Given that there were roughly 35 million homeowners, this

amounts to   7 million purchases per   year.   We   assume further that       1 million

additional households     purchased in the fourth quarters of 1966 through

1972. Finally, all households are assumed to correspond to our standard

one (r =   0.3,   v =     0.75 and income grows at 1.5 percent per year).

Thus, there are only 12 household classes (j =        12).
      Calculation of the losses from fixed and variable rate mortgages is

illustrated in Figure 3 which is based on Figure 2. The latter indicates

the consumption patterns between 1966 and 1979 of a household buying in

1965:1+ under three different assumptions: (a) no transactions costs

(neither a brokerage fee nor mortgage capital gain), (b) no mortgage

capital gain (a brokerage fee, but use of a variable-rate mortgage),

and (c) use of fixed-rate mortgage (both brokerage fee and mortgage capital

gain). The jagged line is the optimal consumption pattern and reflects

every twist and turn in the real user cost or rental price of housing.

The household effectively moves every quarter. The solid line, which

jumps discreetly in 1968 and 1975 to reflect moves at those times, is

based upon variable-rate financing. The hatched line is based upon fixed-

rate financing and indicates only one move, in       1975.    The move in 1968

with the VRM shifts the household to the optimal consumption line at

that point and generally keeps the household closer to this line throughout

the 1968-71+ period. Thus the loss with a VRM is generally less than with

8A more precise calculation would compound the gains prior to 1972 and discount
 those after 1972. Given the low real after-tax interest rates existing in the
 1970s and the compounding of gains prior to 1972, introduction of this precision
 is unlikely to affect the results significantly.

a   FRM. Note, however, that     if the   real user cost rose after the move

 in 1968, optimal   consumption of housing could decline so that                 the loss

with   a   FRM would be less than with a VRM. This is the case at point A.

 fixed and variable rate mortgages for the more typical point B in, say,

 1973. In is the indifference curve reached by households choosing the

optimal consumption bundle based upon (ytl,cX). Housing consumption would

be x. Because of the transactions costs associated with moving,

households originally purchasing in 1965:14 choose less housing in 1973,

 equivalent gains are calculated, as before, by drawing budget lines

tangent to these indifference curves and parallel to the original budget

the left-hand side variables with x and x, and then using equation (114)

where EGN becomes EGV.



Some Estimates

       Table 3 contains estimates of the loss per household [column (2)]

 initially purchasing in different years [column (1)] and the total loss

 for each class household [column (14)], which is the product of columns

 (3) and (14).    The cummulative loss for the 1966-79 period is 18.52

billion 1972 dollars. Over 18 billion of this accrues during the period

1967-77. That is, for this 11 year period the loss is 1 2/3 billion dollars

per year.

        This   analysis overstates the direct welfare loss due to FRMs for a

 number of reasons. First, fewer household moves generate a resource

 saving. This includes both direct moving      expenses   and the substantial

 search costs reflected in realtor fees. Second, probably a fifth of the

 value of house sales in the 1961-65 period was financed by assumable,

 FHA-VA mortgages.9 Third, many households move for reasons other than

 normal income growth and changes in relative prices. For example, one

 might move to achieve extraordinary income growth or to be closer to

 (further from) ones family. %Then such moves occur, the optimal consumption

 bundle will be selected, in general reducing the measured loss from FRMs.

 On the other hand, there are some unmeasured indirect costs of FRMs.

 Because of capital gains on mortgages, some households will forego or

 postpone moves that would increase the aggregate welfare of society;

 labor mobility and productivity are reduced. On net, our measure of the

 cost of FRMs could overstate the true value by as much as a multiple of

 two.



 General   Equilibrium Considerations
        The above is a partial equilibrium analysis of welfare loss insofar
 as only one distortion of increased inflation on    consumer   choice is
 considered.     Another well-known distortion is the favored tax treatment of




9Between 1961 and 1965, 23 percent of loan originations on 1- to 1i-fami1y
 houses were FHA-.VA financed (Mortgage Loan Gross Flows, U.S. Department
 of HIJD, 1968, Table 25). Because loan-to-value ratios are higher for
 FHA-VA than conventionally financed houses, the share of housing that
 was FHA-VA financed is lower than 23 percent.

 owner-occupied    housing vis-a-vis business capital; in fact, this treatment

 is the source of the decline in the real rental price of owner-occupied

 housing noted above. Thus, the distortionr in consumption in the 1967-76

 period owing to capital gains on fixed-rate mortgages is partially an

 offset to the distortion generated by fundamental biases in tax law.1Â°

        The efficiency loss due to FRMs has also been calculated for the

 case where the real user cost of housing was frozen at the value existing

 when the original house purchase occurred. That is, suboptimal consumption

 (too little housing) exists in this calculation only because households

 do not allocate any of their increased real income to housing. Our

 estimate of the efficiency loss in this case is only 2            billion   for the

 1967-77 period. Thus seven-eights of the earlier calculated distortion

 due to FRMS actually generated positive welfare because it acted as an

 offset to another distortion in the system.

        In an earlier paper, we calculated the annual economy wide efficiency

 loss owing to the favorable tax treatment of owner-occupied housing to be

 1   3/14 billion (1972   dollars) in 19614-65 and 6   billion   in 1976-77

 [Hendershott and   Hu    (1980)]. Thus the increase between the      middle 1960s

 and 1970s was just over 14 billion. If one assumes that the loss increased

 linearly between these dates, then the annual incremental (above the

 19613_65 value of 1 3/11. billion) loss from overinvestment in housing in



10The authorization of variable rate mortgages by the Federal Home Loan Bank
  Board in 1979 and the obviously desperate need of most mortgage lenders
  to achieve a better balance between the effective maturities of their
  assets and liabilities suggests that very few nonassumable, long-term
  fixed-rate mortgages will be originated in the United States in the 1980s.
  As a result, if inflation should accelerate in the late 1980s or 1990s,
  mortgage capital gains will not exist to offset the inducement to greater
  housing investment.

the decade from the middle 1960s to the middle 1970s was just over
$2 billion. This is not much greater than our     $1   2/3 billion estimate
of   the loss due to underinvestment in housing owing to nonassumable long-term,

fixed-rate mortgages. In addition, the two alternative mechanisms proposed

for the sluggishness of housing activity in this decade --     the   sharp increase

in the ratio of mortgage payments to income and credit rationing (see the

introduction to this paper) --   could also have been operating. It seems
safe to conclude that the net efficiency loss during the 1966-75      period
triggered   by the acceleration in inflation and the favored tax treatment

of owner-occupied housing was relatively minor.

       Unfortunately, the 1976-79 housing boom certainly changed matters.

Annual single-family starts averaged 1.141. million, xp from 1.15 million

in the previous four years and roughly 1.0 million in the two four year

periods prior to that. Moreover, the average quality of these starts

jumped by nearly 10 percent relative to previous years (see footnote

 7), and the real price of a constant quality house increased by 21 percent

between the third   quarters of 1975   and 1979.11 By 1979, the efficiency

 loss from overinvestment in owner-occupied housing was likely substantial)


11The real price is defined as the ratio of the price of the constant (197L)
  quality house to the CPI net of the shelter component. With the latter
  indexed to unity in 1967 (when the constant quality price equalled $2L.8
  thousand), the real price rose from $26.8 thousand in 1975:3 to $32.5
  thousand in 1979:3. (By 1980:4, the real price had declined by 3 percent.)

      overinvestment seems certain to be reduced over time owing to the
 economic policies of the Reagan administration (high real interest rates
 and reduced taxation of returns on assets other than owner-occupied housing).

                             V. Conclusion


     This paper attempts to explain the surprising absence of a surge in

housing demand in the 1967_714 period. The absence is a. surprise because

the real user costs or rental prices for owner-occupied housing appear

to have fallen sharply in this period (by 2 to 3 percentage points --    or
25 to 50 percent -- between l961+.65 and 1973_711., depending on the households

marginal tax bracket). Our explanation of the absence of a housing boom

follows from the fact that most housebuyers in the 1950s and 1960s

financed their purchases with nonassumable, long-tern, fixed-rate mortgages.

The sharp increase in the nominal mortgage rate from under 6 to well over 9

percent during this period created substantial mortgage capital gains for

these buyers; however, given the nonassuinability of their mortgages, the

gains could only be reaped if the households maintained their existing

houses (continued low rate financing while their houses inflated rapidly

in value). To the extent that households chose to reap these gains,

housing demand failed to rise in response to both 'the decline in the

real rental price and increases in real income. For these households,

the housing-income ratio actually fell.

     The paper contains 'three sections. The first provides a methodology

for calculating the benefits and costs associated with moving and for determining

when households who purchased houses in secific years would have

moved. During the 1967-78 period, households are viewed as weighing the

benefits of retaining existing low-rate mortgages (and of postponing the

payment of realtors fees) against the costs of a progressively more

ttsuboptimal" consumption bundle (too little housing given its falling
