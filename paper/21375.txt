Inventing Prizes: A Historical Perspective on Innovation Awards and Technology Policy

                                                ABSTRACT

Prizes for innovations are currently experiencing a renaissance, following their marked decline during
the nineteenth century. However, Daguerre’s “patent buyout,” the longitude prize, inducement prizes
for butter substitutes and billiard balls, the activities of the Royal Society of Arts and other “encouragement”
institutions, all comprise historically inaccurate and potentially misleading case studies. Daguerre,
for instance, never obtained a patent in France and, instead, lobbied for government support in a classic
example of rent-seeking. This paper surveys empirical research using more representative samples
drawn from Britain, France, and the United States, including “great inventors” and their ordinary counterparts,
and prizes at industrial exhibitions. The results suggest that administered systems of rewards to innovators
suffered from a number of disadvantages in design and practice, some of which might be inherent
to their non-market orientation. These findings in part explain why innovation prizes lost favour as
a technology policy instrument in both the United States and Europe in the period of industrialization
and economic growth.

Technological progress has been characterized as a “lever or riches” that has been responsible for

a significant fraction of human welfare in the past three centuries.1 In such areas as innovations

in pharmaceuticals and healthcare, the stakes can be as fundamental as the difference between

large financial gains or losses for firms, and life or death for consumers. It is therefore not

surprising that policy debates surrounding inventions and innovations have frequently been

controversial. Policy makers of the past explored the full range of options that were available for

promoting ingenuity, including patents, prizes, subsidies, bounties, trade secrecy protection,

cartelization and the protection of monopolies, as well as specialized institutions dedicated to

administering inducements for innovation. What is, perhaps, surprising, is the extent of

historical myopia that manifests itself in the policy debates of the twenty-first century.

Proponents of different policies today tend to make selected and often inaccurate reference to

history, without a full assessment of all the relevant costs and benefits, a practice that creates the

potential for suboptimal rules and standards.

        In the nineteenth century, President Abraham Lincoln, a patentee himself, was convinced

that economic and business prosperity depended on strong property rights in patents. In 2014,

the President of the United States included patent policy in his State of the Union address, but

from a critical perspective that called for major reforms in longstanding rules and standards

regarding such intellectual property rights. Nobel Prize winners in economic theory have

contended that “probably the best solution would be to maintain the patent system on drugs and a

few other products that are expensive to innovate and cheap to copy, and eliminate patents on

everything else.”2 Others, however, are more concerned about the negative effects of

pharmaceutical patents on the provision of drugs and access to medical care.3 According to

some extremists, it is time to abolish the entire intellectual property system, which they regard as

an “unnecessary evil” and an unwarranted monopoly.4

         By way of contrast, both academics and American policy makers today are increasingly

enthusiastic about prizes. The White House urges that “history should be our guide” and “the

Federal Government should… use high-risk, high-reward policy tools such as prizes and

challenges to solve tough problems.”5 The federal government has begun to finance prizes as a

means of generating new ideas and products, claiming that prizes “have a good track record of

spurring innovation.”6 Numerous businesses have also offered large privately-funded prizes for

objectives that range from specific targets to solutions for more general problems.7 Many

  Netflix, for example, offered one million dollars in 2006 for an algorithm to improve its predictive capacity. The
competition attracted some 27,000 entrants and the prize was awarded in 2009 to a team that achieved the specified
target. The (excessive?) number of entrants may mirror problems that also occur in “patent races” (Michael Baye
and Heidrun C. Hoppe, "The strategic equivalence of rent-seeking, innovation, and patent-race games," Games and
Economic Behavior, 44 (2) 2003: 217-226.) The publicity was undoubtedly valuable for Netflix, but the firm later
reported that the benefits it derived from the prize-winning code were limited because “the additional accuracy gains
that we measured did not seem to justify the engineering effort needed to bring them into a production
environment.” This owed in part to a changed market environment, for which the findings from the competition
economists lobby for these nonmarket-oriented policies as complements or superior alternatives

to intellectual property rights.8 The rationale for promoting innovation prizes ranges from

attractive properties of theoretical economic models to unexamined case studies, and these

debates would benefit from more empirical analysis and information drawn from the actual

historical record.

        This survey considers the nature and consequences of alternative technology policy

instruments in the United States, Britain and France during the early industrial period. The paper

reviews the use and misuse of case studies regarding several prominent innovation awards,

assesses the experience of prestigious prize-granting institutions, and presents the results from

systematic empirical research on historical innovation prizes. The first section revisits the record

for several popular case studies that have figured prominently as representative of the historical

experience for inducement awards and related policy initiatives. The second section discusses

the salient details regarding the award of prizes by the Royal Society of Arts in England, and the

Society for the Encouragement of National Industry in France. The final section outlines the

results from large-scale empirical studies based on several different samples of prizes, including

awards to great inventors, and prize grants at industrial exhibitions in the nineteenth century.

These findings have implications for effective innovation policies, but the paper does not attempt

to project schemes for the design of an optimal inducement mechanism.

A substantial amount of theoretical economic research addresses the question of innovation

prizes.9 Theorists primarily distinguish between ex ante inducement awards, ex post prizes such

as rewards to the winners of competitions, targeted prizes that relate to a specific and well-

defined problem, and prizes for nonspecific achievements such as lifetime-career awards, while

more expansive definitions include research grants that subsidize inputs into technology, and

procurement contracts. The analysis at times contrasts intellectual property rights and alternative

arrangements as mutually exclusive, whereas other approaches assume their complementary

existence.10 Both technological discovery and the transformation of an invention into a

commercially useful innovation are stochastic and dynamic processes that are inherently difficult

to predict, so it is important to understand the fundamental role of information, valuation, and

incentives in policy alternatives. For instance, in a pioneering article, Brian Wright concludes

that the choice between intellectual property and other mechanisms will depend on the degree of

informational asymmetry between inventors and prize-granting agencies; if value and cost

cannot be accurately determined by grantors, patents would tend to dominate other prospective

incentive measures.11 What has been markedly missing from such valuable discussions,

however, is direct attention to the pragmatic details of how innovation prizes have worked in

practice, the political economy of administered institutions, and the deadweight losses that may

result from associated sources of inefficiency.

         The most popular and influential example of an inducement prize is the significant sum

that was offered for an accurate means of gauging longitude at sea, so it is worth re-examining

this case study.12 Specialists with a detailed knowledge of this case tend to be somewhat

skeptical about the effectiveness of the Longitude prize, which nobody ever officially won.13

John Harrison (1693-1776), a poor uneducated clockmaker, encountered numerous obstacles in

his dealings with the Board that administered the prize, including competition from some who

were also attempting to win the award on their own account.14 A full 47 years elapsed before

Harrison actually received compensation from another source than the Longitude Board. It is

possible that the information about the winning technology generated spillovers that benefited

the industry, but the incentives were quite different for the losers, who bore the risk of revealing

their inventive ideas without obtaining a return. The astronomer Samuel Molyneux was

appointed to examine the work of another participant in the race, Zachariah Williams, and




12
  The British Parliament passed a bill in July 1714 “for providing a public reward for such person or persons as
shall discover the longitude at sea.” The bill offered “10,000 pounds if the method were accurate to within 1 degree,
or 60 nautical miles; 15,000 pounds if the method were accurate to within 2/3 degree, or 40 nautical miles; 20,000
pounds if the method were accurate to within ½ degree, or 30 nautical miles.” The panel of judges comprised 22
commissioners, including the astronomer royal, the Speaker of the House of Commons, and the lords of Admiralty.

RGO-00014-00001/19. A modern version of this prize, Longitude 2014 (https://longitudeprize.org) notes that
“Bacteria are evolving to become resistant to the antibiotics we have successfully used for decades to treat
infections. Longitude Prize is looking to help tackle the problem with a £10 million prize fund for a diagnostic tool
that can rule out antibiotic use or help identify an effective antibiotic to treat a patient.” At the same time, other
grantors are offering equally large sums for similar solutions. For instance, the Department of Health and Human
Services plans that “A prize of up to $20 million will be awarded to the first group(s) to develop a rapid, point-of-
care diagnostic test to be used by health care providers to identify highly resistant bacterial infections” (nih.gov
website). See also Jon White, “Why it's time to resurrect a centuries-old prize,” New Scientist, Volume 222, Issue

14
   As shown in the empirical section, the social standing of inventors affected the likelihood of prize awards. For
instance, the uneducated George Stephenson and the well-connected Sir Humphry Davy both resolved the problem
of an effective safety lamp. According to the Dictionary of National Biography, Davy received public accolades and
a testimonial of £2000, whereas Stephenson was given the “paltry” sum of 100 guineas.
Williams claimed that Molyneux stole his design. Williams understandably became so secretive

about his methods that it was difficult to accurately assess his contributions.15

        The positive assessment of the role of prizes in generating a solution to longstanding

problems at times risks faulty logic involving post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacies. David Landes

points out that, while it is true that the British prize was associated with numerous attempts to

resolve the problem, the issue had been known and researched for more than a century prior to

the passage of the Longitude Bill in 1714. Enormous sums had been offered throughout Europe

for the discovery of a means of measuring longitude, long before the British introduced their own

prize, and those had all failed to produce a positive outcome. Despite the outlay of significant

resources towards assessing and aiding applicants, Spain, Venice and Holland had eventually

given up, because “necessity may be the mother of invention, especially if backed by money, but

there is no substitute for the kind of environment that generates novelty.” 16 Markets may have

failed because of spillovers that could not be privately captured, but it is also possible that, even

in the absence of state-sponsored prizes, another substitute would have been developed, because

of the significant profits that awaited anyone who resolved the problem.

        In Europe, an extensive array of targeted prizes were conferred on inventors who directed

their efforts to specific discoveries, such as the premium offered for margarine and food

preservation, and the sums directed toward the process to make soda from sodium chloride.17 In

a related example, the French Academy of Sciences in 1775 offered a cash prize for the

Society of Arts in London, where committees concluded that prizes, claimed fifty years or more after their initial
introduction, had functioned as successful inducements.

discovery of a process to create sodium carbonate from the cheaper sodium chloride.18 Nicolas

Leblanc succeeded in finding a viable manufacturing solution, but he never received the prize

and his factory was expropriated by the revolutionary government. From one perspective, such

prizes succeeded if, despite the failure of Harrison or Leblanc to win the award, the offers did

induce inventors to turn to the issue that was in need of a resolution. However, even if

unawarded prizes provided an effective one-period inducement, this argument fails to take into

account the deterrent effect owing to a fall in the credibility of the granting agency or

mechanism. That is, the process of invention is a repeated game and, when a prize is not

bestowed even though the conditions are satisfied, this occurrence reduces the perceived

probability of future awards and thus the expected benefits of prizes.19

         Other prominent examples of such innovation prizes reveal additional complexities,

including the potential for overcompensation of some inventors through multiple overlapping

awards. Premiums from the state did not preclude inventors from also pursuing profits through

other means, including patent protection. For instance, Napoleon III offered a monetary prize for

the invention of a cheap substitute for butter that may have induced Hippolyte Mège to make

significant improvements in margarine production. In assessing the efficacy of this prize it

should be noted that many inventors worldwide were already pursuing the idea of a cheap and

longer-lasting substitute for butter, and for the use of such fats in candles and soap. Mège not

only won the prize money, but also obtained patent protection for fifteen years in France in 1869,

and patented the original invention and several improvements in England, Austria, Bavaria, and

19
   The key point is that systematic awards take place in the context of a repeated game. If this were not the case, it
would be rational for governments or private institutions to costlessly benefit, by continually announcing an array of
spectacular prizes for inventions, and to subsequently refuse to make the award once the solution was discovered.
For a French example, see the prize of one million francs which Napoleon offered in 1810 for the inventor of an
effective flax-spinning machine. Philippe Girard succeeded in making such a machine but never received the award,
although his heirs were later given a small pension after his death. Gabriel Desclosières,Vie et inventions de

the United States. He sold the patent rights in Holland and the United States, to assignees who

made the improvements that transformed the patented product into a commercially-viable good.

In the absence of these follow-on patent rights, it is not clear that Mège himself would have had

the incentive to invest in efforts to turn the discovery into a better product.20

         The experience of the patentee John Wesley Hyatt is also often cited as an example of an

inducement prize that was administered by a private company.21 The billiard table producers

Phelan and Collender had offered a prize of $10,000 in 1863 for a material to replace costly and

increasingly scarce ivory inputs that were used to make billiard balls.22 This was not a new area

of inquiry, as witnessed by the accomplishments of British inventors Alexander Parkes and

Daniel Spill, as well as prior American patents on this subject-matter, but Hyatt sustained an

independent patent claim on his contribution.23 Both Parkes and Spill failed as entrepreneurs,

and Hyatt’s patented version proved to be successful in the marketplace. The $10,000 prize was

never paid out, but it is possible that Hyatt himself chose not to accept it. He established several

firms (including the prominent Celluloid Manufacturing Company), which allowed him to obtain

benefits from the marketplace, as a multiple patentee and entrepreneur, that were far in excess of

the prize money that Phelan and Collender had offered. This example illustrates problems of

20
   To avoid this problem, it is possible to structure the terms of the prize to offer interim awards until the product or
process is successfully commercialized.
21
   Hyatt’s first patent was obtained in 1861; his first patent for billiard balls was granted in 1865; and he later filed
over two hundred patents on a wide variety of inventions.
22
   This New York company was the largest manufacturer of billiards tables in the world, employing over 150 men
and significant capital. The firm continually introduced patented innovations, and both Hugh Collender and Michael
Phelan were successful multiple patentees. The partners were flamboyant promoters, and it is possible that the prize
may have been offered as a means of gaining free publicity. (“These gentlemen are more enterprising than most of
the New York manufacturers, and do not hide their light under a bushel. They have made their names so familiar to
the public, and their manufactory so well known, that it is impossible to write a comprehensive account of the
manufactures of New York without noticing it,” according to John Leander Bishop, A History of American
Manufactures from 1608 to 1860, Edw. Young, 1864, p. 612.)

adverse selection (where only “lemons” are awarded the payoff), and also difficulties in arriving

at an accurate inducement “price” when part of the benefit to the winner comprises additional

gains such as market power.

        Scholars who favour “patent buyout” policies typically cite the example of the

“Daguerreotype patent,” claiming that the French government purchased the rights to a patent

whose social value was great, and allowed everyone to have free access to the technology.

According to Michael Kremer’s account, “In 1839 the French government purchased the

Daguerreotype patent and placed it in the public domain. Such patent buyouts could potentially

eliminate the monopoly price distortions and incentives for rent-stealing duplicative research

created by patents, while increasing incentives for original research.”24 The facts are somewhat

different, however. Most noticeably, a search in nineteenth-century patent records reveal that

Daguerre never obtained a patent in France at any point in his life for this or any other invention.

As such, there was no patent for the French government to buy out, and the case study instead

highlights the incentives for unproductive “rent-stealing” that arises when returns can be

negotiated through a political process.

        In popular histories, Daguerre typically receives sole credit for the discovery of a method

of reproducing photographic images. However, work in photography had been in progress for

over a century, and arguably the most significant advances up to that date had been made by

Joseph-Nicéphore Niépce. Daguerre formed a partnership with Niépce, who died in 1833 and

bequeathed his inventive rights to his son. Isidore Niépce agreed that it was advisable for

marketing purposes that Daguerre should have the sole attribution rights to the joint work

Daguerre had accomplished with Isidore’s father.25 The political economy behind Daguerre’s

prize of August 1839 was typical of the stratagems and manipulations that French inventors often

adopted to get support and payouts from the authorities.26 Instead of paying the extremely high

fees for a patent, and trying to interest licencees or assignees, Daguerre was able to secure the

patronage of François Arago, a politician and influential member of the Académie des Sciences,

who lobbied strongly on Daguerre’s behalf in favour of a government grant. When the inventor

turned over to the Ministry of the Interior a packet with the specification and information on the

discovery, Arago was involved in the process of examining and verifying their validity on behalf

of the French government, in something of a conflict of interest.

         In view of the “patent buyout” argument, it is ironic that Daguerre’s main plea to the

French legislature was that he was unable to apply for a patent to gain benefits from the process:

“Unfortunately for the authors of this great discovery, it is impossible for them to commercialize

it and thereby obtain compensation for the sacrifices they have endured as a result of their long

and hitherto fruitless trials. Their invention is not susceptible to patent protection ... It is

therefore necessarily the case that this process must belong to everyone or else it must remain

unknown.”27 Daguerre thus contended that his idea was an unpatentable trade secret and, once it


25
   The two seem to have had a falling-out, however, as Isidore later inveighs against Daguerre for "the
Machiavellian tendencies which have taken away … the honor for which M. J.-N. Niépce had toiled over a period of
twenty years": Historique de la découverte improprement nommée Daguerréotype, précédée d'une notice sur son

was revealed, the whole world would have free access to his ideas and he would be unable to

appropriate any returns. As such, the choice before the legislature was for his secret to die with

him and be lost to the world (“il devait se perdre et mourir avec ses inventeurs”), or for the state

to buy the information and so benefit the public. An appeal was further cannily made to the

essentially mercantilist nature of the French authorities, by hinting that otherwise foreigners

might make an offer that Daguerre could not refuse. The measure was quickly approved, and an

annual lifetime pension of 10,000 francs was awarded for the discovery.28

         Daguerre at the same time proceeded to file for a patent in England under the name of

Miles Berry (a British patent agent), giving the lie to the notion that the invention was

unpatentable, and reneging on the bargain that the French government would buy the discovery

on behalf of the entire world.29 Daguerre and Berry then placed a true patent buyout prospectus

before the British government, on the grounds that the inventor was “obliged to ask so large a

sum to Individuals for Licences that few can afford to take them.”30 As a result of this alleged

failure of the market to recognize the true value of the invention, the inventor wished “to solicit

Her Majesty or the Government of England to purchase the said Patent right for the purpose of

throwing it open in England for the benefit of the Public and preventing this important Discovery

being fettered or limited by individual interest or exertion.”31 Daguerre’s British patent buyout



28
   The request was initially for an upfront award of 200,000 francs, but an annual lifetime payment seemed more
politically expedient than such a large lump sum payout. Six thousand francs per annum went to Daguerre, and the
remainder to Isidore Niepce, with residual rights of 50 percent of this sum payable during their widows’ lifetime.

         Patent buyouts are often proposed because they would allow ideas to circulate freely and

because such access enables cumulative inventions to flourish without the transactions costs and

deadweight loss that a monopolistic right of exclusion might impose. The Daguerre-Niépce

method did indeed spread quickly, comprising an undoubted advantage of the French policy, but

this approach to photographic reproduction was also short-lived and did not become the

dominant process in the marketplace. Instead, the English inventor William Fox Talbot patented

a technique in 1841 through which photographic prints could be developed from negatives, and it

was this approach that ultimately prevailed throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in

the pre-digital era.32 The buyout of the Daguerre process may also have created its own problem

of cumulative invention, by putting in the public domain all of the efforts of prior inventors

whose work was incorporated in the Daguerreotype, without their permission and without

offering them any compensation.33 Questions also remain about whether the monetary award

accurately gauged the true value of the invention, given the availability of (present and

imminent) substitutes that were not taken into account in the public accounting; the deadweight

loss of taxation and redistributive effects of using public funds to benefit one group in society

(photographers); and, ultimately, the incentives that such a policy creates for inefficient rent-

seeking and patronage on the part of inventors and their influential connections.34


32
   Talbot’s methods were different and independent of Daguerre’s and the validity of his patented discovery was
upheld in litigation. He was publicly criticized for the price of its use, and chose to appropriate returns through the
practice of price discrimination, charging professional photographers higher licence fees than amateurs.
33
   Even if the process had been patented, this would still be true, because French patents were granted via a
registration system without any prior examination to determine the incremental contributions that were worthy of
exclusive property rights.
34
   The role of such connections was important in European innovation awards, and comprised an additional cost of
administered prizes. Even in competitions with open access, worthy applications were at times not rewarded,
because the inventors lacked the advantage of patrons to exert their influence in prosecuting the claim on behalf of
II. EARLY PRIZE-GRANTING INSTITUTIONS

As the example of Daguerre highlights, European policies towards inventions and innovations in

the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were based on an extensive but somewhat arbitrary array

of rewards and incentives. Inventors or introducers of inventions could benefit from titles,

pensions that sometimes extended to spouses and offspring, loans (some interest-free), lump-sum

grants, bounties or subsidies for production, exemptions from taxes, and monopoly grants in the

form of exclusive privileges.35 As such, the French and British experience offers a valuable

opportunity to analyze the relative benefits and costs of alternative institutions and policy

instruments for generating technological innovation. This section focuses on the analysis of

innovation inducements offered by two of the primary societies in London and Paris for the

encouragement of technological discoveries during the industrial revolution.

         A key institution in the granting of prizes, medals, and “encouragements,” the Société

d'Encouragement pour l'Industrie Nationale (Society to Encourage National Industry or SEIN),

was founded in 1801.36 As the name suggests, its objectives were to promote economic



the inventor. “Unfortunately the government had no uniform policy for all inventors. Some it aided financially;
others it did not. More flagrantly inconsistent was its policy of granting monopolistic rights in many lines to court
favorites, so that the greater number enjoying exclusive privileges were not inventors,” Shelby T. McCloy, French
Inventions of the Eighteenth Century, Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, 1952, p. 171.
35
   The award of technological prizes was administered by ad hoc committees or institutions who varied significantly
in the extent to which the application was debated or formally examined, and in the accuracy of their valuations. (As
Scientific American recognized, “The Expert Committee would have a very delicate duty to perform in fixing the
cash valuations, and they would constantly be subjected to risks and probabilities of making egregious errors.”
Scientific American, March 1852, vol 7, p. 221.) In 1790, M. Devilliers demonstrated two inventions in Paris: a
device to measure longitude and one to purify the town water supply. He claimed a total of 4,200 livres, and offered
to donate a quarter of the award to the paupers in the town, and the French Committee on Agriculture and
Commerce saw no need for deliberations before granting his request. In other cases, committees engaged in
extensive due diligence, and only offered conditional awards that awaited successful outcomes before payouts. See
B. Zorina Khan, The Democratization of Invention, op. cit.
36
   Societies such as the Paris Académie des Sciences ostensibly offered prizes for discoveries in pure science,
although at times the subject matter included technological issues. See Maurice Crosland, “From Prizes to Grants in
the Support of Scientific Research in France in the Nineteenth Century: The Montyon Legacy,” Minerva, Vol. 17,
No. 3 (Autumn, 1979): 355-380.
development by furthering technological innovation and manufacturing, and specifically to

distribute information, assess and fund new inventions, and award prizes.37 The SEIN is often

characterized as a private free-market initiative to promote French industrial competitiveness, but

scholars point out that it was initially a state-founded and state-run institution that was created by

representatives primarily from such government departments as the Ministry of the Interior.38

In any event, it is clear that throughout its first century the administrators, committees and

members of the SEIN were primarily drawn from the elite circles of politicians, aristocrats,

scientists, professors, bankers, and wealthy manufacturers, who were not all necessarily qualified

to gauge inventive merit.39 Juries or committee membership may in part have been offered as an

honour, rather than as a means of obtaining the most competent or technically-qualified

personnel.

        The Society published an annual list of proposed areas, to which it sought to attract

applicants for cash prizes, medals, and “encouragements” or other support for projects. The list

identified the problem, in specific terms in some cases, and quite broad and vague phrases in

others, along with the monetary value of the prize that was at stake. The Jacquard loom for silks,

improved turbines by Claude Burdin and his student Benoit Fourneyron, and the naturalization of

sugar beets, illustrate the successes of the Society. In 1810 Nicolas-François Appert received a

payout of 12,000 francs for his discoveries of improvements in food preservation, although his



37
   Jean-Antoine Chaptal, President of the Society from 1801-1832, proved to be a remarkable force and leader in the
movement to support national industry, and was himself an accomplished scientist and industrialist.
38
   The SEIN is typically described as the spontaneous creation of influential individuals and entrepreneurs who
wished to support domestic industry, but some researchers refer to this perspective as a “founding myth.” See
Andrew J. Butrica, “Creating a Past: The Founding of the Société d'Encouragement pour l'Industrie Nationale

method of employing heated glass bottles was not entirely novel.40 Appert did not have to turn

his rights over to the public; the sole requirement for earning the award was the printing of 200

copies of a short book to describe his methods, and he signed each volume individually, warning

potential infringers that he would prosecute them.41 The Society awarded Appert a silver medal

in 1816, followed by a gold medal in 1820, and a lack of coordination across prize-granting

societies allowed him to garner cash awards and prizes for the same discovery from several

different sources.42 Administered prize systems implied such negotiations and strategy could

increase the inventor’s rewards independently of the value of the invention and, consequently, as

Liliane Hilaire-Pérez notes, “in France, to invent meant to go into politics.”43



40
   The Appert process seems to provide an example of an ex post award, rather the outcome of an inducement.
Relevant supporting original documents are included in Nicolas Appert, L’Art de conserver, pendant plusieurs
années, toutes les substances animales et végétales, Paris: Patris et Cie, 1810. See also the biography of Appert in
Potin, J., Exposition universelle internationale de 1889 à Paris, Rapports du jury international, Classes 70 et
71,1891: 9-14. Salting, boiling, pickling, and freezing had been practiced for centuries as cheap methods of
conserving foods, and several scientists had devised a similar process to Appert’s. Appert had long been
experimenting on the job with ways to improve on the flavor of such preserved foods. He was able to interest
English financiers who in 1804 funded his small manufactory in Massy that employed about 30 women, and this
work drew the attention of connected officials, as well as the popular press. The Bureau consultatif des arts et
manufactures subjected his foods to several tests and testimonies from elite panelists. As might be expected from a
former gourmet chef, the samples he offered the panel included delicacies like freshly-picked truffles that had been
preserved, cherries, raspberries and cream, that had been put up by hand in bottles in a very labour-intensive
process. Clearly, Appert’s bottles were not ideal for provisioning an army, and the English method of canning (with
American improvements) was more efficient. In France, “Appertized” establishments were small artisanal shops,
the price of preserved foods was too expensive for large-scale usage, (French!) soldiers detested the taste of the
tinned mass-produced items, cases of massive food poisoning led to wariness, and these goods remained a niche
product until the end of the nineteenth century. See Martin Bruegel, “Du temps annuel au temps quotidien: la
conserve appertisée à la conquête du marché, 1810-1920,” Revue d'histoire moderne et contemporaine, 44 (1) 1997:
40-67. Appert’s manufacturing efforts were not financially successful and the state made him an annual pension of
1200 francs to ease his poverty.

frontispiece of Appert’s 1810 book, op. cit.) Appert submitted the copies of this work to the Bureau consultatif des
Arts et Manufactures. Similarly, James Douglas, an English engineer, was able to gain the support of influential
officials, including Chaptal, which he was able to parlay into a portfolio of benefits, including a large loan from the
Conservatoire des arts et métiers, patents for his machines, as well as funds from the Society for the Encouragement
of National Industry. Michael P. Fitzsimmons, From Artisan to Worker: Guilds, the French State, and the

   The archival records of both the RSA and the SEIN indicate a significant number of “repeat players.” The
prevalence of repeat winners, rather than losers who subsequently won, suggests that the patterns were likely not due
to learning.

        Table 1 shows the subject-matter for the prizes that were granted during the first half-

century of the Society’s existence. The percentage distribution by value indicates the relative

importance of the awards during this critical period, and suggest the prizes were not wholly

aligned with the economic value of innovations for the individual industry. The Society offered

valuable support for heavy industry and metals, including forges, locomotives, machine tools, as

well as steam engines. However, awards for the domestic cultivation of sugar beets and sugar

production accounted for 9.3 percent of prizes, relative to a mere 1.2 percent for locomotives,

and it is not clear why sugar should have been viewed as more meritorious than transportation.

The ceramics industry obtained a surprising 12.7 percent of funding, and fine arts and music

similarly received 11 percent of the prizes and encouragements. The criteria for some grants

were associated with inventive novelty and higher productivity, but others were less related to

technological excellence, and included justifications that ranged from close imitation of foreign

goods, to good workmanship and the beauty of an item, and even the moral character of the

applicants.44 The Bulletin of the Society for 1820 included figures that showed 184,000 francs

had been offered as prizes since the founding of the institution, whereas only 41.6 percent of this

sum had actually been granted. In some instances, the prize was withdrawn because the problem

had already been resolved elsewhere, or because no applicants were deemed to be worthy, which

were indicative of effective due diligence. In many other areas, the award remained unclaimed

throughout its history because of a lack of entries, indicating nobody had been “induced” by the

offer, perhaps because the award was too low or the problem was insoluble or uninteresting.

Such failures need to be taken into account, to avoid a selection bias in the assessment of

inducement prizes.


44
  These statements are based on a perusal of several thousand pages of handwritten committee reports in the attic of
the Society in Paris, France.
        In view of current advocacy in favour of prizes for medical discoveries, it is relevant to

note that several prizes were offered in nineteenth-century France, and in other countries, for

cures, preventive measures, and medical solutions to public health problems such as cholera.45

The French Academy of Sciences bestowed a prize of 5000 francs on Léon Doyère for his

experiments on cholera victims, whereas specialists disparaged his efforts as already known in

points, and incorrect in others. The Russian government offered 25,000 roubles for the best

treatise on this subject, and made investments in examining 125 entries, none of which was

practicable.46 A well-known and often-cited prize of 100,000 francs, the Bréant award, was

offered for a means of curing cholera, or for prevention of the epidemics. The Bréant fund made

a minor payout but remained largely intact and unclaimed well into the twentieth century, despite

numerous submissions that proved to be largely ineffective or even irrelevant. Clearly, “money

left on the table” in this way was not costless, because there was an opportunity cost in terms of

more viable or productive alternatives that could have been funded.

        The Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce

(commonly known as the Royal Society of Arts or the RSA) offers another example where the

historical details are not entirely consistent with popular anecdotes. The Royal Society of Arts

has been cited as an institution that serves as a model for the adoption of prizes instead of

intellectual property rights. For instance, Joseph Stiglitz, a theorist and holder of the Nobel Prize

in Economics, proclaims: “the alternative of awarding prizes would be more efficient and more

equitable. It would provide strong incentives for research but without the inefficiencies

associated with monopolisation. This is not a new idea – in the UK for instance, the Royal

Society of Arts has long advocated the use of prizes. But it is, perhaps, an idea whose time has

come.”47

         The RSA was founded in London in 1754, in part to “embolden enterprise,” according to

its charter. Initially, the Society published annual lists of items for which inducement awards

were to be offered, in the form of honorary medals and cash payouts. These prizes were

administered by specific committees in the designated categories of Polite Arts, Mechanics,

Agriculture, Chemistry, Manufactures, as well as Colonies and Trade. The society achieved

some success in calling attention to scarcity in such industrial areas as the production of soda

made from salt. In others, such as its treatment of the great inventor John Kay, its record is less

than stellar.48 The Royal Society itself was the target of persistent criticism throughout this

period, including scathing assessments by its own disillusioned members, who attributed awards

to arbitrary factors such as personal influence, the persistence of one's recommenders, or the self-

interest of the institution in making the award. As in France, the mercantilist doctrines that

informed the choices of the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) meant that a great deal of effort and

funds were directed toward nationalistic attempts to replicate items and inputs that were already

being produced more efficiently in foreign countries.

   The experience of the famous English textile machine inventor, John Kay, illustrates the asymmetries and risks
involved in individual bargains struck with such authorities. Kay settled in France because of state promises of
support as well as a monopoly on textile shuttles, and he substantially aided this country’s technological competency
in the textile industry. The Royal Society in England promised him a generous reward to leave France, and then
reneged on the agreement once he was back in London. Kay then contacted Prudaine de Montigny, Conseiller
d’Etat in London, to explore the possibility of receiving French financial aid if he again immigrated to Paris. Later
that same year, Kay wrote to M. de Brou, Intendant de Rouen, to complain that he was still not receiving the annuity
he had been promised. This account is based on correspondence and documents in the French National Archives.

Growth: Evidence from the Great Inventors of the United States, 1790-1930,” in Institutions and Economic Growth,

         The Royal Society, an early advocate of prizes, did not view them as complementary to

patents and, indeed, was initially hostile to the grant of patents. The Rules and Orders of the

Society stipulated that prize winners were not permitted to obtain patents for their inventions.

This led to an adverse selection effect, because the owners of important discoveries chose to

obtain patents and bypassed the RSA, whereas the owners of minor inventions had an incentive

to try to claim a prize award that was in excess of the market value of the item.49 As a result, the

annals of the RSA prizes were largely devoted to undistinguished contributions, and the truly

significant innovations were to be found in the roster of patentees, rather than in RSA records.

For instance, the inventor Samuel Clegg obtained a patent for an important gas-meter in 1815,

and the RSA gold medal was instead given for an incremental improvement on Clegg’s patent.

As one contemporary observer pointed out: “Of the importance of these discoveries the Society

is by no means ignorant; but as, in connection with the majority of the industries which grew out

of these discoveries, patents were obtained, the Society refused to take cognizance of them,

having effectually closed its doors against all patented inventions; the necessary result, as coal,

iron, and the steam engine extended their influence, was that the Society lost power and

position….”50

         As was the case for the French SEIN, the archives of the Royal Society of Arts reveal

prizes which remained unawarded over the course of decades, as well as other prizes offered for




49
   The most palpable successes of the RSA were typically in subject areas that were unpatentable, such as the 1802
medal and cash award to Henry Greathead’s lifeboat, which also received numerous other awards from Parliament,
as well as from other institutions. Inventors who competed for nonmonetary awards may have been interested in the
prospect of attracting the notice of a patron on one of the committees, or in promoting their claims to the military or
the government.

problems that had long been resolved or patented.51 For instance, in 1777 a gold medal was

available for a method to measure the degree of sweetness in saccharine substances, that no one

ever attempted to resolve.52 Sir Henry Trueman Wood, a Secretary of the RSA for several

decades, points to the inability of the committees to identify or predict the course of

economically important new technologies.53 A large sum was allotted to the provision of an

improved supply of fish to markets in London, although the results were not entirely satisfactory

in terms of meeting the expectations of the Committee in question. Panels of judges applied

idiosyncratic criteria to the assessment of applications and, Wood noted, some of the awards may

have been motivated by criteria besides the objective quality of the invention, such as sympathy

or friendship. Other chroniclers (including another Secretary) of the RSA conclude that

economic advance soon “made obsolete the whole idea of encouraging industrial progress by the

award of prizes.”54 Outsiders tended to regard the institution with a more sanguine perspective,

but conceded that “Of course it is true that the Society of Arts can take no credit for the

development of the iron industry in Britain, or that of the steam-engine, and little for the creation

names of Watt, Hargreaves … amongst those whose inventions were recognized and rewarded by the Society of
Arts. But in the early records none of these names appear. Why is this? … A committee which could anticipate the
direction in which industry or science would progress would have to be composed of men with prescience beyond
their fellows (p. 241)…Another reason which prevented the Society from taking cognizance of many important
inventions was the regulation which excluded patented articles (p. 244).” Instead, one notes awards for obsolete
spinning wheels, for which “various prizes were offered, and certain small improvements were duly rewarded.
None of them, however, were of any great value, and, as we fully recognize now, the efforts of the Society were
quite futile, and its energy was entirely misdirected” (p. 260).

of the Lancashire textile industry. It may even be doubted whether the awards of prizes and

medals would have had the least effect in strengthening enormous economic forces.”55

         The general conclusions of authors, including insiders and officers of the Society, is that

the policy of granting prizes resulted in a few successes, but that industrialization in Britain was

largely independent of such awards. Their views are supported by the data, drawn from the

archival records of the RSA. Figure 1 shows the time series of awards bestowed during the

eighteenth century, and reveals a sharp drop-off in the total amount of prizes in the decade after

the Society’s founding in 1754. The levels after 1770 comprise a much lower plateau of activity,

which do not reflect the expansion and structural change in the wider economy. Table 2

examines the patterns of awards at a more disaggregated level. These data indicate that the

awards of the Society within the declining patterns over time were for innovations that were

primarily outside of the burgeoning manufacturing sector, which accounted for just 7.3 percent

of total funds allocated through 1782.56 Prizes were given in agriculture for the introduction of

imported fodder-crops such as Swedish turnips, rhubarb and the mangold-wurzel, but not for

innovative plant breeding. However, over twenty million trees were planted owing to awards

that were largely offered to the landed gentry. As in France, the sector that benefited most from

the premiums that the RSA bestowed was the “polite arts,” including watercolours, sketches,

Royal Society of Arts, Vol. 122 (5218) 1974: 641-658, p. 644. He adds, “the main pioneers … went without
recognition, perhaps because of patent protection. It is my impression that such awards had negligible effects on
major industrial changes” p. 645. For a debate about such issues in the early textile industry, see Trevor Griffiths et
al., “Inventive activity and the British textile industry , 1700-1800,” Journal of Economic History, 52 (4) 1992: 881-

   Similarly, between 1731 and 1839, the prestigious Copley Medal was largely given for optics, heat and electricity,
anatomy, and chemistry, with just 12 percent of the awards in the area of mechanics. The vast majority of these
awards (90 percent) went to higher status gentlemen and professionals, with only 10 percent given to artisans or
tradesmen, and the authors note some degree of “internal favoritism” in the selection process. See M. Yakup Bektas
and Maurice Crosland, “The Copley Medal: the Establishment of a Reward System in the Royal Society, 1731-
1839,” Notes Rec. R. Soc. Lond. 46 (1) 1992: 43-76.
sculpture, and “musick.” The analysis by contemporary insiders and the data are thus consistent

with the notion that the course of British industrialization was not significantly altered or aided

by the policies of the premier prize-granting institution of its time.

         It is therefore not surprising that, in both England and France, the systematic institution

of “inducement prizes” that had prevailed in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries failed

to survive except for sporadic instances. In England, by the 1820s the Royal Society realized the

inefficiencies associated with prizes, and instead switched to lobbying in favour of patents. By

the time of the Crystal Palace Exhibition in 1851, the RSA had not only acknowledged the value

of patents, it had become active in lobbying for reforms to strengthen the British patent laws

along the lines of the U.S. model.57 The system of inducement prizes in France and England was

typically replaced by research grants to underwrite the costs of R&D inputs into the technology

production process.58 Both institutions also switched their mandate towards the provision of

information and technical education.59 The RSA even refused to accept further funding from

benefactors who wished to designate prizes, because such endowments hampered their desire to

reform their policies away from such targeted awards and towards more productive endeavours

for “the advancement of Natural Knowledge.”60

III. EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON PATENTS AND PRIZES



The patent and innovation policy controversies of the twenty-first century have often

unknowingly replicated concerns from the past regarding the nature and consequences of

technology institutions.61 For instance, pivotal Supreme Court decisions have in part been

justified with references to history that exhibit a faulty understanding of the actual development

of intellectual property markets.62 Policy debates would therefore benefit from an historical

perspective on the design, operation and consequences of incentive mechanisms for promoting

technological change and innovations. At the same time, even if selected supporting anecdotes

are accurate, their representativeness needs to be determined through the systematic empirical

analysis of data drawn from a number of independent sources.

        Patent institutions have played a primary role in the technology policy of the world’s
leading industrial nation, so it is perhaps not coincidental that a significant amount of research
has already been directed towards the empirical analysis of patent systems and outcomes.63 Such

in a concurring opinion that injunctive remedies might not be as appropriate because “the nature of the patent being
enforced and the economic function of the patent holder present considerations quite unlike earlier cases. An
industry has developed in which firms use patents not as a basis for producing and selling goods but, instead,
primarily for obtaining licensing fees.” For evidence that such considerations are not “quite unlike earlier cases,”

scholars as Kenneth Sokoloff have produced extensive evidence that patents played a substantial
role in influencing the rate and direction of inventive activity during industrialization, and were
also associated with advances in productivity.64 Inventions and inventors of all backgrounds
were responsive to economic incentives.65 From the first decades of the nineteenth century,
strongly enforced property rights in patents facilitated trade and commercialization, with all the
attendant benefits of market exchange.66 The vast majority of “great inventors” who produced
the transformative innovations in both the United States and Britain (especially after the latter
reformed their patent laws towards the U.S. model) were patentees.67 A major feature of the

by examiners through a centralized process) and the economic value (determined by the market
through a decentralized process) of an invention. Impecunious inventors in particular benefited
from markets in patents, because they were able to specialize in inventive activity, and obtain
returns in the market place by selling or licensing their patent rights to others who were better
equipped to commercialize their discoveries.68 An extensive network of specialized
intermediaries facilitated patent sales and licensing, and helped to reduce the transactions costs
of trades in new technologies, in both national and international markets.69
        The central role of patents and the market for technology in American policy was

recognized by prominent foreign observers. Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), a British

inventor and scientist, was a judge at the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, which

featured displays for Bell’s telephone, the Westinghouse airbrake, Edison’s improved telegraph,

sewing machines, refrigerator cars and numerous other patented discoveries. He reported :

“Judged by its results in benefiting the public, both by stiumulating inventors and by giving a

perseveringly practical turn to their labours, the American patent law must be admitted to be

most successful, and the beneficence of its working was very amply illustrated throughout the

American region of the Exhibition, where, indeed, it seemed that every good thing deserving a

patent was patented.”70 A Swiss Commissioner to the Philadelphia Exhibition likewise

successfully urged his own countrymen to model its policy after the U.S. and introduce a patent

system.71 A special commission from Japan was even more emphatic, asking “‘What is it that

makes the United States such a great nation?’… we investigated and we found it was patents,

and we will have patents.”72

         Patents comprised a central feature of U.S. innovation policies, and this orientation is

reflected in the stock of academic research. By way of contrast, relatively little systematic

evidence has been produced in the area of prize incentives. In the earliest such attempt, an

insightful nineteenth-century observer in England, Samuel Sidney, sought to determine “Whether

… manufacturing inventions [can be] stimulated, by invitations to compete for substantial or

honorary awards?”73 Sidney spent ten years investigating the data on prizes at exhibitions, as

well as the incentives that various societies offered for encouraging industry. His investigations

led him to conclude that prizes generally tended to be inefficient, and improvements in market

demand and competition offered more effective inducements for inventive activity. The prize

system, he found, merely encouraged “a long list of machines which, for practical purposes, are

no better than toys.”74 For instance, the market value of useful inventions tended to be far greater

than any prize that could be offered, whether by private or state initiative. Even prestigious

   “We must introduce the patent system. All our production is more or less a simple copy. ... It is evident that this
absolute want of protection will never awaken in a people the spirit of invention. ... America has shown us how in a
few years a people, in the midst of circumstances often embarrassing, can merit by its activity, its spirit of enterprise,
and its perseverance, the respect and admiration of the whole world, and acquire in many respects an incontestable
superiority.” cited in “Arguments before the Committee on Patents of the Senate and House of Representatives,”

institutions such as the Royal Agricultural Society and the Royal Society of Arts had failed to

develop truly significant inventions.75 Moreover, the competitor for a prize had an incentive to

overspend on the item in an attempt to win, regardless of whether such investments were

practicable in the marketplace. As a result, winners tended to be among the wealthiest of the

competitors: “The theory that prizes encourage humble merit is only a theory, for experience

shows that in a series of yearly contests wealth wins, as it must when hundreds of pounds must

be expended to win ten.”76 However, he found that, from the perspective of manufacturers or

retailers, prizes served as a useful marketing strategy, comparable to advertisements and

enhanced brand name capital. Sidney’s thoughtful assessment are all consistent with the

quantitative analysis of national and international prize systems discussed here.

        Systematic insights into the relationship between incentives and innovation can be

gleaned from a large sample of British inventors who were responsible for the great inventions of

the period before the Second World War. 77 The sample includes information on all of the prizes

and other forms of official recognition the British great inventors received, and indicates that less

than 40 percent of these eminent inventors were recipients of awards. When many might be

equally deserving, a question arises about why one is selected, and some observers identify

instances when such awards, medals and prestigious appointments owed to nepotism, bias and

even corruption.78 Statistical analysis of the factors that influenced the probability that an

   An extensive survey in Britain concluded that presenters were concerned about “the indiscriminate manner in
which awards are often bestowed” (Great Britain, Board of Trade, Report of the Committee appointed by the Board
inventor would receive a prize shows that patentees were more likely to get prizes, so the

incremental incentive effects of an additional prize were likely quite low. The grants of prizes to

British great inventors owed in part to their personal connections rather than to factors that might

have enhanced the technical value of the discovery. The most significant variable affecting the

award of a prize was an elite or Oxbridge education, which doubled the likelihood of such

winning recognition, despite the contemporary hostility of such institutions to pragmatic studies.

At the same time, specialized education or employment in science or technology fields, which

might be expected to enhance inventiveness and productivity, did not significantly affect the

probability of getting a prize. Such findings are consistent with the growing disillusionment in

Europe with prizes as an incentive mechanism for generating innovation.

         A number of empirical studies have been based on samples of prizes and exhibits at

international fairs, as a means of gauging the relationship of prizes and patents to overall

inventive activity.79 Such studies offer valuable insights; however, counts of the prize entries at

international exhibitions are unlikely to be representative of the inventive capital either within or

across individual industries or countries.80 In the first place, the size and content for displays for

   Since many of the exhibitors tended to be firms, agents or commercializers, rather than inventors, it is impossible
to accurately determine which items had been patented. Contemporary observers noted that a number of the entries
at the Crystal Palace were actually copies of articles invented and patented in the United States. Crystal Palace
Juries were instructed to “reward an important Machine without undertaking to pronounce whether the novelties
exhibited in its construction have been originated by the Exhibitor, or have been borrowed or adapted by him from
some one else.” (Official Catalogue of the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations, Reports by the
Juries, p. xxv.) According to the rules, exhibits did not have to be new and some were several decades old, and
any group of products or country were determined in part by distance and political expedience,

rather representing random draws from the underlying population of inventions.81 As Table 3

indicates, at the 1851 Crystal Palace event, Britain and its dependents accounted for 7,381 or 53

percent of all exhibitors, in comparison to 12 exhibitors from the entire continent of South

America, 12.3 percent from France, and 499 or 3.6 percent from the United States. At the Paris

Universal Exhibition of 1855, by way of contrast, France and its dependents now comprised 50.1

percent of all 21,779 exhibitors, while Britain and its colonies were a mere 15 percent, and the

United States, at 0.6 percent, was the same size as the Greek contingent.

         Even if the “home court advantage” is accounted for, there were significant differences in

participation within and across industries and countries that were uncorrelated with technological

capability. For instance, the funding for the exhibitions, as well as variation in costs (travel,

insurance, and other expenses), influenced the number and composition of the displays. Some

financing derived from private initiative, while others were funded by national governments, and

this variation occurred across products and countries at any specific event, as well as across

time.82 Exhibitors tended to be export-oriented firms seeking customers, and were not

necessarily representative of the population of inventors or inventions. Their presence was

affected by the conditions for the market for their specific products at home, relative to their

without a time-limited test of novelty, counts of exhibits cannot be usefully compared across industries, countries or
fairs. Instead, juries were instructed to give prizes for criteria that had little or nothing to do with technological
inventiveness or patentability, such as beauty of design and appearance, “adaptability to use, economy in first cost,
durability, economy of maintenance, excellency [sic] of workmanship, strength.” The percentage of prizes by
country tended to be proportionate to the exhibitors rather than to technological value, and above fifty percent of
exhibits typically received recognition of one sort or another. Many of the Judges were chosen because of their
personal prestige rather than because they were familiar with the latest technologies and, even if qualified, political
issues, differences in language and personal preferences complicated the already opaque decision-making process.

   The United States was in the middle of a war at the time of the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1862, and Congress
allowed only $2,000, so just 128 Americans participated among the total of 26,348 exhibitors, whereas the U.S.
government allocated more than $1.4 million to the Paris exhibition of 1900, which obviously boosted participation.
The French government was typically generous in supporting participation at all international exhibitions, relative to
other countries, especially in certain industries which it considered politically expedient.
expected gains overseas.83 The prize entries reflected this commercial orientation, and numerous

items on display were not patentable or even innovations; many comprised agricultural produce,

interesting specimens of minerals and taxidermy, embroidery, and final goods that illustrated

good workmanship or attractive design elements rather than innovation.84 Moreover, the award

of prizes tended to be proportional to the number of exhibitors and did not necessarily proxy

inventive quality or quantity.

         One way to control for some of the biases of samples drawn from prize-granting events at

the international or national levels is to consider within-city variation. In the United States prizes

were not as prevalent as in Europe and, indeed, the most prominent of these honorific awards

were introduced in the United States at the instigation of foreigners.85 However, innovation

institutions sponsored industrial fairs in most large cities in the United States, on a roughly

annual basis, which attracted a majority of entries from nearby areas. These exhibitions were

sampled to construct a panel data set of technological innovations that were submitted for prizes,

comprising some 20,000 entries from major cities, including Boston, New York, Philadelphia,

San Francisco, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Raleigh (North Carolina), Charleston (South Carolina), and



83
   See Great Britain, Board of Trade, Exhibitions Branch, London: Wyman and Sons, 1907, p. 3:
“an exhibition which may offer special advantages as an advertisement for one trade may prove to be of little or no
value to another, owing to the highly developed state of that industry in the country in which the exhibition is held.
Thus a manufacturer of agricultural machinery, who could expect but little profit from exhibiting his goods at an
Exhibition in the United States of America, might derive benefit through showing them in Russia, and a maker of
aniline dyes, who might be reluctant, for the same reason, to exhibit his products at Berlin, might be willing to show
them at, St. Louis or Chicago.”

   Representative entries for Switzerland, for instance, included machines, but also various paintings, “a double
American rifle,” gemstones, lace, fringed shawls, miniature milk tubs, goat skins, cow bells, embossed drinking
cups, wood carvings, and a watch-stand “made by a pupil of the Asylum for the Blind.” An examination of Swiss
entries at international exhibitions indicates that many prizes were awarded for workmanship and design rather than
new inventive ideas. This is confirmed by contemporary observers, “The novelties [chronometers] were improved
designs rather than new movements,” B.P. Johnson, Report on the International Exhibition of industry and Art,
London, 1862, (1863), p. 74.

   For instance, the John Scott Medal and premium was funded by a legacy from the London pharmacist, who
bequeathed $4000 in 1815 for “premiums to ingenious men or women who make useful inventions.” Awards and
honours from foreign governments and institutions were liberally bestowed on famous American patentees such as
Thomas Edison, Samuel Colt, and Sir Hiram Maxim (the first American to be knighted by the Queen of England).
Atlanta, over the course of the nineteenth century.86 These individual-level observations were

matched with the patent records to identify the inventions that were patented. The matched data

were then linked with the manuscript population censuses, to obtain information on the

backgrounds of individual inventors, such as occupation, age, wealth and geographical mobility.

The subsequent analysis at the level of individual innovations and inventors was conducted

separately by city, as opposed to a higher level of regional aggregation, and the revealed

consistency in the results across cities lends some confidence in the generality of the patterns.

         As shown before, observers of the U.S. patent system in the nineteenth century noted that

almost everything that could be patented was patented, and the data on the propensity to patent

for American “great inventors” support these claims.87 At the same time, it is also true that a

considerable and diverse amount of creativity was indeed occurring outside the formal patent

system, and we can speculate why such items were not patented. First, some might argue that

such inventors actively rejected the patent option, and instead decided to appropriate returns

through other means such as trade secrecy. However, secrecy seems somewhat implausible as a

general explanation for data based on prize competitions, since it is unlikely that secrecy would

be promoted by participating in a public exhibition. Second, if inventors rationally compare the

costs to the benefits of patent protection, and decide to forego patenting, it is possible that a

number of these unpatented inventions were of minimal technical or economic value. Third,

many exhibits at prize competitions were simply not eligible to be considered for a patent, either

because they lacked novelty, or because the innovation fell outside the subject matter that could

be patented.88

         The stated objective of such industrial exhibitions was to advance the standing of

innovative workers and artisans. Nevertheless, participants in these events were drawn from

markedly more prominent socioeconomic backgrounds than the general population of

patentees.89 Indeed, the information on occupations show that exhibitors were significantly less

likely to be artisans and ordinary labourers than were patentees, and the representation of artisans

at the exhibitions also declined over time. Occupational class does not directly translate into

economic or social status or influence, but the information on wealth-holding from the

population censuses of 1850, 1860 and 1870 provides additional evidence on the economic status

of exhibitors relative to patentees in general. These data confirm Samuel Sidney’s finding, since

the participants in the exhibitions were substantially wealthier than the general population and

the population of patentees. 90 For instance, in 1860 the sample from the industrial fairs owned

average personal property that was almost twice as extensive as that of patentees in general, and

more than double their average real estate holdings.

         Patents must satisfy specific rules and standards that are outlined in the laws; applications

are examined through an objective rule-based centralized process; and applicants have the right

to appeal the decisions of examiners. None of these criteria was true of prizes, and leads to the

   Patent examiners in the United States have the task of filtering applications for novelty and for conformity with
the rules and standards of the Patent Office and the patent laws. The descriptions for the vast majority of exhibits
tend to be quite vague and, without detailed specialized knowledge about each exhibit, it is impossible to determine
the amount of novel inventive capital vested in unpatented exhibits. However, it is straightforward to categorize the
patentability of each item in terms of subject matter. Application of this minimal filter of subject matter indicates
that prize-oriented exhibits were typically quite different from patents and, indeed, the majority of exhibits that were
not patented were actually unpatentable.

key question of what determined whether an entrant received a prize or not. The statistical

analysis of separate datasets, including prizes and awards to great inventors in Britain, and to

great inventors in the United States, exhibitions of the Massachusetts Mechanics Institute, and

the American Institute of New York, are all consistent. These studies indicate that, unlike

patents, almost all of the variation in prize awards remains unexplained, implying that these

grants were based on fairly random and unsystematic rationales.91 The multivariate regression

results from the industrial exhibitions show that the most significant factor that influenced

outcomes was financial status: exhibitors with greater personal wealth were more likely to win

gold and silver medals. However, the mechanism through which wealthier exhibitors gained an

edge over their competition is unclear. Advantages for wealthy applicants may have been

associated with greater expenditures on their presentation at the fairs, name recognition, or

perhaps to less obvious connections with the award juries. It is also possible that the individual’s

wealth was correlated with unobserved variation in the ownership of businesses.92 In general,

the results indicate that the awards reflected characteristics of the inventor, rather than

characteristics of the invention.

         The judges for these technology classes in the industrial exhibitions stated their objective

was to reward novelty and inventive ingenuity. In practice, they bestowed medals for an array

of other reasons besides inventiveness, including overcoming adversity (such as age or physical

handicaps), cheapness of the item, neatness, and aesthethic factors.93 In addition, as in the

European institutions, a nationalistic orientation towards import substitution was evident when

   Some contemporary assessments in the United States similarly refer to the process as “invidious”( “Awards at
Exhibitions,” Electrical Review, 1885.); as well as “impractical and liable to the grossest abuse… special systems ,
where favors are sought for and obtained by particular parties in a particular manner” ( Scientific American, March
1852, vol 7, p. 221.)
awards were given to the producers of American goods that attempted to replicate innovations

originally created in foreign countries. The decentralization of judging committees, the lack of

transparency and the private nature of their decision making process, and the absence of appeal

from their rulings, all encouraged idiosyncratic and inconsistent decisions.94 It is thus not

surprising that observers continually criticized the arbitrary way in which the awards were given

out, at domestic and international fairs alike. This mattered, because a lack of systematic

methods of allocating awards reduced the incentives for inventors who realized that prizes in

many instances were uncorrelated with inventive merit.

        Research has also been directed towards the assessment of positive spillovers (benefits

that ensue to others besides the parties directly involved in an activity) from inventive activity.95

Scholars typically contrast patents as monopolies (that offer the right to exclude) to prizes

(assumed to offer free access to ideas) and hypothesize that the latter are likely to confer a

greater benefit on society. This focus on the patentee’s right to exclude risks underestimating the

effects of the corresponding obligation to disclose. The usual justification for offering patent

protection proposes a bargain or a social contract by means of which inventors obtain a

temporary monopoly in their discoveries, in return for disclosing their ideas in sufficient detail

al., “Race, Ethnicity, and NIH Research Awards,” Science, 333 (6045) 2011:1015-1019, (in response to which the
NIH proposes to offer prizes for solutions to avoid such biases!); Tom Coupé, “Peer review versus citations – An
analysis of best paper prizes,” Research Policy, Volume 42 (1) 2013: 295-301, finds that winners of prizes for
academic articles are rarely the best papers as gauged by citations; Jordi Blanes i Vidal and Clare Leaver, “Bias in

that the invention can be recreated by someone who is skilled in the arts.96 However, this is not

necessarily the case in practice; for instance, in Britain and France, ineffective rules about

specifications, and limited access to patented information owing to high transactions and

monetary costs, meant that the disclosure mechanisms were quite weak.97 Trade secrets or

prizes, on the other hand, might impose a social cost if the information is not made available to

others in a usable format despite its low incremental cost. On net, both theory and practice are

unclear about whether unpatented ideas would tend to generate knowledge spillovers, or to

inhibit them.

         Patents and prize-winning innovations at the U.S. industrial exhibitions differed in many

regards, including the propensity to create external benefits beyond those accruing to the

inventors themselves. Prizes were less systematic, were not significantly associated with

location and geography, and did not generate geographical and technological spillovers. Spatial

autocorrelation analysis of patents and prizes revealed that patents led to spillovers that

significantly increased both patented and unpatented innovations in nearby counties.98 This is

consistent with the bargain or contract view of patents, which proposes that the limited grant of a

monopoly right to inventors benefits society, because in exchange the public gains information

about the discovery that increases social welfare. From the earliest years of the patent system,

   A nineteenth-century observer noted that “the assertion that the patent-system interferes injuriously with
intellectual progress by blocking the course of thought is curiously at variance with the evidence of history.” See

diffusion of information. Such results may owe to poor measures by the patent authorities to ensure disclosure,

policy makers engaged in discussions about how to ensure that information was available to the

broader public. The patent grant requires a specification that is sufficiently detailed to enable a

person who is skilled in the arts to recreate the patented invention. Patent legislation included

measures to publish information about patents that were granted in annual reports that were

widely disseminated, and expired patents were published in newspapers, while the U.S. Patent

Office maintained local depositories throughout the country. Thus, even if the patentee had

acquired a monopoly for (at that time) fourteen to seventeen years, access to the information

about the discovery likely facilitated inventions that worked around the initial patent, or led to

ideas for follow-on inventions.

       By way of contrast, the patterns for prizes were inconsistent with the presence of

technological spillovers. Thus, access to technological exhibits did not generate as much

diffusion of information as was the case for inventions that were protected by patent grants.

Exhibits sponsored by the American Institute of New York or the Cincinnati Mechanics’

Association might have been open to the public, and some inventors might have been able to

copy from the displays, but there was likely a selection effect that influenced the owners of

valuable inventions that were readily duplicable to avoid displaying them at fairs. Moreover, if

competitors did not attend the events, there were relatively few effective mechanisms that might

have led to the spread of unpatented information embodied in prize-winning innovations. This

was of course a function of the decentralized nature of the prize system in industrial exhibitions,

but even in European countries that offered centralized institutions such as the Royal Society of

Arts, access to unpatented inventions and knowledge about them was quite limited.

       Awards and prizes undoubtedly facilitated the efforts of businesses to advertise and

commercialize their innovations. Manufacturers at many exhibitions had the choice of monetary
awards rather than medals of equivalent value, but typically opted to reject the cash, choosing

instead to accumulate medals from numerous fairs, and touting their success in magazines,

journals and on product packaging. Medals may have proven useful in competitive markets as a

means of product differentiation, and as a way of signaling higher quality or brand-name capital,

although this function became less relevant with the advent of mass advertising and

trademarking.99 Some scholars propose that such ex post prizes at exhibitions stimulated new

inventions because they generated publicity for promising areas of endeavor. 100 Even if a prize

system were successful in generating new inventions, it would also be necessary to ensure that

additional incentives were provided to effectively manage the unpredictable and often lengthy

processes required to transform an idea into a commercially viable product. In short, the jury is

still out on the question of whether prizes served to induce inventive activity and productivity

gains, and the subject remains an important topic for future research.



IV. CONCLUSION

Today both developed and developing societies have a vital interest in determining the optimal

policies towards technological innovation, including the nature and consequences of different

rules and standards. At the same time, as Harold Demsetz pointed out, “much public policy

economics implicitly presents the relevant choice as between an ideal norm and an existing
99
   According to testimony to the British Parliament, “Considerable progress has been made of recent years in the art
of advertising, and the advertisement afforded by displaying goods at an International Exhibition is consequently
regarded by many as being of less importance than formerly” (p. 3). Moreover, “when a business is young you reap
very great advantage in bringing it before the public through the medium of exhibition; but when a business is well
established like ours is I do not think you do reap so much advantage.” See Great Britain, Board of Trade, Report of
the Committee appointed by the Board of trade to make enquiries with reference to the participation of Great Britain
in great international exhibitions, Exhibitions Branch, London: Wyman and Sons, 1907.
100
    Petra Moser and Tom Nicholas, for example, find that prizes at the Crystal Palace Exhibition offered publicity
that significantly enhanced technological progress, in “Prizes, Publicity, and Patents – Non-Monetary Awards as a
Mechanism to Encourage Innovation,” Journal of Industrial Economics, 2013 Volume 61: pp. 763–788. This
mechanism is plausible, and suggests that future work is needed that attempts to control for unobserved variation in
all the other private and public sources of information that were simultaneously available to inventors, including
patent documents, on-the-job insights, technical supply factors, and the pressures of market demand.
"imperfect" institutional arrangement. This nirvana approach differs considerably from a

comparative institution approach in which the relevant choice is between alternative real

institutional arrangements.”101 What lessons does the evidence from the past about “real

institutional arrangements” offer for designing an effective mechanism to create incentives for

new and useful forms of technological creativity? Any answer to this question is obviously

speculative, since it requires an accurate assessment of the characteristics of prize systems that

are inherent to this institution, relative to discretionary features that can be adjusted through

careful and conscious design of specific instruments. However, historical evidence presents a

valuable opportunity for exploring key features of this debate.

        The framers of U.S. policies were aware of the options that had prevailed in the colonial

period and in Europe, but rejected the use of “premiums” in favour of property rights in

patents.102 The patent system was market-oriented, offered open access to creative individuals

regardless of their social status and background, enabled strong enforcement of such rights,

ensured useful disclosure, and promoted extensive markets for technology. The empirical

evidence on the early patent system in the United States suggests that patents and their effective

legal enforcement played a substantial role in influencing the rate and direction of inventive

activity in a country that would become the world’s leading industrial nation. Patent institutions

were not perfect but, as Demsetz points out, their imperfections did not necessarily imply the

    The use of prizes and bounties was common in the colonial period, and the Continental Congress in 1783
“recommended to the Legislatures of the several states to … encourage the establishment of useful manufactures
either by premiums or by such other means as they may find most effectual.” See B. Zorina Khan, “Looking
Backward: Founding Choices in Innovation and Intellectual Property Protection,” in Douglas Irwin and Richard
Sylla (eds), Founding Choices: American Economic Policy in the 1790s, NBER and University of Chicago (2010):

superiority of any other system.103 Perhaps the most telling evidence comprises the endogenous

diffusion and adoption of the distinctive U.S. rules and standards towards property rights in

patents by other countries who wished to emulate its industrial achievements,.

         Whereas, the majority of organizations that had specialized in granting prizes for

industrial innovations ultimately became disillusioned with this policy, and the practice of

bestowing technology awards declined among both private and public institutions. As observers

noted in the nineteenth century, industrial prizes faltered in part because of their lack of market-

orientation, and even the democratic nature of economic institutions in the United States could

not overcome such drawbacks in administered prize systems.104 Judges had to combine technical

and industry-specific knowledge with impartiality, but even the most competent personnel could

not ensure consistency; decision-making among panels was complicated by differences in

standards, interpretation, capture, and risk-aversion. Such difficulties tended to lead to

haphazard decisions, or were often overcome by simply making the award to the person or the

firm with the most established reputation. Juries were not immune to the effects of outright bias,

capture, cognitive dissonance, lobbying, and “marketing.”105 Prizes tended to offer private

benefits to both the proposer and the winner, largely because they served as valuable

advertisements, with few geographical spillovers. Winners of such awards were generally

unrepresentative of the most significant innovations, in part because the market value of useful

    Adam Smith had early on noted that “pecuniary rewards for the inventors of new machines … would hardly ever
be so precisely proportioned to the merit of the invention” as in the case of patents, where “if the invention be good
and such as is profitable to mankind, he will probably make a fortune of it; but if it be of no value he also will reap
no benefit.” Smith, Adam, Lectures On Jurisprudence, Meek, R. L. et al. (eds), vol. V, Glasgow
Edition, Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1982, p. 103.

    When the Nobel Prize was awarded to two cliometricians, William Parker noted that the event held a “lesson in
marketing” for business historians. SeeWilliam N. Parker, “A "New" Business History? A Commentary on the 1993
Nobel Prize in Economics,” The Business History Review, 67 (4) 1993: 623-636.
inventions would typically be far greater than any prize that could be offered by private or state

initiative. Even prestigious and well-funded institutions such as the Royal Society of Arts failed

to develop truly valuable inventions.

       A systematic assessment of the role of incentives for innovation in the nineteenth century

therefore highlights the advantages of market-oriented policies which economize on information,

especially in the decentralized determination of price, value, and “winners.” Market mechanisms

also bypassed many of the high transactions costs attendant on negotiating, monitoring, and

contracting with applicants and winners. This is not to say that administered inducements are

never effective, especially in the context of such market failure as in the provision of medicines

or vaccines characterized by significant gaps between private and social returns. However, in

distinguishing between the numerous ingenious theoretical mechanisms that have been proposed,

such transactions costs need to be recognized and incorporated. In particular, governance issues

and the potential for rent-seeking and corruption should be explicitly addressed, especially in the

context of countries where complementary institutions and political control mechanisms are

weak or nonexistent. In any event, history indicates that the evolution of the institution of

innovation prizes over the past three centuries serves as a cautionary tale rather than as a success

story. As such, significantly more research needs to be completed before we can conclude that

such awards should be re-introduced in the twenty-first century as a preferred means of

promoting technological change and economic progress.
