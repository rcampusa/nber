                Structural and Stabilization Aspects of Fiscal
                and Financial Policy in the Dependent Economy




                                   ABSTRACT


         The paper considers the response of a small, open dependent economy
to a variety of fiscal and financial shocks as well as che influence of
alternative budget balancing rules on the response of the system to such
external shocks as a change in the world interest rate.

         The approach allows for both uncertain individual lifetimes and
population growth, using a slightly generalized version of the Yaari—Blanchard
model of consumer behavior. Debt neutrality does not prevail unless the sum
of the population growth rate and the individual's probability of death equals
zero. The government spends on traded and non—traded goods and raises tax
revenue both through a lump sum tax and through a distortionary tax on the
production of traded goods.

         Even though the tax on the production of traded goods is the only
conventional distortion in the model, changes in this tax rate will have first
order real income effects even when the distortion is evaluated at a zero tax
rate, as long as the individual's subjective pure rate of time preference
differs from the interest rate. This can occur even in well—behaved steady
states of the Yaari—Blanchard model, as long as the population growth rate
plus the probability of death differ from zero. This "intrinsic" distortion
effectively causes second—best arguments to apply even when there is only one
conventional distortion.

         Even in the absence of government budget deficits, fiscal choices
relating to the composition of public spending and the structure of taxation
have important short—term and long—term consequences for the real exchange
rate, the sectoral allocation of production, the level and composition of
private consumption, the current account (in the short run) and the nation's
stock of claims on the rest of the world in the long run.

1.   Introduction

         This is the first of a series of three papers dealing with the

macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy in an open economy, a very broad

subject area. It covers the implications of alternative public spending,

revenue raising and financing actions (or of alternative public spending,

revenue raising and financing rules) for a wide range of endogenous          -




macroeconomic variables, both prices and quantities. Among the most important

prices are nominal and real interest rates and the cost of capital, the

nominal and real exchange rate, the nominal and real wage rate, the terms of

trade and the general price level. The most important quantities are the

level of domestic output and employment and their composition in terms of

traded and nontraded goods sectors, the domestic capital stock and the

domestic rate of capital accumulation, the financial assets and liabilities of

the private and government sectors and their financial deficits or

surpluses. The responses of these prices and quantities can be studied in the

short run (i.e. at a point in time), in the timeless long run of the

stationary or steady state and, most interestingly, along a "real—time"

dynamic adjustment path.

         There are many taxonomies for classifying and subdividing this vast

subject. The one adopted in these papers involves a two way "real" vs.

"monetary" and "balanced—budget" vs. "unbalanced budget" classification. Real

models, considered in the first two papers, do not include a monetary

sector. Private agents do not hold money and seigniorage or the inflation tax

is not a source of government revenue. Governments can borrow, by issuing

interest-bearing "real" debt, and financial crowding out can occur, in the

short—run and/or the long run.- Money is added to the private sector's

portfolio of fin..ncial assets and money creation to the public sector's

sources of revenue in the third paper.

         The "balanced" vs. "unbalanced" budget dichotomy emphasizes that

there are two kinds of macroeconomic effects associated with fiscal policy,

even in "real" models where money financing is not an option. The first kind

operates through the public sector debt dynamics associated with unbalanced

public sector budgets, i.e. with public sectors financial deficits or

surpluses. The presence of these effects is contingent on the absence of

"debt neutrality". The second kind, the balanced budget effects, are the

consequences of variations in the volume and composition of public spending

and in the level and structure of taxation for real and nominal variables that

occur even when the budget is balanced continuously. These effects are not

contingent on the absence of debt neutrality. They operate through "direct

crowding out" (Buiter [1977]), i.e. through the direct complementarity or

substitutability of public consumption or investment and private consumption

or investment, thrc.ugh the direct (selective or across—the—board) preemption

of real resources by government absorption and through the allocative or

incentive effects of changes in non—lump sum taxes, transfers, or subsidies.

         Recently, the focus of much macroeconomic analysis has been on public

sector debt and deficits and their consequences, through "indirect financial

crowding Out," for private saving, capital formation and the current account

of the balance of payments. The second and third papers address some of these

issues. The present paper, however, focuses on the important effects of

balanced budget fiscal policy on the real exchange rate, the sectoral

allocation of productive resources between tradd and non—traded goods,

private consumption and the nation's net external asset position. It

considers the impact, steady state and transitional effects of balanced—budget

fiscal poLicy in a simple open economy macroeconomic model, which is set out

in Section 2. The "balanced budget" in this paper is, strictly speaking, a
SUD/wb/08—22"86                                — 3 —




"real   growth corrected" balanced budget. In such an equilibrium the deficit,

as a fraction of full, employment GDP, equals nB, where n is the growth rate of

full, employment real output and 8 is the public debt outstanding as a fraction

of capacity CDP. Such a policy keeps the burden of the debt, 8, constant over

time. When there is no real growth (n0) the growth—corrected balanced budget

and the conventional balanced budget coincide for the 'model of papers 1 and

2. For the monetary model in paper 3 we define a "real growth, inflation and

exchange rate appreciation—corrected balanced budget." This corresponds to a

conventionally measured budget deficit (as a fraction of CDP) equal to

nB +     (1. —         —         +   (n + p)         Here n is as before the growth rate of

the proportional rate of exchange rate depreciation. A deficit or surplus of

this magnitude is consistent with maintaining a constant overall. debt burden

and with constant ratios to capacity GDP of each of the interest—bearing and

monetary liabilities of the authorities.

           The model developed in Section 2 of this paper bundles familIar

ingredients in a somewhat novel fashion. Private consumption behavior is

modeled according to the uncertain lifetimes version of the overlapping

generations model due to Yaari (1965) and first applied to the analysis of

macroeconomic issnas by Blanchard (1984, 1985).. Uncertain lifetimes result in

effective private sector subjective discount rates that exceed the pure rate

of time preference and i-n effective private sector market discount rates that

exceed the government's interest rate. This causes absence of debt—neutrality

and creates a non—trivial role for financial policy, i.e. for variations in
                                   — 4 —

the   taxation—borrowing mix for a given path of real public spending on cuçrent

goods and services (or "exhaustive" spending), even when taxes are lump—sum.

           Even without uncertain Lifetimes, population growth alone can, as

shown by Weil (1985), cause absence of debt neutrality. Even infinite—lived

consumers cannot command the resources of those yet to be born, while the

authorities can use them as a tax base. A growing population therefore

extends the public sectors's opportunity set beyond that available to the

private agents currently alive. (See also Buiter [1986b]).

           The production side of. the model is the "dependent economy model" of

Wilson (1931), Swan (1960) and Salter (1959) in the modern version due to

Dornbusch (1974, 1980, Ch. 6, pp. 93—116).

           The country is assumed to be a price taker in the world markets for

all tradeables, iElportables and exportables alike. The terms of trade are

therefore exogenous. For the issues addressed in these papers they can be

ignored. They are aggregated into a composite commodity, traded goods. Non—

traded goods are also produced and consumed (by the private and the public

sector). The real exchange rate, or the relative price of traded to non—

tradedgoods, is the crucial atemporal or static relative price in this.

model. Wage and price flexiblity and full empicyment of resources are assumed

to hold throughout.

           Some of the key conclusions are the following. Balanced budget

fiscal policy actions will in general have short—run and long—run effects on

the real exchange rate and real private absorption. They will also tend to

have transitory effects on the current account and permanent effects on th2

nation's net foreign asset position. "Balanced-budget multipliers" can be

negative in the short run and in the long run wnen the increase in public

spending is financed by higher discortionary tax rates. An increase in the
SUD/wb/08—22—86                      — 5 —




distortiotiary   tax rate on the production of tradeables may have such strong

negative income effects, that the demand for riontraded goods declines

sufficiently to Lower the producer's relative price of nontraded goods. In

that extreme case nontradeables production could contract arid tradeables

production expand in spite of the increase in the tax rate on traded goods

production. This can happen even, when the initial veL of the distortion is

zero, if the (exogenous) real interest rate exceeds the (exogenous) rate of

tinie—prefererice, something that is consistent with equilibrium given Yaari—

Bianchard preferences.



2.   The Model

            a. Private Consumption

            Household consumption behavior is determined by the intertemporal

optimization model of Yaari and Blanchard (Yaari [1965], Blanchard [1984,

1985]). Each individual has a constant (age—and tine—independent)

instantaneous probability of death X         0. Another interpretation of X is the

probability of dynastic extinction (through childlessness) in a model in which

an intergenerational gift or bequest motive is permitted. The details of the

derivation of the individual and ,aggregate consumption rules are given in

Appendix 1. The important consequences of introducing uncertain lifetimes are

(1) that the effective instantaneous subjective discount rate of households is

6 + X, where 5 is the instantaneous pure rate of subjective time preference

(6 >   0)   and (2) that the effective market discount rate is r + X where r is

the instantaneous real interest rate. Population growth in addition means

that the public sector's tax base grows at a rate n, unlike the resource base

available to those private agents currently alLve (even if x0). (See Weil

[1985] and Buiter [1986b]).

SUD/wb/08—2286



              An individual household discounts its uncertain future after—tax non—

interest income using a discount rate r + X, while the government discounts

its certain and growing (at a rate a) aggregate future tax revenue using a

discount rate r. Another way of looking at this is that aggregate private

consumption and saving behavior are functions of the human capital of those

households that are currentLy ali,ve. The government knows it will be able.to

tax in the future both those households alive today and those yet to be born

that survive into the future. Its tax revenues are therefore not subject to

              With private discount rates exceeding public sector discount rates as

long as X + n >           0,   there will be no debt neutrality: for a given program of

government spending on real goods and services (or exhaustive spending), the

substitution of public borrowing for current taxation will affect private

consumption. and aggregate private plus public saving, even if the taxes are

lump—sum. The debt neutrality case is the special case of this model

where X =       n   = 0 and househoLds live forever.

              Aggregate household behavior is characterized in equations (1)

through (5). q denotes per capita private consumption expenditure, measured

in terms of traded goods. w is per—capita non—human or financial household

wealth, h per capita human capital, it                         per   capita non—interest income and t          per
capita taxes net of transers. w, h, it                             and   T   are   measured in terms of traded

goods. xT is per :apita household consumption of traded goods, xN per capita

household consumption of non—traded goods and p the relative price of non—

traded goods, i.e. the reciprocal of the real exchange rate. r is the

instantaneous real interest rate measured in terms of traded goods

and ii       0 the constant instantaneous populationgrowth rate.

         In    Figure 1, the budget constraint qE represents a higher value of p

than qF. With homethetic preferences, indifference curves have a common slope

along any ray through the origin such as OA. With strictly convex

indifference curves such as KK and K'K', the consumer's equilibrium moves from

B to D when p increases. xN falls while XT either increases or decreases. In

          Even though public sector debt and deficits matter in the Yaari—

Blanchard model with A >             0,   financial markets are "perfect" in the sense that

households can borrow against the security of their expected future after—tax

labor income, i.e. that (discounted) future expected disposable labor income

is as good a source of purchasing power as current disposable income. One

could weaken this e.g. by assuming that a fraction y of households in each

vintage is constrained to spend. its current disposable income. The remaining

fraction, 1 —        y,    would follow the Yaari—Blanchard paradigm and would determine

its   consumption behavior subject only to its intertemporal present value
budget constraint. Under this specification of aggregate consumption

behavior, equation (1) wouLd be replaced by (1"'), while equations (2), (3),

          Production

          The production, of traded and nontraded goods is modeled through the

device of the representative competitive multiproduct firm which maximizes at

each instant the value of its production of traded and nontraded goods subject

to the technological production possibility frontier 2. sketched in Figure 2.

respectively. The firm's           problem   is

e is the rate of taxation on the production of traded goods. The world price

of traded goods, which is also the price faced by consumers, is unity. The

producer's price is 1 — 0.

          The first—order condition for an interior optimum is                                    =

This   permits us to write the per capita supplies of traded and nontraded goods

as functions of the producer's relative price of traded goods,                                        and to

write per capita net domestic product as a function of p and of 8.

              The Government

              The government spends on traded goods,                          and on non—traded goods,

           It raises revenue by taxing households, it and by taxing production in the

traded goods sector, 8T•                 finances any deficit or surplus by issuing or

retiring interest—bearing debt b denominated in terms of traded goods.
                                                                                                     g,,
      it   and b are all per capita quantities. From the government's budget

identity we therefore obtain:

                     (l_(P;J))g

a is a shift parameter, with an increase in a signifying a shift towards

public spending on traded goods, given p and g. Taxes on households t

(measured in traded goods) are assumed to be independent of p, and so is 0.

           The government's intertempora]. present value budget constraint or

solvency constraint is obtained by integrating (9) forward in time and

imposing the "no—Ponzi game" transversaiity condition


                       —f[r(u)—n]du

This    condition makes sense if, on average, the future instantaneous real

interest rate is expected to exceed the future growth rate of the real tax

base (r>n). The present value government budget constraint is given in (ha

                                                                y(s)eflS and B(t) =      b(t)eflt


Equation (lib) states that the present value of future planned government

revenue should equaL the present value of future planned public spending plus
SIJD/wb/08—22—86                   — 15 —




the outstanding stock of public debt. Equation (ha) makes the equivalent

statement using per capita quantities and real growth rate adjusted discount

rates.

         The government's (per capita) revenue R from the tax on the

production of tradeables (or tpt) is given by


(12)     R =
               8T       'l—e

An increase in 8 increases revenue proportionally at any given level of

tradeables production. Given p, it will increase       the producer's relative

price of non—traded goods. The volume of tradeables production declines,

i.e., the tax base is narrowed. Total revenue will go up or down dependipg on

whether , the (absolute value of the) elasticity of T with respect to

less than or greater than       i.e.,



         9         -

(14)                     p
                       (1—8)



         We shall see that, in the short run and in the long run, an increase

in 0 lowers p, the consumer's relative price of non—traded goods. To evaluate

the general equilibrium implications of an increase in 0 for R we must aLlo

for any endogenous response of p to the change in 8, i.e.




where    will in general be different in the short run and in the long run.
SUD/wb/082286                             — 16 —




          In   many cases, the decline in p as 8 increases is not enough to

reverse the a priori plausible result that a higher value of 8 will be

associated with a higher value of p1(1—8), i.e., with a lower producer's price

for traded goods. It is therefore certainly possible that there is a "Laffer

curve" for the traded goods production tax. There is a common presumption

that    will be higher (in absolute value) for higher values of 8 (and              -




of   p/(l—e). In that case, a reduction in 8 from a very high level may well

increase the revenue from the tpt.



          The rest of the world

          The rest of the world provides the domestic economy with perfectly

elastic excess demandschedules for traded goods and for financial capital.

The instantaneous interest rate in terms of traded goods, r, is exogenous.

          Three equivalent ways of writing the equation of motion for the

nation's per capita stock of external assets f             w—b, are given below in (16a,

b,c). The first is based on the identity that equates the current account

surplus with net exports of traded goods plus net property income from

abroad. The second is based on the current account surplus as the sum of the

financial surpluses of the private sector (cj+nw) and the public sector

(—6—nb) The last one represents the current account surplus as the excess of

national income over domestic absorption.

         Unless all spending (at the margin) is on traded goods (n1 or c1)

higher private or public spending raises p. A higher tax rate on the

production   of traded goods, given q, g and a, shifts resources towards the

production of non—traded goods and lowers the consumer's relative price of

nontradeables. The effect of an increase in 0 on the producer's relative

price of nontraded goods T2 given q, g and      is given by



(18g)
                            p                      p
         (p1(1—0))8 =           2                            (p1(1—0))8
                                                         2
                        (1—8)                    (1—e)


         Thus, even though the consumer's relative price of traded goods

declines as B increases, the producer's relative price rises. The result is

an expansion both of the demand for and the supply of non—traded goods and a

contraction in the traded goods sector. Only when there is no scope for

reallocating production from the traded to the non—traded goods sector

(y = 0 or 2"= —ci)   will   p1(1—8) increase by the full amount of the increase

in 8, with p constant. When production can be reallocated along a straight—

line production possibility frontier (y =      or f" = 0)    there will be rio

change in p(1—8) when 0 changes. A switch towards public spending on traded

goods (an increase in a, given g) lowers p.

        When balanced budget policies are considered, it is only legitimate

to treat, g, 8 and a as exogenous if the lump sum tax r is permitted to adjust

passively to ensure budget balance. When unbalanced budget policies are

considered, t can be treated as exogenous, together with g, 0 and a, with b

taking up the slack. Ultimately, however, the requirement of government

solvency, summarized in the present value budget constraint (ha or b), will

put an upper bound on b and thereby constrains the paths taken by g, 9, a

and r over time. With unbalanced budget policies (at any rate during the

transition to steidy state) steady state governxent debt, b, becomes an

endogenous variable. It is easily seen that any steady—state equilibrium that
SUD/wb/08—2286                               — 19   —




satisfies    (ha, b) has a real growth corrected balanced budget. With

unbalanced budget policies outside the steady state, four out of the five

Long—run fiscal parameters g, e, a, r and b can be chosen independently.

            This paper will focus on policies that maintain real growth corrected

budget balance continuously, i.e., b is treated as constant throughout.

Before turning to this in section (4), it is instructive to consider briefly

the intertemporal inconsistency of unbalanced budget models that treat all

four of the fiscal parameters g, e, a and r as exogenous.

SUD/cib/08—22—86                           — 20 —




         The behavior of the private sector is captured entirely by equations

(19a, b, c, d and e). SpecificaLly, the level or rate of change of the public

debt and the level, or rate of change of the nation's net claims on the rest of

the world do not influence private sector behavior, unless they affect the

fiscal parameters g, 5, e and r (or                       0 and r) or the world rate of

interest r. Ignoring this possibility for the time being, we solve for p as •a

function of q, g e and a as in (18a to f), substitute this into the four

equations of motiori and obtain the following linear approximation of the

economy at a steady state equilibrium.

but no longer sufficient for saddlepoint stability. Provided (21) holds, the

q,w subsystem has one stable (negative) and one unstable (positive)

part of which falls on non—traded goods, will not raise the relative price of

non—traded goods by so much that the value, in terms of tradeables, of non—

traded goods production rises by more than the increase in consumption. This

still leaves us with 4 qualitatiavely distinct phase diagram specifications in

configurations   obtain always when rtS or r<&. They may obtain for r>S, but if

r is too far above , the equilibrium becomes completely unstable. We only

consider saddlepoint equilibria in what follows.

          The two remaining eigerivalues of the complete system in (20), which

govern the public debt and net foreign assets dynamics, both equal r—n. Since

we assume r>n, b and f will diverge explosively even as q and w settle down

into stationary equilibrium. The intrinsic dynamics of interest—bearing debt

feeds on itself in an. explosive manner.

          A government whose debt grows indefinitely at a rate faster than its

capacity to service that debt violates the solvency constraint given in

(1].a,b). An explosive net creditor position of the government (given w)

violates the solvency constraint of the rest of the world. In either case,

the assumption that the real interest rate is exogenous becomes untenable. In

addition, credit rationing would emerge to constrain the behavior of b

and f. The model would break down.

          Stability of the public debt process requires that, if b>0,

ultimately primary (i.e., non—interest) government surpluses are run to

service the debt. The need to run these surpluses will sooner or later affect

the behavior of q and w through changes in g, -r, 0 or a. Only in one special

case can the dynamic properties of the present q,w subsystem be consistent

with public sector solvency. This is the case when public spending on traded

goods,     is adjusted, either continuously or eventually, to ensure continuous

or ultimate real ;rowth corrected budget balance, while public spending on

non—traded good, is kept constant. In terms of our notation, this amounts to

manipulating g           -to maintain budget balance and simultaneously

varying    (the share of traded goods in public spending) to ensure

that dg = 0.      With this restriction, the long—run steady state equilibrium

        When evaluating these long—run multipliers, an interesting benchmark

is the case when rd. When X0, i.e., with infinite—lived consumers, well—

behaved stationary equilibria (with positive but finite per capita private

consumption) exist only when r. Considering this case permits us to

evaluate the economic effects of instability or finite horizons.

        Long—run private consurnption,rneasured in traded goods increases when

public spending on non—traded goods increases and long—run budget balance is

maintained by reducing public spending on traded goods. The reason is that p

increases (the real exchange rate appreciates) and with it real disposable

income and human capital measured in traded goods. Financial private wealth w

increases if r>d, decreases if S>r.

        Increased lump—sum taxes r (matched by increased                   to preserve loflg—

run budget balance) reduce private consumption and raise financial wealth if

>r, lower it if tS <       r.    This wiLl occur even if there is no effect on the

relative price of non—traded goods, as in that case
SUD/wb/O8—22—86                               — 27 —

                          (r+X)(r—('S+n+X))


Unless Pq equals zero, the reduction in consumption, a fraction l— which

falls on non—traded goods, will, lower p.

         An increase in 8, the tax rate on the production of traded goods

directly lowers the after—tax income received by the factors of production

    =
        T   <   0).       By lowering the consumer's price of non—traded

goods (p0<0) it also reduces the value in terms of traded goods of any given

amount of domestic production of non—traded goods, and consumption falls.

Financial weaLth rises if S>r, falls if S<r. It doesn't matter whether tpt

revenue increases or declines, since                is used to balance the long—run

budget. The consumer's price of non—traded goods fails. What happens to the

producer's price,              as 8 increases?

         In (18g) we calculated that, given q, the decline in p as 8

increases is not enough to cause                  to decline. q, however, declines in th

long run as 8 is raised and this further depresses p. From (23m) it can be

checked that with A = 0, 2- rises when 8 increases, but that with X >             0,   this

could be reversed. Strong negative income effects from the increase in 8 are

necessary to obtain this paradoxical result. The increase in 8 wouLd, across

steady states, be associated with an increase, not a decline in the volume oE

tradable production and with a corresponding reduction in the volume of

nontradable production. The demand for nontradables, however, declines (at a

given p) even more than the production of nontradables, necessitating the

equilibrium decline in p. We return to this issue in Section 4.

        A sufficient condition for an increase in the interest rate to be

associated with an increase in long—run consumption is for w to be non—
                                       —   28   —

negative.       Equating (22a) and (22b) we see that



(24)        W                       (v-r).
                  (r+X)(r-(+X+n))




            Therefore we will be positive (negative) if r>6 (S>r).           p moves in

the same direction as. q when r increases. If r>6, an increase in r will, raise

Long—run w if YNPg<0          As was pointed out during the discussion of the

model's stability properties, this (and similar conditions under the different

balanced budget regimes), amounts to assuming that a higher value of

consumption does not, by raising p, increase income by more than the increase

in consumption.

            For all shocks other than changes in the interest rate, the r=ô

special case greatly simplifies the dynamic analysis when the shocks are

unanticipated, immediate and permanent (i.e., random walk shocks). w in that

case doesn't change in response to changes in              r or 9, and the

instantaneous response of q is also the long—run steady state response. Since

u doesn't vary, the current account surplus equals the public sector

surplus. For anticipated future shocks in 8N' r or 9 and for transitory

shocks, there will be transitional private financial wealth dynamics.

            From an initial position with r =       tS, consider the case of an
unanticipated, imnediate increase in the world rate of interest which is

perceived as pezmnent. For concreteness assume that the government adjusts

   not only in the long-run but at each instant to maintain budget balance.

            In Figure 4 an unanticipated permanent increase in r causes an

immediate drop in private consumption from E1, the initial long—run

equilibrium,   to E12, the point vertically below E1 on the saddle path through

the new long—run equilibrium. From (23 j, k) we know that the long—run effect

of this shock is higher values of q and r. The impact effect of a higher

worLd rate of interest is therefore in the opposite direction from the long—

run effect. After the initial jump down to E12, consumption rises steadily

frornE12 to E2 along S1S2. Private savings rates, however are positive

throughout the adjustment process and financial wealth accumulates.

         The unexpected news, at t0, of a permanent future increase in r at

t1> to causes a smaller initial drop in q (to E12' say), followed by a further

decline in q between t0 and t1 when the system moves along that divergent

trajectory (drawn with reference to EL) that will place it on S2S2 at t1.

After t1 consumption rises smoothly from E12" to E2.

         An unanticipated increase in r at t0 which is expected to be reversed

at t1> to is followed by an immediate drop in consumption, to E121t' say.

Saving becomes positive and wealth accummulates until t < t1, while

consumption rises. Beyond E12t", and between t and t1, consumption continues

to rise but dissaving takes place. At t1, when the interest rate comes down

again, consumption and financial wealth are above their initial equilibrium

values at E1. Both q and w then decline gradually back to their initial

equilibrium levels.

        Assuming Continuous budget balance through passive variation in        f

exactly mirrors the behavior of w. Permanent interest rate increases are

associated with current account surpluses throu;hout the adjustment process.

A temporary increase in r is followed by a perid of surpluses followed by a

period of deficits.

        p, the relative price of non—traded goods moves with q. In all casis

there is an immediate decline in p, permitting resources to be shifted towards
SUD/wb/08-2286                             31 —




the production of tradables and private consumption to be shifted away from
tradables to generate the export surplus that permits the accumniuLation of

foreign assets.

         With the permanent unanticipated increase in r, p rises steadily

after its initial drop and ultimately achieves a higher value than it had at

E1. With the anticipated futureincrease in r, the price of nontraded goods

continues to decline smoothly after the initial discrete drop until it reaches

its low at t1 when r actually goes up.

         In the case of the transitory increase in r, the initial drop in p is

followed by a gradual increase beyond its initial equilibrium value. When r

resumes its initial value again, p declines smoothly back to its initial

value. The high values of p after tj, when the solution trajectory crosses

the , = 0 line at B12"" is mirrored in the current account deficit.



4. Real Growth Corrected Balanced Budget Policies

         In the remaining sections of the paper we consider continuous real

growth corrected balanced budget policies. This requires the analysis of the

following model:



(25a)    q = (r—&)q —(S+X)(X+n)w



(25b)    w = (r—n)w +   ir(p,   e) —r—q



                        i—n(p) )q +        l—(p,a)

(25d)                                = 0

STJD/wb/08—22--86                            — 32 —




Equations (25d) states that the public sector deficit (per capita) equals nb,
exactly sufficient to keep constant the stock of real per capita debt, b. In

what follows (25c and a) will be solved for p and one of the four fiscal

parameters (g, r, e and a) as functions of the remaining three fiscal

parameters and of q, r and b. The solutions are then substituted into

(25a,b). Since b = 0, f =        i.        Even though the public sector balances its

real growth corrected budget, private sector financial dynamics make for non-

trivial current account adjustments in response to virtually any kind of

policy or external shock.              -




            4a.   -r responds endogenously to maintain budget balance

             In this subsection, -r adjusts to satisfy the balanced budget

constraint (25d) in response to exogenous variations in g, r, b, 8 or -r and to

endogenous variations in p. The easiest way to proceed is to substitute for

t   in   (25b) using (25d) and to solie (25c) for p as a function of q, g,

8 and a, which was already done in (18a,f). The resulting linearized dynamic

system is given in (26), with Pq given in (18b) and (18f).

         The 1ongrun effects of fiscal policy and exogenous shocks are quite

intuitive. An increase in exhaustive public spending means with a balanced

budget that total taxes g+(r—n)b increase by the amount of the increase in

public spending. Private consumption falls as a result. Financial wealth

increases if S >   r,   falls if tS   < r.    If r =        the price level will be boosted

if the share of non—traded goods in public spending is higher than that of

be reinforced (weakened or offset) if                      >   r    if (5<r).

                 A balanced budget increase in 0 and reduction (or increase) in

t   will   always lower the relative price of nontraded goods. Since, from

(18d), p0+ re-i 2 0, consumption falls as 0 increases. Financial wealth will

increase if S >           r,   fall if 5 <   r.    All this is independent of whether the

increase in the tax rate on the production of tradables increases or Lowers

the revenues from that tax, as the total tax revenue from both taxes remains

                 While it is likely that the producer's relative price of non—traded

goods -j.2-j rises as 0 increases, it is again possibLe that strong income

effects reverse this conclusion. The paradox of an increase in 0 reducing the

production of non—traded goods and increasing th production of traded goods

by sufficiently immiserizing the private sector remains a logical

possibility. In the numerator of (29f), both YPqand p0 are increasing in

absolute value, ar.d                    therefore increases in absolute value as the
                                 30 r
production possibility frontier becomes less concave and the efficiency loss

from distortionary production taxes increases. This possibility exists .even

when taxes are raised from an initial value of 0 = 0.                           The reason is that the

long—run equilibrium value of aggregate consumption, q, need not equal the

long—run equilibrium value of domestic product, after taxes, because of the

possibility of holding net foreign assets, i.e.,



                 q =   (1 — e)yT +         —r +    (r   — xi) w




or, given a balanced budget,

         Note, however, that when both 0 = 0 and r = 6 in the initial

equilibrium, then this paradoxical movement in .1.21. cannot occur. The reason

is that when 6 =    r,   w =   0,   and        0, so q will equal y+py—g—(r—n)b. It
is only when r > 6 [i.e. when              < o] that the paradox occurs.

         A switch towards public spending on traded goods for a given total

public spending level reduces the price of non—traded goods. Note that since,

given e, this raises the revenue from the tpt, t will fall to balance the

budget. The effect on q depends on the sign of
                                                                 y   .    This   is the.

effect of an increase in p on ir—t when the balanced budget rule is in effect.

If the concavity of the production possibility frontier is sufficiently low,

real disposable non—interest income could actualLy increase as p falls because

of an increase in a. For lower (absolute) value of
                                                            4 (and       for low values

of 9) q will fall as a rises.

         An increase in the world rate of interest will, as in the previous

case where       balanced the long—run budget, raise long—run q unless thern

initial position is characterized by a sufficiently large foreign debt, i.e.,

a large negative value f f. The long—run price of non—traded goods will move

in the same direction as aggregate consumption q.          If r =   6, financial wealth
will increase.

         Equations (29m, n, and o) can be used to have a first pass at the

issue of debt repudiation. Note that a reduction in b increase long—run q aid

p and raises (lowers) w depending on to whether :>6 (Or r <).               The long—run

effects, but not the dynamic adjustment, are independent of whether the

repudiation involves domestic or foreign debt. Figure 5 shows the response of

repudiation..

          In the case where the debt that is repudiated is foreign debt, the

authorities cut taxes Cr) by the amount of foreign debt service that is no

longer required. The new long—run equilibrium is at E, and since w is not

affected by the default, consumption immediately jumps to its new equilibrium

value at E1. If the default is on domestic debt, the initial financial, wealth

of domestic residents falls by the amount of debt that is repudiated (db<O).

The initial level of consumption will be on the new saddlepath S1S1

at       and will always be below the level without default of E0. 4/ After

the default, saving becomes positive and financiaL wealth augments through

current account surpLuses. The long—run equilibrium is again at E1.

          Thisaccount assumed that there was no external response to the

default, through increased interest rates for future external borrowing (which

now includes a default risk premium), through external credit rationing (or

enforced financial. autarky) after the default or through other penalties

imposed through trade sanctions or in any other way. It is the story of the

governnient that defaults but is believed (with subjective certainty) ne'ler to

do so again.

          The long—run effects of an increase in r on q, w and p with

t endogenous are given in (29 j,           k,    z). Consider the case where tS =   r   and,

consequently, w =   0.   Comparing (29j, k, 2.) with the corresponding expressions

when g is endogenus (33j,       k,   z) we note the following. (It is assumed

that l—c+Pc1 0 so that          =               While   q will increase under the

be smaller with r endogenous than with                          endogenous. The reason is that the

increase in p will, at a given tpt rate 9, reduce tpt receipts. Consequently

t   will   increase when it is endogenous. This will Limit the increase in q and

thus in p below what happens when                      is endogenous. 5/

            We now consider the case where 8 adjusts endogenously to satisfy the

balanced budget constraint (25d) at each instant.                       We proceed by solving (25c,

        Note from (31b) that even given q, the effect of an increase in g on

p is ambiguous. This is because while cet.par. an increase in g will, raise

(if some of the additional spending falls in nou—traded goods (i.e., c<l)) the

increase in 8 required to keep the budget balanced (see 31h) will tend to

lower p, both by reducing private demand for non—traded goods and by

increasing their supply. Clearly, if all the additional spending falls on

traded   goods (   l),   then p< 0. Even if c=0, on the other hand, an increase

in p is not certain. If the tax effect dominates, (p8< 0) then the long—run

effect of an increase in public spending is to lower q and p, while w

increases if S >    r,   falls if 5 <     r.
           An increase in t,      with   budget balance maintained by lowering 8, will,

given q, tend to create excess demand for non—traded goods. p rises to clear.

the market, i.e. p> 0. Aggregate consumption in terms of traded goods

therefore increases in the long run and so does the long—run price of non—

traded goods. w will rise if r>ó, fall if r<5.

           Switching public spending towards traded goods, holding g constant

will, given q, reduce p. This will expand the production of trade goods and

the tpt receipts at a given value of 8. The tpt rate is therefore lowered to

prevent a budget surplus from emerging. For small value of 8, long—run g

falls and the price level unambiguously declines in the long run. For large

values of 8', however, the boost to real income associated with lowering the

distortion may be large enough to raise q. The long—run value of p of course

declines. w moves in the same direction as q if r >             , in   the opposite

direction if r < 5.             -.




           An increase in r will, if b >       o,   require a higher value of 8 to

balance the budget. Given q, p falls to equilibrate the non—traded goods

market. Long—run aggregate consumption in terms of traded goods increases

unless the negative effects on human capital (measured in traded goods) of a

q were to fall, the long—run effect on p is negative, otherwise it is
             -
                            -
ambiguous.

           A higher value of b also requires a higher tax rate 8 to take care of

the increased government interest bill. Given q, the price of nontraded goods
SIJD/wb/ 08—22-86                               — 44 —




declines. Long—run q declines, as does Long—run p. w increases

if *5 >   r,    decreases if        <   r.   To the attractions of repudiation is now added

the lower distortionary tax rates that it permits.

         Assuming as before that the 4 = 0 locus is upward—sloping, it can be

seen that the slope of the 4 = 0 locus is the same when g is endogenous as

when r is endogenous if 8 =       0.   If 0 < e < 1, then the 4 = 0 locus is steeper

when g is eadogenous than when t is endogenous. 9/ The q                 0 locus always has

the same slope, regardless of the financing mode. The shape of the 4 = 0

spending on non—traded goods then the increase in taxes subtracts from private

spending on non—traded goods.

         The ambiguity of the long—run effects of an increase in• 8 with g

endogenous (equations [39d,e,f]) are the same as those of the long—run effects

of an increase in g with 9 endogenous (equations 34a,b,c) discussed in the

previous Section (note that, since we assume that we aren't on the wrong side

of the tpt Laffer curve,    >   0).
         An increase in the share of traded goods in public spending again

lowers long—run p and q, and lowers w if r > 6, raises it if 6 >         r.   Note that

with p lower, tpt tax receipts will increase (if 8 >        0)   and g will rise to

preserve budget balance.

         A higher interest rate requires a lower volume of public spending to

balance the budget. This will depress p, given q. The long—run effect ih q

is ambiguous. If it.increases, the long—run effect on p is ambiguous. If q

falls, p must also go down. A larger stock of public debt requires a cut in

public spending. p and q fall.

         The case where the budget is kept balaned by varying the composition

of public spending, keeping the total constant in terms of traded goods is

omitted for reasons of space and left as an exercise. Much of it (e.g. the

long—run effects of changes in g, -r and 8, with         endogenous) can be derived

straightforwardly from the analysis in Sections 4a,b, and c (e.g. from the

long—run effects of a change in       with T     8 or g endogenous).




5. Conclusion

        The volume and composition of exhaustive public spending and the

structure of taxation are important influences on the composition of

production between traded and non—traded goods, the real exchange rate, the

net foreign asset position and the volume of private consumption in the short—

run and in the long—run. Even when the problem of public debt stabilization
SUD/wb/08—22—86                         —   49 —



is   not present, as in section 4 of the paper where the public sector was

assumed to maintain continuous real. growth corrected budget balance, important

fiscal options remain. Two examples serve to illustrate this.



          Consider a government that has decided to reduce the bias against

traded goods in its fiscal programme by reducing 9, the tpt rate. If tax

revenue decreases as 9 is reduced, the government has several options, even

assuming the budget is kept balanced. If it raises the other (lump sum) tax

in its arsenal, the following will happen. In the long run (equations

29d,e,f) the consumer's relative price of non—traded goods,p, rises, i.e. the

consumer's real exchange rate depreciates. The producers' relative price of

non—traded goods .i.2.   should decline as 9 is reduced, unless the increase in p

more than offsets the reduction in the tax rate on traded goods. This

perverse result can happen only if there are "first—order" real income effects

on private consumption demand from the reductio.i in the distortionary tax

rate. Conventional intertemporal optimizing models such as the representative

infinite—lived household, have the property that there are no "first—order"

real income effect if the distortionary tax is the only distortion and the tax

rate change is evaluated at 9 =    0.       In the Yaari—Blanchard model of consumer

behavior, tax rate changes evaluated at 9 = 0 will have "first order" real

income effects even if there are no other convevitional distortions, as long as

r, the market interest rate and S, the consumer's pure rate of time

preference, differ from each other. Specifically, if r >          , a reduction
in 9 will have a positive first order real incone effect, even at B =        0, which
may boost private spending in general and private demand for non—traded goods

in particular by so much that           rises when B is lowered. In that case the

movement of resources will be out of the traded goods sector and into the non—
SUD/wb/08—22—86                           — 50 —




traded goods sector, in spite of the reduction in the tax rate on tradeables

production.         r       is operationally equivalent to another distortion.

         Without wishing to advance the perverse case as the likely one, it

illustrates the importance of even minor concessions to realism in modelling

private consumption and saving behavior. The Yaari—Blanchard model with its

effective private discount rate in excess of the marginal cost of government

borrowing, generates equilibria than can be characterized by r below, equal to

or above ,     in       the short run and in the long run. The absence of debt—

neutrality in the Yaari—Blanchard model is another important ingredient in the

analysis of real—world fiscal and financial policy issues.

         If instead of raising its other tax, the government accompanies its

Cut in 0 by a cut in public spending, the consequences for the real exchange

rate and the sectoral allocation of production can be quite different.

         From equations (39d,e,f) .it can be seen that the effect on the real

exchange rate is ambiguous. The cut in 0, which will cet. par. (i.e. given q

and g) be associated with an increase in p, is accompanied by a spending cut

which, if at least some of it falls on non—traded goods, will tend to depress

their relative price. Unlike the previous case when r was raised, total taxes

now are down. Private consumption demand will be boosted and, to the extent

that this falls on non—traded goods, will tend to raise p.         If p declines,

p(l—0) declines a—fortiori and production and resources more towards the

traded goods section. Even if p increases, p(l—8)1 will fall unless the

increase in p is 'ery large. This is less likely the smaller S and the excess

of r over 5.

         Itcan be shown- that even if t and g are kept constant, the

government can balance the budget when it reduces the tpt rate by shifting the

composition of public spending towards traded goods. 12/ (provided 8 >           0).
SUD/wb/08—2286                       51




This will reduce p and restore total tpt tax receipts to their previous level

itt spite of the lower rate by reducing       and further expanding the

production of traded goods. With this budget balancing strategy, p definiteLy

declines and resources unambiguously move into the traded goods sector.

           The second example concerns alternative balanced budget responses to

an increase in world real interest rates which increses the interest cost of

servicing the public debt. If the government raises lump—sum taxes to offset

the increased interest bill, the long—run effects will depend on the net

foreign asset position of the country (equations 29, j, k,l). Consider for

simplicity the case where r = 5.   In that case the country's net foreign aset

position equals —b, the public debt. For a small negative value of f (fdr a

small public debt), the long—run response to an increase in the interest rate

involves the accumulation of private non—human wealth and an increase in the

Level of consumption. The short—run response of consumption to an

unanticipated permanent rise in r of course goes in the opposite directiQn.

During the adjustment process a low but rising level of consumption generate.s

the current account surpluses that accumulate into a higher long—run stock of

net fo'reign assets which permit the long—run increase in consumption. the

response of p is an immediate sharp drop followed by a steady rise and an

eventual higher long—run equilibrium level.

           If the initial position is that of a heavily indebted government and

nation, however, all these results can be reversed, with a long—run decline in

w, q and p being preceded by a short—run consumption boom and current account

deficit.

           If the incipient budget deficit resulting from an increase in r is

avoided by an increase in the tpt rate, the result is much more ambiguous

(see equations 34j, k, I). Given q, the increase in 0 required to pay for
SUD/wb/08—2286                       — 52   —




the    increase in debt service will, tend to reduce p, so p8 <   0. Two
economies starting off with the same moderate external debt position

((r—n)q+(x+n)(s+x)f>o) could.therefore have qualitatively different responses

of p and of the composition of production in the short run and in the long

run, to an increase in r, depending on whether t    or 8 is raised : balance the
budget. Specifically, the short—run decline in p and q followed y a Long—run

increase in both under the r endogenous rule in response to an u.anticipated

permanent increase in r could become, in the 8 endogenous case, a short—run

increase in q and p followed by a long—run decline. Of course, :he increase

in e   is,   unlike the increase in r, associated with a dead—weight loss if

e>o.
             If public spending is cut to balance the budget following an increase
in r, the effect on p, given q, is again negative, if at least some of the

spending cuts fall on non—traded goods. For the same (moderate) value of the

foreign debt, the response of q and p can again be in the opposite direction

from what it would be if 'r were adjusted to balance the budget. If the

government's share of non—traded goods in total public consumption l—E,exceeds

the private sector's share i—n, a long run decline in p is more likely when g

is endogenous.

             All the ingredients necessary for the consideration of alternative

balanced—budget adjustment processes following a variety of internal and

external shocks are contained in the previous sections. In a subsequent paper

the preliminary unbalanced (but solvent) budget analysis of section (3) wil

be extended to allow for more general borrowing strategies. Finally, the

option of money financing, in practice often the authorities' first resort,

will be added to the policy menu.

4. It is comforting that governments cannot put the economy on a Pareto—

    superior aggregate consumption path through a default on internally held

   debt. [Note that the traded goods only economy is the special case of oir

   economy when                    =   0.    In such an economy a path of q that dominates

   another path must be Pareto—superior].

           It is easily checked [see Buiter (1984)] that the slope of the

                The Yaari—Blarichard Model of Consumer Behavior



         The only new element in this Appendix is in the subsection on

aggregation where population growth is allowed for.



The individual's problem

         Each individual born at time s maximizes the following utility

functional at t s.                   -




(1)      maxEW(s,t) = maxE.f        et)us,vdv                 ; 6>0




         6 is the instantaneous pure rate of time preference.

               (II
                           (ii=O)


         l—.z is the coefficient of relative risk aversion.

         Et is the mathematical expectation operator, conditional on the

information available at time t.

         During his or her-lifetime each consumer faces a common,

instantaneous probability of death XO. The probability, at time t, of

surviving until time vt is therefore given by

         Equation (1) can therefore be rewritten as

                  We   define the following. Pt is the domestic currency price of traded

goods,             the domestic currency price of non—traded goods, m the nominal money

stock, XT consumption of traded goods, XN consumption of non—traded goods and

 i the nominal interest rate. In addition:



(3a)              ir(v)




(3b)              c(s,v)     xT(s,v) + 1T(v)XN(s,V)



(3c)              q(s,v)     (s,v) + i(v)(s,v)/pT(v).



                  The instantaneous utility function z is further characterized in

equations (4a, b).



(4a)               (s,t) =
                                        PT(t), N(t), (s,t))


(4b)              (s,t) = fC(     (s,t), XN(s,t))



The instantaneous utility function z is weakly separable between money and

goods. fC is linear homogeneous in XT and XN• fq is is linear homogeneous in

ilj   and   rn.    It is also homogeneous of degree zero in T' N and in.      fC j

increasing in XT and XN strictly quasi—concave, three imes continuously

differentiable and satisfies Inada—type condition that ensure strictly

positive solutions for XT and XN for positive •               fq   is increasing in

* and rn, decreasing in T and               for in > 0, strictly quasi—concave, three

times continuously differentiable and satisfies Inada—type conditions ensuring

positive solutions for              and non—negative solutions for in, for positive g.

    goods XN and real money balances are homothetic. In addition there is a

    subutility function fC generated by homothetic preferences over               and
                                                                              T



             Homogeneity of degree zero of fq in T' N and rn implies that z can

             be written as:



•
    (4a')      = fq(4,,   ,

             Homogeneity of degree 1 of fq in 4, and rn implies that (4a') can be
             rewritten as:




    (4a")      =   qf(          1, it,            1)


             Homqgeneity of degree one of fC in ; and XN implies that (4a") can

             be rewritten as:

             The instantaneous flow budget identity of the consumer is given in

    (5). There are 5 financial assets among which uie consumer allocates his

    financial wealth: non—interest bearing domestic money, rn, interest—bearing

    short bonds denomirated in domestic currency, b, interest—bearing short bonds

    denominated in foreign currency, b

    is index—linked to the price of traded goods, j, and claims to real

    reproducible capital k. The instantaneous domestic nominal interest rate is

    i; the instantaneous domestic real interest rate (in terms of traded goods) is

r,    the instantaneous foreign nominal interest rate is i and the domestic

currency price of a unit of installed capital is p. c is the spot foreign

exchange rate, n the nominal value of divided payments per unit of

capital, w nominal wage income, and r tax payments net of transfers.

           Equation (5) is the identity that saving equals disposable income

minus consumption.

           The first term on the r.h.s of (5) reflects the operation of

efficient life insurance or annuities markets. Each private consumer enters

into the following contract with an insurance company. As long as he lives

the consumer receives a rate of teturn p on his total financial asset holdings

at each instant. When he dies, the portfolio becomes the property of the

insurance company (conversely, if the consumers net financial asset position

is negative, he pays a rate of return p to the company on his net debt, with

the debt being caicelled when he dies). The insurance industry is competitive

with free entry      There is a large population and X is not only the

instantaneous probability of death for an individual but also the fraction of

Aggregation
          At each instant a new age cohort composed of many agent is born. The

size of the cohort born at time t is (n+X)eflt, n, X?O. The constant

instantaneous probability of death of an agent, A, is also taken to be the

proportion of agents in each cohort which die at each instant. The size of

the surviving cohort at time t which was born at time st is therefore
        ns —A(t—s)
(n+X)e     e            •        Total   population at any instant t is given by



           (n+X)e

                             J   e

                            -w


          For any individual agent's stock or flow ;(s,t) we define the

corresponding aggregateV(t) to be



(15)      V(t) = (n+X)e                tI;(st)e             )sds   .




We   assume that each agent, regardless of age, earns the same wage income and

pays the same taxes net of transfers, i.e.,



                    =        (t)      for all st



          (s,t) =           (t)       for all s        t




          It follows that each surviving agent has the same human capital:



          1(s,t) =          (t)       for all s        t.

        Aggregate consumption is, by direct computation, given by



(16a)   Q(t) =     e(t)(A(t)    + H(t))



(16b)   A(t)       r(t) A(t) + W(t) -       T(t)   -

        0(t) is as defined in (14b, c).

        For any aggregate V, the corresponding per—capita magnitude is

defined by



(17)    v(t) V(t)e1t


        Per capita consumption is therefore given by:



(18a)   q(t) =     0(t)     (aCt) + h(t))



        0(t) is as defined in (14b,c).



(18b)   (t) = (r(t)—n)a(t)          + w(t) —   t(t) — q(t)

(18c)   h(t) =     (r+X)h    + r(t) —   w(t)


(18d)   c(t) =     nC(i(t))q(t)

(18f)    xT(t) =        T((t))(t)

(18g)    xN(t) = (1_n



         From (18a,b,c) an alternative representation of the behavior of q is:



(18h)    t)     =      (r(t)—)q(t)—(X+n)(tS+X)a(t)
         or

(18i)    t)            (r(t)—(s+n))q(t)   —   X(S+X)a(t)+n(S+X)h(t).


If labor—augmenting (Harrod—neutral) technical change at a constant

proportional rate 'i is allowed for, the behavior of private consumption is

shown in 19. For any per capita variable v, v denotes the corresponding

magnitude per unit of efficiency labor.

         Using (19a,b,c), the consumption function can be written as:

(19a')   q =   (r—(+i+X))                    (5+x)xh

         In Buiter [1986b] it is shown       that   Xn0 is necessary for debt

neutrality, but that 0 is not necessary. The result that population growt1i

alone can destroy debt neutrality is due to Well [1985].
