                   Distributions of Family Hospital
                        and Physician Expenses


                              ABSTRACT



     The paper develops frequency distribution of annual health expense

for a variety of family compositions. The basic data resource was a

sample of claims for a large group of federal employees in 1977. The

primary data were compared in several aspects against three other sources

of reference data on expenses by the non—aged population; the comparisons

were reassuring.

     The method of convolution is used to obtain family frequency distri-

butions from the distribution for individual adults and children. This

technique is necessary when the claims data do not record family com-

position. In consequence, the results may not be nationally representative

of households which are relatively large or affected by unemployment.

Aside from this special reservation, the experience of the non—elderly

federal employee families seems to be a useful resource for policy analysis.

      The purpose of this report is to develop and discuss some new frequency

 distributions of family health expenses. Such distributions, if nationally

 representative of non-aged, non-poor, households wculd be useful for eval-

 uating proposals for new health insurance programs.

      Ideally, these distributions would be obtained from a large sample of

 families, using insurance company and household records under the following

 conditions: the composition of each enrolled family is known; all families

 have the same insurance coverage that is extensive by current standards;

 there was no selection bias in the observed population. These ideal require-

 ments cannot be met with any single available data resource. There are a

 variety of imperfect data resources, any of which should be used only with

 caution and after cross-checking for significant discrepancies.1"

      In this report, expenditure distributions are developed from the claims

 experience of a large group of federal employees in 1977. Several character-

 istics of this data will be compared with other sources such as per capita

 spending computed at HEW, claims experience at Blue Cross-Blue Shield of

Michigan, and claims experience of Metropolitan Life employees. The compar-

 isons are rather reassuring.

     Some interesting questions about the impact of new insurance

programs would require much more disaggregated detail than is attainable

with present resources. For example, the sources of family income,

education, age and occupation of members are likely to affect the responses

of sub-populations to insurance changes. Also, health care supply conditions

vary geographically and therefore consequences of insurance innovation will

also vary with location. The present resources and analysis allow direct

disaggregation only by family size, and are primarily relevant to aggregate

budgetary and service demand consequences of insurance changes.

Sampled Population nd Insurance Coverage

     In 1977, there were approximately 862,000 persons insured under the

high-option Indemnity Plan (Aetna Life and Casualty) for federal employees.

The persons insured are either enrollees (employees and annuitants), spouses,

or dependent children under age 19 or full-time students to age 23 or disabled

children with no age limit.

     Each enrollee represents a "contract." There were about 274,000

contracts headed by an enrollee under age 65. These contracts, contain-

ing about 452,000 adults and 277,000 children are the reference population

for the ensuing analysis. The enrollees had a choice of several insurance

plans, each having an experience-rated premium paid partly by the enrollee.

The 1977 premium (including both employer and subscriber payments) for family

coverage was 960 per year for the Aetna plan, which was somewhat lower than

the premium for the more popular Blue Cross-Blue Shield option. The BCBS

plan has more complete "first-dollar" coverage than the Aetna, but the two

are comparable in the coverage of large expenses. The possible selection

bias is that Aetna families may expect to incur fewer moderate health care

needs than the average federal employee family.
                                -3-

     Virtually all health care expenses are covered in the Aetna plan

except dentistry, routine checkups or well-baby care, eye glasses or

eye examinations. The family is responsible for 207 of hospital room

and board expenses after 2000, 207,, of all other hospital expenses, the

first 75 and then 207 of ambulatory care. Family copayment ends when

l0,00O of gross expense is exceeded. This is a clear instance of

"catastrophic" coverage. Further general information on enrollment and

coverage may be found in publications of the U.S. Civil Service Commission.

(Annual Reports, booklet BR1 41-24, and Federal Fringe Benefit Facts, 1978)

Claims Experience

     The Aetna company has prepared a l07 sample of all contracts with

claims for occurrences in 1977. The resulting file contains the annual

experience of each of 25,197 persons under age 65. The exact family

composition of each claimant contract is unknown, as is commonly the

case in insurance claim statistics. Therefore, the size distribution

of expense for a particular family composition cannot be simply observed.

Instead, each family composition must be synthesized from the individual

distributions for adults and children. This procedure will be addressed

in a later section.

     The average annual covered expense appearing on claims was approximately

279 per insured person. Persons not submitting claims may have had some

expense. This average is only 5% lower than the experience of Blue Cross-

Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM) with more than 2 million regular (non-aged)

contracts in force. More specifically, for BCBSM the average claimed

charges per person insured in 1977 were 296. Health care prices in

Michigan are slightly higher than the national average, and there are more
                                   -4-

blue-collar worker families than in the federally employee population.

This comparison is therefore somewhat reassuring about the national

representativeness of the Aetna data.

     The upper tail of the distribution of claimed expenses is a matter

of great interest for current policy discussions. In Table 1 below, the

Aetna and BCBSM results are compared in a gross fashion permitted by

published data.

                   and private communication)

These data again do not suggest serious incompatibility between the

reference population and Michigan families. Apparently, the Aetna group

had relatively more large claims, but because of greater "first-dollar"

coverage or other factors, the average expanse for families in the lower

category was higher in Michigan.

     A second population with which the Aetna group may be compared is

the population of employees of Metropoligan Life, whose headquarters is

in New York City. The Metropolitan claims experience for 1965-1975 has

been applied in policy analysis by the Congressional Budget Office.

     Table II compares the upper tail of claimed expenses for Aetna

 federal employees and Metropolitan employees. The crudest comparison

 between the first and third columns, shows a greater proportion of expenses
                              -5-

in the upper tail of the Aetna group. Partly, this is due to the

increase in per capita hospital and physician expenses of 227,, between

1975 and 1977. Also, the Metropolitan plan has more "first-dollar"

coverage. After adjusting all Aetna claims proportionally for inflation,

the two distributions are quite comparable.

     The size distribution of expenses for an individual is reported in

Table III. Spouses have been omitted, but their average expense was only

47, greater than that of enrolled adults. All non-claiming adults were

assumed to have 34 in ambulatory medical expenses. This amount is

derived from results of the Current Medicare Survey, a panel study using

diaries of expense for individuals who do not meet a deductible on

comprehensive ambulatory services. Children without claims were assumed

to have 40 in routine uncovered expense.

     The mean results in Table III can be compared with official estimates

of national per capita expense in 1977. For the national per capita

expense in Table IV below, dentistry, eyeglasses and nursing home care have

been eliminated, and the fiscal year rather than calendar year is available.

           "Age Differences in Health Care Spending, Fiscal

     The table shows, presumably, the net effect on the two populations of

differences in geographic concentration, age, income, education, insurance

coverage, health status or other factors. The apparent difference between

the groups would be narrowed if an appropriate share of drugs and other

health services (e.g., psychiatric) were deducted from the national means.

In some previous investigations, federal employee group expenses have been

said to overestimate national averages. The present analysis may have

reversed this perception by using an age limit. It is noteworthy that the

Michigan experience would also tend to fall short of the national averages

in Table II. These findings suggest that private insurance data would

tend to underestimate the experience of persons eligible for comprehensive

Medicaid assistance.

Family Expenses

       In the previous section I explained why family experience cannot be

simply tabulated from claims records. In this section, family experience

is estimated by the method of convolution. The method of coavoluting inde-

pendent random variables is as follows. Consider a two-person family, so

that family expense, Ef is the sum of expense for individual 1 and

individual 2.

               Ef = E1 + E2
                                  x
               Prob [Ef =
Then                             = E Prob [E1 =        Prob {E2 = X -
                            X}                    Z}                    Z}
                                  z=O

       In   the case of independent distributions, a family distribution for any

particular composition is easily synthesized by a sequence of pairwise con-

volutions. There are, however, reservations that should be attached to the

independence assumption. Contagious disease and accidents suggest a positive

correlation among the expenses of family members. Also, conformity of

decision-making in the family suggests a positive correlation. If we took a

sample of individuals living alone and estimated family experience using the

independence assumption, we would expect to underestimate the variance of

family expense because of positive intra-family correlation. Our sample is

not individuals living alone, so there is not necessarily a distorted result.

       The problem of bias from the independence assumption is more acute the

farther we depart from modal family size in the sample (which has a mean of

3.3 persons per contract). In the case of large families, it is quite pos-

sible that average family expense will be overestimated. There may be economies

of scale in knowledge and treatment as in other areas of family life. Also,

if there is a general association of larger family size with lower income this
                                  -9-

would suggest reduced health expense per person.

     Families with a composition close to the sample mode can be estimated

with unknown but perhaps tolerable bias until better data are available.

Tables Va through Vf below present a variety of family distributions

synthesized from the Aetna individuals.

     The hazards of the independence assumption have this implication for

analysis of new insurance programs: effects on small, very large, or

unemployed households are not confidently predicted by the Aetna federal

employee experience. However, for medium-sized households in the non-elderly

employed population, the Aetna data seem to be a valuable research resource.

1/

     During the 1980's more ideal data files should become

available from a major project of the National Center for

Health Statistics. Results of the Health Insurance

Experiment conducted by the Round Corporation will also be

forthcoming and should clarify the importance of selection

bias in insured groups.


2/

     Indirect methods of disaggregated analysis are possible.

For example, experimental results or other studies may yield

reliable models of the effect of income and other variables on

health care demands, independent of insurance coverage. Then

the reported distributions in this paper could be used to

synthesize distributions for particular subpopulations.

     See U.S. Congressional Budget Office, "Catastrophic Health

Insurance," Budget Issue Paper (January, 1977). Analysis of the

Metropolitan claims was performed 'inder contract by Gordon Trapnell

who kindly provided the data presented in this paper.
