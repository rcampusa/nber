     Fama (1984) analyzed the variability and the covariation of risk premiums

and expected. rates of depreciation. We employ three statistical techniques

that do not suffer from a potential bias in Fama's analysis, but we

nevertheless confirm his findings. In contrast to his interpretation the

results are not necessarily at variance with the 'predictions of a theoretical

model of the risk premium. Increases in expected rates of depreciation of the

dollar relative to five foreign currencies are positively correlated with

increases in the expected profitability of purchasing these currencies in the

forward market, and risk premiums have larger variances than expected rates of

depreciation.

      Although the theoretical and empirical literature on the efficiency

of the forward foreign exchange market is now quite broad, there is

anything   but consensus on the issues.     It is now well understood that

rejection of the unbiasedness hypothesis is not a rejection of market

efficiency, since a risk premium can separate the forward rate from the

expected future spot rate, but only recently has effort been directed to

the development of explicit tests of formal models of the risk premium.

The empirical success of the.se models can only be judged as limited.1

      In a recent paper, however, Eugene Fama (1984) has noted that by

viewing the forward premium as the expected rate of depreciation of the-

domestic currency relative to the foreign currency plus a risk premium,, it

is possible to estimate empirically the degree of variation of the risk

premii.un over time and also to learn about the covariation of the risk

premium with the expected rate of depreciation.    In particular, Faina found

that the covariance of these two variables is negative and sufficiently

large to imply that the variance of the risk premium exceeds that of the

expected rate of depreciation.       Farna also found the results somewhat

troublesome.      He states (p.327), "A good story for negative covariation

               (the risk premium) and E(Sti —        (the expected rate of
between                                         S)
depreciation) is difficult to tell."

      In Section I, we investigate the plausibility, of the finding of

negative covariation.      We first argue that it is intuitively plausible

before investigating whether the intuitive reasoning is supported by the

general equilibrium model developed by Lucas (1982).      Fama (198) noted

that the Lucas model might be used for this purpose, but he did not pursue

the   analysis.      We show that a sufficient condition for negative
covariation is that the   covariance   between the ratio of   expected   nominal

marginal rates of substitution of the two currencies and the expected

ratio of the nominal marginal rates of substitution be negative. Since it

is difficult to determine the sign or magnitude of this expression in

general, we   examine a second—order approximation to the expression. Based
on this approximation, it appears that the covartance of the risk premium

and the expected rate of depreciation can be positive only if tile

covariance between the iriterternporal nominal marginal rates of
substitution of the two currencies is large and positive. Since the
analysis based on the approximation is not entirely satisfactory, we
provide an example based on Cobb—Douglas utility functions arid
conditionally   lognormal exogenous processes in   which the covariarice is
indeed negative. This example economy is exactly     the type of environment

in which Fama claims to find difficulty justifying negative covariation.

t has complete markets and flexible goods prices that satisfy purchasing

power parity.

     Fama's other empirical result, that the variance of the risk premium

is greater than the variance of the expected rate of depreciation, also

seems to be an important result.       It is significant because it implies

that a time—varying risk premium plays a fundamental role in the
determination of spot and forward exchange rates.         In contrast, most

theoretical rational expectations models of exchange      rate determination
have focused almost exclusively on the expected rate of depreciation.
This finding suggests that future work be devoted to understanding the

importance of risk in foreign exchange markets.

    Because of the potential importance of these findings, it is
essential to investigate whether the statistical procedures employed in
Fama's analysis are correct.     Under the   hypothesis that there is a
time—varying risk premium, there is reason to suspect that the standard
errors reported by Fama are somewhat biased.         In   Section   II, we
investigate the source of the bias which arises from the presence of weak

serial correlation, and we argue that Fama's estimates, while biased, are

probably not severely biased. We then provide alternative techniques for

testing the hypothesis of negative covariation that are robust to the

presence of serial correlation, and we find that our statistical analysis

supports Fama's results.

     Concluding remarks and some qualifications of our analysis are
contained in Section III.
I. Consistency with Theory

    The empirical results contained in Fama (1984) demonstrate that the

covariation of the expected rate of change of the exchange rate and the

risk premium on a forward contract is negative.              Let     be the spot

exchange rate of U.S. dollars per unit of foreign currency, and let Ft be

the one period forward rate. The risk premium, P, is defined to be the

expected profit from buying U.S. dollars on the forward riarket, P

Ft_Et(St÷i) where                is the conditional. expectation operator.

Consequently, the empirical results tell us that when there is an increase

in the expected rate of depreciation of the U.S. dollar- relative to the

                                               increases, there is a decrease in
foreign currency, i.e. Et(St÷i —     St)/St)
the expected profit froni buying U.S. dollars in the forward market, i.e.

   falls.

    At an intuitive level this covariation may seem puzzling, since one

might argue that the higher the expected depreciation of the dollar, the

higher    might be the required expected nominal return on a dollar

denominated security. However, the risk premium in the empirical work is

the expected profit from purchasing dollars forward. Hence, the expected

profit is riot dollar denominated; it is denominated in foreign currency.

The appropriate dollar denominated profit is             —
                                                             Fe).   It is obtained
by selling dollars in the forward market for foreign currency and using

that foreign currency to buy dollars at the future spot rate.                  The

expected profit from selling dollars forward is (_Pt).                 Hence, the

covariation of         with the expected rate of depreciation of the dollar

relative to foreign currencies is positive. Consequently, at an intuitive

level there is no apparent inconsistency in finding negative covariation

between     arid
                   E:(s÷1   —   S)/S.
        The intuitive reasoning is also supported by an examination of the

risk premium within the context of a formal general equilibrium model

developed by Lucas (1982).              In Hodrick and Srivastava (198U), we.
demonstrate how the Lucas framework can be extended to price forward

contracts. A central idea in such intertemporal asset pricing frameworks

is that nominal risk free bills in the domestic arid foreign currencies are

priced such that the inverse of the known nominal return is equal to the

conditional expectation of the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution

of the currency.         When this is true, the foregone marginal utility of

holding a one period bill is equal to the expected discounted marginal

utility of the return on the bill.

        In the Lucas model, agents in two countries have identical.
preferences but different stochastic endowments of two goods.          In period

t, agents in country 0 get 2Xt of good X and nothing of good Y while

agents of country 1 get             of Y and nothing of X. Preferences are given

agent in country i, i=0,1.           The real state is        (X,Yt) which is a

realization of a known Markov process.           Since agents are assumed to be

able to trade in markets that are complete in the sense of Arrow (19624)

and Debreu (1959),       they   will share risk perfectly and always consume half

of each good. Consequently, the relative price of Y in terms of X is

where U and U are marginal utilities at period t.

      Agents are required to purchase the good of a country with the money

of that country, and agents know        when they make trades in money and

securities. Therefore, the dollar price of X and the pound price of Y are

                                               where   M and        are "dollars"

arid "pounds", the monies of country 0 and country 1.           Monies also follow

known Markov processes.

      The exchange rate is found by arbitrage:



                                                        _____          2

We use equations (2) through (8) to develop an analysis of the covariation

conserve notation, let s                  (S         — S )/S     and let p t    [F    —

                   Then it can be demonstrated that the following must. hold:

Consequently, the covariance of the risk premium in (9) and the expected

where C(•,') denotes the                    unconditional            covariance         operator and V() is the
unconditional           variance.                   Thus, a sufficient condition for negative

covariatiori is that the covariance term on the right hand side of (11) be

negative. However, we have been unable to determine the sign or magnitude

of this term in general. To get some insight into conditionS implying a
negative covariation between p,. and the expected rate of change of the-
spot rate, Et(st+i), we consider a second order approximation to the

expressions      in (9)         and (10). Second order approximation to (10) yields

yields

Intuition       about the sign of the covariariCe between Et (s t+1 )                                 and    p can now
be determined by examining their comovernents as the                                                various terms in
expressions       (12) and (13) change.                             It is straightforward to verify that

E(sti) and Pt move in opposite directions with changes in Et(Q1),
              and C,jQ1,1). With any of these changes, therefore, C[p,
             < 0.    The only potentially aabi6uau ci1ane couies in              se uI
 a change in E(Q1).             If        (Q1) increases, for example, then
Et(3t1)J < 0 if CtEQ1, Q1J < 0.                   If this last term is positive but

small relative to V(Q1), then C[p, Et(s1fl can be positive only if

the conditional covariance between the intertemporal marginal rates of

substitutions of the two currencies is large and positive.

        A sufficient condition for C[p , E (s

                                                                         ) changes

is Ct(Q1, Q1) < 0.               Only if this last term is large relative to

Vt(Q1) is CEpt, Et(st 1fl potentially greater than zero.

        Since this comparative statics exercise may not be satisfactory due

to the approximation and the types of changes being considered, we now

present an example economy in which                Et(st 1fl is negative.

        Suppose the period t utility function is Cobb—Douglas, U

which is evaluated at the equilibrium consumption levels.                   Then, the

marginal utilities with respect to X and Y                   at   time t are

The last term on. the right hand side can                      vary through time as has been
noted by Stockman (1978), Frenkel and Razin (1980), and Engel (198U), even

though it is riot a risk premium.                       Risk aversion magnifies the above

deviation of Ft from Et(St1). Given (20), our empirical findings as well

as Fama's findings can have an interpretation even with risk neutrality.

We prefer to call any deviation a risk premium because of the large

differences that characterize other expected asset returns. This evidence

has strongly conditioned our prior beliefs regarding agents' risk aversion.
II. The     Empirical Analysis

       In this section we analyze whether the empirical technique used by

Fama (19814) in his analysis of this issue is appropriate.        Since the

empirical analysis is relevant to any market containing spot and forward

rates, it is desirable that estimators with correct properties are used.

We argue here that some serial correlation may be present in the residuals

of Fama's ordinary least squares and seemingly unrelated regressions which

would potentially bias the standard errors. Since it appears in this case

that   the degree of the bias is not particularly severe, we do not

investigate it formally.         Instead, we discuss several econometric

approaches to this issue that do not suffer from this potential. bias.

       As in the theoretical analysis, let. Ft and S denote the forward and

spot exchange rates, and let       be the risk premium.. Both exchange rates

are measured in domestic currency (U.S. dollars) per unit of foreign

currency.     The risk premium is defined to be the expected profit from

selling the foreign currency forward which is equivalent to buying U.S.

dollars forward.      Market efficiency in the presence of a risk premium

therefore implies



(21)    Ft E(S
            t t+1)+P t


where Et(Sti) denotes the conditional expectation of                     given

information at time t.      In (21), the forward rate is decomposed into two

parts which are not observable to the econometrician, but each part is

known to agents in the market.     Since S is known at time t, (21) can be

rewritten as
(22)       (F —   S)/St       E[(Si — St)/S             +
                                                            Pt


which decomposes the forward premium into the conditional expectation of

the rate of change of the spot rate plus a normalized risk premium, Pt

            We use (22) in the empirical analysis because it is more likely

than (21) to satisfy assumptions of covariance stationarity. In order to

simplify notation in what follows, let s                         [(S          —   S       )/S )   and   f
                                                        t+1            t+1            t      t

       —
[(Ft
        Because the actual rate of change of the spot rate is equal to its

conditional expected value plus a prediction error, we can write



(23) s t+1        E (s
                  t t+1   )   +   r t+1

where the prediction error,                      is orthogonal to all variables in the

information set at time t. From (22), it follows that



(2) C(ft,.st+i)           C[Et(st+i),              + C(pt,


where C(,) denotes the covariarice operator.                                 Using (23) and the

orthogoriality of             to all time t information, we find



                                            +
(25) C(f,                 VEE(s1)]              C[p,   E(st+1fl


where V(•) denotes the variance operator.

       The covariance between the forward premium and the actual rate of

change of the spot rate can be measured as the left hand side of (25).

?either of the terms on            the    right hand side of (25),           the variance of the
expected rate of depreciation of the domestic currency relative to the

foreign currency and the covariance between the risk premium and the

expected rate of depreciation, is observable.                      Since V[Et(s1fl
positive, the observable covariance on the left—hand side of (214) yields

an estimated upper bound for CEp,               Et(s1fl.       Consequently, if C(f,
         is    statistically significantly            negative, then C[p Et(Stifl is

negative      and greater in absolute value than

        As Fama (19814) notes, negative covariation between the risk premium

and the expected rate of change of the spot rate sufficient to make the

measurable covariance in (25) negative implies that the variance of the

risk premium is greater than the variance of the expected rate of

depreciation.       This is easily demonstrated by examining the variance of

the    forward premium:.

Fama (19814) uses equations (22) and (23) to note that an ordinary least

if         is serially correlated, which is likely, the traditional computation

of the OLS standard errors cannot be justified since                    will be serially

correlated.           Farna (198L) did not find much evidence against the null

hypothesis of no serial correlation in the autocorrelatioris of the

residuals of equations like (27) using standard statistical tests, but

there      is    substantial evidence (see eg. Hodrick and Srivastava (1984)) that

have statistically significant explanatory power in predicting future spot

rates in equations like (27). Thus, it seems that the residuals of (27)

may be characterized by weak serial correlation which could bias Fama's

standard errors.

          At this point there are two questions to be addressed. One is why do

the residuals of (27) satisfy standard tests for serial correlation.                       A

second related question is if there is statistically significant serial

correlation but standard tests cannot detect it, is there significant bias

in the estimation.

          In addressing the first question consider the figures reported in

Table       1     that are taken from Fama's (1984) Table 1.               The standard

statistical test for serial correlation compares autocorrelation
coefficients to an asymptotic standard error which is 1/ Jf where T is the

sample size.          With a sample of ten years of monthly data, the standard

error is approximately .09.              Hence, an autocorrelation coefficient raust

exceed .18 in absolute value to be judged statistically significant at

traditional levels. Iotice that none of the first order autocorrelatioris

                is greater than .18.    On.e interpretation of these statistics could
be that s is riot       serially   correlated. An alternative interpretation is

that the large forecast errors in            make inference about the degree of

serial correlation in the series quite difficult.         Notice also that the

autocorrelations of the         series are highly significantly different from

zero.     Since these variables are statistically significant in regressions

like (27), we know that there is a statistically meaningful expected rate:

of change in exchange rates.          However, applying the ii.f test to the

residuals will riot reject the null hypothesis of no serial correlation

because the residuals also contain the unanticipated change in the

exchange rate, ri1. Based on the regressions in Hodrick and          Srivastava
(1984) in which a set o forward premiums was statistically significant in

explaining           it is entirely plausible to conjecture that- the residuals

in equations like (27) contain approximatley the same       amount of   residual

serial correlation as the raw series used as the dependent variables.        It

is also plausible based on the statistics in Table 1 to consider that the

variance of n1, the unanticipated change of the exchange rate, is

perhaps 50 to 100 times the variance of the projection error, 1L.         Thus,

in this case it seems unlikely that the bias is very severe.



II.A. The GMM Alternative

        Rather than investigate the severity of the bias directly, which is

cumbersome and quite difficult in the case of stochastic regressors that

are simply predetermined variables, we investigate three alternative
strategies of analysis.

     First, we consider estimation of the parameters in (27) as a problem
in Hansen's (1982) Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). In this case we
treat (27) as    a   model that supplies us with two orthogonality conditions.
 Let Z    = (1,f),     and define the function h(s
                                                         t+1
                                                               ,z ,b )
                                                                 t, 0        t+1
                                                                                    where   b0
         is   the true parameter    vector. Then the orthogonality            conditions of
 the model are    given by     defining the function f(s1,zt,b) as



 (29) f(st1,zt,b)


 where    2     denotes        Kronecker     product,    and      the model           implies

 E[f(sti,zt,bo)J        0.      Since b is    unknown and must be estimated, a GMM
estimator        can      be     constructed        by   defining          the       function
g0(b)     Etf(sti,zt,b)]        which has a zero at b      b0. The method of moments
estimator     of the function g0 for a sample of size T is




(30)




and b can be chosen by minimizing the criterion function




(31) JT('o)



where WT is an appropriately chosen weighting matrix.                    Since WT    is   (2x2)

and the model is linear, the choice of T does not affect the estimated

values of the parameters.           In this case the GMM         estimates    are the 01.3

estimates. The important point is            that   the choice of T does affect the

standard errors of the parameters, and different auxiliary assumptions

lead to different optimal choices of WT where optimality implies the

minimum asymptotic covariarice for estimators that                       impose the same
orthogonality    conditions.       The OLS    standard   errors are       produced by the
auxiliary assumptions of no serial correlation,

                  0,       arid conditional homoscedasticity,

            =          .        These are the assumptions of case (i) of Hansen (1982,

                We argued previously that the                               series is arbitrarily

serially correlated under the null hypothesis, which makes these

assumptions inappropriate.                More appropriate assumptions are case (v) of

Hansen (p.1O145).               We assume that E(c         )   and E(z ) are zero and that the

processes are linearly regular with fourth order cumulants that are zero.

In this    case       the- asymptotic covariance matrix of the 3MM parameters for

the optimal choice of WT                       is                 (DS1D

     The data used In this paper consist of spot and one—month forward

exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and five currencies, the French

franc, the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc, the British pound and the West

German mark.               The estimation used 119 nonoverlapping observations, the
                                                                    5

     The results of this estimation are presented in Table 2.                                       Not

surprisingly, the results of the test are supportive of Farna's findings.

All of the currencies have negative s's, and those of the Japanese yen,

the Swiss franc, and the U.K. pound are. statistically significantly
 negative- at standard marginal levels of significance.     Rather than extend

 the analysis in the direction of seemingly unrelated regressions as was

 done by Fama, we explore two alternative ways of conducting the
 investigation.     These tests are described in the next subsection of the

 paper-.




 11.3 Two Additional Complementary Techniques

         Our first additional test allows us to examine whether the covariance

 in (2L) is negative without assuminz lack of serial correlation.         The-

desire to develop a inultivariate analogue to (27) that does not impose the

assumption of no serial correlation in the residuals provides the

motivation for our second additional test. Unfortunately, the coefficient

of the      own forward premium does not decompose as in (28) if more
regressors are added to (27-).    It is, nevertheless, still possible to test

the hypothesis of negative covariation in the rnultivariate case.         The

procedure consists of predicting            using a multivariate analogue of

(27) to compute an estimate of V[Et(st1)] which can be compared with

            From (26), if VCEt(sti)] > V(f,), the covariance of P and
E Cs
 t t+1 ) must be negative.
       We turn next to a formal description of our alternative statistical

tests.      Mote that the first case examines whether a covariance of two

arbitrarily serially correlated time series is negative while the second

case tests whether the difference of two variances is negative.
Hypothesis testing in these cases requires the distribution of sample

variances and covariances, and these are derived and estimated by using

some elementary spectral analysis.        The procedures followed here are
similar to those employed by Meese and Singleton (1980) and Singleton
(1980).
       In the two tests we assume that the rate of change of the spot rate,

        and the forward premium,                           are time series that are stationary up

to their fourth moments. For the purposes of our first test, they can be

arbitrarily serially correlated.                           Define the autocovariance function of

 -Ience, Cf(0) is a biased estimator of R5(0) but from (32), the bias is

 proportional to —21TSf(0)T and is unimportant in large samples.
 Therefore, Cf's(0) is a consistent estimator of R (0).
                                                          f's

         In order to conduct inference, we need the asymptotic distribution of

 the sample covariance, Cf (0).       Fishman (1969, p. 121) demonstrates that

.fi(Cf(0) —     Rf(O))    is asymptotically normally distributed with zero mean
 and variance




 (35) V[C(0)] = 2ir I [Sf(X)S (A) +
                                    S(A)3dA


 when f and           are normal.    Valid inference about the hypothesis that

 the true covariance is negative can be conducted as a one—sided test of

 the null hypothesis       Rf3(0) > 0 using the normal distribution described

above.

         The series were first subjected to Fourier transformation, and the

periodogram was computed at 120 equally spaced frequencies. The spectral

densities were then obtained by smoothing the periodogram ordinates using

a Daniell window of width 7.             This smoothing procedure was deemed

satisfactory in that the estimates of the covariances obtained by
integrating (summing) the estimated spectral densities were quite close to

those computed directly. The results of our one—sided test are presented

in Table 3.       As can be seen, the sample covariance between the forward

premium and the actual rate of change of the spot rate is negative for all

five currencies, significantly so for the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc,
and the U.K. pound. While riot an identical test to our 3MM estimation,

this first alternative produces basically the same statistical results.



Additional Test 2

       As indicated previously, the second test relies on a comparison of

the variance of the forward premium with the variance of the estimated

rate of change of the spot rate, E(S+1). If



(A       \!(1' ' — \i1 (.q    '1 <- -,


then the covariance of the risk premium and the expected rate of
depreciation must be negative.              The statistical analysis in this case

follows Singleton (1980) quite closely. The first step in the analysis is

                                                    of the expected rate of change of

corresponding to the regressions of                            onto w. It is well

known EFishinan (1969), p. 71] that the spectral density function of the

                           •• t+1

where S(X) is the spectral density function of w.7 Following arguments

in Hannan (1970), Anderson (1971), and Singleton (1980), it can be shown

that the sample variances of                   and f have asymptotically normal

distributions with means given by                   and c, the true variances, and

covariance matrix of the sample variances given by

Here Sf(X) is the spectral. density function of f and S(x) is the

cross—spectral density function of f and .                               From these distributions we

find, that (f —-            is   asymptotically normal with mean                   — a., and   variance
    =    (+           — 2tS)Lir/T.             Examination      of   whether the variance       of the
expected rate        of depreciation is greater than the variance of the forward

premium   can be done as a one—sided test of the null hypothesis a. —                           a >0
based.   on this asymptotic distribution.
        In performing this test, we used                        the same data arid spectral
estimation method as in the first test.                          The results of the test are

presented in Table L•            As    can be     seen, the tests here based on the large

magnitude of the z statistics indicate very strongly that the covariance

between the risk premium and the expected rate of change of the spot rate

is negative for all five currencies in our sample.
iii. Conclusions
     The primary purpose of this paper has been to investigate the

covariation of the risk premium in the forward foreign exchange market and

the expected rate of depreciation of the U.S.      dollar relative to five

                                                    techniques, we confirmed
other currencies. Using alternative statistical

the findings reported in Fama (19814).   If one views the forward premium as

the sum   of   the expected rate of depreciation of the currency plus a risk

premium, then our evidence indicates that the risk premium      is negatively
correlated with the expected rate of depreciation.    The risk premium, when

defined this way, is the expected return to purchasing dollars in the:

forward market. The expected return to selling dollars or buying foreign

currency forward therefore covaries positively with the expected. rate of

depreciation of the dollar relative to all         five   foreign currencies..

Although Farna (19814) found such a covariation puzzling and potentially

inconsistent with economic theory, we have demonstrated that it is

intuitively plausible and consistent with the prediction of the         Lucas

(1982) model.

     The magnitude of the covariance also indicated that the variance of

the risk premium is greater than the variance of the expected rate of

depreciation.      Since rational expectations models of spot exchange rate

determination have focused almost exclusively on the latter term, this

quantitative finding suggests that more work ought to be devoted to

determining how risk affects the determination of spot exchange rates.

     Of course, this analysis as well as Fama's and all modern rational

expectations time series analysis relies on the statistical assumptions of

stationaritY and ergodicity. Krasker (1980) has argued that these
assumptions nay be incorrect in such analyses. Agents may care about
 events that have not occurred in the sample, and the probability of these

 events may fluctuate.9       Developing estimation methods to handle these
 problems may riot be as critical as determining what the factors actually

 are.     Fatna's Section 5 offers some alternative interpretations of the data

 that certainly demand some consideration.         First, it is, of course,
 possible that the market is inefficient, although this hypothesis receives

 virtually no support in studies of other financial markets.          A second
 alternative is attributed to Richard Roll who apparently suggested that a

government may obstinately force appreciation of a currency precisely in

those periods during which market forces are predicting depreciation.       If

the unbiasedness hypothesis were true, such a finding could only be
consistent with the data if governments could          consistently -fool the
public.      Hence, we also give little credence to this explanation in a
rational world.      Fama's third possible explantion was offered by Michael
Mussa.     He argued that these markets may be characterized by periods of

brief skewness in the distribution of future exchange rates due to

uncertainty in the direction of government policy.         Without sufficient

draws from these changing distributions, it is possible that ex post

changes in exchange rates are consistently below their ex ante means which

creates negative small sample covariation between the forward premium

under the unbiasedness hypothesis and the actual rate of depreciation.1°

Tackling these problems of heteroscedasticity and changing skewness in the

distributions of returns requires larger samples arid explicit
incorporation of additional theory regarding the linkage between the
determination of exchange rates and government policies.             This is
certainly a fertile area for additional theoretical and empirical analysis.

*    This paper was presented at the Goldwater Conference on Implications
     of International Financial Risk held at Arizona State University,

     1arch 1985. We thank the participants and especially the organizers,

     Don Schlagenhauf and Michael Melvin, for their comments. We thank the

     Center for the Study of Futures Prices at Columbia University for its

     support of this project. We also thank Lauren FeinstOne, Robert

     Flood, Jacob Frenkel., Richard Meese, Maurice Obstfeld, Kenneth

     Singleton and participants in seminars at the NBER 198 Suxnnier

     Institute,   Northwestern University, and. Washington University for

     their comments.



1. See Hodrick and SrivastaVa (198k) for tests of a particular model and.

     for extensive references to the empirical and theoretical literature

     on the subject. See also Frankel (1982), Domowitz and Hakkio (1985),

     Korajczyk (1985), and Mark (1985) for tests of alternative

     specifications of risk premiums.



2.   This   specification of the Lucas model has been criticized because the

     determination of the exchange rate lacks a forward looking component.

     The problem arises because the timing of trades in securities and

     goods makes the demand for money insensitive to the nominal interest

     rate. Alternative ways of overcoming this problem are discussed in

     Lucas and Stokey (1983) and Svensson fl983).
3. Domowitz and Hakkio (1985) employ these distributional assumptions in

    their analysis.



    Fama (198L) specified his analysis in natural logarithms. Since

              —          and ln(Ft) —          are very nearly equal to
    [(St1 —   3t)/st]   and [(Ft —
                                     S)/S]   and have almost perfect

    correlation, it is highly unlikely that statistically significant

   differences would separate the results.



5. The data were supplied by Data Resources, Inc. They are a nonover—

   lapping sample beginning in July 1973 and ending in September 1983 in

   which Tuesday forward rates predict Thursday spot rates 30 days in the

   future with the next observation being the following Friday forward

   rate predicting a corresponding Monday spot rate. Hakkio (1983)

   argues correctly that the future spot rates do not match the precise

   value day that is specified by a forward contract. Fama (1984) used

   the Harris Bank data treating a Friday forward rate as predicting a

   Friday spot rate four weeks in the future which is also incorrect.

   Thus, our data contain slight measurement errors. Riehi and Rodriguez

   (1977) discuss the rules that regulate the execution of a forward

   contract. Meese and Singleton (1980), Hsieh (19814), and Cumby and

   Obstfeld (19814) match the data more precisely than here, and they find

   very little difference in inference regarding evidence against the

   unbiasedness hypothesis.
6. ecause the distribution theory for a sample covariance requires

     consideration of the entire autocorrelation function of the vector

     time series, we have introduced new notation. Clearly, Rf5(O)

     z       ) is the covariance of interest.

7.   Dhrymes (197, p. 532) notes that S..(X) is a consistent estimator of
     the true spectral density whenever a consistent estimator of 9 is used

         (•7•I.
     a." __II
     4,.




3.   Anderson (1971, p. 593) establishes conditions under which the sample

     variances have limiting normal distributions despite the fact that 9

     is estimated. Our analysis is valid given these regularity conditions.



9. Tests of excess volatility of stock prices relative to dividends as in

     Shiller (1981) are subject to the same critique although the problem

     is much broader than just these financial studies. All rational

     expectations estimation techniques require that large sample moments

     correspond to the moments of the true distributions. If this is not

     the case because drastic events have not occurred with sufficent

     frequency, then the studies make an error.



10. It is interesting to note that evidence of negative covariation can be

     found in Bilson (1931) who broke the forward premium into small and

     larger values on the basis of whether they were smaller or larger than

     10 percent at an annual rate. His seemingly unrelated regression
                         = .25 f3 — .23
                           (15)    (.12)
indicates   that the negative   coefficient in equations like (27) may

be due to extreme values in the data which supports Mussa's conjecture

since relatively few of these large values occurred during the sample.
