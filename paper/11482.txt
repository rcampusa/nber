Reexamining the Distribution of Wealth in 1870

                                            ABSTRACT

This paper uses data on real and personal property ownership collected in the 1870 Federal Census
to explore factors influencing individual wealth accumulation and the aggregate distribution of
wealth in the United States near the middle of the nineteenth century. Previous analyses of these
data have relied on relatively small samples, or focused on population subgroups. By using the much
larger sample available in the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) we are able to
disaggregate the data much more finely than has previously been possible allowing us to explore
differences in inequality across space and between different population groups. The data provide
strong support for the hypothesis that American industrialization during the nineteenth century
resulted in increasing inequality in the distribution of wealth.

Introduction

       The marked rise in income inequality in the United States over the past two decades has

prompted a renewed interest in the history of both income and wealth distribution. Several

recent studies have sought to construct consistent measures of inequality across most of the

twentieth century. Using data from the Internal Revenue Service Piketty and Saez (2001) have

shown that income inequality followed a roughly U-shaped pattern: falling sharply during the

Great Depression and World War II before beginning to increase. At first inequality rose

gradually, but over the past several decades income dispersion has grown rapidly, so that by the

end of the century it had returned to levels comparable to those at the beginning of the century.

As with income distribution, inequality in wealth distribution declined dramatically during the

1930s and 1940s. But, in contrast to income, there has been no corresponding rise in wealth

inequality in the recent past according to the evidence compiled by Kopczuk and Saez (2004).

       Evidence about either income or wealth distribution before the twentieth century is quite

limited, but it is important to be able to place twentieth century trends in a broader context. The

federal censuses of 1850, 1860 and 1870 offer a rare glimpse of patterns of property ownership

in the United States during the nineteenth century. In 1850 census enumerators gathered

information on the value of real property and in 1860 and 1870 they collected data on the value

of both real and personal property holdings of every individual. These mid-century data offer a

snapshot of wealth holding prior to the late nineteenth century acceleration of industrialization.

Although a number of previous studies have made use of these data to explore a variety of issues

related to wealth accumulation and inequality in the nineteenth century, these earlier efforts have

been based, however, on relatively small samples or focused on particular sub-groups within the
                                                                                                      2


population.1 In this paper we make use of the much larger sample available in the Integrated

Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) sample of the 1870 census to examine the distribution of

wealth at a relatively disaggregated level.

       The large size of the IPUMS sample allows us to explore both patterns of spatial

variation in inequality, and differences in the level of wealth holding and inequality across a

variety of population sub-groups. Based on a much smaller sample, Soltow (1975) had noted

that wealth was much more unequally distributed in the South than elsewhere. While our

examination is consistent with this observation, we also find that property was nearly as

unequally distributed in some parts of the Northeast, and in the Pacific and Mountain regions.

Decomposing wealth inequality by race, residence, occupation, nativity and age, we find that

inequality was higher in urban than rural areas, higher among Blacks than Whites, and varied

with occupation and age. In light of the property requirements for entry into the profession, it is

not surprising that wealth was relatively equally distributed among farmers, but we also find

relatively low levels of inequality among professionals, and clerical and kindred workers, while

those in sales occupations displayed the highest level of inequality. Breaking the data down by

age we show, consistent with Atack and Bateman’s (1981) results for rural households, that

inequality was highest among the young, and declined for successively older groups. In contrast

 Soltow (1975) contains a relatively comprehensive discussion of wealth accumulation and
distribution based on a national sample of census returns at all three dates. His sample is,
however, considerably smaller than that collected in the IPUMS thus limiting his ability to
disaggregate the data across different demographic groups or geographic areas. Steckel (1990)
used a sample of about 1,500 observations matched from the 1850 to 1860 censuses to examine
wealth accumulation in the 1850s, and Ferrie (1999) used samples of immigrants and natives in
1850 and 1860 to trace the impact of changes in occupation and location and wealth
accumulation. Atack and Bateman (1981) analyzed wealth accumulation over the life-cycle
based on a sample of approximately 21,000 rural northern households in 1860.
                                                                                                   3


to these between group differences, however, we find that there was little difference in inequality

between the native born and the foreign born in 1870.

       Beginning with Kuznets (1955), economic historians have been intrigued by the

relationship between inequality and economic development. In his seminal article Kuznets

conjectured that income inequality would likely follow an inverted U-shaped path. In support of

this hypothesis he noted that inequality was higher in the urban and industrial sectors of the

economy than in the rural and agricultural sectors, and noted given this differential inequality the

movement of population from the agricultural to the industrial sector would (other things equal)

be expected to cause inequality to increase during the early stages of industrialization.

Williamson and Lindert (1980) have argued that movements of skilled/unskilled pay ratios—

which they interpret as a proxy for income inequality—in the nineteenth century United States

are consistent with this conjecture. More recently Steckel and Moehling (2001) have compiled

wealth data for a single state, Massachusetts, that reveal an upward trend in inequality from 1800

to the early twentieth century.

       Like these earlier studies we find support for the view that the early phases of U.S.

industrialization were associated with rising inequality. Using the 1870 wealth data from the

IPUMS to construct a measure of inequality that parallels that used by Kopczuk and Saez (2004)

in their study of twentieth century trends, we show that the distribution of wealth became

substantially more unequally between 1870 and the early twentieth century. In addition, we are

able to exploit the cross-sectional detail of the IPUMS data to demonstrate that wealth inequality

varied geographically with the level of urbanization and industrialization.
                                                                                                   4


Characteristics of the Data

       The 1870 census IPUMS contains a 1 percent random sample of the population drawn

from the original census manuscripts. In total there are data for 383,308 individuals, with a

combined aggregate wealth of $250.7 million. Many of these individuals were part of larger

households, whose assets were likely to be reported as belonging to the head of the household.

Analyzing wealth distribution across individuals thus may produce misleading results about the

concentration of property ownership. Therefore, in the subsequent analysis we focus on wealth

holding of household heads.2 Household heads accounted for 75,567 observations or about 20

percent of the sample, but held close to 90 percent of the reported wealth in 1870.

       The information on the value of real and personal property collected by Census

enumerators was self reported, and the instructions to enumerators acknowledged that “exact

accuracy may not be arrived at, but all persons should be encouraged to give a near and prompt

estimate for your information” (quoted in Soltow 1975, p. 1). In 1870 enumerators were

instructed to record information on personal property only if its aggregate value was $100 or

greater. As a result there is some understatement of property ownership among the poorer

segments of the population. In 1860, however, no such limitation was imposed and information

from this year can be used to draw inferences about the extent of censoring in the 1870 data. In

1860, approximately one-third of household heads with personal property valued at less than




2
  In 1870 family interrelationships were not recorded by enumerators, but their instructions
specified that the household head’s name should be entered first in the record for each family
recorded, with other members following. Using this fact the compilers of the IPUMS have
constructed the family relationship variable for record locations for each individual in the family
along with other demographic data.
                                                                                                    5


$100 had non-zero amounts of personal property. Given the small amounts involved, however,

the impact of this truncation in personal wealth is likely to be small.3

       Because the data on the value of real and personal property were self-reported the

resulting figures are unlikely to be entirely accurate, but previous researchers have concluded

that the discrepancies do not create large systematic biases. Analysis of the distribution of

reported values clearly reveals a tendency toward heaping on round numbers. Matching census

manuscripts with tax lists, Steckel (1994) found that census wealth figures often exceeded

taxable wealth levels, but that there was no systematic association between such discrepancies

and socioeconomic variables such as age or occupation. He also reported that differences in the

Gini coefficients computed from the two sources were small and not statistically significantly.

       The first column of Table 1 summarizes a number of the personal characteristics of the

full IPUMS population sample, while the next three provide comparable information for all

household heads, and for male and female household heads separately. Compared to the general

population household heads were considerably older, more likely to be foreign born and to be

employed in manufacturing. As previously noted, their average wealth level was substantially

higher than the population as a whole, and they were much more likely to own any property. On

the other hand, regional and urban-rural distributions were quite similar for the population as a

whole and the household heads. The racial breakdown of the two groups was also quite similar.

       Reflecting typical gender roles of the time there were relatively few female headed

households. Only about 11 percent of household heads were female in 1870, and it is likely that


3
  To assess the impact of truncation on the data we constructed a hypothetical personal property
variable in which we used the 1860 distribution of wealth holding for those with less than $100
of wealth to assign non-zero values to a portion of those recorded as having no personal property
in 1870. We then compared measures of aggregate wealth and the distribution of wealth in each
state for the actual and hypothetical data and found that they were quite similar.
                                                                                                  6


in most cases these women were recorded as heads because they had been widowed. The

average female head was nearly five years older than her male counterpart, and almost twice as

likely to be Black. She was also more likely to be native-born and to reside on a farm. Given

the adverse events which were likely to have preceded their ascendance to the role of household

head and their limited economic prospects it is not surprising that female household heads

reported owning substantially less property on average and were more likely to report owning no

real or personal property.



An Overview of Wealth Holding and Inequality in 1870

       In 1870 there were pronounced differences across states and regions in both average

wealth levels and in the distribution of wealth. The large size of the IPUMS sample makes it

possible to characterize these differences much more clearly than has heretofore been possible.

       Table 2 reports average levels of real, personal and total property holding, along with two

measures of the distribution of wealth—the share of total wealth held by the top 1 percent of

wealth holders, and the proportion recorded as having no wealth—in each state and census

division. For comparison the national figures are also reported. Regional differences in average

wealth were quite substantial, ranging from a high of $4935 in the Pacific to just $957 in the

Mountain states. Excluding these two recently settled areas there was a clear North-South gap in

wealth levels, with average wealth in the North about two to three times that in the South.

Within the South, wealth levels were generally higher in border states—Maryland, West

Virginia, and Kentucky, than in the deep South. Average wealth levels also varied greatly within

the North, and especially within New England, the industrialized states of southern New
                                                                                                  7


England—Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts—had much higher levels of wealth

holding than the more rural northern states—Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.

        The same regional patterns are also apparent when real and personal property ownership

are considered separately. But it is interesting to note that in New England real property

accounted for an unusually small share of total wealth, while personal property holding was

correspondingly more important. In New England personal property accounted for almost 43

percent of total wealth while it amounted to just 30 to 35 percent of wealth in most other regions.

        Differences in the level of average wealth to some degree parallel differences in the

distribution of wealth as well, with higher levels of average wealth being associated with greater

equality of wealth holding. Across most northern states property ownership was relatively

widespread. In the North Central states more than 80 percent of household heads reported

having some property, while over 70 percent of household heads in the Northeast had positive

property holdings. In contrast, in many of the southern states close to half of all household heads

reported having no property.

        Another measure of inequality is provided by the share of wealth owned by the top 1

percent of wealth holders. Kopczuk and Saez (2004) have traced the evolution of this statistic

over the 20th century, noting that in 1916—the first year covered by their data—the top 1 percent

of households held close to 40 percent of total wealth. The share held by this wealthiest group

fell sharply between 1930 and 1932, and continued to decline until by 1949 they held just 22.5

percent of the nation’s wealth. Despite some subsequent fluctuations in wealth inequality

Kopczuk and Saez did not find any long-run trend in the share held by the top 1 percent since

1950.
                                                                                                    8


       As the figures in table 2 make clear, wealth was substantially more equally distributed in

1870 than it was a half century later. For the nation as a whole, in 1870, the top 1 percent of

wealth holders owned just 27.9 percent of total property, closer to contemporary levels of wealth

inequality than to the high levels recorded near the beginning of the 20th century. Real property

holding was even more dispersed, with less than 27 percent owned by the top 1 percent, while

personal property tended to be substantially more concentrated, with more than 38 percent

owned by the top 1 percent.4

       The extent of wealth concentration varied considerably across states and regions,

however. In South Carolina and Louisiana, the top 1 percent of wealth holders owned more than

50 percent of all property. Wealth was also highly concentrated in several of the New England

states. In Rhode Island the top 1 percent owned 47 percent of all property, while in Connecticut

and Massachusetts they held 41 and 35 percent, respectively. At the other extreme, there were

twelve states in which the top 1 percent owned less than 20 percent of all property. These

relatively equitable states included several recently settled western states—Utah, Oregon, and

Montana—and a number of relatively agricultural northern states, including New York and

Pennsylvania, where tge wealthiest 1 percent owned less than 30 percent of total wealth.

Summarizing regional patterns, inequality was least in the North Central states, and highest in

the South and in New England. High levels of inequality in California also raised regional

inequality in the Pacific region.

  Kopczuk and Saez (2004)do not report separate figures for real and personal property, so there
is no way to compare these figures with more recent data.
                                                                                                    9


Determinants of Individual Wealth Accumulation

       The state, regional and national data discussed so far reflect the aggregation of the

experiences of thousands of individuals. Differences in wealth accumulation across these

individuals reflect both systematic differences associated with observable characteristics and the

influence of random shocks and unobservable differences. Because the IPUMS combines

individual level data on wealth holding with a range of other individual characteristics, such as

occupation, literacy, age, nativity and race, we can examine in more detail how these observable

characteristics affected individual wealth accumulation.

       Since a large number of household heads in 1870 were recorded as possessing no

property we proceed in two stages. In the first stage we use a probit regression to examine

factors that influenced whether a person reported owning any property. Here the dependent

variable is equal to 1 if the individual was recorded as having any property (for personal property

it is equal to 1 if they had more than $100 of property), and zero otherwise. In the second stage

we limit our analysis to individuals reporting positive amounts of property (more than $100 for

personal property), and regress the log of the level of wealth on personal characteristics. Table 3

reports the results of the probit regressions converted to marginal probabilities, so that each

coefficient shows how changes in the dependent variable affected the probability of reporting

any wealth. 5 Table 4 reports the results of Ordinary Least Squares regressions of the log of

wealth on individual characteristics for those household heads reporting positive (greater than

$100 for personal property) levels of property ownership.



5
  For continuous variables the transformed coefficient is the slope of the probability function
calculated at the means of the independent variables. For zero-one dummy variables we report
the change in probability resulting from changing the value of the particular dummy variable
from zero to one.
                                                                                                   10


       The impacts of personal characteristics are generally consistent with our expectations.

Reflecting the severe disadvantages of the newly emancipated slaves, Blacks were about 30

percent less likely to report owning any sort of property than were non-blacks, and the value of

property owned by those who did report positive values was about 60 percent of that owned by

otherwise comparable white household heads.6 There was no difference in real property

ownership between the foreign born and the native born, but immigrants were less likely to

report positive amounts of personal property, and this disadvantage in personal property

translated into smaller numbers reporting having any wealth. Among foreigners with some

property the amounts they owned were 15 to 20 percent less than among the native born.

Women were also less likely to own property and those who had property had less of it than

men.

       Literacy increased the odds of owning property and increased the amounts that people

owned, while disabilities reduced property ownership. Finally, the coefficients on age indicate

that the likelihood of property ownership and the amount owned both increased with age, but at a

decreasing rate. Both the likelihood of property ownership and the amount owned peaked in the

late 50s or early 60s.

       City dwellers were less likely to own any kind of property, and the odds of owning

property fell with city size. But those city dwellers who owned property were wealthier than

property owners in smaller places. Those in cities with populations of 25,000 to 99,999 were

about 8 percent less likely to report any property or any personal property and 13 percent less

likely to own real property. In cities with populations of 100,000 or more the odds of not owning

6
  To calculate the comparison of property values it is necessary to exponentiate the regression
coefficients. The results in Table 4 imply that Black’s real property was valued at 62 percent
that of whites, their personal property was valued at 63 percent that of whites, and their total
wealth was valued at 57 percent that of whites.
                                                                                                   11


property approximately doubled. For property owners both real and personal property wealth

were increasing with city size, although the gradient was much steeper for real property than for

personal property. The value of real property owned by those in cities with populations of

between 25,000 and 100,000 was nearly double that of residents of places with less than 25,000

population, and it was more than 2.7 times as great for those in cities with populations of

100,000 or more. Interestingly, however, the relationship between city size and wealth breaks

down for total wealth. Although the wealth of property owners in cities larger than 25,000 was

greater than those in smaller places, it was residents of medium sized cities that had the greatest

wealth.7

          Occupation was another important correlate of wealth accumulation. Here we employ

the IPUMS recoding of the original occupational responses based on the 1950 census

occupational classification scheme. The excluded category in all of the regressions is laborers,

so the coefficients reflect differences in wealth accumulation relative to common labor. Laborers

were the occupational group least likely to have accumulated any property, and the wealth of

those who had property was lower than for any other group. Of all occupation groups, farmers

were the most likely to own property of any kind. Individuals in professional and managerial

occupations were also more than usually likely to own property in 1870. Turning to the value of

property owned, the wealthiest occupational groups were professionals and managers, but the

value of property owned by farmers was also quite high. Those in non-occupational categories

were also among the wealthier property owners. While there was little difference in the

probability of owning property between sales and clerical occupations, on the one hand, and craft




7
    This reversal reflects the effects differences in sample composition across groups.
                                                                                                    12


and operative occupations, on the other, there was a pronounced difference in the value of

property owned, with the former group being substantially wealthier.

          We noted earlier that there were significant variations in the prevalence of property

ownership and average wealth levels across states and regions. To some extent these differences

reflect differences in population composition across states, as can be seen by considering the

regional effects estimated in Tables 3 and 4. Controlling for the large differences in wealth

holding between Blacks and Whites nearly eliminates North-South differences in the probability

of owning property. On the other hand, differences in personal characteristics do little to alter

North-South differences in the amount of property owned by those with positive amounts of

wealth. On the other hand, the relatively high levels of wealth holding in the Pacific region

appear to be largely a product of differences in population composition, rather than a regional

effect.



The Sources of Inequality

          Despite the evident correlation of property ownership with a variety of personal

characteristics, these observable factors can account for at best a small fraction of total

inequality. No matter how the population is divided the vast majority of variation in wealth

levels occurred within groups rather than between them. This observation is already suggested

by the relatively small fraction of wealth variation that is statistically explained by the

regressions in Tables 3 and 4. In this section we formalize this observation making use of the

Theil inequality index.

          Like the Gini index, the Theil index reduces the degree of wealth dispersion across the

entire wealth distribution to a single parameter. But unlike the Gini index, the Theil index can be
                                                                                                   13


linearly decomposed to express the relative contributions of inequality within and between

different subgroups of the population being studied. For a selected population the Theil index is

calculated as:

                      1 n wi      w
                 T=     ∑
                      n i =1 µ
                               ln( i )
                                  µ                                                          (1)

where n represents the number of observations, wi represents the wealth of individual i, µ

represents mean wealth, and 0ln(0) is defined to be equal to zero. In the case of perfect equality

the index is equal to zero. When wealth is perfectly unequally distributed—which is the case if

one individual owns all the wealth—the index equals ln(n).

       The Theil index can be decomposed for any exhaustive set of population subgroups into

the contributions attributable to inequality within each subgroup and across subgroups. If there

are G population subgroups and Tj denotes the Theil index calculated using equation (1) for

individuals within subgroup j. Then aggregate inequality can be rewritten as:

                      G      njµ j       G      njµ j  µ j 
                 T =∑                Tj + ∑         ln                                     (2)
                      j =1    nµ         j =1    nµ    µ

where nj is the number of observations in subgroup j, and µj is the mean wealth of subgroup j.

Notice that the first term in each summation is the same and is equal to subgroup j’s share of

total wealth. Thus the first term in the decomposition is a weighted sum of the within subgroup

inequalities where the weights are subgroup shares of total wealth. This is the measure of within

group inequality. The second term is a weighted sum of the log of the ratios of subgroup average

wealth to the mean wealth of the entire population. This is the measure of between group

inequality.

       Variations in the Theil Index across states closely resemble the pattern of variation in the

measure of inequality we considered in Table 1, the share of wealth owned by the top 1 percent
                                                                                                    14

of wealth holders. Figure 1 plots the Theil index for each state as a function of the

corresponding share of total wealth owned by the top 1 percent. The fact that the two measures

are not perfectly correlated reflects the additional information about other points in the wealth

distribution that is captured by the Theil index but ignored when we look only at wealth holding

of the very rich.

       Table 5 reports Theil inequality indexes for subgroups of the population broken down by

race, nativity, age, occupation, urban residence, and region. These decompositions reveal a

number of interesting features of wealth accumulation patterns. First, while real property

ownership became increasingly equitable with age, personal property ownership became

increasingly unequally distributed. When these patterns are combined there is relatively little

relationship between age and inequality. Second, inequality was substantially greater among

Blacks than among whites. Third, on the other hand, there was little difference in inequality

between the native and foreign born. Fourth, inequality was greater in large cities—those over

25,000 population—than in smaller places. Fifth, there were marked differences in inequality

across different occupation groups. As one might expect, farmers had the most equal distribution

of property ownership. Interestingly, however, laborers were among the occupations with the

most unequal distribution of property. Finally, regional patterns of inequality parallel those

noted earlier—with real property inequality highest in the South, and personal property

inequality highest in New England and the Mid Atlantic.

       Table 6 presents calculations of the decomposition of aggregate wealth inequality into

components due to within group inequality and between group inequality. It is apparent that

almost all of the inequality occurred with groups rather than between them. In all but one case

90 percent or more of total inequality was attributable to within group variations in wealth
                                                                                                 15

holding. The sole exception is the decomposition by occupation groups, where between group

inequality accounts for about 20 percent of total inequality.



The Correlates of Geographic Variation in Inequality

       One motivation for studying variations in wealth and income inequality is to gain a better

understanding of the mechanisms that have contributed to historical variations in the level of

inequality produced by the American economy. The presence of substantial cross-sectional

variation in levels of wealth inequality in 1870 provides an opportunity to examine the

relationship between inequality and the structural changes in the economy that were associated

with the process of industrialization during the nineteenth century.

        Over the course of the nineteenth century the process of economic transformation that

accompanied American industrialization proceeded at different rates in different parts of the

country. Industrialization began much earlier, for example, in New England and the Mid

Atlantic regions, than in North Central and Southern regions. By 1870, close to 35 percent of the

population in Massachusetts and New York lived in places with population of 25,000 or more,

more than three times the national average of 11 percent. Similarly, while manufacturing

accounted for only 7 percent of employment nationally, more than 20 percent of the population

of Massachusetts and Rhode Island was employed in manufacturing. Industrialization and

urbanization were also closely linked to high rates of immigration, although many of the foreign

born could also be found in more agricultural regions.

       It is inappropriate of course to equate the results of such cross-section comparisons with

genuine time-series observations. On the one hand it is possible that patterns of within group

inequality changed over time. On the other hand, there have been interactions between states at a
                                                                                                     16

point in time—arising from interstate migration and trade—that caused cross-section and time

series relationships to differ. Nonetheless, in the absence of time series data on inequality over

the course of the century it is illuminating to explore the cross-section relationship.

       Using the full IPUMS population sample for 1870 we have constructed measures of a

number of demographic characteristics for each state. These include: the share of the population

that was Black, foreign born, literate, living in a city with population 25,000 or greater,

employed in manufacturing, and the average age of the population. Several of these

characteristics are highly correlated with each other, and it does not make sense to include all of

them in a regression model.

       After some experimentation we found that we could account for a large fraction of the

across state variation in inequality with a small number of state characteristics. The top three

panels of Table 7 report the results of several OLS regressions estimated across states where the

dependent variable is the Theil inequality Index calculated for, respectively, real, personal, and

total property. In these regressions we have dropped the four smallest states (those with less than

50 heads of household in the 1870 IPUMS sample) to reduce errors arising from very small

sample sizes. The bottom panel of the table reports summary statistics for the dependent and

independent variables in the regressions.

       State characteristics can account for close to two thirds of the variation across states in

real and total property variation, and about half of the variation in personal property inequality.

Which specification fits best, and the relationship between inequality and the various explanatory

variables differs depending on which type of wealth we are considering. Our first specification

(Specification 1) includes the share of Blacks in the population (a proxy for the legacy of

slavery), along with the share employed in manufacturing and the share living in large cities
                                                                                                    17

(those with populations of 25,000 or more), which can be interpreted as proxies for

industrialization and urbanization, respectively.

        Urbanization and the fraction Black are consistently positive and statistically and

economically significant, but the share employed in manufacturing is significant only in the

regression for real property inequality. 8 The effect of the fraction Black on inequality is not

simply capturing North-South differences in inequality. When we replace the share of Blacks

with a dummy variable for southern states that dummy variable is indeed positive and

significant, but when we include both the dummy variable and the share of Blacks, the dummy

variable loses its significance, indicating that the relationship between the share of Blacks and

inequality is being identified largely on the basis of variations within the South.

        Adding the fraction of the population that is literate (Specification 2) substantially

increases the explanatory power of our model, especially for the case of personal property wealth

inequality. In addition the size and significance of the fraction Black declines, so that this

variable is statistically significant in only one case—for real property inequality. There was a

strong negative relationship between literacy and the fraction Black across states—the simple

correlation coefficient between these two variables is -0.78—but it is clear that the fraction

literate is more closely related to inequality than the fraction Black. Adding literacy also

increases the size and significance of the share in manufacturing, which is now positive and

statistically significant for all three measures of inequality.

        Adding the average age of the population (Specification 3) only marginally increases the

explanatory power of the model, and this variable is only statistically significant in the regression

8
  Our assessment of economic significance is based on calculating the implied effect of a one
standard deviation change in each variable. For total wealth, a one standard deviation increase in
the share employed in manufacturing would have increased the theil index by 0.18, or a bit more
than 10 percent of the unweighted average of the index across states.
                                                                                                    18

for personal property inequality. While including age does not greatly affect the magnitude of

the estimated effects of the other explanatory variables it does increase the standard errors for

several of them.

       The regression results in Table 7 suggest several conclusions. First, consistent with

Kuznets (1955) hypothesis, increasing with urbanization and industrialization are positively

related to the level of inequality. The effect of urbanization was consistently strong for all

measures of inequality across all three specifications. The impact of industrialization is not as

consistently significant, but after controlling for literacy we find that the share in manufacturing

had a positive and statistically significant relationship with all three measures of inequality. This

relationship is not simply a compositional effect arising because inequality was higher in urban

areas. Restricting the analysis to residents of rural counties (those with populations of less than

2,500) we find that the positive relationship between inequality and urbanization and

industrialization is, if anything, stronger, than for the population as a whole. In other words,

inequality among a state’s rural population was increased by the extent of urbanization and

manufacturing in the state.

       Second, slavery continued to exert an important influence on wealth distribution in 1870.

This is clearly true for real property ownership, where after controlling for urbanization and

industrialization the states with the largest fraction of Blacks in their population had the highest

rates of inequality. It is less evident in the distribution of personal property. That the

relationship between inequality and the share of Blacks weakens with the inclusion of the

literacy measure suggests that this is one important mechanism through which slavery may have

affected wealth accumulation.

Conclusions

       Information on real and personal property ownership collected in the federal population

censuses of 1850 through 1870 offer one of the few opportunities to study patterns of wealth

accumulation and inequality in the nineteenth century United States. While a number of earlier

studies have made use of relatively small or selective samples of these data, the availability of

the IPUMS one percent sample offers the opportunity to explore these data in much greater detail

than has heretofore been possible. In particular, the larger sample size makes it possible to

disaggregate the data in a variety of ways.

       Compared to estimates for the early twentieth century, the distribution of wealth at the

national level wealth was relatively equal. In 1870 the top 1 percent of wealth holders owned

27.9 percent of all property, about one-third less than was the case in 1916. Thus, wealth

inequality increased substantially during the period of rapid American industrialization in the late

nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

       The rise in inequality associated with increasing industrialization was prefigured in the

pattern of cross-sectional variation in inequality in 1870. Inequality varied considerably across

states, and much of this variation reflected differences in urbanization and manufacturing

employment across states. For the most part more rural and agricultural states enjoyed a higher

level of equality. The exception to this rule was, of course, the South, which remained in 1870

highly rural and agricultural. This exception is explained, however, by the legacy of slavery,

which apparently permitted the emergence during the antebellum period of a much more unequal

distribution of property than occurred in the North. This inequality managed to survive after the

Civil War despite the strong negative effect of emancipation on overall levels of wealth holding

in the South.
