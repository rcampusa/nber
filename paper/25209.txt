                                         ABSTRACT

Debate over safe-storage gun regulations has captured public attention in the aftermath of several
high-profile shootings committed by minors. Whether these laws actually decrease youth gun
violence, however, is an unanswered question. Using data from the FBI’s Supplementary
Homicide Reports for the period 1985-2013, this study is the first to estimate the relationship
between child access prevention (CAP) laws and firearm-related homicides committed by
juveniles. Our results suggest that CAP laws are associated with a 19 percent reduction in
juvenile firearm-related homicides. The estimated effect is stronger among whites than blacks and
is driven by states enforcing the strictest safe-storage standard. We find no evidence that CAP
laws are associated with firearm-related homicides committed by adults or with non-firearm-
related homicides committed by juveniles, suggesting that the observed relationship between
CAP laws and juvenile firearm-related homicides is causal.

“Too often, minors have also used their families’ unsecured firearms to intentionally perpetrate violence against
others.”
                                              -Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence (2018a)

“This poorly thought out legislation is without any consideration for personal circumstances. It invades people’s
homes and forces them to render their firearms useless in a self-defense situation by locking them up.”
                                              -National Rifle Association-Institute for Legislative Action on Seattle’s
                                              recently passed safe-storage ordinance (NRA-ILA 2018).

1. Introduction

           The most recent mass school shooting in the United States has intensified the discourse

over the safe storage of firearms after it was learned that the guns were taken from the shooter’s

home and belonged to his father (Coaston 2018, Mann 2018).1 This comes at a time of rising

youth gun violence and increasing public support for gun restrictions.2 For instance, a 2017 U.S.

survey found that approximately 60 percent of gun owners backed safe-storage requirements for

guns in households with children (Barry et al. 2018).3 As states grapple with decisions on gun

control, many view child access prevention (CAP) laws as a preferred option compared to more

divisive policies such as assault weapons and large-capacity magazine bans (Ingraham 2018).

           CAP laws encourage the safe storage of firearms by imposing liability on adults who

allow children unsupervised access to guns (Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence

2018a). Gun safety advocates support CAP laws as a way to limit firearm-related homicides, as

well as a way to decrease suicides among minors and the number of children killed by


1
  On May 18, 2018, 17-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis used his father’s shotgun and 0.38 revolver to kill 8 students
and 2 teachers at Santa Fe High School in Santa Fe, Texas. Because Texas’ safe-storage gun law applies only to
children under the age of 17, Pagourtzis’ family was not held liable (Platoff 2018, Sanchez 2018). Other recent
high-profile school shootings committed by minors who obtained their guns from home (or the home of a relative)
include the events in Chardon, Ohio (Crimesider Staff 2012); Sparks, Nevada (Associated Press 2013); Troutdale,
Oregon (Bernstein 2014); and Benton, Kentucky (Markgraf 2018).

  Gun violence has surpassed vehicle accidents as a leading cause of death for 15- to 29-year-olds in the United
States (Parsons et al. 2018). In 2015 alone, 2,824 individuals 19 years of age or younger died from gun violence
(National Center for Injury Prevention and Control 2017). Firearm-related injuries are currently the third leading
cause of death among American children aged 1 to 17 years (Fowler et al. 2017). Public support for gun restrictions
recently reached its highest point in the last 25 years (Clement 2018).
3
    In the same survey, nearly 80 percent of non-gun owners supported safe-storage requirements (Clement 2018).

                                                           2
unintentional shootings (Jones 2017, Iannelli 2018). On the other hand, critics argue that safe-

storage requirements impede a person’s ability to defend their home and family during a violent

intrusion, and that these laws may actually increase incidences of murders, rapes, robberies, and

other forms of violent crime (Kopel et al. 2000).

         As public calls for safe storage grow louder, it is likely that an increasing number of state

legislatures will come under pressure to pass CAP laws or toughen their existing CAP

requirements. In fact, one of the few municipal-level ordinances requiring the safe storage of

firearms passed in Seattle, Washington on July 9, 2018 (Norimine 2018).4 Yet, only 27 states

and the District of Columbia currently have some form of CAP law in place. Recent estimates

suggest that 7 percent of U.S. children (≈ 4.6 million) live in homes with an unlocked and loaded

firearm (Azrael et al. 2018).

         While a literature on CAP laws exists, its focus is almost entirely on unintentional

shooting deaths among children (Cummings et al. 1997, Webster and Starnes 2000, Lott and

Whitley 2001, Hepburn et al. 2006, DeSimone et al. 2013, Gius 2015) and youth suicides

(Cummings et al. 1997, Lott and Whitley 2001, Webster et al. 2004, DeSimone et al. 2013, Gius

2015). With a few exceptions, which we discuss in detail below, little is known about how these

laws affect violent crime and, more specifically, homicides.




4
  Soon after the ordinance passed, the Second Amendment Foundation and National Rifle Association (NRA) filed a
lawsuit against the City of Seattle, claiming the safe-storage requirement violates the state’s preemption statute
(KOMO Staff 2018). See Legal Community Against Violence (2008) for a discussion on local child access
prevention laws. At the state level, sponsors gathered enough signatures to put a gun safety initiative, which
includes a safe-storage requirement, on the November 2018 ballot in Washington (Porter 2018). In Oregon, a
petition calling for stricter gun storage laws failed to make the November 2018 ballot, after being challenged in
court by the NRA and Oregon Firearms Federation. Petitioners announced they would refile for the November 2020
ballot while concurrently working with the state legislature to pass the initiative in the 2019 session (Grippo 2018).
A child access prevention act was introduced into Congress on May 23, 2018 in Rhode Island (GovTrack.us 2018).


                                                          3
        Using the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR), a data source unique to the

literature, this study is the first to explore the relationship between CAP laws and firearm-related

homicides committed by juveniles. We focus on homicides, rather than other forms of violent

crime, because information on the offender’s age is available and the laws generate predictions

as to which age groups should be most affected, predictions that could not be tested without age-

specific information. Examining the period 1985-2013, a span when 26 states and the District of

Columbia adopted CAP legislation, our estimates suggest that CAP laws are associated with a 19

percent reduction in the expected number of firearm-related homicides committed by juveniles,

and this effect is driven by states enforcing a “negligent storage” standard, the strictest form of

CAP legislation. Furthermore, we find that CAP laws are not associated with firearm-related

homicides committed by adults nor are they associated with non-firearm-related homicides

committed by juveniles, providing evidence that the relationship between CAP laws and juvenile

firearm-related homicides is causal.



2. Background

        The storage of firearms within the home was unregulated in the United States until 1981,

when Missouri became the first state to pass a CAP law. Under the Missouri law, it is illegal to

recklessly provide firearm access to a person under the age of 18 (Giffords Law Center to

Prevent Gun Violence 2017). Since 1981, 26 states and the District of Columbia have passed a

CAP law (Table 1).5 Appendix Figure 1 illustrates the evolution of CAP laws over time.




5
  The dates listed in Table 1 for Delaware and Nevada are different than those listed in Anderson and Sabia
(forthcoming). Based on further research and additional sources, the effective CAP laws dates were updated from
1998 to 1994 and from 1995 to 1991 for Delaware and Nevada, respectively. It should be noted, however, that the
results presented below change little when using the original dates from Anderson and Sabia (forthcoming).


                                                       4
           CAP laws take a variety of forms. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia impose

criminal liability on individuals who negligently store firearms. In these states, if a minor gains

access to a firearm that was not properly stored, the gun owner faces potential fines,

imprisonment, or some combination of both. For instance, violation of Minnesota’s negligent

storage CAP law is punishable by up to a $3,000 fine and one year in jail (Peters 2013). The

remaining states listed in Table 1 levy a weaker standard for criminal liability and “impose

penalties only in the event of reckless, knowing or intentional conduct by the adult” (Giffords

Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence 2018a). In some cases, CAP laws have been used to

punish dealers and manufacturers who failed to include the appropriate safety devices with the

sale of their firearms (Shaffer 1999).

           CAP laws vary across other margins as well. For example, some negligent storage states

impose criminal liability if a minor could simply gain access to a firearm, while others require

the minor to have carried or used the firearm to impose liability. CAP laws may apply to all

firearms, loaded firearms, or handguns only, and some states require that stored firearms include

a locking device. Lastly, the definition of a “minor” varies from state to state (Giffords Law

Center to Prevent Gun Violence 2018a).6 For anecdotal evidence on individuals being charged

with unsafe gun storage in CAP law states, see Amaral (2014), Bell (2016), Boren (2017), Cutts

and Majchrowicz (2016), “Father Charged” (2017), Harmacinski (2013), James (1996), Lopez

and Goff (2014), Ly (2013), “Parents Charged” (2009, 2017), Spies (2016), and Young (2012).

A recent review of cases in which children under the age of 12 either shot and killed themselves

or were shot and killed by another child found that approximately half of the deaths resulted in a

    See Anderson and Sabia (forthcoming) for further details on CAP laws.


                                                          5
criminal charge. If the parent involved was a felon, the case almost always resulted in a criminal

charge (Penzenstadler et al. 2017).

           Due to the absence of state panel data on household gun storage, we know little about the

effect of CAP laws, and more generally gun control, on the safe storage of firearms. 7 Recent

research, however, suggests that CAP laws are indeed successful at keeping guns out of the

hands of youths. Using data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveys for the period 1993-2013,

Anderson and Sabia (forthcoming) explored the relationship between CAP laws and gun carrying

among high school students under the age of 18. Their results suggest that CAP laws are

associated with an almost 20 percent decrease in the rate of past-month gun carrying, and these

effects are driven by states that enforce a negligent storage standard.

           To our knowledge, only four previous studies have explored the relationship between

CAP laws and some form of violent crime. Using data from the Compressed Mortality Files of

the National Center for Health Statistics for the period 1979-1994, Cummings et al. (1997) found

no evidence that CAP laws deter gun-related homicides among victims under the age of 15.

Using data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) for the periods 1979-1996 and 1977-

1998, Lott and Whitley (2001) and Lott (2003), respectively, found that CAP laws were

associated with increases in homicides, rapes, robberies, and burglaries. However, Pepper

(2005) showed that Lott’s results were clearly sensitive to model specification and that some of

his reported estimates were not replicable. 8 Finally, Anderson and Sabia (forthcoming)

assembled the first comprehensive data set of school-associated shooting deaths in the United




7
  In a cross-sectional study, Prickett et al. (2014) found that families in states with both CAP laws and stronger
firearm legislation were more likely to safely store their firearms.

States and estimated the relationship between CAP laws and these events. Given the imprecision

of their estimates, they were unable to rule out substantially-sized effects in either direction.

           Our research extends the literature in at least three important ways. This study is the first

to estimate the effects of CAP laws on firearm-related homicides committed by juveniles. This

important contribution is possible because the SHR data include information on the age of the

offender and whether a firearm was used in the commission of the crime. Information on the age

of the offender was unavailable in the data used by Cummings et al. (1997), Lott and Whitely

(2001), and Lott (2003), preventing these authors from estimating the juvenile-gun-crime effects

of a policy that targets households with minors. By using data on homicides committed by

offenders of any age, one could fail to detect an effect that is concentrated among minors. 9

           Second, given the sample time frame under study, we exploit a considerable amount of

CAP law variation relative to previous research. Cummings et al. (1997), Lott and Whitley

(2001), and Lott (2003) observed pre- and post-treatment data for 12, 15, and 16 states,

respectively. We observe pre- and post-treatment data for 26 states and the District of Columbia.

Finally, because these studies predate the recent uptick in youth gun violence and wave of school

shootings, a fresh investigation is needed.



3. Data and Empirical Framework

           State-level homicide data come from the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR)

for the period 1985-2013.10 The SHR data are part of the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR)



9
    Lott and Whitley (2001) and Lott (2003) did not discern between firearm- and non-firearm-related homicides.
10
  The data are made available by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency
Prevention at the following location: https://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/ezashr/. See this website for details regarding
data collection procedures. See Iyengar (2009) and Raissian (2016) for other research that uses the SHR data.

program and are based on information from individual law enforcement agencies that are

compiled by state authorities and forwarded to the FBI. Unlike the standard data made available

by the UCR, the SHR data provide details on each incident, such as offender demographics and

whether a firearm was used in the commission of the crime (U.S. Department of Justice 2014).11

           To explore the relationship between CAP laws and juvenile firearm-related homicides,

we estimate a Poisson regression that takes the following form:



(1)        ln Juvenile Firearm Homicidesst = β0 + β1CAP Lawst + X’stβ2 + vs + wt + rs • wt + εst,



where Juvenile Firearm Homicidesst represents the expected number of firearm-related

homicides committed by 12- to 17-year-olds in state s and year t.12 The natural logarithm of the

state population of 12- to 17-year-olds is used as an offset variable. The independent variable of

interest, CAP Lawst, is equal to 1 if state s was enforcing a CAP law during year t, and equal to 0

otherwise. 13 The vector Xst includes state-level controls for demographics (% Nonwhite, %

Under 18, % Male), economic conditions (Unemployment Rate, Per Capita Income), policing

resources (Police Expenditures), political preferences (Democrat), mental health coverage

(Mental Health Parity Law), and other gun laws (Shall Issue Law, Stand Your Ground Law,


11
  The other source for homicide data in the United States is the National Vital Statistics System’s (NVSS) Fatal
Injury Reports. These data are compiled from the registration of deaths at the state and local level, but do not
contain information on the offender. Despite the differences in coverage and scope across the SHR and NVSS, both
sources show similar trends in homicide rates over time (U.S. Department of Justice 2014).
12
   Our empirical analysis follows a similar state-level differences-in-differences approach taken by previous
researchers interested in the effects of gun control. For examples, see Ludwig (1998), Marvell (2001), Cheng and
Hoekstra (2013), McClellan and Tekin (2017), and Edwards et al. (forthcoming). The results presented below
change little if we include homicides committed by children under the age of 12 in our definition of juvenile
firearm-related homicides. While most CAP law states define a “minor” as anyone under 18 years of age, some
states use a lower age threshold (Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence 2018a). Unfortunately, the juvenile
homicide data made available by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention are only available for
the under-12 and 12-17 age bins. Consequently, we potentially capture a lower bound effect of the policy.
13
     This variable is equal to fractional values during the year in which a CAP law took effect.

Minimum Possession Age, Background Check Law, Trigger Lock Law).14 Table 2 provides

weighted means and definitions for the variables included in Xst.15 The vectors vs and wt

represent state and year fixed effects, respectively. 16 Following Cheng and Hoekstra (2013), we

also include Census region-by-year fixed effects, denoted by rs • wt.17 These allow us to control

for differential shocks by region over time. Lastly, in most specifications, we include state-

specific linear time trends to control for state-level unobservables that evolve smoothly over

time, such as attitudes towards gun control. All regressions are weighted by state populations

and standard errors are corrected for clustering at the state level (Bertrand et al. 2004).



4. Results

           The baseline results of our analysis are presented in Table 3. The estimate of β1 reported

in column (1) comes from a model that does not control for any of the state-level covariates

listed in Table 2. It suggests that CAP laws are associated with a 31 (e-0.366 – 1 = -0.306) percent

reduction in firearm-related homicides committed by juveniles. Controlling for state-level

demographic characteristics and economic conditions has only a small impact on this estimate.

Likewise, including the political, mental health, and other gun law controls reduces the size of

the estimated effect by only a small amount. Specifically, the estimate reported in column (4)

suggests that CAP laws lead to a 25 percent reduction in juvenile firearm homicides. While we

(2008). Cheng and Hoekstra (2013) and McClellan and Tekin (2017) studied the effects of Stand Your Ground
laws, and Marvell (2001) explored the effects of juvenile gun possession bans.

16
  An advantage of the Poisson model is that including fixed effects does not lead to an incidental parameters
problem (Cameron and Trivedi 1998).
17
  The four Census regions are the West, Midwest, South, and Northeast. Region of residence is a strong predictor
of gun ownership and attitudes towards gun control (Pederson et al. 2015, Parker et al. 2017).

do not observe every policy or state-level characteristic that may be simultaneously correlated

with our outcome of interest and CAP laws, the stability of the estimates in columns (1) through

(4) is encouraging. In the last column of Table 3, we control for state-specific linear time trends.

Their introduction decreases the magnitude of our estimate of β1 by 7.5 log points, but the effect

remains statistically significant at the 5 percent level and suggests that CAP laws lead to a 19

percent reduction in firearm-related homicides committed by juveniles. 18

           In column (1) of Table 4, we test the parallel trends assumption by adding a lead on CAP

Law to the model, equal to 1 if a CAP law was passed in year t + 1, and equal to 0 otherwise.

The estimated coefficient on the lead is small and nowhere near statistically significant. In

columns (2) through (4) of Table 4, we add a series of leads to the model. They are, with one

exception, statistically indistinguishable from zero. Importantly, we observe no clear systematic

trend in juvenile firearm-related homicides leading up to the passage of CAP laws, providing

further evidence that the parallel trends assumption is satisfied.

           Next, in column (5) of Table 4, we replace CAP Law with an indicator that is equal to 1

the year in which a CAP law went into effect, 5 leads of this indicator, and 5 lags. 19 Again, there

is no evidence that juvenile firearm-related homicides began trending prior to the adoption of

CAP laws. In addition, we observe that the effect of CAP laws grows stronger over time.

Specifically, CAP laws are associated with a (statistically insignificant) 6.5 percent decrease in

the expected number of firearm-related homicides committed by juveniles during the year in

which the law goes into effect (i.e., year 0); two years after implementation, CAP laws are

related homicides.

associated with a 27 percent decrease; and, after 5 or more years, CAP laws are associated with a

31 percent decrease.20 Figure 1 plots the estimates shown in column (5).

           In the first two columns of Table 5, we replace juvenile firearm-related homicides with

firearm-related homicides committed by adults. Specifically, in column (1), we consider the

number of firearm-related homicides committed by 18+ year-olds. In the second column, we

restrict this age range and consider the number of firearm-related homicides committed by 18- to

24-year-olds. Because these laws may have spillover effects across individuals (e.g., siblings)

within households, we are hesitant to refer to these as true falsification tests. However, we do

expect CAP laws to bind less for these older age groups. The estimated coefficients indeed

suggest this is the case, as both are small in magnitude and statistically insignificant. Moreover,

an event study analysis of adult firearm-related homicides (Appendix Figure 2) shows little

evidence of pre-CAP law differences between treatment and control states, suggesting that CAP

laws were not simply passed in the midst of a downward trend in firearm-related homicide rates

or as a reactionary response to increasing gun violence.

           In the third column of Table 5, we consider the relationship between juvenile non-

firearm-related homicides and CAP laws. Again, we do not refer to this as a perfect falsification

test, because the laws may affect the usage of other types of weapons. 21 Yet, if CAP laws were

associated with large reductions in juvenile non-firearm-related homicides, we would be worried

that the estimates in Table 3 simply reflect some unobserved and confounding factor. This turns

  Standard difference-in-differences estimates may be biased if treatment is not constant over time (Goodman-
Bacon 2018). One way to assess the degree of bias is to compare the conventional difference-in-differences
estimate with an average of event-study coefficients. In Figure 1, the average of the coefficients for years 0 through
5+ is -0.261. By comparison, the estimated effect of CAP laws in column (5) of Table 3 is -0.210.
21
     It is possible that firearms and other types of weapons (e.g., knives) are substitutes or complements.


                                                             11
out to not be the case, as the estimated coefficient on CAP Law is small in magnitude and

statistically indistinguishable from zero.

         Approximately 30 percent of SHR cases have an unknown offender (U.S. Department of

Justice 2014). To the extent that state-level rates of missing information on the offender are

correlated with CAP laws, our results could be biased. To address this issue, we regress the

number of firearm-related homicides where information on the offender is unknown in state s

during year t on CAP Law and the full set of controls. The estimated coefficient in the final

column of Table 5 suggests this type of measurement error is not systematic to CAP laws, as it is

small in magnitude and nowhere near statistically significant. In sum, the Table 5 results support

the notion that the observed relationship between CAP laws and juvenile firearm-related

homicides is causal.

         We explore heterogeneous effects in Table 6. In columns (1) and (2), we consider

firearm-related homicides committed by white and nonwhite juveniles, respectively. The

estimated effect for whites indicates that CAP laws are associated with a 27 percent decrease in

firearm-related homicides, while the estimate for nonwhites indicates an 11 percent decrease.

The latter estimate, however, is not statistically significant at conventional levels (p-value =

0.155).22 Given that white Americans own guns at significantly higher rates than blacks, this

pattern of results is perhaps not surprising (Parker et al. 2017). When we restrict our attention to

male juvenile offenders (column (3)), the estimated coefficient suggests that CAP laws lead to an

18 percent decrease in firearm-related homicides.23



22
   Recent research shows that, in the cross-section, gun-storage behavior does not vary by race (Azrael et al. 2018,
Crifasi et al. 2018). Support for gun control, however, is generally stronger among nonwhites than whites (Filindra
and Kaplan 2017).
23
   Because firearm-related homicides committed by 12- to 17-year-old females are such rare events, Poisson models
failed to converge. When we specified the dependent variable as equal to 1 if state s during year t experienced a

                                                         12
         In column (4) of Table 6, we replace CAP Law with two mutually exclusive indicators,

Negligent Storage and Reckless Endangerment. As mentioned above, negligent storage laws are

the stricter form of CAP legislation and impose criminal liability on individuals who allow a

minor access to a firearm that was not properly stored. On the other hand, reckless

endangerment laws only impose criminal liability when an individual “intentionally, knowingly,

and/or recklessly” provides a firearm to a minor (Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence

2018a). The estimated coefficients in column (4) suggest that the observed CAP law effects are

driven by the stricter negligent storage form of legislation. These results are consistent with the

results in Anderson and Sabia (forthcoming), who found that negligent storage laws were much

more effective than reckless endangerment laws at reducing gun carrying among minors. 24

         We report the results of various robustness checks in Table 7. In the first column, we list

our preferred estimate from column (5) in Table 3 for comparison. In the second and third

columns, we drop states with 10 or more and 5 or more missing years of data, respectively. 25

Some states did not report any data to the SHR program in some years, while other state-year

cells are so severely underreported that they have been made unavailable by the Office of

Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.26 When dropping states with missing years of data


firearm-related homicide committed by a female juvenile (and equal to 0 otherwise), the estimated coefficient on
CAP Law was positive in sign but statistically indistinguishable from zero.
24
  Specifically, Anderson and Sabia (forthcoming) found that negligent storage laws were associated with a 25
percent decrease in the likelihood high school students reported past-month gun carrying. Reckless endangerment
laws were associated with a (statistically insignificant) 9 percent decrease in the likelihood high school students
reported past-month gun carrying.
25
  The states with 5 to 9 years of missing data are Kansas and Kentucky. The states with 10 or more years of
missing data are Florida, Montana, and Nebraska. The District of Columbia has 13 years of missing data. A full list
of data coverage by state is available at: https://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/ezashr/asp/methods.asp.
26
  If all states and the District of Columbia had data available for each of the 29 years in our panel, the sample size
would be N = 1,479. Given our sample size of N = 1,382, this means that roughly 7 percent of state-year cells are
unavailable due to reporting issues.


                                                          13
the estimated coefficient on CAP Law changes little in magnitude and remains statistically

significant at the 5 percent level. In column (4), we restrict our attention to only those states that

passed a CAP law during the period 1985-2013. With this restriction in place, the estimated

coefficient on CAP Law again changes little in magnitude and remains statistically significant.

Next, we report unweighted regression estimates, which are slightly smaller than those shown in

Table 3 but nevertheless indicate that CAP laws are associated with a 16 percent reduction in

firearm-related homicides committed by juveniles. In column (6), we drop the region-by-year

fixed effects from the right-hand-side of the estimating equation. The estimated coefficient from

this exercise suggests that CAP laws are associated with a 15 percent decrease in juvenile

firearm-related homicides, and this estimate is statistically significant at the 10 percent level.

Finally, we estimate equation (1) with OLS rather than modeling homicides as a count process.

While the estimated coefficient on CAP Law is no longer statistically significant at conventional

levels (p-value = 0.12), the magnitude of the effect is quite large, suggesting that CAP laws are

associated with a 36 percent decrease in juvenile firearm-related homicides relative to the mean.

       In Table 8, we repeat the robustness checks listed above to examine the sensitivity of the

Negligent Storage estimated reported in Table 6. In general, the estimated coefficient on

Negligent Storage is quite robust across the alternative specifications under consideration.

Again, there is little evidence to suggest that the weaker reckless endangerment laws are

effective at reducing gun violence among juveniles.

       Finally, in Figure 2, we assess the robustness of the estimated coefficient on CAP Law to

dropping one CAP law state at a time. The effect sizes range from -11.9 log points when we

drop California to -25.6 log points when we drop Indiana. As indicated above, populous states

enforcing a negligent storage standard (e.g., California, Illinois, and Texas) contribute important



                                                  14
weight to the estimated effect of CAP laws. 27 We repeat this exercise in Figure 3 to examine the

robustness of the estimated coefficient on Negligent Storage. Here, the effects range from -22.6

log points when we drop Illinois to -39.9 log points when we drop New Jersey. In all cases, the

estimated coefficient on Negligent Storage is statistically significant at the 5 percent level.



5. Conclusion

        While the majority of gun owners in the United States do not safely store all of their

firearms (Crifasi et al. 2018), we know very little about the causal effects of gun storage on gun

violence. This policy question has taken on increased salience in the wake of several high-

profile school shootings carried out by minors who obtained their gun from home (or the home

of a relative). To better understand how safe-storage laws affect gun crime, the current study

exploits state-level variation in safe-storage requirements. Specifically, using data from the

FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports for the period 1985-2013, we examine the relationship

between child access prevention laws and firearm-related homicides committed by juveniles.

        Our results suggest that CAP laws lead to a 19 percent reduction in the expected number

of firearm-related homicides committed by juveniles (i.e., 12- to 17-year-olds). This effect is

stronger for whites, as opposed to nonwhites, and is driven by states enforcing a negligent

storage standard, the strictest form of CAP legislation. Negligent storage laws impose criminal

liability on individuals who allow a minor access to a firearm that was not properly stored.

Event-study analyses show that the effects of CAP laws grow stronger over time and our

estimated coefficient of interest is robust to a range of specification checks and sample selection

criteria.


27
  The estimated coefficient on CAP Law is no longer statistically significant at conventional levels when we drop
California (p-value = 0.153), Illinois (p-value = 0.144), or Texas (p-value = 0.184).

                                                        15
        We also find that CAP laws are not associated with firearm-related homicides committed

by adults or with non-firearm-related homicides committed by juveniles, providing evidence that

the observed relationship between CAP laws and juvenile firearm-related homicides is not

simply being driven by confounding trends in gun crime or juvenile violence. 28

        From a policy perspective, understanding the effects of CAP laws is vital as youth gun

violence rises alongside public support for gun restrictions (Parsons et al. 2018, Clement 2018).

Because previous studies have relied on considerably less policy variation and homicide data

without age-specific information on offenders, we view the results above as the most credible

estimates of the relationship between CAP laws and youth gun violence.




28
   These results also suggest that increases in the time costs of accessing firearms for lawful gun owners during a
home invasion does not lead to an increase in the firearm-related homicide rate. Opposition to CAP laws generally
rests on this concern. It is possible that CAP laws promote important technological change that mitigates this
tradeoff. Safe-storage innovations such as biometrically-enhanced “gun boxes” that safely store (and often GPS
track) firearms, but also make guns quickly accessible via eye scan or thumb print, may deter gun crimes by
juveniles as well as reduce incentives for home invasions. Retail prices for these products generally range between
$150 and $300. For example, one popular product, “The Gun Box”, retails for $259 at www.gunbox.com.

Notes: Each column represents results from a separate Poisson regression based on data from the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide
Reports for the period 1985-2013. The dependent variable is equal to the number of firearm-related homicides committed by 12- to
17-year-olds in state s during year t. Weighted means for the dependent variable are reported. Demographic and economic controls: %
Nonwhite, % Under 18, % Male, Unemployment Rate, and Per Capita Income. Mental health and political controls: Police
Expenditures, Democrat, and Mental Health Parity Law. Other gun laws: Shall Issue Law, Stand Your Ground Law, Minimum
Possession Age, Background Check Law, and Trigger Lock Law. All models control for state fixed effects, year fixed effects, and

Notes: Each column represents results from a separate regression based on data from the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports for the period 1985-2013. In
columns (1)-(6), the dependent variable is equal to the number of firearm-related homicides committed by 12- to 17-year-olds in state s during year t. In
column (7), the dependent variable is equal to the number of firearm-related homicides committed by 12- to 17-year-olds per 100,000 population of this age
group in state s during year t. In columns (1)-(4) and (6)-(7), weighted means for the dependent variable are reported. In column (5), the unweighted mean for
the dependent variable is reported. Unless stated otherwise, all models control for the covariates listed in Table 2, state fixed effects, year fixed effects, region-
by-year fixed effects, and state-specific linear time trends. Unless stated otherwise, regressions are weighted by state populations of 12- to 17-year-olds.
Standard errors, corrected for clustering at the state level, are in parentheses.

      Notes: Poisson coefficient estimates (and their 90% confidence intervals) are reported. The dependent variable is equal
      to the number of firearm-related homicides committed by 18+ year-olds in state s during year t. Controls include the
      covariates listed in Table 2, state fixed effects, year fixed effects, region-by-year fixed effects, and state-specific linear
      time trends. Regression is weighted by state populations of 18+ year-olds. Standard errors are corrected for clustering
      at the state level.
