Do Workers Gain by Sharing? Employee Outcomes under Employee Ownership, Profit Sharing,
and Broad-based Stock Options

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper examines how shared capitalism compensation systems - those that link employee pay
to company performance - affect diverse employee outcomes. It uses two data sets: the national GSS
survey that provides a broad representative view of the extent of the programs; and the NBER Shared
Capitalism Project surveys of workers in 14 companies that use shared capitalism programs extensively.
We find that greater involvement in the programs is generally linked to greater participation in decisions,
higher quality supervision and treatment of employees, more training, higher pay and benefits, greater
job security, and higher job satisfaction. We also find positive interactions of shared capitalism with
high-performance policies in predicting participation in decisions and overall job satisfaction, and
negative interactions of shared capitalism with close supervision in affecting almost all of the outcomes.
Overall the results support the idea that workers can gain by sharing, but whether this happens is contingent
on other workplace policies.

       Today, more employees than ever before have ownership stakes in their firms through

ESOPs and firm-based stock ownership plans, receive stock options once limited to top

executives, and are covered by profit-sharing plans. The media has publicized both the rewards

and dangers of tying worker pay and wealth to company performance. The 1990's produced many

stories of regular employees becoming millionaires by working in Silicon Valley firms with

broad-based options that paid off handsomely. The early 2000’s produced stories about Enron

employees losing their retirement moneys in a 401(k) plan that was heavily concentrated in

company stock. Apart from the extreme cases that get publicized, are these programs generally

good or bad for workers?

       This paper analyzes the relationship of shared capitalism programs to a range of employee

outcomes: participation in decisions, supervision, training, company treatment of employees, pay,

job security, and job satisfaction. It uses data from the 2002 and 2006 General Social Surveys

(GSS), which covered 2226 persons in for-profit firms from a nationally representative sample,

and data from an NBER-sponsored firm based survey of over 40,000 employees at 320 worksites

in 14 companies for whom these programs are a key part of their compensation systems.

                                      WHAT WE EXPECT

       On the basis of incentive and organization theory and previous empirical work, we expect

that linking employee pay to company performance will impact workers in several ways.

Employee Participation in Decision-Making

       Shared capitalist compensation systems should be associated with greater freedom for

workers to make decisions at their workplace. It is difficult to imagine a firm devolving decisions

to workers without developing some pecuniary mechanism for motivating them to make decisions

in the firm's interest, be it profit-sharing, gain-sharing, stock options or share ownership. Indeed,
                                                     1
one common reason for firms to institute compensation systems relating employee pay to company

performance is to induce workers to make decisions that improve firm performance.1

         Two national surveys of workers have found the expected relation. For the U.S., Dube and

Freeman (2001) found a positive relation between shared capitalist compensation systems and

employee decision-making in Freeman and Rogers’ (1999) Workers Representation and

Participation Survey, with strong results for profit-sharing but weak results for employee

ownership. For the UK, Conyon and Freeman (2004) found a positive link between changes in

variable pay and changes in decision-making in the Workplace Employment Relations Survey.

However, firm-based studies of employee ownership find only a weak pattern between perceived

or desired participation in decision-making and employee ownership. Half of the ten studies

reviewed by Kruse and Blasi (1997) found participation levels higher with employee ownership

while half found no difference in participation. None of the studies found a connection between

participation in decisions and the size of one's ownership stake. Two of the studies that asked

about desired participation found no difference between employee-owners and non-owners, while

a third study found a decline in desired worker participation after an employee buyout, which the

author attributes to wariness by employees about the commitment levels of new employees and

trust in management (Long, 1981, 1982).

Supervision, Training, and Treatment of Workers

         Any shared compensation system must overcome potential free rider problems. The larger

the number of people who share in the rewards of the firm or group, the lower is the incentive for

1
 Over 60 studies indicate that profit sharing, employee ownership, and stock options are associated with better firm
performance on average. However, there is a great dispersion around that average as some companies greatly
outperform, and others under perform their non-sharing counterparts, for reasons that research has not yet pinned
down. (Kruse and Blasi, 1997; Kruse, 2003; Blasi, Kruse, and Bernstein, 2003).

                                                         2
the individual to work hard and the greater the reward to shirking. In our companion paper, we

find that worker monitoring of the group is an important mode for overcoming the free rider

problem (Freeman, Kruse, and Blasi 2008). Firms cannot force workers to self-monitor but they

can provide supportive supervision, training, and a workplace climate that encourages group

norms to sustain a self-monitoring equilibrium.

       Few studies have examined the relation of shared capitalism programs to supervision,

training, and workplace climate. Brown and Sessions (2003) report that employees in

performance-related pay plans have more positive views about management-employee relations

and how the workplace is run. Two studies have found that employee in profit-sharing plans are

more likely to receive employer-provided training (Azfar and Danninger, 2001; Robinson and

Zhang, 2005). Two studies have examined whether workplaces are safer under shared employee

ownership. Rooney (1992) found fewer OSHA injuries in employee ownership companies with

greater worker participation in decisions, but otherwise found mixed results for ownership without

participation. Rhodes and Steers (1981) found that accidents were no lower in a plywood

cooperative compared to a standard plywood company.

Pay and Benefits

       There are two reasons for expecting shared capitalist compensation systems to be

associated with higher pay and benefits.

       First, shared capitalist systems could operate in part as a "gift exchange" between the

worker and the firm, in which the higher pay increases worker effort, decreases turnover, and

increases worker loyalty (Akerlof, 1982). By encouraging employee cooperation, shared

capitalism programs could increase output, some of which would go to workers as their share of


                                                  3
profits and some as higher base wages or benefits. The sharing system would be a key component

of a mutual-gains or high-commitment system where both workers and the firms come out ahead

(Handel and Levine, 2004: 5). Second, since shared capitalism increases risk to workers,

compensating differential theory predicts that workers will want higher overall compensation.

Whether this compensation takes the form of fixed pay and benefits or shows up in a larger share in

profits and ownership is unclear. Again, what creates the potential for higher income to workers is

the higher productivity generated by the system.

         Despite some well-publicized examples of wage concessions when workers buy out their

companies or accept large ownership stakes (which make up a very small percentage of the

employee ownership landscape), workers in employee ownership plans tend to have comparable

or higher wages or compensation than other workers. Blasi et al. (1996) found that public

companies with broad-based employee ownership plans had 8% higher average compensation

levels than other comparable public companies, and compensation increased with the percentage

of stock held by employees. Studies of pay and benefits in ESOP and non-ESOP firms in

Massachusetts and Washington state also found that the levels of pay and other benefits were

similar between these two types of firms, so that ESOPs appear to come on top of other worker pay

and benefits (Kardas et al., 1998; Scharf and Mackin, 2000). With regard to other forms of

ownership, Renaud et al. (2004) found that stock purchase plan participation was associated with

subsequent pay increases for employees, and employer stock held in 401(k) plans appears to come

largely on top of other pension assets (Kroumova, 2002). Seven studies from the U.S., Great

Britain, and Germany find that profit-sharing firms also have generally higher average

compensation than otherwise-comparable firms (Kruse, 1993: 113-114; Handel and Gittleman,

2004).
                                                4
       Still, it is possible that the higher pay levels associated with shared capitalist compensation

reflect higher unmeasured worker quality, and that workers in fact take a cut in compensation to

link their pay to company performance. But the evidence runs against these possibilities. Kruse

(1998) found that average base pay levels and other benefits increase as young workers join

profit-sharing firms and decrease as they leave such firms, so worker selectivity cannot dominate

the cross-sectional relation. Similarly, Azfar and Danninger (2001) found that employees in

profit-sharing plans receive higher annual raises in base pay than employees in other firms,

connected in part to the greater training noted earlier. Other studies find that neither wages nor

total labor costs exclusive of the sharing component fall significantly in pre/post comparisons of

firms that adopt profit sharing (Black et al., 2004, for wages; Cappelli and Neumark, 2004, for

total labor costs). The implication is that trade-offs between base pay and shared capitalist

compensation are minimal and that profit sharing may be used in conjunction with higher base pay

levels as part of an efficiency wage strategy.

       Another possibility is that the higher monetary compensation associated with shared

capitalist systems may come at the cost of greater effort, stress, workplace danger, or other

disamenities at work. Some analysts view the systems as a bit of a sham, designed to elicit greater

worker effort and to shift risk to workers, without increasing the pay or quality of jobs. This is

"'management by stress' … which believes that [employee involvement] is simply a method of

sweating the workforce and curbing worker power and influence" (Handel and Levine, 2004: 6).

       Our data allows us to compare compensation for workers covered and not covered by the

shared capitalist compensation and to compare compensation for workers by the intensity of their

shared compensation arrangements.


                                                 5
Job security

       Traditional analysis of labor-run firms predicts that they have lower employment than in

management-run firms, and respond perversely to demand shocks, lowering employment when

output prices increase (reviewed in Bonin and Putterman, 1987). Most analyses show that

employee ownership firms tend to have more stable employment than other firms, but do not

respond perversely to demand shocks (Craig and Pencavel, 1992, 1993; Blair et al., 2000). Two

studies report that employment grew faster in firms following the adoption of ESOPs, particularly

if they have greater employee participation in decision-making (Quarrey and Rosen, 1993;

Winther and Marens, 1997). In addition, public firms with substantial employee ownership are

more likely than other comparable firms to survive over time (Blair et al., 2000; Park et al., 2004).

French worker cooperatives also have high rates of survival (Estrin and Jones, 1992).

       Profit sharing, in contrast, should create excess demand for employment and thus provide

substantial job security (Weitzman, 1984). Nineteen studies have examined Weitzman's

predictions that profit sharing should stabilize firm employment (Kruse, 1998: 109-113). A

majority found that firms view profit sharing differently from fixed wages in making employment

decisions. Of the twelve studies directly examining employment stability, six found greater

employment stability under profit sharing; four showed greater stability in some but not all

samples; while two have little or no support for the stabilizing effects of profit sharing.

Job satisfaction

       If shared capitalism is associated with greater participation and decision-making at the

workplace, better supervision, more training, more job security and higher total compensation,

these modes of pay ought to raise job satisfaction. But the 12 existing studies on job satisfaction


                                                  6
under employee ownership yield no clear generalization.2 Several studies show higher

satisfaction; several show no relationship; and one study shows lower satisfaction among

employee-owners where the union had lost a bitter strike the year before.3 Participation in

decisions seems to be important: one longitudinal study found that satisfaction went up only

among those who perceived increased participation in decisions after an employee buyout (Long,

1982). Our data provide the largest sample for assessing these inconclusive findings.

         In sum, prior research on employee outcomes under shared capitalism has yielded

generally positive results, though there is sufficient variability in some results to suggest that they

depend on the context in which they are implemented. By addressing all of the employee

outcomes with the GSS and the NBER data sets, and providing more robust measures of the

employment context inside these firms, we should be better able to provide a more consistent

generalization than the existing work.

                                           DATA AND ANALYSIS

         The NBER Shared Capitalism Research Project uses two data sets to analyze how shared

capitalist arrangements affect workers. The first is the 2002 and 2006 General Social Surveys

(GSS), on which we placed several questions on shared capitalism programs. The 2002 GSS has a

representative sample of 1,145 employees, and the 2006 GSS has a sample of 1,081 employees, in

for-profit companies. The second is a data set of employee surveys in 14 companies with one or

more shared capitalism programs, which we conducted over the 2001-2006 period. We selected

these companies to vary in company size, industry, and type of shared capitalism program. Even

2
  This is based on nine studies on job satisfaction reviewed in Kruse and Blasi (1997), plus Pendleton et al. (1998),
Keef (1998), and Bakan et al. (2004). The studies were selected if they used systematic data collection from
representative samples of employees, and used statistical techniques to rule out sampling error. Many used
multivariate analysis to hold constant the effect of other factors on employee attitudes or behavior.

                                                          7
so, our sample is non-representative, first because many firms refused our requests to run the

survey; and second because two of the firms were bought out by others who refused to proceed

with the planned survey. Each company in the sample agreed to have our research group

administer a survey to all or a random sample of employees. The survey included core questions

common across all companies, and some questions of special interest or relevance to that

company. Six company surveys were conducted entirely by web, seven company surveys were

done on paper, and one survey was done using both the web and paper surveys. The company

response rates ranged from 11% to 80%, with an average of 53% across the 14 companies. A total

of 41,206 respondents provided usable surveys. Appendix A describes the variables used in this

analysis. Companion papers that analyze the GSS and NBER datasets include Blasi, Kruse, and

Markowitz (2008), Blasi et al. (2008), Buchele et al. (2008), Budd (2008), Carberry (2008),

Freeman, Kruse, and Blasi (2008), Harden, Kruse, and Blasi (2008), and Kruse, Freeman, and

Blasi (2008).

        The overall prevalence of shared capitalist compensation is presented in Appendix Table

A-1, with fuller presentation in our companion paper (Kruse, Blasi, and Park 2008). For our

purposes here the most important result is that 45% of the for-profit private sector employees in the

GSS sample report participating in some kind of shared capitalism program (36% in profit sharing,

25% in gainsharing, 19% in employee ownership, and 11% in stock options), which gives us good

variation for examining the relation of these programs to worker outcomes. The prevalence is of

course higher in the NBER sample, since these firms were selected on the basis of having these

programs.


3
 Reminders by management that the strike would hurt ESOP account values brought the response "We don't vote; we
don't control the company; we don't care" (Kruse, 1984).
                                                      8
       As a first step in assessing the relation of shared capitalism to employee outcomes, we

constructed a thermometer-style index of shared capitalism, which assigns points based on

coverage by shared capitalism programs and the size of the financial stakes. This index is

described in Appendix B. We also present results breaking out the different forms of shared

capitalism types and intensities using the NBER data.

       Turning to employee outcomes, we have organized responses to questions in eight areas:

participation in decisions, company treatment of employees, supervision, training, pay and

benefits, co-worker relations, job security, and job satisfaction. These outcomes are related to

each other—e.g., training generally leads to higher pay; participation in decisions, training, job

security, and supervision are likely to affect perceptions of how the company treats employees;

and so on. We lack instruments to identify causality, so we do not try to tease out possible causal

links among the outcomes. Rather, we first test for the reduced form relationship between shared

capitalism and each of the individual outcomes conditional on demographic and job

characteristics, and in some cases on other outcomes as well—e.g., since company training is

likely to affect pay, we examine whether shared capitalism is related to pay both before and after

controlling for training.

                                     EMPIRICAL RESULTS

       We first use the shared capitalist index to predict each of the outcomes (Table 1), and then

probe the impact of different types and intensities of shared capitalist compensation (Tables B-1 to

B-5). We estimate OLS regressions when outcomes are numeric and use ordered probits when the

outcomes have three or four values with a natural ordering (e.g., "not at all true, not very true,

somewhat true, and very true"). The regression predicting hours of training use a Tobit

specification, to account for the censoring at zero. Most of the regressions using the NBER dataset
                                                   9
include company fixed effects so that coefficients reflect within-company differences rather than

cross-company differences that might be due to unmeasured differences among the companies.

At the bottom of Tables B-1 to B-5, some ESOP coefficients are reported where company fixed

effects are not used. Federal ERISA law imposes strict requirements on coverage so that most or

all employees are covered by an ESOP within a firm; the small number of excluded employees are

thus likely to differ in some particular way from other employees in the same firm. Because of this

the ESOP effects are better determined by comparing otherwise-similar ESOP and non-ESOP

workers across firms in the specifications without fixed effects.

       Table 1 summarizes our empirical results in terms of the coefficients on the shared

capitalism summated rating index variable for the seven outcomes under study. In most cases, we

examine more than one outcome under the specified domain.

1. Employee participation in decisions

       Almost all of the measures of participation in decision-making in Table 1 are positively

and significantly related to the shared capitalism index. There are two exceptions in the NBER

data -- the relationships with participation in company decisions and satisfaction with participation

in the NBER data, but only after controlling for other outcomes (employee involvement team,

training, and job security). This indicates that shared capitalism is strongly correlated with these

policies, and the package of these policies may be the most important determinant (which we

examine in Table 2).

       When the shared capitalism policies are broken out in Appendix Table B-1, the most

consistent result is that profit sharing intensity (measured using the most recent bonus as a percent

of pay) is linked to greater participation in decisions and greater satisfaction with participation

(cols. 1-5). The small negative coefficients on profit sharing eligibility (cols. 2, 3, and 5) indicate
                                                10
that very low profit sharing bonuses are associated with lower participation and satisfaction—an

effect that is erased as the bonus size increases. In addition, while employee ownership is linked to

greater participation in decisions (cols. 1-4) but satisfaction with participation is linked to

employee-owned stock as a percent of pay (col. 5).

       Examining the different types of employee ownership, the data show some significant

associations but no strong patterns. 401(k) stock intensity is associated with greater involvement

in job and department decisions (cols. 1-2), while involvement in company decisions is highest

among those with any 401(k) employer stock or those who retain stock from exercised options

(col. 3). These latter two groups are also more likely to be in EI teams (col. 4), while satisfaction

with participation is highest among those holding open market stock or with large ESOP or 401(k)

stakes (col. 5). As noted earlier, given the ERISA rules about coverage within a company, it is

more sensible to make inferences about the effects of ESOPs by comparing workers between

companies with and without ESOPs, which requires elimination of company fixed effects in the

calculations. When this is done at the bottom of Table B-1, the estimates show that ESOP

participants are more likely to be involved in job, department, and company decisions (cols. 1-3),

but are much less likely to be satisfied with their participation (col. 5). This latter result, which is

consistent with the within-company comparison, suggests that the simple membership in ESOPs in

these companies may have raised the desire for participation more than they raised actual

participation (or alternatively, that the additional participation itself raised desires for more

participation in ESOP companies). The impact of an ESOP on worker outcomes may be more

closely tied to the ESOP value as a percent of pay -- i.e. ownership intensity in relationship to

one’s economic situation – rather than simply membership in an EOSP plan.

2. Company treatment of employees
                                                  11
         Both the GSS and the NBER company survey asked a variety of quality of work life

questions. Item 2 in Table 1 contains results for ten of those measures.4

         The national survey data give generally positive results. Shared capitalism employees are

more likely to say that they are treated with respect, management-employee relations are good,

promotions are handled fairly, and worker safety is a high priority with management. A measure

that reflects directly on the "management by stress" theories is the employee's perception of stress

at work, which is not significantly related to the shared capitalism index. In additional calculations

not presented here, we examined the positive worker safety result using breakdowns by type of

shared capitalism program. In contrast to studies that found no consistent relationship between

employee ownership and worker safety (Rooney, 1992; Rhodes and Steers, 1981), our data show

that employee-owners as well as profit-sharers are more likely to report that worker safety is a high

priority with management.

         The NBER data, in contrast, show consistently positive results for shared capitalism and

company treatment. Shared capitalism is positively linked to perceptions that the company shares

success with employees and is fair to employees, and to grades workers give to the company on

sharing information, trustworthiness, and employee relations. These positive associations become

smaller in magnitude but remain positive and highly significant when controlling for several

human resource policies (being in an EI team, training, and job security). Disaggregating by

type of shared capitalism program in Table B-2, profit sharing and gainsharing eligibility are

strongly linked to perceptions that the company shares and is fair to employees (cols. 1-2), while


4
 The GSS contains other quality of work life measures which we also analyzed. The results (available on request)
were broadly similar across these measures, generally showing positive relationships to profit sharing but not to the
other shared capitalism measures.

                                                         12
profit sharing intensity is strongly associated with all three of the grades (cols. 3-5).

Employee-owners are also more likely to say the company shares with employees (col. 1), while

the size of the ownership stake is a strong predictor of each of the five measures.

       Comparisons among employee ownership types show an interesting disparity. Having

more employer stock in a 401(k) plan is positively linked to each of the measures, while ESOP

membership and stake are positively associated with perceptions that the company shares with

employees, but ESOP membership is negatively associated with the other four perceptions of

company treatment both with and without company fixed effects. This is consistent with the

finding that ESOP members are less likely to be satisfied with their participation in decisions.

3. Supervision

       Since incentive programs are one way to reduce the principal-agent problem when

supervision is difficult or costly, we expect less supervision in shared capitalist environments. In

addition, we expect supervisors to be more concerned with maintaining a cooperative atmosphere

that helps solve the free rider problem than with watching workers work.

        The GSS asked respondents for views of their supervisors, while the NBER survey asked

about the degree of supervision. As seen in item 3 of Table 1, shared capitalism employees are

more likely to see their supervisors as helpful and caring, while they are less likely to report that

they are closely supervised both before and after controlling for other HR policies. When broken

out by type of shared capitalism program in Table B-3, the strongly significant result is that ESOP

members have greater freedom from supervision (col. 1). Most of the coefficients on other

programs are positive, which indicates that each program contributes to the strongly positive

shared capitalism coefficient in Table 2.

4. Training
                                                  13
       The national GSS data in Table 2 show that shared capitalism employees are more likely to

say they have the training opportunities they need. The NBER data show that they report a higher

likelihood of formal job training in the past year, greater hours of training, and higher levels of

informal job training from fellow workers, with and without controls for participation in an EI

team and job security. The breakdowns by plan in Table B-3 show that both training and hours of

training are higher among workers with profit sharing and employee owners, and are also

positively linked to size of gain sharing bonus and employee ownership stake. But training is

negatively related to the size of stock option value from future potential profits (cols. 2-3). Among

the types of employee ownership, training and training hours are highest among ESOP participants

and those with 401(k) employer stock.

       The pattern of coefficients is quite different for informal job training from coworkers,

which suggests that informal job training often substitutes for formal training. Both stock option

holding and the size of the stake are positively linked to informal training (Table B-3, col. 4).

Also, while ESOP members are more likely to get formal training, they are less likely to get

informal training. Gainsharing is positively associated with informal training, as is the size of a

workers’ higher profit-sharing stake. The broad range of associations between shared capitalism

and formal and informal training suggest that training is complementary with shared capitalism.

5. Pay and benefits

       Table 1 shows that pay tends to be higher among employees with greater shared capitalist

forms of pay in both the national and NBER company data. Employees in the NBER company

data set with greater shared capitalism are more likely to say that their fixed pay is as at least equal

to market and rate their total compensation as higher than market and to rate their company as

higher on wages than others. Employees in the national shared capitalism survey are more likely
                                             14
to feel they are paid what they deserve. Employees with greater shared capitalism in both datasets

rate their companies as better on fringe benefits. The NBER results are not affected by the

inclusion of several human resource policies. When the shared capitalism programs are broken out

in Table B-4, most of the shared capitalism types are associated with higher fixed pay, though the

gainsharing bonus intensity and employee ownership stake are inversely related to pay. There are

few associations with the employee's rating of fixed pay relative to market (col. 2), but total

compensation relative to market is higher among gainsharers and those with higher profit sharing

benefits when they receive profit sharing, have bigger profit sharing bonuses, and are

employee-owners through ESPP's and 401(k) plans (cols. 4-5). The pay and benefit results

indicate that shared capitalism does not generally substitute for fixed pay or other benefits. This

rejects a simple compensating differences story of shared capitalist modes of pay, although the

higher pay may help compensate for greater effort or other forms of costly behavior.

6. Co-worker Relations

       Does shared capitalism help or hurt relations with fellow workers? Employees with greater

shared capitalism in the GSS dataset are more likely to report that their co-workers can be relied on

for help when needed, and that their co-workers take a personal interest in them. Such helpfulness

and interest presumably make work more pleasant and increase employee welfare directly, but

may also lay the foundation for cooperation among employees that can increase workplace

performance (explored in the companion papers by Freeman, Kruse, and Blasi 2008, and Blasi et

al. 2008).

6. Job Security

       Shared capitalism is associated with greater job security. Employees higher in the shared

capitalist index report a lower likelihood of losing their jobs, and in the national data they report a
                                                  15
lower likelihood of being laid off in the past year. The NBER results are maintained when

controlling for participation in an EI team and receipt of training. When broken out by shared

capitalism policy, both profit sharing eligibility and the size of the profit share are linked to greater

job security (Table B-5, col. 1). Owning employer stock, and the size of the ownership stake and

stock option value, are also positively associated with job security. The breakdowns by type of

employee ownership indicate that job security is highest among ESOP participants and those

holding 401(k) employer stock, and those with greater holdings in both of those plans. The

findings that job security is greater for employee-owners than for other workers is consistent with

prior research on the employment stability and company survival of employee ownership firms

(Blair et al., 2000, Park et al., 2004).

7. Job satisfaction

        Job satisfaction is positively linked to the shared capitalism index in both the national and

NBER company data, but the result is statistically significant only in the NBER data. This NBER

result disappears, however, when controlling for the human resource policies. The strong

association between shared capitalism and these human resource policies indicates that there may

be important complementarities, which we explore in Table 2. When the policies are broken out in

Table B-5, job satisfaction is positively associated with the size of the profit sharing and

gainsharing bonuses, and with participation in an ESOP when company fixed effects are removed

(col. 2). The positive ESOP result on job satisfaction presumably reflects the positive effects of

ESOP membership on training, freedom from supervision, rating of benefits, and job security

overpowering ESOP participants' lower satisfaction with participation in decisions (Table B-1)

and their lower ratings for the company on several measures (Table B-2).

Complementarities
                                                   16
         Both theory and evidence support the idea that there may be important complementarities

among human resource policies in affecting workplace performance (e.g., Levine and Tyson,

1990; Huselid, 1995; Ichniowski et al., 1996). These complementarities may also affect employee

outcomes: for example, job satisfaction may be increased more by combining shared capitalism

with employee involvement and training than by the sum of the policies in isolation.

         Measurement of high-performance human resource policies varies among studies. One

analysis divides them into seven broad categories: group incentive pay, teamwork/employee

involvement, training, employment security, information sharing, flexible job assignment, and

recruitment and selection (Ichniowski et al., 1997). The NBER surveys contain measures of each

of these, but not for every company.5 For our investigation of complementarities, we created a

human resource policy index that gives one point each for being in an employee involvement team,

receiving formal training in the past 12 months, and having high job security, and we then interact

this index with the shared capitalism index.6

         Shared capitalism may also interact with supervision in affecting employee outcomes.

Shared capitalist policies may, as noted, help substitute for close supervision of workers by

providing greater incentives for workers to work hard and monitor their co-workers. The finding

that shared capitalism is associated with greater freedom from supervision lends support to this

idea (Table 1). When shared capitalist policies are combined with close supervision, however, the

results may be negative. If workers are not given much latitude in how they do their work, shared


5
  Flexible job assignment was measured as job rotation at six companies, and rigorous selection was measured at one
large company.
6
   We also experimented with indices using measures of information sharing, job rotation, and rigorous selection,
producing a similar pattern of results. Here we use the index based only on employee involvement, training, and job
security since the sample sizes are smaller for job rotation and rigorous selection, and the grade of the company on
sharing information reflects an employee evaluation of the policy's success (highly correlated with evaluations of the
company on other dimensions), rather than the existence of a policy.
                                                         17
capitalist policies may serve mainly to shift financial risk to workers, resulting in more negative

worker behaviour and attitudes. At a minimum, combining shared capitalism with close

supervision sends a mixed message to employees: "We want you to work harder and be more

committed to the company because of your (profit share/employer stock/stock options), but we're

still going to keep a close eye on you." Workers may not respond well to this mixed message.

        Table 2 assesses interactions between the shared capitalism index and other workplace

policies to assess possible complementarities in effects on employee attitudes. The statistical

analysis shows that shared capitalism interacts with high performance policies and supervision in

affecting a number of employee outcomes.7 The interaction with high performance policies shows

that employees are especially likely to have high participation, and to be satisfied with their

participation, when they are covered by both shared capitalist and high performance policies (col.

3). The interaction is also positive with informal training and overall job satisfaction. The

interaction is negative, however, on perceptions of company sharing, fairness, and benefits; the

coefficients indicate that shared capitalism has a positive effect both for those with and without

high performance policies, but has a more positive effect for those who are not also covered by

high performance policies.

        The pattern is more straightforward with respect to supervision: the combination of shared

capitalism with close supervision produces a more negative outcome in almost every case (col. 5).

The main effect of close supervision is generally positive (col. 4), indicating that in the absence of

shared capitalism, having close supervision may often be a good thing (e.g., giving workers a

  When the high performance index included the outcome being predicted, that item was deleted from the high
performance index (e.g., employee involvement was deleted from the high performance index in predicting
participation in an employee involvement team).

                                                      18
better sense of what they are supposed to do). But the main effect is counteracted in most cases,

however, by the negative shared capitalism interaction—e.g., the predicted overall effect of

increased supervision on perceptions of company fairness is negative whenever the shared

capitalism index is 2 or greater.

        The contingent effects of shared capitalism on job satisfaction are illustrated in Figure 1,

which uses the regression results from Table 2. When workers are covered by high performance

policies and have low or average levels of supervision, the effects of increased shared capitalism

are positive (top two lines). When they are not covered by high-performance policies, and/or are

very closely supervised, the effects of shared capitalism are slightly or very negative (bottom four

lines). While the overall relationship between shared capitalism and job satisfaction is close to

zero after controlling for other policies (Table 1), these results illustrate that the other policies can

greatly condition the effects of shared capitalism.



                                           CONCLUSION

        Do workers gain by sharing? The evidence generally supports an answer of "yes", with

some caveats. Both the national and NBER company data indicate that shared capitalism is

positively linked to participation in decisions, evaluations of company climate and employee

treatment, perceptions of helpfulness by supervisors, lower levels of supervision, and higher levels

of training, pay and benefits, job security, and job satisfaction. Almost all of these relationships

remain strong when controlling for other human resource policies. This rejects the "management

by stress" theories of work innovation.

        When broken out by type of shared capitalist program, profit sharing was most consistently

linked to the positive outcomes, although gainsharing, stock options, and employee ownership also
                                                19
affect some outcomes positively. In many cases the positive effect was tied to simply being

covered by a policy (e.g., being eligible for profit sharing, or being an employee-owner), but there

were also many cases in which the effect was tied to the size of the financial stake involved (size of

most recent bonus, or value of employer stock or stock options).

       Estimated negative relations between some aspects of shared capitalism and some

outcomes are also informative about how this form of financial sharing operates. In particular,

while being a member of an ESOP was linked to a number of positive outcomes (participation in

decisions, perception that the company shares, freedom from supervision, formal training, pay and

benefit levels, job security, and job satisfaction), ESOP members also had lower satisfaction with

participation in decisions and lower ratings of the company on fairness, trustworthiness, and

employee relations. One possible reason is that employee-owners may be frustrated by unfulfilled

desires for greater participation in decisions (above the higher levels they already have). Another

possible reason is that some ESOP accounts have too little stock to be meaningful and some

employees may have negative attitudes when they are called owners but have very little

ownership. The importance of the ownership stake is highlighted by the finding that satisfaction

with participation rises with the value of employee-owned stock as a percent of pay. The

dynamics of employee ownership may work differently for ESOPs than for other forms of

ownership: it is the only form where all eligible workers are automatically enrolled and called

owners even with miniscule accounts.

       Finally, our data reveals potentially important complementarities of shared capitalism with

other workplace policies, particularly with high performance work policies and closeness of

supervision. Those who are covered by the combination of high-performance policies with shared

capitalism are most likely to report high participation in decisions, satisfaction with participation,
                                                 20
and overall job satisfaction. The combination of close supervision with shared capitalism,

however, has negative effects on almost every outcome.

       Overall, our findings are consistent with theories that stress the linkage between group

incentive pay systems and other labor and personnel relations policies. Taken as a package, a high

performance work system involves greater participation, higher quality of supervision, more

formal training, better wages and benefits, higher job satisfaction, and better job security.

Employers who are concerned about company performance, and workers who are concerned about

the quality of their working life, have reasons to be interested in this package. Our findings that

shared capitalist programs are often associated with these policies and outcomes indicate that there

is good potential for workers to gain through sharing.

                   APPENDIX B: The shared capitalist thermometer index

       As a first step in assessing the relation of shared capitalism to employee outcomes, we

constructed a thermometer-style index of shared capitalism. This index assigns one point each

when the worker was covered by any of the shared capitalist forms of compensation about which

the survey asked, with additional points for recent bonuses or grants, and for large bonuses or stock

holdings. For questions with a continuous numeric answer, we gave the item a value of 1 if the

respondent had a value greater than the median value. Because there is no natural ordering of

shared capitalist systems in the sense that a firm first introduces profit-sharing, then adds employee

ownership, and then gain-sharing, the index is not a Guttman scale. It is a simple summated rating

(Bartholomew et al, 2002; Bartholomew, 1996), using dichotomous scoring.

       In the GSS, there are eight variables in the index: profit sharing eligibility, gain sharing

eligibility, owning any company stock, holding stock options, receiving a profit sharing bonus in

the past year, receiving a gain sharing bonus in the past year, having an above-median profit- and

gain sharing bonus as a percent of pay, and having an above-median company stock holding as a

percent of pay. In the NBER data there are ten variables in the index: all of the above items plus

one point each for receiving a stock option grant in the past year, and having above-median stock

option holdings (including unvested options if they could be exercised today) as a percent of pay.

       Indices of this style have both advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, they

provide a quick and ready measure of the extent of shared capitalist arrangements that makes it

easy to compare results across surveys and to summarize the broad thrust of findings. Since our

firm surveys covered only firms with some shared capitalist arrangements, the index allows us to

differentiate workers with differing degrees of incentive to their firm’s programs. On the negative

side, the index treats different programs the same even though they potentially have different
                                                 34
effects on particular outcomes. It postulates a single scale with equal weights rather than using

factor analysis or other statistical modelling to obtain weights for given factors. To deal with

these problems, we estimated the relationship of the outcomes to the different types of shared

capitalism, introduced as dummy or continuous variables in regressions.8 Tables B-1 to B-5 give

the results of those calculations. By comparing the results in the appendix tables with those in the

text, we can assess the loss of information due to the amalgamation of the measures into a single

index.

         Figure B1 shows the distribution of our shared capitalism index in the GSS. This survey

estimates that 40% of US workers have some form of shared capitalist program. This estimate is

close to that obtained by Dube and Freeman in the WRPS. The mean score of the index is 1.48 – a

figure greatly affected by the substantial number of workers without shared capitalism systems.

Conditional on having a program, most workers report scores in the range of 2 to 5, with 6%

reporting scores of 6 or greater. Figure B2 gives the distribution of the index in the NBER survey

data. It also shows a non-normal distribution, with the most common scores as 2 to 4 but a sizeable

number of workers scoring 7 or above. There is sufficient variation in the index to differentiate the

extent of the shared capitalist “treatment” on workers.

 There are statistical techniques to deal with the formation of latent variable indices from questions of the sort that we
are amalgamating into a single summated rating. See Bartholomew et al. (2002) and Spector (1992).
