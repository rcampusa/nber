                                              ABSTRACT

The nature of the firm and its financing are closely interlinked. To produce significant net present
value, an entrepreneur has to transform her enterprise into one that is differentiated from the ordinary.
To achieve the control that will allow her to execute this strategy, she needs to have substantial ownership,
and thus financing. But it is hard to raise finance against differentiated assets. So an entrepreneur has
to commit to undertake a second transformation, standardization, that will make the human capital
in the firm, including her own, replaceable, so that outside financiers obtain control rights that will
allow them to be repaid. I argue that the availability of a vibrant stock market helps the entrepreneur
commit to these two transformations in a way that a debt market would not. This helps explain why
the nature of firms and the extent of innovation differ so much in different financing environments.

        One of the cornerstones of modern corporate finance is the Modigliani Miller Theorem, which

essentially says that in a world where investors can borrow and lend as easily as corporations, the value of

a firm is determined by the present discounted value of its expected cash flows, and not by how these cash

flows are allocated to various claimholders. A firm’s capital structure is therefore irrelevant to its value,

or taken literally, much of what corporate finance spends its time on is second order.


        Corporate finance researchers have spent the years since then trying to prove the value of their

field by challenging one assumption after another of the near-perfect world that Miller and Modigliani

postulated. Miller and Modigliani themselves acknowledged the tax deductability of interest, which

would imply that firm value should increase with leverage. Seminal contributions by Jensen and

Meckling (1976) and Myers (1977) showed that capital structure choices affected the firm’s investment

decisions. These were followed by Myers and Majluf (1984), who suggested that information

asymmetries between management and investors also influenced the choice of securities that are issued,

and hence corporate investment, and by Jensen (1986), who proposed that debt disciplines managerial

waste. Corporate finance thus responded well to the challenge posed by Miller and Modigliani, and

instead of witnessing its extinction, we have seen a tremendous flourishing of the field.2


        Today, behavioral theories of capital structure and financing choice (see Baker and Wurgler

(2011) for a comprehensive survey) duke it out with asymmetric information and agency explanations to

provide a veritable cornucopia of theories of corporate financing choices. Theories have linked capital

structure decisions to everything from consumer fears (Titman (1984)) or predation (Bolton and

Scharfstein (1990)) to wage negotiations (Perotti and Spier (1993)) or the early life experiences of today’s

CEO (Schoar and Zuo (2011)). If anything, corporate finance has an excess of models, with many

explanations for the well-documented regularities in the data. Fortunately, empirical corporate finance too

has joined the fray, with researchers uncovering interesting new patterns in firm financing behavior to

2
  Two excellent surveys of the field are Harris and Raviv (1991) and Shleifer and Vishny (1997), while a thoughtful
paper about future research challenges that I draw on is Zingales (2000). Tirole (2006) offers a comprehensive
integration and overview of research in corporate finance.

serve as grist for the theoretical mill, even while paying much more attention to issues like causality,

which earlier researchers had neglected. Hopefully, in the future we will be better able to tell our students

the empirical importance of each of the theories of corporate financing choice that we present to them,

without laying them out as an un-weighted stream of consciousness.


        In all this, though, one of the most important assumptions of the Modigliani Miller Theorem has

gone unchallenged by researchers in corporate finance; the assumption is the existence of the corporation.

In the largely perfect world envisioned by Miller and Modigliani, it is not clear what, if anything,

determines the existence of the corporation with clear boundaries. As researchers on the theory of the firm

such as Ronald Coase, Oliver Hart, and Oliver Williamson have suggested, firms with well-defined

boundaries emerge in worlds with transactions costs stemming from difficulties in contracting. But these

costs are unimportant in the Modigliani Miller world. So is the Modigliani Miller theorem doubly

irrelevant – it postulates the irrelevance of corporate capital structure in a world where corporations are

irrelevant?


        The substantial point I want to make is that a more general approach to corporate finance would

ask if the imperfections that lead to the boundaries of the firm being meaningful also lead to implications

for corporate capital structure, and vice versa. No doubt, many of the seminal papers in corporate finance

(see Myers (1977), for example) are based on the premise that the asset side and liability side of a firm’s

balance sheet are jointly determined, and much of the literature since links asset side frictions such as

illiquidity (see Diamond (1991) or Shleifer and Vishny (1992), for example) to the nature of financing.


        But with a few exceptions (see, for example, Fama and Jensen (1983 a & b), or Zingales (2000)),

the firm in finance consists of a set of projects with a pattern of investments, cash flows, and liquidation

values, with little explanation as to why the projects or the people running them should be part of the

same firm. Similarly, with notable exceptions (for example, Williamson (1988) and Hart and Moore




                                                      2
(1990) read with Hart and Moore (1994)), those working on the theory of the firm have largely ignored

the issue of how the firm is financed.


           Presidential addresses are occasions when you lament a misspent youth, and point to issues that

you wish you (and by implication, the profession) had spent more time on. Since the work of Fama and

Miller (1973) and Jensen and Meckling (1976), the firm in corporate finance has invariably been a single

person entity. The question of where the boundaries of the firm should lie is largely uninteresting in such

a setting, so the primary focus of analysis has been on the agency problem between the manager and

investors. But when one considers the firm’s activities as potentially involving many collaborators, with

their identity changing over time, the question of where the firm’s boundaries are drawn to promote

efficiency becomes an interesting one. It is equally fruitful to see how the factors that compel a certain

structure for the efficient operation of the enterprise also affect its need for, as well as its ability to, obtain

finance.


           I would like to use my time at the podium to attempt such a synthesis, I will focus on the very

early stages of the firm where the links between the nature of the entity being financed and the availability

of financing are perhaps most clear. Clearly, my work is informed by a burgeoning empirical literature in

the area of entrepreneurship and venture capital, which more than any other area of corporate finance has

recognized the links between the corporation and financing (see, for example, Bhide (2000, 2008),

Hellmann and Puri (2000, 2002), Kaplan and Stromberg (2002), Kaplan, Sensoy, and Stromberg (2009),

and Lerner and Malmendier (2010)).


           I will argue that the typical innovative firm undergoes two important transformations over its

early life: The first transformation entails differentiation, whereby the entrepreneur brings a group of

people and the assets they work with together to create an organization, which she leads to produce

distinctive goods and services.3 The differentiated nature of the enterprise’s activities is critical to its


3
 This resembles the Fundamental Transformation that Williamson (1985, 2002) refers to, but I emphasize the need
for the entrepreneur’s collaborators to coordinate with the entrepreneur rather than undertake asset-specific

                                                         3
being able to generate value, but the associated risk makes it hard for the entrepreneur to get collaborators

to coordinate in enterprise-building activities. I argue that the initial structure of the firm, with the

entrepreneur having significant ownership of assets, and thus control, is intended precisely to enable her

to differentiate substantially even while giving collaborators the incentive to follow.


         But a differentiated unique enterprise is also hard for outsiders to finance. And for an

entrepreneur who is not independently wealthy, finance is critical to purchasing the assets she needs to

encourage enterprise building. This is why the firm needs a second transformation, whereby the firm’s

operations are standardized so as to make the firm’s key human capital more replaceable and liquid, even

while it continues to produce the differentiated product or service. In this way, outsiders obtain more

control over the going concern, and value can be committed to them to repay their earlier financing.

Equity is the appropriate instrument to finance such a transformation because equity relies on going

concern value. Equity markets play an important role by rewarding the entrepreneur for standardizing the

firm, and thus providing powerful incentives for the second transformation.


          Because the cycle of up front financing followed by the two transformations is hard to commit

to, path-breaking innovation, enterprise creation, and the generation of positive NPV, are all difficult. The

availability of finance does alter the nature of firms that are created and explains why corporate finance is

so central to innovation, firm growth, and economic development. Of course, mature firms are more

capable of financing projects themselves, but the standardization many of them have undertaken to repay

past finance typically renders them less capable of innovation. Analyzing the firm and its financing in this

way gives us insights into who should own the firm, what the form of financing should be, and what kinds

of innovation and enterprises are possible when the financial system is underdeveloped.


         My broader message, of course, is that a very rewarding area of research in the years to come will

be to open up the black box of the corporation so as to link its inner functioning to its financing needs. It


investment. The subtle distinction is that differentiation sets a direction for the entire enterprise, while asset-specific
investment ties specific groups of assets together.

is doubly exciting in these times of great technological, economic, and political change. I will devote the

last part of the paper to speculation on how innovation and finance might be altered in the years to come.


                          I.       The Creation of Distinctive Capabilities

         The structure of a firm encompasses the people who work for it, the way their work is organized

and compensated, the assets it owns, the nature of ownership and control of the firm, the firm’s

relationship with suppliers and buyers, etc. And when we think about its financing, we refer to the variety

of claims it has issued, the division between inside and outside financing, and the power outside claimants

have over the firm’s operational and strategic decisions, as well as over its cash flows. The firm’s

structure and its financing center around one common problem: how to create net present value – that is,

value net of the opportunity costs of the inputs -- and then how to allocate this back to agents in the

economy in a way that maximizes value creation.4


         An entrepreneur cannot create net present value simply by mimicking others unless she happens

to be extraordinarily lucky or the market extraordinarily uncompetitive– very few of the myriad laundry

shops or small restaurants that open (and close) every day repay anything more than the normal expected

returns for the factors that are employed. To create net present value, the entrepreneur has to go out on a

limb, distinguishing herself from the rest of the herd of potential competitors, and thus potentially earning

sustainable profits (provide the limb is narrow enough, the firm’s capabilities distinctive enough, or its

innovation continuous enough that others cannot follow). Thus, the process of creating positive net

present value invariably implies differentiation – whether in creating new products or product varieties




4
  The firm and its financing structures need not arise only from conscious optimization. They also emerge from
political and social compromises, sometimes resulting from historical happenstance (see, for example, Roy (1997)).
Hysteresis plays an important role in economic development. Institutions developed for one purpose can be used for
another -- the comfort that U.S. investors developed with government war bonds during the First World War may
have eased the way for corporations to issue bonds after the war (Peach (1942)). However, while we should not be
Panglossian in believing that every structure exists because it is efficient, we should not also dismiss the economic
forces that push towards efficient structures.


                                                          5
that nobody else manufactures, in developing production methods that are more efficient than that of the

competition, or in targeting customer populations or needs that have hitherto been overlooked.


         However, the entrepreneur faces a critical challenge. She needs to persuade others to join her in

enterprise-building activities, which is hard if the entrepreneurial venture is a significant departure from

the ordinary, and is therefore both risky as well as uncertain (in the Knightian sense of entailing unknown

unknowns). Clearly, one option would be to contract to buy inputs and hire services in the spot market.

The entrepreneur would then be a contractor who sets up a nexus of contracts (see Alchian and Demsetz

(1972) and Jensen and Meckling (1976)) with other independent contractors – collaborators who have full

independence of actions, as well as full ownership of the critical assets they use, bound only by the need

to make contracted deliveries at the stipulated time. This is typically the way undifferentiated products are

put together. But differentiated products often require producers to acquire special skills that have little

outside market value, place facilities in locations where there are few other uses, and put together

machinery in new ways that make them not just hard to sell but also hard to replace. Independent

contractors may worry about the likely decline in the outside value of their human capital and their assets

if they tie their fates to the venture, even as they also doubt the chances of the proposed venture. When

contracts are incomplete, the entrepreneur will find it hard to ensure through contract alone that

independent contractors coordinate and specialize to the desired extent.


        An example may be useful to fix ideas. It is well known that car manufacturer Henry Ford

perfected progressive assembly or more colloquially, the moving assembly line, whereby men stayed put

and the parts and work flowed wherever they were needed. But Ford also implemented a second

innovation that was key to the success of the first (see, for example, Raff (1995)), the “American-system”

production of parts – that is the production of parts finished to such high tolerances that they were for all

practical purposes interchangeable. With it, the assembly line no longer needed artisans who could rework

poorly finished parts, it could manage with moderately skilled workers. Moreover, the assembly line was

not subject to delays as parts were re-jigged to fit each car. So the high tolerance of parts was essential to

                                                       6
the low cost and high efficiency of the assembly line. But since no other car manufacturer required such

high tolerances, and since Ford in his early years was known for his failures rather than his successes, it

would have been hard for him to persuade suppliers to produce the tolerances he needed.5


         Indeed, it is far more attractive for the skeptical independent contractor to stay closer to the

mainstream and provide a more conventional intermediate product that will have a market if the

entrepreneur fails; the contractor’s downside is protected by the deep market for the conventional

intermediate product; he can obtain scale economies by producing for that larger market; he can also get

more of the surplus generated by the entrepreneur if she is successful, because he retains a credible

outside option. Matters are even worse in the “Prisoner’s Dilemma” situation where no independent

contractor wants to specialize to the business of the entrepreneur if they believe other key contractors will

not specialize.


         Moreover, even when the independent contractor is convinced that the entrepreneur’s venture will

work, he can manoeuver to grab a greater share of the prospective surplus instead of working to enhance

it.6 More generally, if the venture shows initial signs of success, the presence of multiple irreplaceable

independent contractors who will each up their demands as the entrepreneur tries to get them to continue,

will greatly diminish the rewards to entrepreneurship, and potentially reduce the life of the enterprise.7


         In sum, similar to the process emphasized in Williamson (1985,2002), the entrepreneur needs a

first transformation whereby some out of a large number of initially interchangeable people and assets

collaborate, coordinate, and build inter-relationships to create a well-honed organizational structure that

has a small number of mutually specialized and largely irreplaceable people and assets with a common

  There is some debate on what Ford’s key innovations were, and whether in fact they were original to him. See
Baird (2009) for an alternative view.

  For example, he can strengthen his bargaining position (as well as monetize future rents) by issuing significant
amounts of short term debt that he would be unable to repay unless he gets a greater share of the surplus. He can
also strive to expropriate the entrepreneur’s critical resources and set up as competition, with a head start because of
the resources he controls (see Rajan and Zingales (2001)).

  Bolton and Scharfstein (1996) make a similar point in the context of multiple debt holders. See Baird and Casey
(2011) for a discussion of the costs and benefits of allocating property rights in complementary assets to different
creditors.

purpose. However, because of risk as well as uncertainty, it is hard to shape the transformation through ex

ante contracts – not only are the necessary enterprise-building actions difficult to specify contractually in

a complete state-contingent way, myriad enterprise-destroying actions are hard to rule out without more

control over the actions of collaborators.8 So how does the entrepreneur gain enough control to shape the

transformation?


         The key is for the entrepreneur to have employees, who typically have fewer degrees of freedom

than independent contractors. Employees, unlike independent contractors, usually do not own the assets

they work with -- instead, someone else owns the irreplaceable assets that are key to the enterprise. For

now, it will be convenient to assume the entrepreneur owns all assets, but what is essential is that control

over their use be largely delegated to the entrepreneur. The ability to allow (or deny) access to the assets,

both initially and over time, is central to the entrepreneur’s ability to encourage coordination. I now show

this in a simple model before explaining why this implies a role for financing.


            1.1. Differentiation, Enterprise-Building, and Ownership


         Consider a two date economy with risk neutral participants. Let date 0 be today and date 1

represent the future, after uncertainty is revealed. Consider an entrepreneur who has an idea and related

assets (experience, patents, a committed core team, critical pieces of land or natural resources, etc.). For

now, I assume that the idea and the related assets (henceforth, collectively termed the entrepreneur’s idea

to distinguish it from the critical asset I will describe shortly) cannot be appropriated by others when they

are given access to it. I will discuss “ideas” and “assets” in more detail after laying out the basic model.


         Let  be the degree of differentiation chosen by the entrepreneur coming in to date 0, where

  0 and   0 means the entrepreneur chooses to be with the mainstream, which is normalized to 0.

The entrepreneur’s project will be successful with probability p ( ) . After choosing the degree of



8
  The terms “ex ante” and “ex post” in the literature are with respect to the timing of the specific investment or
transforming action.

                                                           8
differentiation, the entrepreneur picks a collaborator from the available set of independent contractors. In

doing so, the entrepreneur essentially decides to share access to her idea with the collaborator, giving him

the ability to coordinate.9 The remaining independent contractors who are not given access have no ability

to coordinate.


        I assume the existence of a critical asset – a machine, a patent, or a piece of property – without

which the project is not feasible. Nothing hinges on who owns the asset up front, though the rationale for

financing, which I discuss later, will stem from the entrepreneur’s need to buy or create it.


        Having chosen the collaborator, the entrepreneur and the collaborator settle who will own the

asset going forward, and any negotiated side payments are made. The collaborator then chooses the

degree of coordination  , the key enterprise-building activity the entrepreneur seeks to foster. I assume

that  is not contractible and intricate incentive contracts to force the optimal  are not possible.10

Coordination may involve building specific human capital (learning specific software and technology,

understanding the firm’s culture, building friendship and trust, developing complementary skills, creating

a bank of favors) or specializing assets (locating plants in the most appropriate places, linking and

calibrating machines to one another, specializing equipment to the main product).


        If the project is successful, it produces an NPV of V ( , ) if the entrepreneur and the

collaborator work together with the asset – I assume the entrepreneur cannot work with anyone else at

that point. If it fails, the NPV produced by the project is zero. The collaborator can go back to being an

independent contractor if he has use of the asset, producing an NPV of v ( ) without the entrepreneur. I

assume (subscripts will denote derivatives):




9
  See Rajan and Zingales (1998, 2001) for an elaboration of how selective access can allow the entrepreneur to
shape firm-specific investment. Access gives those who enjoy it the ability to acquire power conditional on making
the required investment.
10
   See Baker, Gibbons and Murphy (2008) for similar assumptions. For a contrary viewpoint, see Maskin and Tirole
(1999).

                                                        9
Assumption 1


(i)     The greater the differentiation, the lower the probability of project success so p  0 .

(ii)    The expected value of the project first increases then decreases in differentiation so that

          d                                   d
             p( )V ( , )   0 at   0 ,  p( )V ( , )   0 at    , and
         d                                  d

          d2
               p( )V ( , )   0 . The value of the successful project is increasing and concave in
         d 2

        differentiation so V  0, V  0
                                              .

(iii)   The NPV of the successful project is maximized when    .

         V  0 if      ,
         V  0 if      ,
         V  0

(iv)    The expected value of the collaborator’s outside option of working again as an independent

        contractor, v ( ) , decreases with  at an increasing rate so that v  0,   v  0 .

(v)     V and p are small.


The assumptions are straight forward. More differentiation takes the entrepreneur into more unknown

territory and thus reduces the probability of project success, but it can enhance expected NPV over a

range. The collaborator coordinates best when he sets    , however, the higher he sets  , the further

he reduces his outside option of rejoining the mainstream if the project fails. The assumption that the

entrepreneur cannot produce with anyone else once she chooses a collaborator, and that the collaborator’s

outside option falls in value as he coordinates, reflect the first transformation. Finally, plausible

arguments can be made for V or p having either sign, so I assume they are small.


        Given that contracts are incomplete, I have to propose some way surplus is allocated ex post.

Throughout this paper, I will assume surplus is split according to Nash Bargaining with outside options;

                                                      10
Each person gets their outside option plus half the surplus over and above the sum of values of outside

options. None of this is to say that there is actual bargaining when surplus has to be divided. Instead,

recognizing each player’s bargaining power, the system should gravitate towards dividing surplus

automatically according to the prospective equilibrium.


              1.2. First Best


           The first best is to set  and  to maximize the joint surplus pV ( , )  (1  p )v ( ) .11 The first

order conditions are


                                           p V  pV  p v  0                                           (1)

                                            pV  (1  p)v  0                                            (2)


(1) suggests that the first best degree of differentiation  FB will be set higher than  0 , the level that

ensures expected project NPV is maximized. Because the asset can be redeployed if the project fails, the

optimal strategy is to increase differentiation even further, till the marginal reduction in the expected

value of the project equals the marginal gain in the expected value of the redeployment option. In a sense,

the surplus from redeployment is a form of insurance if the project fails, and its availability enhances the

optimal amount of differentiation (effectively risk taking). The first best degree of coordination,  FB , as

(2) indicates, sets the marginal expected increase in project value equal to the marginal expected loss in

the redeployment option. Thus  FB   FB , implying that even in the first best, the collaborator should not

coordinate fully with the entrepreneur.12




11
  Rather than assume V ( , 0)  v (0) , which would ensure V ( , )  v ( )     , it is sufficient that the latter
inequality holds for the values of  we are interested in.
12
     V is increasing and concave in  for    , and V  0 when    , hence (2) implies  FB   FB

         Now consider what happens when the collaborator owns the key asset and therefore works as an

independent contractor for the entrepreneur. As in the Property Rights view, the owner of the asset

decides how an asset will be used. If the project succeeds, the collaborator will get his redeployment

                                                  V v V v                         V v
option plus half the surplus , which equals v             . The entrepreneur gets      . If the

project fails, the collaborator will simply redeploy the asset and get v . So he maximizes

  2 

and because v  0 , it follows that the level of coordination if the collaborator owns the asset,  CO , is

less than first best,  FB . Intuitively, the collaborator benefits from owning the asset and having the option

to redeploy it outside the relationship with the entrepreneur, both because it increases his bargaining

power over the surplus if the project succeeds, and because it cushions him if the project fails. As a result,

he is reluctant to jeopardize the value of his redeployment option, and undersupplies coordination relative

to the first best.


         Totally differentiating the first order condition, and using Assumption 1 that V is small, I get


                            
                     d    

Intuitively, the higher the entrepreneur sets the degree of differentiation, the lower the probability of

project success, and lower the value to the collaborator of coordinating instead of maintaining the value of

his redeployment option.

From (3), we can see the right hand side of (4) is positive. Comparing with (1), it is immediate that under

collaborator ownership, the entrepreneur chooses a level of differentiation,  CO , that is less than the first

best. Intuitively, the entrepreneur does not see the “insurance” from redeployment if the project fails,

which accrues entirely to the collaborator when the collaborator owns the asset. Moreover, the

collaborator will reduce his level of coordination as the entrepreneur differentiates more. For both these

reasons, the entrepreneur will differentiate less than the first best. We have


Proposition 1: Under collaborator ownership, the entrepreneur sets the degree of differentiation less

than the first best, and the collaborator coordinates less than the first best.


        By settling on a potential collaborator and giving them access, the entrepreneur exposes herself to

the collaborator’s future non-contractible actions. Knowing that he has a right to the joint surplus, the

collaborator focuses to a greater extent than he should on extracting a share of that surplus, rather than

enhancing it. Asset ownership expands his outside options, and the incentive to nurture these diverts him

from enterprise building activities.

             1.4. Coordination and Differentiation if the Entrepreneur Owns the Critical Assets


         If the entrepreneur owns the asset, she and the collaborator will share the surplus equally if the

project is successful, because the collaborator does not have a credible threat to exercise his redeployment

option. If the project fails, both the entrepreneur (who owns) and the collaborator (who is needed to

operate the asset when it is redeployed) are essential to redeployment. As a result, they share the surplus

from redeployment equally – the entrepreneur now obtains a stake in redeployment, which realigns her

                                                                                             p    (1  p )
incentives also. Thus, both the entrepreneur and the collaborator maximize                     V          v , which is half
                                                                                             2       2

the overall expected surplus. The collaborator’s first order condition in setting coordination is just the first

best condition (2). The entrepreneur sets differentiation so that

 d p     (1  p)  d  p     (1  p)  d
      V        v      V        v .   0 . The second term is zero because its first part is
d  2       2     d  2       2     d

simply the collaborator’s first order condition. So the entrepreneur’s first order condition also reduces to

the first best condition (1). We have


Proposition 2: Under entrepreneur ownership, the entrepreneur sets the level of differentiation at the first

best level and the collaborator also sets the level of coordination at the first best level.


Example: Let p ( )  0.8e 0.8 , v( )  5  1.5e0.05 ,

V  ,   1  e  (  0.8 )  4 1  e  (1 0.8)   1  1.5e   2 .We then have

 FB  1.72,  FB  1.06, V FB  4.17  v FB  3.42
and  CO  1.43,  CO  0.27, V CO  3.67  vCO  3.47


Both differentiation and coordination are lower under collaborator ownership. It is easily checked that

taking probabilities into account, entrepreneur ownership is better than collaborator ownership.




                                                                14
            1.5. Discussion


         An entrepreneur who sets up a laundry shop or a run-of-the-mill restaurant generates very little

surplus over the cost of factors employed. The high rate of failure of such enterprises is not because the

entrepreneur ventures into the unknown but because their profit margins are so thin. There is little need

for enforcing coordination in such enterprises because their activities are not distinctive and the enterprise

could well be described as nexus of contracts.


     The entrepreneur I focus on is instead the heroic leader found in Schumpeter (1911) and Knight

(1921), who “incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the

old one, incessantly creating a new one.”13 She must be willing to strike out, largely on the basis of

intuition, on courses of action in direct opposition to the established settled patterns, she must have “the

drive and the will to found a private kingdom”, the desire to create new things even at the expense of

destroying old patterns of thought and action.14 Such an entrepreneur should own the critical asset so as to

enhance differentiation, coordination, and project value. Implicit in this is the assessment that the

entrepreneur will choose the right direction, and is committed to it – that she will lead well.15 This is

precisely the assessment that collaborators and the financier make ex ante.


     Entrepreneur ownership does not just curtail the collaborator’s outside options (see also Rajan and

Zingales (1998), Holmstrom (1999), or Van den Steen (2010)), it also gives the entrepreneur more of a

stake in her collaborators’ redeployment possibilities (rather than in the project alone). While the model is

specialized and the result that the first best is achieved under entrepreneur ownership is sensitive to

bargaining assumptions, the broader point is that when the entrepreneur does not own, she may have too

little concern for the outside options of her collaborators while single-mindedly focused on the project. At

the same time, independent collaborators may be focused too much on their outside options. Ownership

by the entrepreneur shifts everyone’s incentives in the right way, allowing her to focus on creating the

next Google rather than limiting her aspirations to a laundry shop.


            1.6. The Nature of Assets and Ideas


      Let me now discuss the implicit assumptions I have made about the nature of assets that the

collaborator works with. First, the asset is capable of being owned, and if the asset is not already

possessed or owned by the entrepreneur, ownership can be transferred. So it is not a human capital asset

possessed by the collaborator such as management capabilities or industry experience. Second, the asset is

critical in that without it, neither the project nor the redeployment option generate value. Third, the asset

is hard to replicate.


      The collaborator’s asset may be hard for him to replicate simply because he is specialized to it – for

example, a favored tool or instrument. More generally, though, an asset may be hard to replicate because

it occupies a strategic location (a port in recent times, or a fort in ancient times). It may enjoy property

right protection, as with a brand name or a trade mark, or equivalently, regulatory protection as with a

license or barriers on further entry. Some assets may enjoy multiple characteristics – a cluster of patents

situated strategically may make it hard for competitors to innovate around them. An asset may be hard to

replicate because doing so takes time, and by the time the competition has succeeded, the frontier could

have moved. Assets may also have the characteristics of a natural monopoly with large up-front fixed

costs, so that competitors will hesitate replicating the asset for fear of the ruinous competition that would

subsequently ensue.


      Turning next to the entrepreneur’s “idea”, it could consist similarly of hard-to-replicate assets. But

because the entrepreneur is committed to the project and has no need to sell her idea, it could also consist

of personal assets like experience, a devoted team, industry relationships, management capabilities, trade

secrets, and plain charisma.




                                                      16
            1.7. Ownership, Ex Ante Access, and Appropriability.


     If financing is limited and there are many critical collaborator assets, what assets should the

entrepreneur own? The model suggests that, ceteris paribus, a collaborator’s incentives to coordinate are

most reduced by ownership when v (which is negative) is large in magnitude. The entrepreneur’s

incentive to differentiate is also reduced by more when v is large in magnitude. Thus assets whose use

value outside the relationship fall most with coordination ought to be owned by the entrepreneur.16

Clearly, ownership of assets that are neither hard to replace nor critical to the firm’s activities will not

help the entrepreneur control her collaborators’ outside options. Such assets should not be owned by the

entrepreneur.


     In the model, I have ignored the possibility that asset ownership offers the entrepreneur additional

tools to limit the collaborator’s freedom ex ante and foster coordination. In practice, when the assets are

on the entrepreneur’s premises, she also has a greater ability to direct the efforts of her collaborator,

which is an additional advantage of ownership. Essentially, the collaborator would be subject to an

employment agreement that specifies the employee will obey reasonable commands, in return for

reasonable pay and working conditions – in a sense, the entrepreneur obtains the residual control rights

associated with having an employee.17 By requiring regular attendance at the workplace, the entrepreneur

could effectively rule out frequent contact between the collaborator and the competition, which would be

essential for the collaborator to preserve his outside options. The entrepreneur can also prohibit certain

activities by the chosen collaborator, such as practicing old skills, or taking on debt (that could serve as a

mechanism to extract rents from the entrepreneur). Conversely, an independent contractor would only be

16
   A full treatment of optimal ownership when there are multiple collaborators and assets would, of course, require a
constrained maximization problem.
17
   By the “residual rights of ownership”, Grossman and Hart (1986) refer to rights conferred by ownership that
cannot be, or are not habitually determined by, explicit contracts. In a similar vein, Masten (1988, p187) argues, “In
addition to obedience, an employer has the right to expect loyalty, respect, and faithfulness from his employees and
that each will "conduct himself with such decency and propriety of deportment as not to work injury to the business
of his employer." There is a legal basis for the employment relationship that makes it different from a contractual
relationship with an independent contractor, and the employment relationship offers both sides some rights that
could be termed “residual” in the Grossman and Hart (1986) terminology.

                                                         17
responsible for the final output, could keep the entrepreneur off his premises, and have greater freedom to

maintain outside options or choose financial structure.


     All this presumes that the entrepreneur’s idea (and related assets) cannot be appropriated by the

collaborator ex post. If the collaborator could expropriate the entrepreneur after getting access to her idea,

the entrepreneur has the problem of retaining a share of the surplus in addition to incentivizing

coordination. This would suggest an additional reason for entrepreneur ownership than in the model we

have studied so far: By owning the irreplaceable collaborator assets, the entrepreneur prevents the

collaborator from expropriating her ex post. For instance, by owning iTunes music purchase and

management software, a key complementary asset to the iPod player, Apple ensures that competitors

cannot match it simply by replicating the hardware. Ownership by the entrepreneur of key irreplaceable

assets is thus not just a way to foster coordination but also to protect the entrepreneur’s idea ex post (see

Teece (1986), Pisano and Teece (2007)) and ensure continuity of the enterprise.


            1.8. Discussion: Enterprise Building, Ownership and the Firm’s Boundaries


     There is, obviously, a long history of viewing the firm as a governance structure that exercises fiat to

control misbehavior instead of eliciting cooperation through contract.18 My view of the entrepreneurial

firm is one where the entrepreneur limits employee freedoms through the power she gets from ownership

in order to lead a cohesive enterprise. There is a parallel to theories of government here: Much as the

government has a monopoly over violence so as to ensure civil order, the entrepreneur has a monopoly

over ownership so as to coordinate organizational movement in the chosen direction.


      Theories of firm boundaries start, of course, with Coase (1937), who argues that a firm’s boundaries

are located where the costs of doing transactions within a firm exceed the costs of doing them in the

market (see Gibbons (2005) or Holmstrom and Roberts (1998) for excellent surveys). Transaction costs

18
   Coase (1937) cites D.H. Robertson in Control of Industry (p85) describing firms as “islands of conscious power in
this ocean of unconscious co-operation like lumps of butter coagulating in a pail of buttermilk”. Williamson
(1985,2002) focuses on the firm as a governance system, while Grossman and Hart (1986) see owners as having the
right to exercise the “residual” control rights associated with ownership.

                                                        18
economics, which owes much to the work of Williamson (1975, 1985, 2002), takes this insight much

further. Williamson (2002, p 174) argues that “if human actors are not only confronted with needs to

adapt to the unforeseen (by reason of bounded rationality), but are also given to strategic behavior (by

reason of opportunism), then costly contractual breakdowns (refusal of cooperation, maladaptation,

demands for renegotiation) may be posed. In that event…efforts to devise supportive governance

structures, thereby to mitigate contractual impasse and breakdowns, have merit.” Thus Williamson, as

also Klein et al. (1978), emphasize ex post haggling costs over the quasi-rents created when parties are

tied through specific investments. Ownership allows the owner to settle disputes by fiat, reducing

haggling costs.


    My basic model does not have ex post “haggling” costs, but I can incorporate them as outlined earlier.

If the entrepreneur’s idea can be expropriated in the future by the collaborator, ownership of other critical

complementary assets by the entrepreneur can prevent the collaborator from running away with the idea

on his own (thus obviating the need for costly security measures such as restricting collaborator access–

the equivalent of “haggling costs” in my model). Moreover, because the collaborator anticipates he will

not be successful in expropriating the entrepreneur when the entrepreneur owns, he has incentives to

undertake enterprise-building activities that complement the entrepreneur’s skills (instead of undertaking

activities that attempt to substitute for them). The key difference in my model is, however, the focus on ex

ante incentives for coordination rather than ex-post opportunism.


    My work is closer in many ways to the Property Rights View of Grossman and Hart (1986) and Hart

and Moore (1990), henceforth GHM. Ownership for GHM consists of a bundle of revenue and control

rights, including rights that are hard to contract that they term the “residual rights of control”. Ownership

attaches the assets to the owner, and can be useful in enhancing the owner’s incentive to invest.

Specifically, when the required ex ante investment by the owner is in her human capital and is asset

specific (e.g., learning to use a particular machine), it is plausible to think that an increase in investment

increases the value of both the owner’s contribution to the enterprise and her value with the asset in

                                                      19
alternative ventures. The owner’s threat to use her asset in alternative ventures when bargaining over ex

post surplus then enhances her share of the surplus. Because her threat point is directly increased by her

ex ante investment, ownership enhances her ex ante incentive to invest. As Holmstrom (1999) argues,

ownership is a way of bringing in market incentives embedded in the increase in asset values resulting

from investment to reinforce any pre-existing investment incentives.


     Unlike Transactions Costs Economics, the Property Rights view assumes ex post efficiency. Thus the

owner never actually exercises her right to use the asset differently; it is just a bargaining ploy. My paper

relies heavily on the special nature of ownership suggested by the Property Rights view – that ownership

bundles a variety of rights, many of which are hard to contract. However, I depart from it when

considering the channel through which ownership “works”. In GHM, ownership goes to the agent whose

ex ante incentives to invest are most enhanced by the surplus he can extract by threatening to use the

greater outside options available with ownership. In contrast, ownership in my model works by closing

down the outside options of all except the entrepreneur, who is the only one trusted to lead. By owning

the key assets, the entrepreneur in my model actually takes the enterprise in the direction she chooses,

while having greater assurance that the collaborator will follow. It is precisely by eliminating the market

options of the collaborator that ownership “works” in my framework.


        Put differently, I argue that the more important, and also necessarily more specific, activity in

new ventures is not asset-specific investment but enterprise-specific activities like learning to coordinate

with other people and other machines, which make the agent an integral part of a team.19 This

coordination tends to be irreversible in part, which is why it reduces the value of the owner’s outside

options. The freedom provided by ownership detracts from, rather than enhances, enterprise building

activities (see Rajan and Zingales (1998) for an early exposition of the detrimental effects of ownership).

This is why common ownership by one who can be entrusted to set the enterprise’s direction and stay the


19
  The importance of coordination in an enterprise is also explored elsewhere, with recent examples including Baird
(2010), Baker, Gibbons, and Murphy (2008), Dessin and Santos (2006) and Hart and Holmstrom (2010).

                                                        20
course is typically more efficient (unlike in Grossman and Hart, the entrepreneur in my model does not

have a credible threat to use the asset in alternative ways – she is wedded to the project unless it fails),

and significant ownership by those who could prefer to exercise outside options is not. Indeed, because

ownership is not primarily about the owner’s investment incentives but about her control over firm

direction, ownership by unrelated third parties who delegate control to the entrepreneur can improve upon

ownership by the collaborator. This is unlike in Hart and Moore (1990) where ownership by unrelated

third parties is a waste of the incentives embedded in ownership.20


            1.9. Enterprise Direction, Indivisibility and Continuity


     The firm is a separate legal personality defined and protected by law. Therefore, if there are (un-

modeled) benefits to legal boundaries, the Property Rights view would suggest firms could well be

associations of different independent contractors, each owning the assets they work with. In other words,

the legal boundary of the firm would be drawn around assets with different ownership, with ownership

allocated to maximize investment incentives, and the boundary drawn to minimize other transaction costs.

Assets would be owned together only to the extent that they are worthless in enhancing investment

incentives when owned separately (see Hart and Moore (1990)). But as Holmstrom (1999) argues,

nothing else in the Property Rights theory requires the legal boundary of the firm to be drawn around

commonly owned assets (other than tautologically).


     Yet the legal concept of a firm emphasizes keeping assets together under common ownership for a

long duration, and most firms (as distinct from loosely coupled co-operatives) have this structure. A

separate indivisible legal personality for the corporation ensures it has a life of its own, and does not have

to be broken up (and reconstituted) if any of its owners or employees die or leave. Divisions within the

firm cannot depart at will and have no separate legal identity or standing. Furthermore, entity shielding

20
   The point that the incentives provided by ownership can detract from enterprise-building parallels the multi-
tasking literature (see Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991, 1994)). However, instead of primarily giving the collaborator
higher powered incentives to undertake some actions that cause him to neglect other poorly-measured ones,
ownership in my model enables him to go in directions the firm wants to discourage.


                                                       21
(see Hansmann, Kraakman, and Squire (2006)) ensures that the personal creditors of owners or

employees, or minority owners, cannot lay claim to the corporation’s assets – the assets are held together

in the firm, and will be sold only if the firm’s owners collectively vote to do so, or if the firm defaults on

its debts and its creditors seize assets. A number of legal scholars (for example, Blair (2003), Guinane,

Harris, Lamoreaux, and Rosenthal (2007), or Hansmann, Kraakman, and Squire (2006)) see the separate

indivisible legal personality of the firm and the “entity shielding” permitted by law as key features of the

modern corporation.


     My model offers support for these views. Common ownership implies common authority and control

– the entrepreneur can set direction and the employees have an incentive to coordinate.21 The enterprise

survives regardless of the entrepreneur’s own continued association with the firm or that of any of her

collaborators (in contrast to, say, a partnership which could be dissolved when any partner wants to quit).

The indefinite life of the enterprise promotes ex ante enterprise-building actions (who would give up

outside options if they knew the enterprise would be dependent on the financial and physical health of

each of the contracting parties) while dis-incentivizing costly ex ante jockeying for position and other

fissiparous tendencies that would emerge if players saw a chance of the enterprise’s demise. Entity

shielding ensures that none of the collaborators can jeopardize the enterprise through injudicious personal

borrowing so, once again, other collaborators can focus on enterprise-building rather than preserving

outside options.


        Finally, as the entrepreneur fosters enterprise-building activities, the effectiveness of the

enterprise as well as her authority grows – it is no longer just the assets she owns that give her power but

also the new direction she gives through differentiation, the employees tethered to that direction because

of their coordination, and the employees tethered to those employees... The firm, as Rajan and Zingales




21
   Holmstrom (1999) argues that common ownership allows the firm to better tailor incentives. I would modify this
slightly to say that common ownership itself is the primary source of the improved incentive.

(2001) argue, has a time dimension, a history that makes it more effective than strangers coming together

via contract.


            1.10. Debt Finance and Financing Frenzies


    In order for the entrepreneur to buy the asset from the collaborator (or from outsiders) she will need

financing if she is not independently wealthy. Even if the capital requirements needed for innovation are

not high (products like new search engines or social networking sites do not need much capital at the

innovation stage), finance is necessary for the entrepreneur to create the organization that will roll out the

innovation. I now turn to how the enterprise should be financed and the additional issues that financing

raises.


    Before exploring the difficulties in financing in the next section, let us start by assuming financing is

easily available. Consider first (again a stripped down version of) risky debt finance, and its effect on

incentives. Assume debt is promised a fixed amount D sufficient for the lender to break even, and the

creditors’ bargaining power conditional on project success is high enough that the payment can be

enforced (I will revisit this assumption shortly). Creditors acquire ownership of the assets if the project

fails (that is, the required face value of payment on debt D is higher than the value of the redeployment

option v ). In this case, creditors will take over the assets and split the redeployment surplus with the

                                                         p
collaborator. The entrepreneur therefore maximizes         (V  D ) while the collaborator maximizes
                                                         2

p            (1  p )
  (V  D )           v . Note that the collaborator’s first order condition is still (2), so if he sees the
2               2

entrepreneur set the degree of differentiation at the first best level, the collaborator will set the level of

coordination at the first best level also.

incentive of the entrepreneur to differentiate the project – this is akin to standard risk shifting incentives

in finance where the entrepreneur gets the upside if the project succeeds while debt bears the downside if

it fails. However, the entrepreneur’s incentive to differentiate is also muted because the collaborator

reduces coordination as the entrepreneur increases differentiation. By inspection and comparison to (1),

                                             p     d
there is a face value of debt D FB (  v       V    , with all values calculated at    FB and    FB )
                                             p    d

such that the first best is achieved if D  D FB . However, there is no reason to believe that the face value

that would allow a creditor to break even would be precisely at this level, and in general, financing will

introduce distortions in differentiation (and hence coordination).


        Distortions notwithstanding, the above discussion points to an important effect of external debt

finance. Because the creditor takes the critical asset away from the entrepreneur in case the project fails

and shares the surplus from its redeployment with the collaborator, he limits the extent to which the

collaborator coordinates (and hence the extent to which the entrepreneur differentiates). Now consider a

financial frenzy where a disproportionate number of overoptimistic entrepreneurs, who think the

probability of success is high and who do not recognize failure even if it stares them in the face, are

financed (alternatively, entrepreneurs want to hide failure so as to avoid stigma). In the midst of the

frenzy, financiers also think the probability of success is high – they forecast p close to 1 and unaffected

by  . So they accept “pay-in-kind” bonds and “lite” covenants up front, implying they cannot effect a

change in control or redeployment when they see the project fail.


        Given that the financier cannot force the continuation-minded entrepreneur to ever redeploy

assets, a rational collaborator has the incentive to set    . Knowing that the collaborator will not hold


                                                       24
back on setting  , the entrepreneur has an incentive to differentiate more. This means that even though

the high  makes the true probability of success small, if it succeeds the project could be a spectacular

innovation, both because it is so differentiated, and because collaborators coordinate so well.


         In other words, financial frenzies typically lead to spectacular crashes, in part because the extent

of project differentiation, and hence riskiness, is endogenously high. The lack of financial controls and the

low likelihood of redeployment incentivizes collaborators to coordinate in a single minded way, and

removes any constraints on the differentiation entrepreneurs choose. However, the few projects that are

successful could be extraordinarily valuable precisely because they are so innovative as well as

coordinated. Crashes and disruptive product innovation may have common roots – in optimism and

excessively lax finance (see Perez (2002) for a discussion of the links between technological revolutions

and financial crashes).22


         In drawing out the above point, I have assumed that creditors are willing to finance the enterprise

– I assumed away the financing problem. But given the enterprise has been differentiated, this will not be

the norm. The very uniqueness of the enterprise and its assets could make it hard for the financier to

obtain repayment. I now turn to examining this is more detail.


                             II.      Financing the Innovative Enterprise

         The difficulty in starting an innovative differentiated organization has as much to do with the

availability of financing as it has to do with willing collaborators. The entrepreneur needs financing to

assemble the critical assets the enterprise needs, with the problem being particularly acute if the scale at

which she needs to start is large. But the financier needs to be assured of an adequate return.




22
  Pastor and Veronesi (2006) suggest an alternative rational explanation for the link between projects with high
uncertainty about growth (the differentiated project in my model) and high ex ante stock prices. Essentially, the
Gordon valuation model suggests that firm value is convex in growth, so expected firm value increases in
uncertainty about growth. Of course, if the low growth scenario is realized, the stock price crashes.

                                                         25
           2.1. Liquidation Values


        Even if the differentiated enterprise succeeds, the entrepreneur and the employees will

appropriate much of the going concern value because their irreplaceable human capital gives them

bargaining power. The debt contract described earlier, whereby the creditor can lay claim to the firm’s

assets in case it does not make contracted payments, gives the creditor the ability to force repayment if the

redeployment value of the assets or the break-up value is high. But this will typically not be the case in

the differentiated firm; Critical irreplaceable assets will either be intrinsically special or will have been

specialized during the first transformation (for example, by moving them to a remote area or by altering

them to better coordinate with other firm assets), which reduces alternative uses. This is why I have

assumed that the more the collaborator coordinates, the lower the value of the redeployment option.

Moreover, the financier has to share some of the redeployment surplus with the collaborator, diminishing

his own recovery in redeployment.


        In some industries (which use general purpose machinery, buildings, or untransformed real

estate), certain assets may retain substantial break-up value despite the first transformation. But such

assets are unlikely to be the source of the entrepreneur’s power because they are unlikely to be

irreplaceable. Irreplaceable assets such as patents and brands may not find as good a use or user on sale,

and may therefore fetch only fire sale prices. Also, certain past investments, such as those in employee

training or in building organizational capital, will intrinsically have little realizable break-up value.


        When liquidation values (the higher of redeployment or break-up values) are low, the

entrepreneur has two options, neither particularly attractive, for obtaining outside debt finance. First, she

could “harden” debt claims by making them shorter term and dispersing them amongst many

claimholders (see Berglof and Von Thadden (1994), Bolton and Scharfstein (1996), Calomiris and Kahn

(1991), Diamond and Rajan (2001)). The threat of a destructive run coupled with the difficulty of

renegotiating with dispersed claimants would give her the incentive to repay whenever she can. She



                                                       26
would not default “strategically” for fear of getting tied up in costly bargaining, or losing the irreplaceable

assets because of inefficiencies in bargaining, and becoming unable to produce any output. The

anticipation of ex post inefficient debt renegotiation can thus allow her to credibly promise more than the

(low) liquidation value of assets. To the extent, however, that she genuinely does not have the ability to

pay, such a financing structure is unforgiving, and would lead to excessive liquidation. Moreover, to the

extent that there is substantial noise about the true prospects of a firm that is trying innovative strategies,

misinformed destructive runs on the firm could occur with high probability.


        A second option is for the entrepreneur to differentiate less. By choosing this route, the

entrepreneur reduces the risk for the financier – not only will the project succeed with higher probability,

but the financier’s ability to extract more of the admittedly lower surplus if the project succeeds will be

higher, as will be his ability to recover value from liquidating assets if the project fails. The difficulty with

this option is, first, that the expected surplus is much diminished and, second, that the entrepreneur has

strong incentives, having obtained the financing, to push for a riskier strategy of greater differentiation,

which has the added advantage of specializing assets and reducing the financier’s ability to collect. Unless

the financier has a very good ability to monitor and prevent such actions, he is unlikely to want to finance.


           2.2. Appropriating Going Concern Value


         So how then can the entrepreneur obtain financing that will permit her to innovate to the extent

she desires? Given that the first transformation increases the firm’s going-concern value while reducing

alternative use values, the challenge is to increase the power of outside financiers over going-concern

surplus. Instead of relying on the liquidation value of assets, the financier should improve his threat of

replacing the firm’s human capital by making it more “liquid”, that is, replaceable, especially at the top of

the hierarchy where key decisions and surplus gravitate.


        After undergoing the first transformation of differentiation, the firm must therefore undergo a

second transformation – standardization -- that gives the financier more effective rights over going-


                                                       27
concern surplus.23 The tension between generating NPV, which requires innovation and differentiation of

the firm’s assets and human capital, and offering financiers credible repayment, which requires reducing

the extent to which the firm’s employees are irreplaceable, has to be lowered by bringing every task done

by the enterprise closer to the mainstream (while ensuring that the tasks, taken together, produce the

differentiated product). Finance requires successful start-ups to grow up and standardize what they do

well, and the entrepreneur has an incentive to make this happen precisely because the firm will be run by

others over time. I now propose a simple model describing standardization. It could be appended to the

previous model at the cost of obscuring the simple mechanisms at work, so I present it as a stand-alone

model.


            2.3. Standardization and Outside Control


         Consider a two period three date world. Assume the entrepreneur has created the coordinated

enterprise I described in the last section. She has an employee (who could be the collaborator and stands

in for all collaborators and employees). At date 0, the entrepreneur picks the degree           to which she

standardizes the enterprise, where   1 .


         For instance, an entrepreneur who has been handling product development, marketing, personnel,

and finance in the early stages of the firm might hive the activities off into four separate functions, each of

which could be more easily managed by professionals recruited from outside. She might restructure the

enterprise to create organizational sub-units that resemble sub-units elsewhere in the industry. She might

formalize implicit agreements between employees and herself by putting in place a human resource




23
   An early attempt at formalizing this is in Myers, Rajan, and Zingales (2005). An alternative to making the human
capital replaceable by an outsider or subordinate is to have redundant insiders (see Stole and Zwiebol (1996)). This
is arguably easier at lower levels in the hierarchy, where redundant workers are less costly, and no single worker
feels directly threatened by the presence of redundant workers. Not only is a redundant CEO extremely costly for a
firm to carry, it is unlikely that she would stay in the shadow and not interfere in management decisions. In turn, the
incumbent could engage in costly influence activities. Rather than ensuring redundancy at every level, it may make
more sense to make internal replacement possible through promotion. This is what I examine.

                                                          28
department.24 She might introduce strategic planning and management information systems so that the

information a CEO needs to make decisions is easily available. She might put in place rules for capital

budgeting and procurement so that there is some discipline on employee spending without every decision

being elevated to her. Finally, she might secure patents for innovations that were protected only by being

kept secret by her. Standardization therefore reduces the idiosyncratic and personalized aspects of the

entrepreneur’s role, allowing her job to resemble that of a typical CEO, and making it easier for an

employee or outsider to replace her as CEO. It also implies greater control over, and routinization of,

work down the hierarchy. Of course, this could result in an (unmodeled) loss of organizational flexibility,

which I discuss later.


        After the entrepreneur sets the degree of standardization at date 0, the employee exercises effort

 in learning by doing (or innovation) at a personal cost  . At the end of the period, the entrepreneur can

produce V (  ) along with the employee and the firm’s assets at date 1, with V  0 . Before production,
           E                                                                    E




the entrepreneur can be replaced by the employee, who can generate  V
                                                                              E
                                                                                  with the assets at date 1. Thus

more standardization increases the amount the employee can produce if he replaces the entrepreneur,

while more learning by doing increases the amount each can produce.


        The entrepreneur becomes old and retires after date 1 (if she is not replaced earlier).

Standardization increases external replaceability even as it increases internal replaceability; The

probability that an outside CEO comes in to lead the firm in period 2 is q   ,   , while the probability

the current employee will succeed the entrepreneur is (1  q ) , where q  0 and q  0 ; greater

standardization increases the probability of being able to find an outside CEO to replace the entrepreneur,

while more learning effort by the current employee reduces the probability that the succession will be

external. Finally, greater standardization increases the importance of the employee’s effort for his chance

of succeeding the entrepreneur as CEO, so q  0 .


        Regardless of whether the next CEO is internal or external, he can produce V C at date 2 with the

enterprise’s assets, and he can be replaced by an (un-modeled) future employee who can generate  V C .

Everyone is risk neutral, the common discount rate for date-2 revenues is (1  r ) , and I assume well-

behaved functions so that the maximization problem is well defined: q  0,           q  0, VE  0 .


            2.4. Financing The Going Concern Value


      I assume the entrepreneur raised financing before date 0 from a venture capitalist to undertake the

initial asset purchases described earlier. The venture capitalist is essentially a large investor who can push

to improve the value of his claims. I will assume that the financing instrument issued is equity (I will

discuss why later), which is an instrument with perpetual life, where each share has identical cash flow

and voting rights, and where the controlling equity interest (or a board that works on behalf of dispersed

equity) has the right at any time to replace the firm’s incumbent CEO (in the first period, this is the

entrepreneur). So the CEO serves at the pleasure of the controlling equity. I assume the entrepreneur is

left with share  of the equity of the firm after financing, and the venture capitalist’s share (1   ) gives

him a controlling interest.


        The controlling interest bargains (implicitly or explicitly) with the CEO over the surplus

generated at the end of the each period. He can threaten to fire the incumbent before production and

replace her with an insider – that constitutes controlling equity’s outside option. Following Nash


bargaining, the entrepreneur/CEO gets
                                           V   V  while outside equity gets V   V  .25 Each period, the
                                               2                                       2



25
  This follows the formulation in Diamond and Rajan (2000). Controlling equity is assumed to be able to extract all
the surplus from any replacement CEO. This can be plausibly modified without a qualitative change in the results.

                                                        30
current employee gets a normalized wage of zero – I want to focus on the long term returns to effort and

learning, where the rewards to employees consists of promotion and rents over a career in the firm, which

dwarf short term annual compensation.


         At the end of the first period, after surplus is produced and the entrepreneur replaced, the firm is

taken public, and the entrepreneur and the venture capitalist sell their stake in the initial public offering.

Outside equity is now represented by a board or a controlling interest that will bargain (implicitly or

explicitly) with the new CEO over the surplus. At date 2 the surplus produced is shared according to prior

agreement.


The time line is


Date 0                                                             Date 1                                            Date 2

             2.5. Solving the Model: Effort Choice and Standardization


         The first best is for the employee to exert effort such that V  1 . The level of standardization
                                                                        E




only affects transfers between insiders and outside claimants, and has no direct effect on output. However,

the employee is rewarded for his learning effort only indirectly, through the prospect of future promotion

possibilities, and a future share of the surplus. By affecting both the employee’s promotion prospects and

his share of surplus, standardization does affect output. I now show this.




All that is important is that standardization increases the threat of replacing the incumbent CEO. Implicit in the
formulation of the problem is that no one can make multi-period commitments.

                                                          31
                                                                    V C 1   
        In choosing effort, the employee maximizes (1  q ( ,  ))                , where the first term is
                                                                     2(1  r )2

his expected direct claim on the surplus as CEO at the end of the second period, and the second term is

his cost of effort. His first order condition is qV 1     2(1  r ) . Totally differentiating w.r.t. 
                                                     C                    2




and rearranging, I get


                                         d  q  q (1   )
                                                                                                        (5)
                                         d    q (1   )
The denominator in (5) is positive. So the effect of the change in standardization on the employee’s effort

depends on the numerator. The first term there is negative; more standardization directly reduces the

future CEO’s expected surplus (more is extracted by outside equity), and thus reduces the employee’s

incentive to exert effort to attain that position. The second term is positive reflecting the fact that greater

standardization increases competition for the top position and makes the role of effort in increasing the

employee’s chances of succession more important. The net effect of greater standardization on employee

effort depends on whether the adverse incentive effect of lower future surplus outweighs the positive

competitive effect.


        Turn finally to the entrepreneur’s first order condition. In choosing  , the entrepreneur

             V E (  ) 1        V E (  ) 1    V C 1    
maximizes                                                         . The first term is her direct share of the
                     2                      2           2(1  r ) 

surplus generated under her tenure, while the second term is the present discounted value of her equity

stake. Clearly, the entrepreneur’s incentive to standardize departs from those of the venture capitalist

because of the presence of the first term, that is, the entrepreneur’s direct share of the surplus. Note also

that the entrepreneur does not really care about who succeeds but does very much care that her employee

is motivated by his future prospects to exert effort today, because greater effort enhances today’s surplus.




                                                         32
          Differentiating w.r.t.  , I get the entrepreneur’s first order condition to be

                   VC                                  d
V E   (V E             )  (1     (1   ))VE     0 . The first term is the reduction in her personal
                  (1  r )                             d

share of the surplus as she becomes more replaceable. Of course, this surplus goes to equity, and there is

an immediate offsetting increase in value of her own share of equity holdings, though only by  of what

she loses. In addition, the enhanced control right from standardization allows equity to extract greater

surplus in the future also, from future CEOs. This gives the entrepreneur an additional incentive to

standardize today (unlike in models where the entrepreneur is infinitely lived and this incentive absent).

Finally, standardization may enhance or reduce the employee’s incentive to exert effort (depending on

surplus from date 1 production that flows back to the entrepreneur directly, and via equity. Note that the

entrepreneur may set a positive level of standardization even if she owns no equity, so as to provide more

ex post competition for her employee in the succession battle, and thus spur more current effort.

Proposition 3:


The entrepreneur will set a lower level of standardization,  , than the venture capitalist would desire her

to. The higher the entrepreneur’s equity stake,  , the greater the degree of standardization the

entrepreneur will set.

Proof: See appendix.


        The entrepreneur standardizes to a lesser extent than desired by the venture capitalist because she

loses personal rents doing so. Clearly, the venture capitalist has to leave the entrepreneur enough of a

stake, not just for her to have the incentive to bring the project to fruition, but also for her to forego

personal rents and standardize the firm in order to make it amenable to outside control. That the

entrepreneur plans to turn over managerial control is necessary for standardization to occur – it is the

prospect of capturing rents from future CEOs, which will be reflected in the elevated price of her shares at

the IPO, that makes her forego her own direct rents today.


            2.6. VC Financing and Optimal Equity Holding


        The venture capitalist is willing to finance the entrepreneur in the early stages of the enterprise if

he knows that the entrepreneur has sufficent incentive to standardize later on, and if the expected market

value of the venture capitalist’s equity claim compensates for the risk he takes up front in financing the

venture. Consider now an example.


                                                                      1  
        Let V E (  )  K     where 0    1 , and q(  ,  )          e where 0    1 . Let K=1,
                                                                     1 

V C  10 , r=0.05,   0.7,   0.3. The first best level of  is easily checked to be 0.89.


I plot the equilibrium values of  and  for different values of the entrepreneur’s stake,  in Figure 1.

The standardization picked by the entrepreneur,  , increases with  as expected – the more equity the

entrepreneur owns, the greater her incentive to standardize. The employee’s effort does not depend

directly on  , but depends on standardization, and hence indirectly on  . At low levels of

standardization, the competitive effect dominates, and effort increases with standardization, while at

higher levels of standardization, the incentive effect dominates, and effort decreases.




                                                       34
        I plot in figure 2 the amount of outside equity raised at date 0 for different values of the

entrepreneur share,  , and we see it reaches a maximum of 6.45, when   0.19 and the corresponding

standardization   0.632 , and effort   0.636 . I also plot the present value obtained by the

entrepreneur (including her direct rents, her equity stake, and her take from selling equity initially to the

venture capitalist) and we see that it reaches its maximum value when   1 . This is straightforward –

when the entrepreneur sells some of the equity up front, she does not take this equity into account while

setting standardization, and therefore obtains lower overall value than if she retained everything. So in

choosing the amount of equity to sell at date 0, the entrepreneur will retain the maximum stake  that

will allow her to finance asset purchases. So if asset purchases require an amount I A in Figure 2, she will

retain  A rather than a lower amount, even if it is possible to raise more outside funds with a lower

holding.


        An aside: while standardization makes the firm easier to finance, it also has a potential downside

to it. Too much standardization eliminates future rents for the firm’s employees. To the extent that these

rents are a form of long term compensation that depend on firm performance and survival in a way that

ordinary long term compensation may not (rents are less susceptible, for example, to manipulation of

performance metrics, and the prospect of future rents could foster actions with long term payoffs such as

innovation), total elimination of these rents may not be desirable because that can undermine employee,

and firm, performance. Indeed, in Acharya, Myers, and Rajan (2011), the desire to obtain these rents

makes employees interested in firm survival, and allows them to check the otherwise rapacious behavior

of the CEO. I will come back to this shortly when I discuss innovation.


           2.7. The Role of the Venture Capitalist


    Thus far, the venture capitalist simply plays the role that any concentrated equity holder would. But

there are two key additional un-modeled tasks that he performs. First, I have assumed that the

entrepreneur knows how to standardize the firm. In practice, the venture capitalist provides help here,


                                                      35
using his past experience of standardizing other firms to advise the entrepreneur, and using his network of

contacts to bring in the right personnel.


    Second, I have assumed that the entrepreneur can standardize only at date 0. However, unless her

equity stake is substantial and current surplus small, the entrepreneur has an incentive to delay

standardization, so as to appropriate more of the surplus directly, standardizing only near the end of her

term. Postponing standardization could also be a way to entrench herself and to prolong her tenure. The

venture capitalist (VC) may be useful again here. He can utilize the fact that some key standardization

milestones are contractible – for example, hiring a chief operating officer or making an operating unit an

independent division. The venture capitalist can tie further disbursements to them. Failure to meet

standardization milestones can be met with the loss of cash flow rights as well as control rights (see

Kaplan and Stromberg (2002)). Thus the venture capitalist can monitor progress on contractible elements

of standardization, even while the entrepreneur has an incentive through her equity stake to deliver on the

non-contractible elements.


    The analysis also points to the kinds of firms the venture capitalist will back. While standardization

makes top management replaceable, it is critical that the collective assets be irreplaceable, so that top

management cannot simply walk out with the employees and set up a new venture in competition, leaving

a shell of a company behind. This suggests that the typical VC backed firm should have either a strong

proprietary underlying technology, or have developed complementary proprietary assets such as brand

names, that would be hard to replicate (also see Bhide (2000, 2008)). In contrast, firms that rely primarily

on the idiosyncratic talents and energies of the entrepreneur are unlikely to find VC backing at all.


    Also, given the substantial amount of effort the venture capitalist has to devote to monitoring and

aiding standardization, the enterprise has to have sufficient promise of scale to be of interest. We will

shortly survey some evidence on the differences between VC backed firms and non-VC backed firms.




                                                     36
           2.8. The Equity Claim


        Unlike the entrepreneur, the shareholder post-IPO has no passionate a priori commitment to a

direction for the firm. Instead, the shareholder’s neutrality amongst the various interested operating

factions in the firm is his greatest strength (see Hansmann (1996) and Rajan and Zingales (1998)). He

cares about maximizing his own share value and will (through the board) appoint a CEO who will take

the firm in a direction to achieve that.


        From the shareholder’s perspective, standardization has multiple effects that could be explored in

greater detail in future research. Standardization in the lower rungs of the corporate hierarchy strengthens

the CEO’s operational control, and allows her to draw the firm’s surplus to the top of the hierarchy.

Standardization at the top of the hierarchy strengthens outside control, and allows the equity holder to

draw the surplus out. The CEO, post standardization, thus resembles a tax farmer, who is delegated

authority so long as equity holders approve his strategic direction and he comes up with the requisite

“taxes” for them. The pro-rata nature of equity payouts serves to align the interests of the entrepreneur

with that of the equity holders (in influencing standardization), and the board with the equity holders (in

extracting and sharing future payouts).


           2.9. Debt vs Equity


        Equity seems the natural claim with which to finance when the entrepreneur’s intent is to commit

to share future going concern value, since equity supports payouts with the threat of replacing

management even while maintaining the firm as a going concern. Why cannot debt threaten to do this

(instead of threatening to liquidate assets) and extract repayment? Why is equity the favored instrument

for raising finance in many start-ups? Clearly, the high degree of uncertainty associated with start-ups and

the low initial cash flows militate against fixed payments. But there is another reason for preferring equity

that my model makes salient – the contingent nature of the control rights associated with debt makes




                                                     37
standardization less attractive for the entrepreneur, and allows her to capture less of firm value in a public

issuance.


           To see this, note that outside equity (in the form of the venture capitalist early on and the public

market shareholder later) has ownership but delegates control, with the right to take it back (that is,

replace the entrepreneur/CEO) at any time. The right to intervene unconditionally in firm management is

a key distinguishing feature of equity. With debt finance, the creditor obtains ownership and control only

if the firm cannot pay the pre-determined debt payments.


           Suppose then that the entrepreneur has financed initially by issuing debt to the venture capitalist

instead of equity. And assume that the proposed public offering will be of debt rather than equity. Unless

the proposed debt issue is extremely large the entrepreneur will typically have a lower incentive to

standardize than if she proposed to issue equity. The reason is that standardization cannot increase debt

value beyond its face value, while an increase in standardization will always increase equity value.26


           Of course, debt of infinite face value is effectively equivalent to equity in the future, since the

creditors get control under all future circumstances. While we can appeal to costs of default and

renegotiation to explain why very high levels of debt are not issued, there is another reason why the

entrepreneur would prefer equity over debt. Controlling equity can intervene to force the pace of

standardization (as we have seen) or to prevent standardization being reversed. By contrast, debt cannot

intervene unless there is a default.


           To see this last point, note that the entrepreneur wants to standardize primarily because by doing

so she can enable equity holders to extract surplus from future generations of firm managers. But what


                                                                                  2D
26
     The entrepreneur will never want to set standardization higher than   D        1 where D is the total debt
                                                                                  VC
outstanding after the public debt issue at date 1. Of course, if the initial debt issued is low, higher standardization
will not hurt the personal rents of the entrepreneur. A full exploration of the incentives to standardize when the firm
issues debt is left to future research, but may offer interesting insights. For instance, a leveraged buyout could be
seen as an attempt to take the mature firm private in order to give management the incentive to standardize it once
again to more exacting standards.

                                                           38
ensures that a future CEO who owns little equity will not entrench himself (see, for example, Shleifer and

Vishny (1989)) by firing key subordinates, by restructuring the organization and its task allocations, and

by reversing past standardization? In other words, what ensures the persistence of standardization after

the public offering?


         Clearly, a later CEO who wants make himself more central and indispensable will have to dis-

empower strong constituencies – for example, those who were allocated critical functions the CEO used

to carry out. Taking back power will be more difficult than giving it away. Importantly, any aggrieved

party can appeal to outside equity. Since reversing standardization is against the interests of outside

equity, it has the incentive to step in and countermand the CEO’s changes. Thus the ability of equity to

intervene unconditionally in the enterprise ex ante allows it to maintain the standardization in place. Debt

holders, in contrast, would find it much harder to protect an existing level of standardization, because they

would not be able to intervene until the borrower defaulted. By then, it might be too late. Outside equity’s

ability to intervene to prevent a reversal in the capacity of outsiders to control the firm makes equity an

even more powerful means of financing young firms.


            2.10. Life Cycle of Financing


         The preceding might suggest that equity is always the preferred financing instrument. This is

probably true only when the firm is being standardized.27 Once the firm is standardized, the split of

surplus between equity and management is determined. If standardization is not high, equity gets only a

moderate fraction of the surplus generated by an investment. If this investment is financed with an equity




27
  What if the entrepreneur issued debt first, then intends to issue equity in the initial public offering?
Standardization helps strengthen the ability of controlling investors to replace management. However, if the
entrepreneur has issued debt up front, she will not have strong incentives to put in place standardization measures
that strengthen investor control in bad times – for example, effective accounting systems that allow an incoming
CEO to cut costs quickly. This is because the benefits accrue primarily to existing outstanding debt at the likely
expense of the entrepreneur. So again, standardization may be lower than optimal.



                                                         39
issuance, it is possible that old equity is “diluted” by issuance, because the share of additional surplus

going to equity is outweighed by the significantly larger number of shareholders post-issue.


           To see this, consider an investment opportunity at date 1, with required investment i P and net

                                                   C
revenues from the project of v P . Recall V is the surplus from existing projects. If the project is

                                                                        (1   ) C
financed using equity, equity holders get a present value of                      (V  v P ) at date 1, of which new
                                                                        2(1  r )

                                                                (1   ) P P
equity holders gets i P . So old equity is “diluted” if                   v  i  0 , with the extent of dilution
                                                                2(1  r )

increasing as standardization falls. In a sense, management does not bear the cost of investment, but gets

some of the gain, so investment financed by equity issues could be “dilutive” for existing equity even if it

is positive NPV for the firm as a whole. Equity holders will therefore demand a higher hurdle rate for

projects when standardization is low, if they are to be financed with equity – we have an underinvestment

problem because of the overhang of managerial rents.


           Matters are unchanged if the firm finances with debt, d P , when d P or the level of outstanding

prior debt D are low (I assume debt is “hard” implying it cannot be renegotiated, and all debt is paid

before equity at date 2). So long as  (V C  v P )  D  d P , management contributes an incremental

surplus of (1   )(V C  v P ) relative to its replacement, so the present value of incremental management

rents are unaffected by the form of financing. Debt is “paid for” by old equity, which is effectively the

residual claimant.28 The underinvestment problem is unchanged.




28
     To see this, note that if the equity exercises its “outside option” of replacing management, it gets    (V C  v P ) but
has to pay D  d . So its outside option is worth  (V  v )  ( D  d ) at date 2, to which it adds half the
                     P                                      C       P           P

surplus contributed by retaining management. Thus the present value of its claim is
(1   ) C
          (V  v P )  ( D  d P )
2(1  r )

                                                             40
          However, if debt issued or outstanding is high enough that  (V C  v P )  D  d P , equity’s

outside option to replace management yields it zero, since the surplus then generated is insufficient to pay

off debt. Interestingly, managerial rents now go down with debt financing because the surplus

management contributes (relative to its replacement) is now only (V C  v P )  ( D  d P ) .29 Put

differently, the issuance of a hard claim forces management to co-invest in the project by foregoing some

rents, reducing the underinvestment problem relative to when the project is financed with equity. We have


Proposition 4: (i) Old equity is strictly better off when the firm finances with debt rather than with equity

if D  d P   (V C  v P ) and indifferent otherwise. (ii) Ceteris paribus, the extent of value gain to old

equity from financing the new project with debt increases as D increases.


Proof: See appendix.


          Interestingly, as the proposition indicates and I show in the appendix, the higher the pre-existing

level of debt, the greater the benefit of financing with new debt, even though debt is not risky in my

model. Thus leverage begets more leverage. We also have another explanation of the well-documented

difference in effects on a firm’s stock price between the announcement of a seasoned equity issuance

(negative) and a debt issuance (neutral to positive) -- see, for example, Asquith and Mullins (1986).

However, we neither need risky debt (Myers (1977)) or asymmetric information (Myers and Majluf

(1984)) to explain the phenomenon. Of course, we have to rely on alert outside equity or a takeover

market (e.g., Zwiebel (1996)) to explain why in practice management might want to forego its own rents

and favor old outside equity by financing with debt rather than equity.


          All this then suggests a life cycle of firm financing, with firms financing with equity early on so

as to enhance incentives for standardization, and financing later with debt so as to avoid diluting equity. It

also suggests that a firm’s early need to raise public equity finance, and the standardization efforts it had


29
     See Diamond and Rajan (2000).

                                                       41
to undertake to obtain it, should affect the subsequent frequency of its seasoned equity issues and the

magnitude of their announcement effect.


           2.11. Venture Capital, Equity Markets, and Innovation


        Let me turn to evidence now. There is substantial evidence suggesting, first, that venture

capitalists tend to focus on the more innovative (aka differentiated) firms and, second, they help

standardize such firms. Hellmann and Puri (2000) find in a sample of hi-tech start-ups that firms they

classify as innovators are more likely to obtain venture capital than firms they classify as imitators.

Kaplan, Sensoy, and Stromberg (2009, p 77) conclude on reading the business plans of 50 venture capital

financed firms that “almost uniformly, firms claim that they are differentiated by a unique product,

technology, or service at the stage we examine”.


        Standardization should result in a substantial reduction in the importance of specific human

capital. Indeed, Kaplan, Sensoy, and Stromberg (2009) document that over time, from early business plan

to IPO and after, most self-reported differentiating characteristics of a VC-financed firm remain stable,

except for management or employee expertise. This is claimed as a differentiating characteristic by 46

percent of firms at the time of the business plan, but is claimed by only 16 percent of the firms at the IPO

stage or after. That human capital is less of a differentiator is consistent with standardization. They also

find that 46 percent of firms have patent rights at the business plan stage, going up to 60 percent at the

time of the IPO and 66 percent soon after. Thus more of the intellectual property of the firm is embedded

in formal patents over time. Hellmann and Puri (2002) find that VC financed firms are more likely to put

in place formal human resource policies than firms financed otherwise, making VC financed firms less

dependent on implicit contracts between the founding team and employees. They also show that VC

financed firms are more likely to hire a VP of sales and marketing.


        Consisting with increasing standardization over time, Kaplan, Sensoy, and Stromberg (2009) find

that only 43 percent of the firms they follow list a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) as one of the top five


                                                      42
executives at the time of the business plan, while 77 percent list a Chief Technology Officer (CTO). By

the time of the first annual report after the IPO, 81 percent list a CFO, while only 46 percent list a CTO.

This suggests that firms move from emphasizing areas of differentiation (technology) to areas of

commonality (finance, sales and marketing).


        Standardization should mean a greater ability to replace the founder. Hellmann and Puri (2002)

find that VC backed firms tend to be faster and more likely to replace founders than non-VC-backed firms

in the hi-tech industries. Kaplan, Sensoy, and Stromberg (2009) find that the involvement of founders

declines steadily over time in their sample of VC-financed firms. At the business plan stage, 66 percent of

firms have a founder CEO (and 77 percent of firms with a CEO have a founder CEO). By the first annual

report after the IPO, this has fallen to 38 percent. They conclude that “over time, founders move from

operating positions to board positions to no involvement”.


        VC financing and innovation are tightly linked. Kortum and Lerner (2000) examine the influence

of venture capital on patented inventions across 20 industries in the United States, and find that while it

accounted for less than 3 percent of the share of R&D, it accounted for over 8 percent of the share of

patents over the period 1983 to 1992. My model would suggest two explanations for the greater role of

venture capital in patenting. First, venture capital is associated with more differentiated, innovative

companies that promise greater rewards but also need more standardization effort, and hence help from

venture capitalists. Second, patenting is a form of standardization, so it is again not surprising to see it

associated with venture capital.


        Differentiated innovative firms that obtain venture capital financing are different in a number of

ways from firms that start out with more run-of-the-mill technology. Bhide (2000) examines a set of 500

firms that appear in Inc. magazine’s annual list of the fastest growing companies. These companies are

less innovative – indeed they typically start out with an entrepreneur who “borrows” an idea from her old

employer. Only 12 percent of the founders of Inc. 500 firms examined by Bhide (2000) attributed success



                                                      43
to an exceptional idea. Instead, the firms appear to be successful because they adapt to exploit niches in

the marketplace. Because the idea is not distinctive enough early on to merit VC financing, Inc. 500 firms

typically are funded by the entrepreneur’s own savings, her family and friends, or by credit card debt.

Given the paucity of capital, Bhide argues Inc. 500 firms typically find it hard to attract quality personnel

or collaborators, and take longer to grow than VC backed firms. Finally, unlike VC-financed firms that

have substantial turnover of top personnel, Bhide (2000, p305) finds that in all but one of the companies

from the Inc. 500 cohort of 1985 that had crossed $ 500 million in revenue by 1995, the same CEO was

still involved in management.


        Thus innovation, standardization, and finance seem to be linked, with venture capital backed

firms starting out with more innovative, distinctive ideas, getting more initial finance, in return for greater

standardization and greater possible replacement of the managerial team down the line as compared to

Bhide’s sample of Inc. 500 firms. This is not to say that firms in Bhide’s sample are doing the wrong

thing. Their strategy typically relies on finding the right new niche for methods or products that have

worked elsewhere. They need to be flexible to be opportunistic, which makes it harder for them to

standardize to attract finance, especially because their capabilities are so centered on the human capital of

the founder. They are doomed to be financially constrained until they hit upon their niche, at which point

they can standardize and obtain easier financing.


           2.12. Stock Markets, Venture Capital, and Innovation


        My model also suggests a reason why stock markets are so critical to the development of

innovation and venture capital. Brown, Martinsson, and Petersen (2011) find in a large sample of firms

across 32 countries that better access to stock market financing is associated with high levels of R&D

investment, particularly in small firms, but is unimportant for firm investment in fixed capital. Similarly,

Black and Gilson (1998) note the relative paucity of venture capital financing in Germany relative to the

United States, and suggest that it is primarily because exit through an IPO is largely unavailable in



                                                      44
Germany (the predominant form of exit in their sample is through a buyback by the company of the

venture capitalist’s stake).


         Black and Gilson (1998) argue that the reason the IPO is so important is that it allows the

entrepreneur to reacquire control (they note that the venture capitalist typically gives up many of his

control rights and his controlling stake at the time of the IPO). Yet this explanation does not sit well with

the evidence I refer to in the previous sub-section, which suggests a significant number of entrepreneurs

in the United States tend to leave under venture capitalist tutelage. My model suggests an alternative

explanation. The role of the venture capitalist is to use his control rights to help standardize the firm, and

ready it for public control by more dispersed equity. Once standardization is achieved, the firm can be

taken public, and the venture capitalist no longer needs control rights. The role of the vibrant stock market

is not so much to reduce the burden on the entrepreneur of VC oversight, but to reward both for making

the firm “controllable”. The entrepreneur’s incentives are aligned with the venture capitalist because her

equity stake tends to benefit tremendously from standardization. My model suggests the reason venture

capital is less popular or effective in Germany at the time Black and Gilson write is because the majority

of the “exits” are entrepreneurs buying back their own stake from the venture capitalist, which gives them

little ability to capture the future rents of the enterprise, and hence little reward from VC financing.30


                                               III.     Discussion

     I now discuss the links between differentiation and standardization – bringing the two aspects of the

entrepreneur’s role together. This will also help us see where in the spectrum of innovations small start-

ups may have an advantage over more mature firms, and vice versa. I then want to turn briefly to changes

in the environment that are affecting the nature of the corporation and its financing. I will conclude with a

discussion of the political environment and how that might impact the financing of innovation.

30
  The entrepreneur could sell the firm to her managers (see Acharya, Myers, and Rajan (2011) or Kreps (1999)).
However, the amount she can raise will be limited by the financing capacity of those managers, which in turn will be
constrained by the availability of finance. She could allow her firm to be acquired, but the principle issues there
resemble the ones we have already explored with a public equity offering.

                                                        45
           3.1. Differentiation and Standardization


        The fundamental tension running through this paper is between the two transformations, between

differentiation and standardization, or put differently, the extent of innovation and the availability of

finance. Because of the difficulties in financing, start-ups are likely to stay away from capital intensive

fundamental innovation where the commercialization possibilities are uncertain.


        But what of more mature firms who have the internal cash flows to finance innovation? To the

extent that central headquarters is remote, both in physical distance as well as in technical expertise, from

the research and development unit of the corporation, it is not clear that headquarters has better

knowledge to finance effectively than would an outside financier (though see Gertner, Scharfstein, and

Stein (1994)). Indeed, because of internal politics (see Rajan, Servaes, and Zingales (2000) or Scharfstein

and Stein (2000)), innovative but disruptive projects may have less chance of being financed internally.

Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center, set up to create new technologies, played a key role in inventing laser

printing, the Ethernet, the graphical user interface, and personal distributed computing. Xerox’s

management based in Rochester, New York, skeptical of the maverick California-based group,

discouraged development, and many of these inventions were commercialized elsewhere (see Seru

(forthcoming) for evidence on the decline in a target’s innovation following diversifying acquisitions).


        There are other reasons why a mature firm may be less innovative. An entrepreneur in a small

stand-alone start-up tends to experience high costs of failure. The scarcity of funds and the knowledge of

the fall that awaits her if the enterprise does not succeed give the entrepreneur focus. By contrast, the

manager of an incubator in a mature firm overflowing with cash flows can rely on the typically soft

budget constraint in large organizations to experiment endlessly. Neither the downside nor the upside he

faces is large enough, nor is his budget constraint tight enough, to induce urgency.


        Furthermore, the very process of standardization, of disciplining the workforce, makes it difficult

for anyone in the more mature firm to think or act outside the box, to differentiate the firm significantly


                                                      46
once again. For instance, while the technologists in a start-up can order a piece of equipment quickly

when needed, those in a mature firm have to go through the procurement office, with extensive delays as

contracts are bid out. Rules and procedures bring order, efficiency, and ease of control to large scale

operations but tend to suffocate innovation, which is typically spontaneous and unplanned. If rules and

compensation structures differ for the mainstream division and for the innovation incubator, it will tend to

breed resentment and internal conflict, while if the firm puts in place common rules and compensation

structures, they will tend to be tailored for the mature businesses rather than for the incubator (see Kanter

(1989)).


           So both the greater tolerance of failure and standardization make it harder for a mature public

firm’s employees to innovate radically and successfully. This is not to say that mature firms have no

advantages. Apart from their ability to deploy more resources, their previous cluster of patents allows

them to defend an innovation, while their existing organization and their network of collaborators and

customers allows them to commercialize it quickly. To the extent that top management is still

entrepreneurial in spirit, and is close to the technologies being developed, they may have the ability and

willingness to take big, radical risks. Mature corporations may also focus on buying out small innovators

and commercializing their products rather than innovating on their own.


              3.2. Mature Firms and the Matrix


           Much of my analysis has focused on the early stages of the firm. This may well be when the most

dramatic changes in the structure of a firm and its capital structure take place. Of course, much of the

existing capital structure literature focuses on more mature firms, where capital structure choices may

already be largely pre-determined by earlier decisions. The problems for mature firms are different – for

instance, the agency costs associated with dispersed equity, which has occupied center stage ever since

Berle and Means (1932) – though as I have hinted earlier, some of the issues I examine will carry over.




                                                       47
        While I leave detailed analysis to future work, it is useful to lay out in Figure 3 the array of

possibilities for firms and financing when we consider both standardization and differentiation. A laundry

shop is low on both differentiation and standardization. A utility is low on differentiation but high on

standardization, hence it is easy to finance. A wealthy family enterprise can be high on differentiation and

relatively low on standardization – it can differentiate more (though families may be undiversified and

risk averse, which will eventually limit differentiation) without standardizing because it has little need to

cater to financial markets. Finally, a mature firm with entrepreneurial roots such as Microsoft scores high

on both differentiation as well as standardization. The central forces governing the structure of the

laundry shop or the small grocer are different from those governing the entrepreneurial high technology

firm, and a tremendous source of confusion in the literature has been to try and understand the latter by

examining the former.


           3.3. Changes in the environment


        My essential point has been that ownership improves coordination when key assets are

irreplaceable and coordination is costly. Recent changes in the environment have been making a variety

of assets more easily replicable, even while bringing down the costs of coordination. These clearly have

had effects on the nature of the firm and its financing.


        In recent decades in industrial countries, there has been substantial deregulation and liberalization

of domestic product markets, of cross-border trade and capital flows, and of the financial sector. Taken

together, these changes have tended to increase the ease of replication, and thus have reduced the

criticality, of physical assets and of assets whose uniqueness is only protected by regulation. For instance,

when regulations limited entry, when the few domestic intermediate goods producers were locked into

contracts with the incumbent, and when financing was scarce, collaborators could not quit an enterprise

and set up easily in competition. The organization man (Whyte (1956)) was not just a product of the

cultural environment in the United States in the 1950s, he was evidence of the hold corporations had over



                                                      48
employees. Today, with few regulatory barriers to entry, a host of competing domestic and cross-border

producers of intermediate goods, and financing more available, it is easier for a collaborator to quit,

contract with suppliers, and buy the necessary assets to compete, which reduces the power of the

incumbent owner.


        Even as physical-asset-based power has diminished, the costs of coordination have also fallen.

Machines today tend to be far more flexible, reprogrammable in an instant at low cost. They can make

small lots at much the same cost that they would take to make large lots. It makes far more sense for a

contract manufacturer to have multi-purpose programmable machines, which he uses to supply a variety

of downstream firms than for each firm to have a dedicated manufacturing base. In case a downstream

venture fails, the contract manufacturer can quickly redeploy his machines at low cost to someone else’s

order. The lower redeployment costs as a result of greater flexibility diminish the need for the

downstream firm to own the upstream firm in order to improve incentives to coordinate.


        The greater availability of information and the ease of exchanging it add to the attractiveness of

contracting out because the cost of keeping in close touch, no matter what the distance separating

collaborators, is smaller. At the design stage, various collaborators in a project can share the same designs

electronically, so that each part fits perfectly. Designs can be shipped instantaneously to a distant contract

manufacturer, whose progress can be monitored in real time. Communications technology ensures that

everyone can be in close touch without ever being physically proximate. Given the ease of monitoring at a

distance, there is less need to bring a collaborator in as an employee who comes to the premises every day

to work.


        Finally, detailed industry standards ensure that firms can be confident that others will coordinate

without any formal agreement. So long as a firm’s product adheres to the standard, it knows that it will be

inter-operable with a host of other products.




                                                      49
           3.4. Effects on the Firm


        Consider now the effects of the diminished power from certain kinds of assets as well as the

lower cost of coordination on the structure of firms:


        Changes in the method of coordination: As the physical-asset-based authority of the entrepreneur

diminishes, any coordination will have to occur more by persuasion rather than by fiat. This means more

direct contact between the top and bottom of hierarchies – flatter hierarchies, more meetings, more

people-friendly management. The lower cost of communication does make it possible to reduce

managerial layers (see the arguments in Malone (2003) and the evidence in Rajan and Wulf (2006)).

Effective CEOs will earn power by creating bonds with key subordinates, building a strong and cohesive

management team. This reduction in asset-based authority extends to the financier also. Even if the

financier makes every single member of the management team replaceable, he is still exposed to the risk

that the entire management team walks out, taking the firm’s value with it. To the extent that the CEO has

made herself central to the team, more value will have to be paid to her than when she obtained power

only through delegated ownership of physical assets. One implication is that relative increases in CEO

compensation across countries should be viewed in the context of these regulatory and financial market

developments rather than narrowly through the lens of corporate governance.


        Changes in critical assets: As physical and regulatory assets become less central to power,

protected intellectual property such as brand names and patents increasingly become the critical assets

around which firms are built. Moreover, because these assets have to be constantly refreshed through

human creativity and innovation, it is harder for firms to standardize, at least to the extent that was

possible in the past. More firm value will have to go to the firm’s innovators and creative personnel,

partly as rents as controls are more lax, partly as incentive. More equity based compensation may be

necessary across the flatter hierarchy (rather than just at the top) to align incentives of creative employees

with equity holders.



                                                        50
        Changes in need for ownership: The lower cost of coordination can have complex effects on the

size of enterprises and their commonly owned assets. On the one hand, it can result in loosely coupled

global enterprises, tied together by common ownership of brand names, clients, and databases, but

without the close hierarchical control that characterized firms of the past. Global accounting, consulting,

and law firms are an example.


        On the other hand, with physical assets providing less power, and with a lower need for

coordination, we would expect ownership of physical assets to be less important for business. Stories of

“virtual” businesses with a handful of employees generating hundreds of millions of dollars in sales are

legion today. However, these very factors make differentiation even more necessary to achieve a

sustainable advantage. When everyone uses the same contract manufacturer in Taiwan, the entrepreneur

has to make her idea or design attractively different because the quality of the manufacturing is the same.


        Changes in organizations: Ownership was especially important when the entrepreneur knew the

direction she wanted to take the firm in, and had to enforce it. With greater need for differentiation,

innovation is more open-ended, and no one may know the precise direction that the enterprise has to go in

ex ante – unlike in my model where the entrepreneur knows where to take the firm. This may explain why

firms increasingly choose to innovate through alliances or consortiums with collaborators that have

important necessary capabilities (see, for example, Baker, Gibbons, and Murphy (2008) for the variety of

alliance structures). Alliances spread risk, bring the right capabilities together, and are more useful when

no one knows which way to proceed. They also become more viable when the costs of coordination are

low.


        None of this is to say that the fundamental forces I have pointed to earlier in the paper have

ceased to be important. The seemingly high rate of break-up of alliances is consistent with the lower

commitment in those ventures that my model would predict. Boeing’s attempt to create the Boeing 787

Dreamliner by coordinating suppliers across the world came in very late and way over-budget, and ended



                                                     51
with Boeing having to buy some of its suppliers.31 Equally, the tension between the firm’s structure and

its financing are still extremely important. Even though the need for common asset ownership and hence

financing may be lower in a world where coordination across firms is easier, the entrepreneur has to

differentiate more, and because human capital is more critical, has a lower ability to promise the financier

an adequate return. On net, it is not obvious that the entrepreneurial problem of effecting the twin

transformations has become any easier.


                                                      Conclusion

           Though presidential addresses are supposed to be timeless, it would be remiss of me to ignore the

political environment we are in. Finance is in some disrepute because of the near-death experience of

Wall Street in 2008, and the continuing travails of European banks. The crisis that started in 2007 is still

with us, and has severely damaged the real economy around the world. At times like these, there is a

strong tendency for critics to claim that finance is a zero, or even negative, sum game, adding risk to

economic activity without contributing real value. No doubt, a number of practices of the financial sector

ought to be re-examined, and regulation improved to reduce the financial sector’s ability to make one way

bets at the expense of the rest of the economy.


           At the same time, we should not succumb to the rhetoric that financial innovation and creativity

are simply ways for the clever to part the innocent of their money. Such rhetoric does get louder after a

crisis, and makes it easier for governments to suppress finance (see Rajan and Zingales (2003 a, b)). What

I have tried to show in this paper is the very real potential cost if financiers are unable to play midwife to

innovative new firms, and if equity markets are not vibrant enough to reward entrepreneurial activity.

The broader point is that attempts to separate Main Street from Wall Street, real activity from “merely”

finance, are not useful. The two are intimately linked, both in theory and in practice.

Proof of Proposition 3

                  d
We know that if       0 , the VC wants to set standardization at its maximal level. Thus the theorem
                  d
holds weakly, and strictly so long as the solution to the entrepreneur’s maximization problem is interior.

          d                                           V E (  ) 1       V E (  ) 1    V C 1    
Now let       0 . The entrepreneur’s utility is U E                                                     
          d                                                   2                     2           2(1  r ) 

                                            V E (  ) 1    V C 1    
and the VC’s utility is U VC  (1   )                                    
                                                    2           2(1  r ) 

                                         V E (  ) 1       
Therefore, the entrepreneur’s utility is                         U VC . This implies the entrepreneur’s first
                                                 2            1

order condition is               V                  0 . The VC’s utility is concave in  and has
                        2     2       d  (1   ) d 
                                       dU VC                                dU E
an interior optimal      VC
                               , where        0 at    . This means that
                                                         VC
                                                                                  0 at    VC . If U E is
                                        d                                   d
                                                  dU VC
                                                        is decreasing in  by concavity of U . That means
                                                                                            VC
concave, we are done. If not, we know that
                                                   d
dU E
      0 for    VC . So the entrepreneur preferred choice of standardization is lower than the venture
 d
capitalist’s. Finally, since the weight the entrepreneur puts on the venture capitalist’s utility in his own
                                 
maximization problem is             , it must be that the standardization chosen by the entrepreneur increases
                                1
in   .
Proof of Proposition 4:

We have seen the basic underinvestment problem when the mature firm finances with a new equity

issuance and              v i  0.
                2(1  r )
Now consider the multiple cases at different levels of legacy debt and new debt issuance, where
 dP
      iP .

Case 1: D   V C and ( D  d P )   V C  v P .     

Equity’s outside option of replacing management, if the project is not undertaken, fetches  V C  D . The
incremental surplus if it works with management is (1   )V C . So its date-2 value from Nash bargaining
     (1   ) C                                                           (1   ) C
is
        2
             V  D . Similarly, if the project is undertaken, equity gets
                                                                             2
                                                                                  V  v P   ( D  d P ) .
This means the incremental present value (at date 1) to old equity of undertaking the project, financing
              (1   ) P d P       (1   ) P P
with debt, is           v                 v  i . This is no different from the present value of
              2(1  r )     1  r 2(1  r )
financing with equity explored in the text.

                                              
Case 2: D   V C and ( D  d P )   V C  v P .        
In this case, equity’s outside option is unchanged if the project is not undertaken, but is zero if it is (since
the surplus generated after replacement is insufficient to repay debt). Hence the date-2 value of old equity

post investment is
                      V   C
                                vP   (D  d P )
                                                     . If the firm does not invest, its value is
                                                                                                   (1   ) C
                                                                                                           V  D . So on
                                     2                                                                2
rearranging and substituting, the incremental date-1 present value to old equity from investment is
(1   ) P P  D  d P   (V C  v P ) 
          v i                         . The last term is the present value of rents foregone by

management relative to all equity financing, and is positive. Thus equity’s incentive to invest is greater
with debt financing than with equity financing.

                                         
Case 3: D   V C and  V C  v P  ( D  d P ) . In this case, it is easily checked that old equity bears the
full cost of debt financing, so there is no difference between financing with equity and financing with
debt.
