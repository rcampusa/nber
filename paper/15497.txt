Family Violence and Football: The Effect of Unexpected Emotional Cues on Violent Behavior

November 2009
JEL No. D03

                                             ABSTRACT

Family violence is a pervasive and costly problem, yet there is no consensus on how to interpret the
phenomenon of violence by one family member against another. Some analysts assume that violence
has an instrumental role in intra-family incentives. Others argue that violent episodes represent a loss
of control that the offender immediately regrets. In this paper we specify and test a behavioral model
of the latter form. Our key hypothesis is that negative emotional cues – benchmarked relative to a
rationally expected reference point – make a breakdown of control more likely. We test this hypothesis
using data on police reports of family violence on Sundays during the professional football season.
Controlling for location and time fixed effects, weather factors, the pre-game point spread, and the
size of the local viewing audience, we find that upset losses by the home team (losses in games that
the home team was predicted to win by more than 3 points) lead to an 8 percent increase in police
reports of at-home male-on-female intimate partner violence. There is no corresponding effect on
female-on-male violence. Consistent with the behavioral prediction that losses matter more than gains,
upset victories by the home team have (at most) a small dampening effect on family violence. We
also find that unexpected losses in highly salient or frustrating games have a 50% to 100% larger impact
on rates of family violence. The evidence that payoff-irrelevant events affect the rate of family violence
leads us to conclude that at least some fraction of family violence is better characterized as a breakdown
of control than as rationally directed instrumental violence.

I. Introduction

         Violence by men against their partners and children is one of the most common

yet perplexing forms of violent behavior. 1 Building on a rational choice perspective

(Becker, 1968), economists have interpreted family violence as instrumental behavior

(Chwe, 1990; Tauchen, Witte and Long, 1991; Bowlus and Seitz, 2006) or assumed that

men like to commit violence and women tolerate it in return for higher transfers (e.g.,

Aizer, forthcoming). 2 An alternative interpretation is that family violence represents

expressive behavior that is triggered when conflictual interactions escalate out of

control. 3 Recently, economists have developed models with a similar risk of breakdown

in rationality to explain present bias in inter-temporal consumption (Fudenberg and

Levine, 2004; Benhabib and Bisin, 2004), drug use by addicts (Bernheim and Rangel,

2004), and other failures of self-control (Loewenstein and O’Donohue, 2007). 4

         In this paper we specify and test a simple behavioral model in which violence

arises when interactions between the members of conflict-prone families escalate to the

point of physical danger. Our key hypothesis is that the risk of violence is affected by the



1
  The estimated number of physical assaults inflicted on adult women in the U.S. by their intimate partners
ranges from 2.5 to 4.5 million per year (Rand and Rennison, 2005): the implied risk of physical assault by
an intimate partner is on the order of 1 percent per year. Wilt and Olsen (1996) estimate that at least 5% of
all injured women treated at hospital emergency departments are victims of family violence. About one-
third of female homicide victims are killed by their husband or partner (Fox and Zawitz, 2007).
2
  Chwe (1990) presents a principal-agent model in which the agent (the male partner) does not directly
prefer violence. Tauchen Witte and Long (1991) and Bowlus and Seitz (2006) allow a positive preference
for abuse. Agency models of violence are similar in spirit to Dobash and Dobash’s (1979) “patriarchal”
model of the use of violence by men to control their partner and children. Farmer and Tiefenthaler (1997)
analyze a model similar to the one of Tauchen Witte and Long (1991). Bloch and Rao (2002) propose a
model of family violence as a credible signal to a woman’s family.
3
  This interpretation of family violence is stressed in Straus, Gelles, and Steinmetz (1980), Gelles and
Straus (1988), and Straus, Gelles, and Smith (1990), who argue that the high rate of violent incidents
committed by women against men is inconsistent with simple instrumental theories.
4
  Thaler and Shefrin (1981) present an early economic model that emphasizes issues of self-control. There
is an extensive psychology literature on “loss of control” or failure of self-regulation: see e.g., Baumeister,
Heatherton and Tice (1994) and Baumeister and Heatherton (1996).

gain-loss utility associated with salient emotional cues. 5 Specifically, we assume that

negative cues – based on realizations relative to expected outcomes – increase the risk of

violence. We test this hypothesis using police reports of family violence incidents on

Sundays during the regular season of the National Football League (NFL). We use a

Poisson regression framework to analyze National Incident Based Reporting System

(NIBRS) data from states that are home to six different NFL teams, focusing on the effect

of wins and losses of the home team on reported family violence incidents. Building on

Koszegi and Rabin (2006) we assume the reference point for the emotional cue

associated with the game outcome is the expected probability of a win, which we infer

from the pre-game Las Vegas point spread. 6

         Our focus on the impact of professional football games is motivated by two

considerations. On the one hand, many fans feel a strong emotional attachment to local

NFL teams. Home games on Sunday afternoons typically attract a quarter of the

television audience in markets with a local NFL team. 7 Team affinity is reinforced by

extensive pre- and post-game coverage by local news and entertainment media. On the

other hand, the existence of a well-organized betting market allows us to infer the

expected outcome of each game. 8 Assuming that a game outcome is random, conditional


5
  A number of previous studies have modeled the effect of external cues on choice behavior, including
Laibson (2001), Bernheim and Rangel (2004) and Ariely and Lowenstein (2005).
6
  There is a growing empirical literature on reference point-driven behavior, including Camerer et al.
(1997), Crawford and Meng (2009), Genosove and Mayer (2001), Lutmer (2005), Mas (2006), Fehr and
Goette (2007), and Farber (2008). See DellaVigna (2009) for a comprehensive review.
7
  In 2008, NFL Sunday football games were the highest-rated local programs in 88% of the market-weeks.
Nationally, the top 10 television programs for 18-49 year old men in 2008 were all NFL football games
(NFL and Nielsen Media Research, cited in Ground Report, January 7, 2009).
8
  Football betting uses a point spread, rather than odds, to clear the betting market (see Levitt, 2004 for a
good description of the institutions involved). Previous research (e.g., Pankoff, 1968; Gandar et al., 1988)
has shown that the point spread is an unbiased (and relatively accurate) predictor of game outcomes, though
there is some evidence that the betting market is not fully efficient. See Wolfers and Zitzewitz (2004) for a
general discussion of betting and related markets, and Wolfers and Zitzewitz (2007) on the information
aggregating property of betting markets.

on the pre-game point spread, we can interpret any difference between the rate of family

violence following a win or loss as a causal effect of the outcome of the game.

Moreover, we can easily define the strength of the emotional cue associated with a win or

a loss in a given game.

        Our empirical analysis points to four main conclusions. First, controlling for

location fixed effects, the pre-game point spread, seasonality and weather factors 9 , and

the size of the local viewing audience, we find that an “upset loss” by the home team (a

loss when the team was predicted to win by more than 3 points) leads to an 8 percent

increase in the number of police reports of at-home male-on-female intimate partner

violence. The spike in violence is concentrated in a narrow time window after the end of

the game. Second, consistent with the standard behavioral prediction that losses matter

more than gains (i.e., loss aversion) “upset wins” (a win when the team was expected to

lose by more than 3 points) have at most a small effect in reducing family violence. 10

Third, upset losses in more salient games (those involving a traditional rival, or occurring

when the home team is still in playoff contention) have a larger effect on the rate of

intimate partner violence, as do unexpected losses after games involving an unusual

number of sacks, turnovers, or penalties. Fourth, we find that NFL game outcomes have

little or no effect on police reports of female-on-male intimate partner violence. We also

find no significant effect on violence against children, though the low rate of police-

reported violence against children limits the power of this analysis. 11


9
  The effect of weather on crime rates is documented in Jacob, Lefgren, and Moretti (2007). Simonsohn
(forthcoming) documents the effect of weather on the decision of what college to attend.
10
   As discussed below, our model suggests that the most violence-prone families will avoid watching a
game together (or take other protective action) when a loss is likely. This behavior will reinforce the
asymmetric response to unexpected losses and unexpected wins.
11
   In a recent paper Rees and Schnepel (2009) analyze the effect of upset and other wins and losses on
crime rates in college towns on days when there is a home game. Interestingly, they find that many types


3
          Our estimate of the effect of unexpected losses in local football games on the rate

of violence against female partners is large: an 8 percent impact is comparable to the

effect of a hot day (over 80 degrees Fahrenheit), and is about one-fourth the magnitude of

the spike in violence on a major holiday like Thanksgiving or the Fourth of July. 12 The

strong impact of random external factors on the rate of family violence provides

compelling evidence that at least some portion of family violence arises through a

breakdown of control, rather than as instrumental behavior driven by purely rational

choice.

          The next section presents a simple model of emotional cues and violence that

provides an interpretative framework for our empirical analysis. Section III describes the

NIBRS data on family violence incidents and the NFL data that we combine into an

estimation sample. Section IV presents our econometric model and our main estimation

results. We then discuss a number of extensions and robustness checks in Section V, and

conclude in Section VI with a discussion of our results.



II. A Simple Model of Emotional Cues and Family Violence

a. Basic Setup

          In this section we present a simplified one-period model of the impact of external

emotional cues on observed rates of family violence. We combine ideas from the “family

conflict” paradigm in sociology (Straus, Gelles, and Steinmetz, 1980) with an hypothesis

about the effect of emotionally engaging external events, based on a gain-loss framework


of crimes are affected by both upset wins and upset losses, including assaults, vandalism, disorderly
conduct, and liquor-related offenses.
12
   Vazquez, Stohr and Purkiss (2005) analyze NIBRS data for one state (Idaho) and show that intimate
partner violence rates are typically higher on holidays. We summarize our own investigation of the pattern
of family violence across different days of the year in Section VI below.


4
with a rational reference point (Koszegi and Rabin, 2006). As in Bernheim and Rangel’s

(2004) model of drug use, we assume that agents who are at risk of committing a violent

act can take action to avoid exposure to emotional cues that may trigger violence.

        We focus on the risk of violence by an adult male with a female spouse or other

intimate partner. 13 For a given couple, we assume that the probability of a conflictual

interaction (a heated disagreement or argument) is q (0≤q≤1), and that q is distributed

across the population with distribution function F(q). We assume that with some

probability h ≥ 0 a conflictual interaction escalates to violence (i.e., the agent “loses

control”). Thus, for a given couple the probability of violence is qh.

        The agent can choose whether or not to watch a locally televised NFL game. The

outcome of the game is a binary indicator y with p=P(y=1) representing the probability

of a home team victory. At the conclusion of the game an agent who has watched the

game experiences an emotional cue that depends on y−E[y] = y−p. We assume this cue

in turn affects the probability of losing control during a conflictual interaction. In

particular, we assume that

(1)     h = h0 − μ( y−p) ,

where μ is the gain-loss utility associated with the cue, with

        μ( y−p) = α ( y−p) , y−p < 0

                   =   β ( y−p) , y−p > 0 ,

for positive constants α and β. Loss aversion predicts that α > β, i.e., that the marginal



13
  Strictly speaking our model focuses on the risk of violent interactions between partners: the outcome of
such interactions could involve injuries to both partners. In our data (described below) about 80% of the
victims of intimate partner violence are women. A similar fraction of female victims is reported in the
National Crime Victimization Survey. We therefore discuss the model as if the primary agent is a potential
male perpetrator of family violence against his spouse or partner.


5
effect of a positive cue is smaller than the marginal effect of a negative cue. 14

          Recognizing that y is binary, the implied probabilities of a loss of control are

(2)       hL = h0 + αp                if y=0 (a loss)

          hW = h0 − β(1−p)            if y=1 (a win) .

The functions hL(p) and hW(p) are graphed in Figure 1. The upper line is the probability

of violence in the event of a loss. At p=0 a home-team loss is fully anticipated and there

is no emotional cue, so hL = h0. For any other p>0 a loss is “bad news”, with a stronger

negative cue the higher is p, implying that hL is increasing in p. The lower line in the

figure is the probability of violence in the event of a win. A win when p=0 is the “best

possible” news, leading the lowest probability of violence h0 − β. At higher values of p a

win is increasingly likely and the deviation of the risk of violence from the baseline rate

h0 is smaller. At p=1 a win is expected and there is no emotional cue so hW = h0. Notice

that when α > β, the gap between the risk of violence in the event of a win and the event

of a loss is increasing in p.

          At the beginning of the period the agent has to decide whether to watch the game

(and be exposed to the emotional cue) or not. We assume the agent’s preferences do not

directly depend on the emotional cue, although he rationally anticipates the consequences

of a win or loss if he decides to watch the game. The expected utility of an agent of type

q for not watching the game, watching the home team win, and watching the home team

lose is

          uj − qhjv      for j = 0 (not watching), W (a win), and L (a loss)


14
  See Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler (1991) for an overview of the evidence of loss aversion in a variety
of contexts. In a review and synthesis of the literature on aggressive behavior or groups of spectators at a
sporting event, Branscombe and Wan (1992) discuss the possible effects of winning and losing on
aggression. They conclude the empirical findings in the literature are inconclusive.


6
where v>0 is the utility cost of a violent episode. 15 We assume that uW≥ u0≥ uL, and that

uW> uL, so the agent strictly prefers to watch a win rather than a loss.16 Combining the

expressions for expected utility with equation (2), the expected payoff of watching the

game (relative to not watching) is

(3)      G(p; q) = puW + (1−p) uL − u0 − (α−β)p(1−p)qv .

Note that if α=β the expected payoff from watching the game does not depend on the

agent’s type (q) or the cost of violence (v). In this “linear” case the increased risk of

violence in the event of a loss for an agent who decides to watch the game is just offset

by the decreased risk of violence in the event of a win. When a negative emotional cue

from a loss has a larger effect than the positive cue from a win, however, then the payoff

from watching is decreasing in q and v.

         Inspection of equation (3) shows that an agent in a conflict-free relationship (q=0)

will watch the game if p> pc and not watch if p< pc, where


          pc = [ u0 − uL ] / [uW − uL ] , with            0 ≤ pc< 1 .


Among the set of agents with some probability of a conflictual interaction, there is a

cutoff type q*(p), such that those with q≤ q*(p) will watch a game with a probability p of

a home-team victory and those with q> q*(p) will not. This cutoff is defined by


(4)      q*(p) = [ puW + (1−p) uL − u0 ] / (α−β)p(1−p)v.


The cutoff type has the properties that: (i) for p< pc, q*(p) = 0 (i.e., no types watch the


15
   The cost of violence includes costs of harm to the partner as well as the risk of arrest. See Iyengar (2009)
for an interesting analysis of the effect of mandatory arrest laws, which require police to arrest the
perpetrator when called to a family violence incident.
16
   As we show in Section III, below, the local television audience is larger for games that the home team is
more likely to win, so this appears to be a plausible assumption.


7
game); and (ii) for p> pc, q*(p) is strictly increasing in p. Thus, as the probability of a

home team victory increases, men with a higher risk of violence are drawn to watch the

game. 17


         In our empirical analysis we compare the effects of wins and losses on the rate of

family violence, controlling for the probability p of a home-team victory. In the event of

a loss the probability of a violent episode is

           (h0+αp)q          for agents with q≤ q*(p) who watched ,

           h0q               for agents with q > q*(p) who did not watch.

In the event of a home team win, on the other hand, the risk of violence is:

         (h0−β(1−p))q        for agents with q≤ q*(p) who watched,

           h0q               for agents with q> q*(p) who did not watch.

Thus the difference in the expected rate of violence following a loss, relative to a win, is

                                              q*(p)
(5)      Δ(risk | p) = [ β + (α−β) p] ∫             q dF(q) .
                                              0

Assuming that α > β this expression is increasing in p for two reasons. First, as shown in

Figure 1, for those who watch the game the deviation in the predicted rate of violence

between a loss and a win is increasing in p. Second, when p is higher more men – and in

particular more men in more conflict-prone relationships – will watch the game.



b. Testing the Model

         Our model predicts there will be a higher rate of family violence following a

17
  Another interpretation is that when p is low, the partners and children of higher-risk men leave the home
or take other defensive actions. Data on the numbers of male and female viewers for a subset of the NFL
games in our sample suggest that the relative fraction of female viewers is unaffected by the probability of
a home team victory, inferred from the point spread. Gender-specific viewing data are only available for a
subset of media markets, however, so the sample is relatively small.


8
home team loss than a home team victory. The maximum relative effect is predicted for

an “upset” loss (a loss when the home team had a high probability of victory). The

predicted relative effect of loss when the home team was very likely to lose – or

equivalently, the relative effect of an “upset win” – is smaller, both because of loss-

aversion in the gain-loss function that generates the emotional cue of a game outcome,

and because we expect relatively risk-prone agents to avoid watching a game when the

likelihood of a loss is high.

        We test these predictions using a Poisson model for the number of police-reported

episodes of family violence in a set of cities, towns, and municipalities in states with a

“home” NFL team. To keep the analysis as simple as possible we limit attention to

violence reports on Sundays during the fall regular NFL season. As discussed in more

detail below we classify games based on the Las Vegas point spread into three categories:

home team likely to win, opposing team likely to win, or a game expected to be close.

We then fit models that include the full set of interactions between the ex ante

classification and whether the game was a won or lost by the home team (3×2=6

categories), treating the non-game days (i.e., a day where the home team is has a bye

week or is playing on another day of the week) as the base case. (We also fit a model

with a polynomial in the point spread, interacted with the game outcome.)

        Our key identification assumption is that the outcome of the game is random,

conditional on the information contained in the Las Vegas spread. Under this

assumption, we can interpret any difference between the rate of family violence

following a win or loss conditional on the pre-game spread as a causal effect of the

outcome of the game itself. As in a classical randomized controlled trial, the assumption




9
that the game outcome is “as good as random” conditional on the spread has the

prediction that one should obtain the same effect of the game outcome, regardless of

whether we condition on other control variables or not. As we show, this is in fact the

case: although other factors, such as the weather, have a significant effect on the rate of

family violence, our estimates of the effect of the game outcome, conditional on the range

of the point spread, are quite stable.



III. Data Sources and Sample Construction

a. Measuring Family Violence: NIBRS Data on Police-Reported Violence

         Our empirical analysis is based on police reports of family violence in the

National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). Incidents in the NIBRS system are

reports of crime to individual police agencies.18 A report does not have to be associated

with an arrest to be included in NIBRS. 19 Each incident report includes information on

the victim (age, gender, etc.), the offender (gender, relationship to the victim), and the

nature of the incident (including date, time of day, location, and whether the victim was

injured).

         NIBRS has several advantages as a source of information on family violence.

Most importantly for our purposes, it represents the universe of family violence incidents

recorded by a given agency, with information on the date and time of day of the incident.

Since family violence is relatively rare, a complete count is needed to accurately study

crime rates on specific days in specific locations. NIBRS incident reports are also


18
   We analyze incident reports for city and county agencies, and exclude college, state police, and special
agencies.
19
   About half of family assaults in the NIBRS result in an arrest (Durose et al, 2005; Hirschel, 2008).
Direct arrests by police officers with no intervening report of a crime are also included in NIBRS.


10
collected in real time, so the information on the date and time of the incident is relatively

precise. In contrast, most other sources of information on family violence are based on

recall of occurrences over the previous month or year, and cannot be used to measure

daily crime rates.

         A limitation of NIBRS is that it only includes police-reported family violence. 20

Nevertheless, a comparison of the implied rate of intimate partner violence (IPV)

experienced by women age 18-54 in the NIBRS to the rate in the 1995 National Violence

Against Women Survey (NVAWS) suggests that NIBRS captures a relatively high

fraction of serious violence – episodes that would be classified as assault (either simple or

aggravated assault) or intimidation. Specifically, we calculated that the implied annual

risk of IPV is approximately 1.6 % per year in the 2000 NIBRS, versus 1.3 % per year

(for assaults and intimidation) in the NVAWS (1995-96). 21

         A second limitation of the NIBRS data is that participation by individual police

agencies is voluntary. Although participation rates have risen steadily over the past 15

years, many states still have no agencies in the program, including California, Illinois,

and New York. Moreover, in some participating states only a fraction of police agencies

report to NIBRS. Typically the largest cities in a state are absent, at least in early years

of the sample. As a result of these features, the total fraction of the U.S. population

covered by NIBRS was only 4% in 1995, but rises to approximately 25% by 2006.

         Table 1 provides summary statistics for IPV incidents in the NIBRS dataset. IPV


20
   Among adult female respondents to the National Crime Victimization Survey who report being a victim
of assault by their spouse or partner, only about 55% report that the incident was reported to police (Durose
et al., 2005).
21
   Using a variety of published data sources, we calculated the incidence rates for violence by an intimate
partner against women, aged 18-54. For the NIBRS, we inflated the number of incidents for which
information on the identity of the perpetrator is available, assuming information is missing at random.
NIBRS data for available agencies were inflated to the national level.


11
is defined by the type of crime and the relationship of the victim and offender. Our

measure of violence includes simple assault, aggravated assault, and intimidation. Our

definition of an intimate partner is a spouse (including a common-law or ex-spouse) or

boyfriend/girlfriend. Our main dependent variable in the empirical analysis is at-home

male-on-female IPV occurring between the hours of 12 PM and midnight Eastern Time,

although we explore other IPV incidents as well. Panel A summarizes the rates for this

main dependent variable for the set of NIBRS agencies used in our analysis (i.e., agencies

in the set of states that we match to NFL teams, as described in the next section). Across

all days of the year, the rate is .70 per 100,000 (total population). 22 As has been noted in

other studies using NIBRS data (e.g., Vazquez, Stohr and Purkiss, 2005) the rate of

violence varies both by day of the week and season of the year. Weekends, especially

Saturdays and Sundays, have the highest rate of IPV; rates are also somewhat higher in

summer. In view of the important day-of-week and seasonal patterns in family violence,

and the relatively small number of games on days other than Sunday, we have elected to

simplify our empirical analysis by limiting our sample to the 17 Sundays during the

regular NFL season. This restricted sample has the important advantage that we observe

rates of violence reported by a given agency on the same day in different years, and rates

reported by multiple agencies on the same day in a given year.

        Panels B and C of Table 1 provide summary statistics for our estimation sample

of Sundays during the regular football season. In Panel B we present rates of intimate



22
  The hours between 12 PM and midnight account for 61% of at-home male-on-female IPV. Ideally the
rate of intimate partner violence would be expressed relative to the number of intimate partner couples. In
2000 there were approximately 21 intimate partnerships per 100 people in the U.S. population: thus on
average the rate per couple is approximately 4.8 times the rate per person (U.S. Census Bureau, Census
2000 Summary File 1). In our empirical analysis, this is not an issue as we use models based on counts that
include police agency fixed effects.


12
partner violence by location and victim-offender relationship. Most of the victims of

intimate partner violence are women (82%) and a majority are victimized at home

(84%). 23 For these reasons, our main analysis focuses on male-on-female at-home

violence. Within this class of incidents, violence by husbands against their wives

accounts for 54% of incidents and violence by men against unmarried female partners

accounts for 46%.

         Panel C narrows the focus to male-on-female violence occurring at home. To

crudely characterize the severity of an incident, we classified all aggravated assaults and

other incidents involving physical injury as “serious assaults.” 24 The remainder (simple

assaults and intimidation with no injuries) are classified as “minor assaults.” Using this

classification just over one-half (52%) of male-on-female at-home IPV incidents are

serious assaults, while the balance are minor assaults.

         Alcohol (and drug) use is a mechanism that is widely believed to contribute to

violent crime, and which might be expected to amplify the effects of emotional cues. 25

Unfortunately, there is only limited information on alcohol and drug use by offenders in

the NIBRS dataset. Police can report whether the offender was suspected of using drugs

or alcohol during or shortly before the offense. Overall, about 20% of at-home male-on-


23
   The relative fraction of female victims of intimate partner violence is controversial because some sources
of information on family violence (in particular, questionnaires that use behavioral checklists to ask about
past episodes of slapping, pushing, throwing articles) often find that men and women are equally likely to
be “victimized” (e.g., Straus, Gelles, and Steinmetz, 1980). As discussed by Hamby (2005) victimization
surveys, police reports, and other sources that measure more serious episodes of violence all find far higher
rates of female victims – typically in the range of 70-90% (Hamby, 2005, Table I).
24
   The NIBRS dataset uses the FBI classification of aggravated assault, which is an unlawful attack where
the offender wields a weapon or the victim suffers obvious severe or aggravated injury. Simple assault is
also an unlawful attack, but does not involve a weapon or obvious severe or aggravated bodily injury
(minor injuries such as bruises or cuts often accompany simple assault, however). Intimidation is placing a
person in reasonable fear of bodily harm without a weapon or physical attack.
25
   Klostermann and Fals-Steward (2006) present a comprehensive review of the literature on the inter-
relationship of alcohol use and IPV. In general, alcohol use appears to be positively correlated with the risk
of IPV. The causal effect is less clear.


13
female incidents of IPV list alcohol or drugs as a contributing factor. (The rate for

serious assaults is a little higher, 24%). The relatively low rate of alcohol and drug

involvement could reflect under-reporting, or a tendency by police to cite alcohol and

drugs as contributing factor only in cases with high levels of intoxication.



b. Matching NFL Team Data to NIBRS Violence Data

           We link the NIBRS data to the team records for “local” NFL franchises. Since

NIBRS data are not yet available for most major cities, relatively few NFL teams can be

matched to crime incidents in the city or county directly surrounding their home stadium.

As an alternative, we focus on reports from police agencies in states where there is a

single NFL team. We then assign all jurisdictions within a state to that team. 26

Following this approach, and imposing the restriction that at least 4 years of data are

available for a given team, a total of six NFL teams can be matched to roughly 800

different NIBRS agencies.

           Our decision to assign all residents of a state to their “local” NFL team is likely to

diminish the average strength of the emotional cue associated with a game outcome for

that team. Arguably, these cues are stronger for people who live close to a team’s home

city and are routinely exposed to media coverage of the team, and weaker for those in

other areas of a state. Weaker emotional cues presumably lead to attenuated estimates of

the effect of wins versus losses, relative to the effect for people who live in the home city.

Thus, we suspect that our assignment procedure is likely to lead to a conservative

assessment of the effect of emotional cues on family violence.



26
     We match the New England Patriots to three states: Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Hampshire.


14
       Table 2 shows the six football teams in our sample, with the associated NIBRS

states listed in parentheses. For each team we also show the win-loss record in the

sample years for which NIBRS data are available, and the number of reporting agencies

in the state in that year. Three teams (the Carolina Panthers, Detroit Lions, and New

England Patriots) have NIBRS data available for all 12 years, starting in 1995 and

continuing to 2006. The remaining three teams (the Denver Broncos, Kansas City

Chiefs, and Tennessee Titans) enter the NIBRS sample in later years. Note that within a

state the number of reporting agencies in NIBRS tends to rise, though there are

fluctuations up and down in some later years as agencies drop in or out.

       The win-loss records reported in Table 2 display wide variation, with some teams

making the playoffs more often than others. Detroit had a poor win-loss record for most

of the sample period, while Denver and New England were very successful teams. Even

within a team, however, there is a fair amount of year-to-year variation. For example,

Denver had a 14-2 win-loss record in the 1998 season (and won the Superbowl), but had

a losing season in 1999. Since predicted game outcomes tend to be based on recent past

performance, these patterns hint at the prevalence of both upset losses (e.g., during the

Denver Broncos’ 1999 season) and upset wins (e.g., during the Kansas City Chiefs’ 2003

season). We characterize upset losses and upset wins more formally using the Las Vegas

point spread in the next subsection.

       In all, the 6 teams in our sample can be matched to 993 regular season football

games and 53 playoff games. The characteristics of these games are shown in the upper

panel of Table 3. The vast majority (87%) of the regular season games were played on

Sundays. As noted earlier, given the seasonal and intra-week variation in family violence




15
rates, we elected to simplify our empirical design by focusing on regular-season Sunday

games. The characteristics of these games and their associated local television market are

summarized in panels B and C of Table 3.



c. Expected Outcomes from Betting Markets

         A key feature of NFL football is the existence of a well-organized betting market

that allows us to infer the expected outcome of each game. The main betting market for

NFL games is run by Las Vegas bookmakers, who equilibrate the demand on each side of

a bet using a “point spread,” rather than odds (as in pari-mutuel betting). 27 If the point

spread is -3 for one team against another, the team must win by 3 points or more in order

for a bet on that team to pay off. The market assessment of the outcome of a game is

contained in the closing value of the point spread (the “closing line”). 28

         Previous research has suggested that the point spread is an unbiased predictor of

the actual outcome of the game (e.g., Gandar et al., 1988). To verify this conclusion, we

collected data on point spreads and final scores for all 3,725 NFL football game played

during the 1995 to 2006 seasons. Figure 2 shows the relationship between the actual and

predicted point spread in each game. As expected, the actual spread is “noisier” than the

predicted spread, but the two are positively correlated. In fact, a regression of the actual

spread on the predicted spread yields a coefficient of 1.01 (s.e. = 0.03). Thus, there is no

evidence against the null hypothesis of an efficient prediction. Moreover, the R-squared


27
   There is an extensive literature on the economics of NFL betting, including Pankoff (1968), Gandar et al
(1988), and Levitt (2004).
28
   As discussed by Levitt (2004), point spreads adjust relatively infrequently from their opening values and
bookmakers sometimes take relatively large positions in particular games. Levitt argues that these features
arise because bookmakers are better predictors than other bettors (i.e., that the “market” of individual
betters is biased). For our purposes the key feature of the spread is that it is the “best” prior estimate of
the outcome of the game.


16
of the relationship is relatively strong (0.20) suggesting that the Las Vegas point spread is

a reasonably informative predictor of game outcomes.

         The vertical lines in Figure 2 divide the predicted spreads into three regions,

depending on whether the home team is predicted to win by more than a field goal (a

spread of -3), predicted to have a close game (a spread of -3 to 3), or predicted to lose by

more than a field goal (a spread of +3). Roughly one-third games fall into each of these

regions. In our empirical analysis we use these three categories to classify games as

“predicted wins”, “predicted close games”, and “predicted losses” for the home team. 29

         Our theoretical model is written in terms of the ex ante probability of a home-

team win, rather than the point spread. The mapping between the two is shown in Figure

3. To derive this relationship we regressed the probability of a victory by the home team

on a third order polynomial in the spread. The fitted relationship follows the expected

“inverse S-curve” shape and is symmetric. For spreads of ±14 points (a range that

includes 98% of games) the probability of a win is approximately linear, with each one-

point increase in the spread translating into a 3% decrease in the probability of a win. For

games with a spread of less than -3 points (“predicted wins”) the probability of a home

team victory is 60% or greater. For “predicted losses” (spread > 3) the probability of a

win is 41% or less.

         Panel B of Table 3 summarizes the predicted outcomes of the 866 regular-season

Sunday games in our IPV analysis sample. Of these games, 316 (36%) were predicted

wins for the home team, 245 (28%) were predicted losses, and 305 (35%) were predicted

close games. The greater number of predicted wins than losses reflects the inclusion in

29
   Few games have a spread of zero, and there are no games with a spread of -0.5 or 0.5. This likely
reflects the fact that given the NFL’s overtime rules, tie games are rare events; only three games ended in a
tie during the entire period from 1995-2006.


17
our sample of two relatively successful teams (Denver and New England). We also

report the actual outcomes of the games: 70% of the predicted wins were in fact victories

for the home team, while only 32% of the predicted losses resulted in a victory. The

predicted close games are almost evenly split, consistent with the unbiasedness property

of the point spread.

         Panel B also shows two other important characteristics of the games in our

estimation sample that we exploit in later analyses: the starting time, and the likely

emotional salience of a game. The majority of games in the sample had a 1:00 PM

starting time, 26 percent had a 4:00 PM start time, and only 6% were nighttime games

(8:00 PM start time). We consider three measures of emotional salience: whether the

home team is still in playoff contention; whether the game was played against a

traditional “rival” team; and whether the game involved an unusually high number of

sacks, turnovers, or penalty yards. 30 A majority of games (70%) are played when the

team is still in playoff contention. Some 20% are played against a traditional rival. And

about 40% of games involve a relatively high number of sacks, turnovers, or penalty

yards. We define “highly salient” games as contests in which the home team was still in

playoff contention and either played against a traditional rival or had an unusual number

of sacks, turnovers, or penalty yards. By this criterion about 40% of the games in our

sample are highly salient.




30
   To develop an indicator for being in contention, we fit a series of models that related the likelihood of
advancing to the playoffs to the team’s win-loss record after various numbers of games played. We
classify a team as out of contention once the predicted probability (based on the historical record for teams
with a similar win-loss record at the same point in the season) is under 10%. We identify traditional
rivalries using information from Wikipedia. A list of the rival team pairs we use is available on request.


18
d. Fan Attachment to Local NFL Teams

       Another important feature of NFL football is that the games attract a lot of fan

interest. NFL Sunday football games are often the highest-rated program in a local

market (see footnote 5). To gauge the strength of fan attachment to the local teams in our

dataset, we purchased data on local television viewership from Nielsen Media Research

(“Nielsen”) for the six television markets that match the teams in our sample. Nielsen

measures viewership in each of these local markets (known as Designated Market Areas)

using metering devices attached to a random sample of television sets. The company

provides ratings information for each program shown in a local market: each rating point

represents 1% of all television households in a local market (whether or not a household’s

television is turned on).

       Panel C of Table 3 shows the Nielsen ratings for regular season Sunday football

games in the Designated Market Areas associated with the 6 teams in our estimation

sample. On average, one-fourth of all households watch their local team play on a typical

Sunday. For particularly compelling games, nearly one-half of all television households

tune in to watch. The strength of fans’ attachment to their local NFL team is illustrated

by the fact that on a Sunday with no home game, the viewing audience is only one-third

as large. These television viewing patterns suggest that emotional cues from local

football games should both be salient and affect a large number of intimate partners.

       Figure 4 plots the number of households watching a game versus the spread, for

the subset of games for which we were able to collect Nielsen data. Our model is

predicated on the assumption that fans strictly prefer to watch a win rather than a loss.

Consistent with this assumption, the local audience size is decreasing in the spread (i.e.,




19
increasing in the probability of a home-team victory). The regression line drawn in the

graph illustrates that for each one point increase in the spread, local audience size falls by

0.4 percentage points.



IV. Econometric Model and Main Estimation Results

a. Econometric Model

        Given the incident-based nature of NIBRS data, we specify a Poisson regression

model for the number of incidents of intimate partner violence reported by a given police

agency on a given Sunday of the regular NFL season. Specifically we assume that

(6)             log(μjt) = θj + Xjtγ + f(pjt, yjt; λ) ,

where μjt represents the expected number of incidents of IPV reported by agency j in time

period t, θj represents a fixed effect for the agency (which controls for the size and

overall characteristics of the population served by the agency), Xjt represents a set of

time-varying controls (e.g., seasonality variables, local weather variables, or the size of

the local television audience), and f(pjt, yjt; λ) is a general function of pjt, the probability of

a victory by the “home” NFL team for a game played on date t, and yjt,the actual game

outcome, with parameters λ. We assume that pjt = p(Sjt) where Sjt is the observed point

spread for the game, allowing us to write the model as

(6′)            log(μjt) = θj + Xjtγ + g(Sjt, yjt; λ) .

Our primary interest is in the effect of a loss or win by the home team, controlling for the

spread. Assuming that the Las Vegas betting market provides efficient forecasts of NFL

game outcomes, the actual outcome of a game is “as good as random” when we control

for the spread, and a specification like (6′) yields unbiased estimates of the causal effect




20
of a loss relative to a win. 31

         An advantage of a Poisson specification is that fixed effects can be included

without creating an incidental parameters problem (see Cameron and Trivedi, 1998).

This is potentially important in the NIBRS context because there are many small police

agencies with relatively low counts of family violence incidents. A second useful

property of a Poisson specification is that consistency of the maximum likelihood

estimates of the parameters of log(μjt) associated with the time-varying covariates (and in

particular, the parameters λ) only requires that we have correctly specified the conditional

mean for log(μjt) (Cameron and Trivedi, 1986). Consistency does not require that the

arrival process for IPV incidents is actually Poisson.



b. Baseline Empirical Results

         Table 4 presents results for our baseline Poisson regressions for at-home male-on-

female intimate partner violence occurring between the hours of 12 PM and 12 AM on

Sundays of the NFL regular season. In these specifications we assume that

          g(Sjt, yjt , λ) = λ1·1(Sjt < −3)          +    λ2·1(Sjt < −3) 1(yjt = 0)

                           + λ3·1(−3≤ Sjt ≤ 3) +         λ4·1(−3≤ Sjt ≤ 3) 1(yjt = 0)

                           + λ5·1( Sjt > 3)         +   λ6·1( Sjt > 3) 1(yjt = 1) ,

i.e., we include dummies for three ranges of the spread (predicted home team win

(Sjt<−3); predicted close game (−3≤ Sjt ≤ 3); predicted home team loss ( Sjt > 3)) and

interactions of these dummies with a game outcome indicator. The main coefficients of

interest are λ2, λ4, and λ6, which measure the effects of an upset loss, a close loss, and an

31
  Formally, for a binary random variable y with mean p, E[ y | p, Z] = E[ y | p] for any Z, so conditioning
on p, y is independent of Z. Assuming the mapping p(S) from the spread to p is invertible and does not
depend on Z, E[ y | S, Z] = E[ y | p, Z] = E[ y | p], so y is independent of Z conditioning on S.


21
upset win on the rate of IPV. The coefficients associated with the range of the spread

(λ1, λ3, λ5) are also potentially interesting, but less easily interpreted, since variation in S

may be correlated with other factors (like the size and composition of the viewing

audience) that affect the likelihood of IPV.

         The basic model in column 1 of Table 4 includes the spread and outcome

variables and municipality fixed effects. Columns 2-5 add in three sets of time-varying

covariates: year, week, and holiday dummies; local weather conditions on the day of the

game; and the Nielsen Rating for the local NFL game broadcast. The Nielsen data are

only available for the 90% of the game days in our sample that occur in 1997 or later. To

check the sensitivity of our results to the sample, we show in column 4 a specification

identical to the one in column 3 (with municipality fixed effects and date and weather

controls) but fit to the subsample with Nielsen data.

         Focusing on the coefficients associated with the game outcome (in the first three

rows of the table) notice that the estimates are quite stable across specifications, as would

be anticipated if the game outcomes are orthogonal to other covariates, conditional on the

spread. 32 The estimates suggest that an upset loss leads to an approximately 8% increase

in the rate of male-on-female at-home IPV. The point estimate of the effect of a loss

when the game is predicted to be close is about one-half as large in magnitude and not

significantly different from zero. The estimated effects of an upset win are positive but

again not significantly different from 0 in any of the models.

         The signs and relative magnitudes of these estimates are consistent with the

predictions of our simple model. Recall from equation (5) that the effect of a loss relative


32
  Estimates of the coefficients associated with the weather, seasonality, and holiday variables are jointly
significant and available on request from the authors.


22
to a win is predicted to be most negative when the ex ante probability of victory is high,

reflecting two complementary channels. When the home team is expected to win, more

violence-prone men are predicted to watch the game, and among watchers the emotional

cue of a loss is most negative when the probability of victory was high. Taken literally,

our estimates suggest the interaction effect is quite powerful: though an upset loss has a

fairly big effect on the rate of IPV, we see only small (1-2%) effects of an upset win.

        In column 5 we explore the effect of controlling for the number of households

tuned in to watch a local game. The Nielsen audience ratings are a significant factor in

game day violence, with intimate partner violence rising by almost 1% for each

percentage point increase in the number of households watching the game. Importantly,

however, the addition of this proxy for the number of couples at home together during a

game has no effect on the estimated impacts of the game outcomes. Since the results

with and without viewership controls are similar and the Nielsen data does not exist for

the first two years of our NIBRS dataset, in most of the remaining analyses, we do not

include the viewership controls. 33

        The models in Table 4 control for the pre-game point spread using a simple set of

indicators for 3 ranges of the spread. As an alternative, we fit a model with a second

order polynomial in the point spread and an interaction of this polynomial with a dummy

for a home team loss. (All other control variables are the same as in column 3 in Table 4.)

The implied effects of a home team loss for each value of the point spread are plotted in

Figure 5. As in the specifications in Table 4, the increase in at-home male-on-female

violence is a declining function of the spread. The pointwise confidence intervals


33

the authors.


23
indicate that this difference is significantly different from zero for spreads less than

approximately −3, which coincides with our definition of a predicted win. For predicted

close games (spreads between −3 and 3), there is a positive but declining impact of a loss

versus a win, which is not statistically different from zero. Finally, the curve is close to

zero for spreads greater than 3 (the predicted loss category).



V. Extensions and Robustness Checks

a. Intra-day Timing of Violence Reports

         Our baseline specifications examine the effect of NFL game outcomes on the rate

of IPV in the twelve hour period starting at 12 PM on the day of the game. Using NIBRS

information on the timing of incident reports (which is coded to the hour of the day) we

can refine these models and check whether the distribution of incidents over the day is

consistent with a causal effect of the game outcome. Since about 70% of games in our

sample started at approximately 1 PM Eastern Time and another 25% started at

approximately 4 PM ET, we fit separate models for incidents in various 3 hour time

windows, allowing separate coefficients for games starting at 1 PM versus 4 PM. 34 The

models – presented in Table 5 – include the Nielsen rating for the number of households

watching a game, although the estimated coefficients of the game outcomes are very

similar when this variable is excluded.

         Each column of Table 5 shows the effects of game outcomes on violence in a

different time window. For the 12 PM to 3 PM window (column 1) there is no significant


34
  We do not include separate coefficients for games starting at 8 PM for two reasons. First, there are very
few of these games (6% of the sample), so there are only a handful of upset losses, close losses, and upset
wins. Second, until 2007, these games were broadcast on cable/satellite, and therefore exposure to the
night games is much lower (see Table 3, Panel C).


24
effect of game outcomes on that day, regardless of when the football game actually

occurred. This is perhaps to be expected, since the game outcome has not yet been

decided for either the 1 PM or the 4 PM games. By comparison, for the 3 PM – 6 PM

window (column 2) there is a significant effect of the game outcomes for games that

started at 1 PM, but no significant effect of outcomes for 4 PM games. Interestingly, the

effect of the Nielsen rating of the game is also significant for 1 PM games, but not 4 PM

games. Since the 3 PM – 6 PM window includes the last hour or so of the 1 PM games

and roughly 2 post-game hours, but only the first half of the 4 PM games, we infer that

the violence associated with an unexpected loss occurs mainly after the game is over.

       Between the hours of 6 and 9 PM (column 3) there is no significant effect of an

upset loss for the 1 PM games, but a sizeable effect (a 34% increase in violence) for the 4

PM games. Interestingly, the upset win coefficient for the 4 PM games also provides the

first sign of a protective effect from a positive emotional cue (a 24% reduction in

violence) although the coefficient estimate is rather imprecise. Finally, during the 9 PM

to midnight interval (column 4), neither of the two upset loss coefficients is statistically

significant. In sum, while the standard errors are fairly large, especially for the less-

numerous 4 PM games, the data suggest that the spike in violence after an upset loss is

concentrated in a narrow time window surrounding the end of the game.



b. Emotionally Salient Games

       If the link between NFL game outcomes and violence arises through the impact of

emotional cues, as assumed in our model, then one might expect more “emotionally

salient” games to have larger effects on the rate of intimate partner violence. The




25
models in Table 6 explore the relative effects of game outcomes for more salient games

(upper panel) and less salient games (lower panel) using the measures of salience

introduced in Table 3. 35 In column 1, we define salience by whether the home team is

still in playoff contention (based on having at least a 10% chance of making the playoff).

Among such games the effect of an upset loss rises to 10%, while the effect of a close

loss rises to 6% and is also significant. In contrast, when the home team is no longer in

playoff contention the effect of an upset loss is small and statistically insignificant. As

shown in the third-to-last row in the table, the upset loss coefficients for the two game

types are statistically different from each other at the 10% level.

         Column 2 looks at games against a traditional rival team. Interestingly, the effect

of an upset loss is nearly twice as large for a rivalry game compared to a non-rivalry

game (14% versus 7%), although the difference is not statistically significant. There is

also a marginally significant increase in violence following an upset win against a rival –

a pattern that is inconsistent with our model, or with the overall finding that upset wins

tend to have a weak negative effect on IPV.

         Games that are particularly frustrating could also generate a larger emotional

response to an upset loss. In column 3 we look at the effect of 3 potentially frustrating

and relatively unusual occurrences: 4 or more sacks, 4 or more turnovers, or 80 or more

penalty yards. At least one of these events happens in 39% of the games in our sample.

For frustrating games defined in this manner, the estimated effect of an upset loss is 15%.

This effect is significantly different from the estimated 3% increase for non-frustrating

games.


35
  We fit the models in each column with a full set of interactions between the salience indicator and the 6
dummies representing the pre-game spread and its interaction with the game outcome.


26
         In the final column of Table 6, we restrict the sample to teams still in playoff

contention, and which are either playing a traditional rival or experience an unusual

number of sacks, turnovers, or penalties. While 72% of games have the local team still in

playoff contention, the percentage of playoff-contention games drops to 40% when

limited to traditional rivalries or frustrating games. The effect of an upset loss is now a

15% increase in IPV, compared to a 10% increase for all playoff-contention games in

column 1. Moreover, the effect of an upset loss is virtually zero for games which do not

fit these criteria, with a reasonably small standard error. The p-value for the difference in

the coefficients appearing in row (a) and row (b) is 0.01. We conclude that the overall

rise in IPV that we measure following upset losses is largely driven by the effect of losses

in games that “matter” more to fans.



c. Variation in Alcohol-Related Violence and Minor versus Serious Assaults

         Incidents of IPV vary substantially in their nature and severity. To gain some

insights into the kinds of incidents that are most affected by the emotional cues of NFL

game outcomes, we fit separate Poisson models for incidents with alcohol and/or drugs

involved, and for serious versus minor assaults. 36 The results are summarized in Table 7.

The results in column 1 suggest that alcohol-related incidents of IPV are somewhat more

affected by an upset loss than IPV incidents as a whole, though the standard errors of this

model are relatively large. The rate of minor assaults appears to be more responsive than

the rate of serious assaults (columns 2 and 3), though again the power of our sample is

limited. Overall, our reading is that all forms of IPV rise following an upset loss, with

36
  Recall that in about 20% of incidents the reporting officer notes that alcohol or drugs were a contributing
factor in the incident – these are the incidents with “alcohol involved.” Serious assaults include aggravated
assaults and all other incidents in which the victim was physically injured.


27
some indication that alcohol-related incidents rise more. We stress that this does not

necessarily mean that upset losses lead to greater alcohol use that causes more violence.

Instead, the emotional cue of an upset loss may be larger for men who have been drinking

heavily, causing a bigger rise in their rate likelihood of an interaction with their spouse or

girlfriend that escalates to violence. Some evidence on the latter channel is suggested by

Exum (2002), who presents an experimental demonstration that alcohol use amplifies the

effect of anger on intentions to commit aggressive behavior by young men.



d. Results by Location and Victim-Offender Relationship

        So far, we have focused on intimate partner violence against women occurring at

home. Table 8 examines the effect of NFL game outcomes on other categories of

intimate partner violence. For reference, the first column of Table 8 reproduces the

estimated effects for male-on-female at-home IPV from column 2 of Table 4. The

second column examines male-on-female violence away from home (which represents

about 20% of total male-on-female IPV). Perhaps surprisingly, the point estimate of the

effect of an upset loss on away-from-home violence is negative and marginally

significant (t=1.8). One (after-the-fact) explanation for this result is that couples who

have been out tend to return home earlier following the unhappy event of an upset loss,

shifting the venue for subsequent interactions that lead to violence. 37 Column 3 presents

a pooled model for all forms of male-on-female IPV, regardless of where it takes place.

Here we find a roughly 5% increase in violence for an upset loss, but no effect for the

other unexpected game outcomes.

37
  Note the number of municipalities falls to 583 compared to 765 in the model for at-home violence. This
occurs because agencies that appear in NIBRS for only a few years can have all zeros for away-from-home
male-on-female violence for every observation.


28
       As noted earlier, a major controversy in the family violence literature concerns

the victimization of men by their female partners. Female-on-male IPV is only about

one-fifth as prevalent as male-on-female IPV in the NIBRS. The model in column 4 of

Table 8 shows that NFL game outcomes have no large or significant effect on the rate of

female-on-male violence. This could be because women are less likely to be emotionally

engaged in professional football, or because women’s aggression is less responsive to

emotional cues.   Finally, the last two columns of Table 8 break out at-home male-on-

female IPV into violence against wives (column 5) and violence against girlfriends and

unmarried partners (column 6). Both forms of violence increase following an upset loss,

with a larger estimated effect on wives. The standard errors on the effects are large

enough, however, that we cannot reject an equal effect (t=0.9).



e. Robustness to Sample Definitions and Other Issues

       One issue with NIBRS is that agencies sometimes fail to provide data for one

reason or another, creating “gaps” in coverage. Unfortunately, with the public use files

there is no way to distinguish between a reporting gap and a period during which there

were no reported crimes. This problem mainly affects smaller agencies (e.g., police

forces in small towns or sheriff departments in small rural areas). For larger agencies, a

period with no reported incidents of crime is very unlikely. In our main analysis we have

assumed that the data for days where an agency does not report a crime incident of any

type (not just family violence) for an entire 24 hour window is “missing at random”.

       As a robustness check, we alternatively set the rate of violence to zero for these

days. Reassuringly, our main results are very similar whether we treat “no crime” days




29
as missing or true zeros: treating the “no crime” days as missing at random yields our

baseline estimate of 0.080 on the rate of male-on-female at-home IPV, while treating the

“no crime” days as zeros yields an estimate of 0.078 (see Appendix Table 1, column 2).

We also re-estimated the model, limiting the sample to agencies with no “no crime” days

for the entire 17 weeks of any given season. As shown in column 3 of Appendix Table 1,

the estimated effect falls slightly to 0.067, although this is partly due to the fact that upset

losses appear to have a smaller effect on the rate of IPV in larger cities than in smaller

cities (see columns 4 and 5 of the Appendix Table), and cities without any missing crime

data are on average larger.

         As is well known, the Poisson model implies that the mean number of events and

the variance of the number of event are equal – a restriction that is often violated.

Typically, instead, researchers find that the variance is larger than the mean, a condition

known as “over-dispersion.” With fixed jurisdiction effects this problem may be less of

an issue, as much of the variation will be absorbed by the fixed effects. To assess

whether over-dispersion is likely to be an issue even after adding in fixed effects,

however, we estimated a Negative Binomial model with agency fixed effects (see column

6 of Appendix Table 1). 38 The estimates are very similar to the baseline Poisson

estimates, with the estimated effect of an upset loss equal to an 8.4% increase in IPV.

         Our baseline model includes fixed effects for year (12 years), week of the football

season (17 weeks), and several holidays which occur during the regular football season (9

holidays). As an alternative, we saturate the Poisson regression with dummies for each of


38
  A negative binomial specification is appropriate if the mean of the Poisson process includes an
unobserved random effect that is distributed as a Gamma random variable. This model includes an
additional parameter (related to the variance of the random effect) that shifts the variance of the counts in
any observed area and time period relative to the mean.


30
the different Sundays included in our sample (204 Sundays). The results are again

similar to the baseline (see column 7). With the full set of Sunday fixed effects, the

estimated effect of an upset loss is .074 compared to the baseline estimate of .080. The

standard error on the upset loss coefficient increases by roughly 20 percent, which is

perhaps to be expected since there are only 1,054 local regular season Sundays

distributed over the 204 Sundays in our sample.

       Finally, we also estimated separate models for different age categories of

offenders and for violence against a victim other than an intimate partner. In columns 8

and 9, we classify incidents of male-on-female IPV by the age of the offender (i.e., the

male partner). We find that the effect of upset losses have a slightly larger effect on the

rate of violence committed by offenders under the age of 30 (9.7%) than those over age

30 (7.5%) but the gap is not statistically significant. In column 10, we consider violence

committed against any family member other than an intimate partner, such as violence

against a child, sibling, parent, or in-law. We find no evidence that unexpected emotional

cues from football games affect family violence defined in this way. Although not

shown, we also find no evidence that upset losses matter for the narrower category of

violence against a child, although the estimates are imprecise given the relative rarity of

such incidents. In the final column of the Appendix Table, we examine violence where

the victim is not a family member or intimate partner, but otherwise known to the

offender (e.g., a friend or neighbor). Interestingly, the pattern of coefficients in column

11 is very similar to what we find for intimate partner violence. An upset loss increases

“friend” violence by a statistically significant 7.7%, while a close loss has a 5.1% effect,

and an upset win has hardly any effect.




31
VI. Discussion

        Our empirical results show a roughly 8% effect of an upset loss by the local NFL

team on the rate of male-on-female at-home intimate partner violence. To provide some

context for the magnitude of this effect we estimated a set of Poisson models for the rate

of IPV on all days of the year for the 6 states of our estimation sample. These models

included agency fixed effects, an expanded set of holiday dummies, dummies for the day

of the week, the month, and the sample year, and the same set of weather controls

included in our main models. 39 The resulting estimates (available on request) show large

and precisely estimated effects of major holidays on the rate of IPV: for example,

Christmas day +17%, Thanksgiving +22%, Memorial Day +30%, New Year’s Day

+19%, New Year’s Eve +32%, and the Fourth of July +28%. They also show a

significant positive effect of hotter weather: relative to a day with a maximum

temperature less than 80 degrees, IPV is 8-10% higher when the maximum temperature is

over 80. Thus, an upset loss is comparable to the effect of a hot day, or about one-quarter

of the effect of a holiday like Memorial Day or New Years Eve. We view the magnitude

of the cueing effect attributable to an upset loss as rather large, considering that only a

fraction of the population are serious football fans, and that our samples largely exclude

the cities in which the NFL teams are located (though they often include nearby suburbs).

        From a broader perspective we draw two main conclusions from our findings.

First, at least a fraction of intimate partner violence appears to represent expressive

behavior that is triggered by payoff-irrelevant emotional shocks, rather than strategic

instrumental violence that is used to control an intimate partner. We emphasize that we

from noon to midnight only.


32
are not arguing against an instrumental interpretation of an important share of family

violence. Rather, our results show that a loss-of-control paradigm may be useful in

understanding some part of intimate partner violence. Second, there appears to be

empirical support for use of a gain-loss utility framework (with a “rational” reference

point) for interpreting the effect of emotional cues on the loss of control in intimate

partner interactions. We suspect that the same framework may prove useful in other

settings where economists are trying to model the effect of visceral influences on

observed behavior.

Notes: Starting times of games are approximate. See notes to Table 6 for definitions of “Exciting or Frustrating
Games.” Nielsen ratings begin in 1997 for Carolina, Denver, Detroit, and New England; 1998 for Tennessee; and
2000 for Kansas. The Nielsen ratings for the 8 PM games do not include the 2006 season, as the broadcasts
switched from cable/satellite (ESPN/TNT) to an over the air network (NBC) in 2006. Average ratings for the 8 PM
games in 2006 are 33.9% and 9.1% when the local team is playing and not playing, respectively.

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. See notes to Table 4. Each column is a separate model which allows for
separate coefficients by game type. Still in playoff contention indicates that a team has a greater than 10% chance of
making the playoffs given their current win-loss record, based on the probability that any NFL team made the
playoffs with such a win-loss record between 1995 and 2006. Traditional rivals indicates a game between
traditional rivals, as defined by “Rivalries in the National Football League” on Wikipedia. The row labeled “p-value
for row (a) – row (b)” reports the p-value for the test of whether the coefficient reported in row (a) is significantly
different from the coefficient reported in row (b).

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. See notes to Table 4. In columns 1-9, the dependent variable is at-home, male-on-female intimate partner violence. In
the baseline model, if there is a day with no crime of any type (not just IPV) reported to NIBRS, that day is dropped and treated as missing at random. Column 2
alternatively treats these missing days as days with zero IPV. Column 3 only includes municipalities in a given season if the agency reports incident data for all
17 Sundays of the regular football season; this subsample is composed primarily of larger municipalities. Column 7 includes dummies for the different Sundays
included in our sample (204 Sundays). The final three columns use different dependent variables for incidents occurring at home: column 10 uses violence
committed against any family member except an intimate partner (for example, a child, sibling, parent, or in-law), column 11 uses violence against a friend,
acquaintance, neighbor, or otherwise known victim who is not a family member or intimate partner.
