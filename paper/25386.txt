We construct and estimate a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model that features demand-
and supply-side uncertainty. Using term structure and macroeconomic data, we find sizable
effects of uncertainty on risk premia and business cycle fluctuations. Both demand-side and
supply-side uncertainty imply large contractions in real activity and an increase in term premia,
but supply-side uncertainty has larger effects on inflation and investment. We introduce a novel
analytical decomposition to illustrate how multiple distinct risk propagation channels account for
these differences. Supply and demand uncertainty are strongly correlated in the beginning of our
sample, but decouple in the aftermath of the Great Recession.

1        Introduction

It is well-established that broad measures of macroeconomic and financial market uncertainty vary signifi-

cantly over time.1 There is also an emerging literature interested in studying how these changes in uncertainty

affect business cycle fluctuations in micro-founded general equilibrium models. With a few exceptions, this

literature tends to find that uncertainty is not among the main sources of macroeconomic fluctuations.

However, these papers typically only use macroeconomic data to pin down the effects of uncertainty, con-

sider only one source of uncertainty, and rely on calibration exercises in which the process for uncertainty

is separately estimated.2 In this paper, we use both macroeconomic and term structure data, distinguish

between demand-side and supply-side uncertainty, and conduct a structural estimation of a micro-founded

model in which the process for uncertainty and its effects are jointly estimated. Our results demonstrate

that uncertainty matters. In particular, we uncover sizable effects of uncertainty shocks on business cycle

and term premia dynamics. The specific effects of demand-side and supply-side uncertainty are examined

through multiple endogenous risk propagation channels.

        Asset prices contain valuable information about uncertainty, given that changes in macroeconomic un-

certainty generate fluctuations in risk premia. We find that changes in nominal term premia contain key

identifying information disciplining the effects of uncertainty and its propagation through various risk chan-

nels. At the same time, there is empirical and anecdotal evidence suggesting that changes in measures of

uncertainty are related to heterogeneous sources (e.g., Bloom (2014)) and are also imperfectly correlated.

Figure 1 plots various uncertainty measures whose pairwise correlations range between -0.30 to 0.85. We

find it important to distinguish between different sources of uncertainty, and we explicitly model fluctuating

demand and supply uncertainty. We identify demand uncertainty as originating from shocks to the time

discount factor while supply uncertainty as emanating from shocks to TFP growth. In particular, we show

that these two types of uncertainty act through distinct channels. Finally, jointly estimating the process

for uncertainty and its effects on the economy has the important implication that uncertainty is not only

identified via changes in stochastic volatility, but also through its first-order effects on the economy.

        Our quantitative analysis is based on a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model along the

lines of Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005), but with the following departures. First, we assume that

the representative household has Epstein and Zin (1989) recursive preferences to capture sensitivity towards

low-frequency consumption growth and discount rate risks. Second, we allow for stochastic volatility changes

in TFP and preference shocks, both modeled as distinct Markov chains, estimated jointly within our DSGE

model. Changes in stochastic volatility and the endogenous response of the economy to these changes

both contribute to fluctuations in uncertainty. Third, we use an iterative solution method to endogenously

capture sizable and time-varying risk premia. By modelling stochastic volatility as regime changes, we obtain

a conditionally log-linear solution that facilitates an estimation using a modification of the standard Kalman

filter. Lastly, we use data on nominal bond yields across different maturities in our estimation.

    Our solution method captures the first- and second-order effects of uncertainty on agents’ decision poli-

cies, as well as effects on conditional risk premia. We show that this feature of our solution method sharpens

the identification of uncertainty dynamics. In addition, our solution method provides an approximate an-

alytical risk decomposition that uncovers distinct risk propagation channels for which uncertainty affects

macroeconomic fluctuations. We use the risk decomposition to illustrate how uncertainty shocks produce

different effects depending on the origin (e.g., demand or supply). Our analysis therefore provides an eco-

nomic interpretation for why there is not a consensus on the macroeconomic effects of uncertainty shocks.

More broadly, our risk decomposition can be utilized in a wide range of dynamic stochastic models, and is

therefore of independent interest.

    Figure 2 illustrates the strong relation between real activity, measured as detrended GDP, the slope of the

nominal yield curve, and macroeconomic volatility.3 As the economy enters a recession, the slope of the yield

curve and macroeconomic volatility both tend to rise. In our model, movements from low to high volatility

regimes endogenously trigger a decline in real activity and a steepening of the yield curve, consistent with

the data. We find that the effects of uncertainty are quantitatively significant. The two uncertainty shocks

together explain over 14% of the variation in investment growth, around 10% for consumption growth, and

28% for the slope of the nominal yield curve. These shocks also produce significant countercyclical variation

in the nominal term premium. The effects of uncertainty are even more sizable when focusing on fluctuations

at business cycle frequencies. An economy that is exclusively affected by uncertainty shocks would generate

business cycle fluctuations for consumption and investment as large as 24.5% and 31%, respectively, of an

analogue economy with both uncertainty and traditional level shocks.

    Both demand-side and supply-side uncertainty generate positive commovement between consumption and

investment, which is often a challenge for standard macroeconomic models. Thus, uncertainty shocks emerge

as an important source of business cycle fluctuations. However, the origin of uncertainty plays an important

role, as the two types of uncertainty impact the economy in very distinct ways. Compared to demand-
    3
      Detrended GDP is obtained by applying a bandpass filter. Similar results hold if GDP is detrended using an HP
filter. The slope of the term structure is computed as the difference between the five-year yields and the one-year
yield. Macroeconomic volatility is measured as a five-year moving average of the standard deviation of GDP growth.

side uncertainty, supply-side uncertainty has larger effects on inflation and is relatively more important

for explaining fluctuations in investment. Furthermore, while in the first half of our sample, demand- and

supply-side uncertainty tend to move together, they decouple in the second half of the sample.

    Nominal term premia in our model is driven by time-varying demand and supply uncertainty. As such,

using the term structure of interest rates as observables in our estimation is important for disciplining the

effects of uncertainty. While both supply and demand uncertainty are important for the unconditional nom-

inal term premia, we find that the conditional dynamics of nominal term premia are mostly attributed to

variation in demand-side uncertainty through the inflation risk premia component. Therefore, the observed

term structure dynamics help to sharpen the identification of the two different sources of uncertainty. With-

out using term structure data in our estimation, the timing of the uncertainty shocks is quite different, the

volatility regimes are less persistent, and the effects of the uncertainty shocks on the macroeconomy are

smaller.

    To understand how uncertainty shocks affect the real economy and account for these differences, we use

an approximate model solution method that allows us to identify and quantify five distinct risk propagation

channels for uncertainty shocks that are labeled as precautionary savings, investment risk premium, inflation

risk premium, nominal pricing bias, and investment adjustment channel. The precautionary savings term

reflects the prudence of the representative household towards uncertainty about future income. This prudence

term arises through the households’ consumption-savings Euler equation. The investment risk premium term

emerges through the investment Euler equation, which depends on the covariance between the pricing kernel

and the return on investment. The inflation risk premium term shows up through the Fisherian equation,

and the nominal term premium imposes strong restrictions on this channel. The nominal pricing bias

arises in the Phillips curve due to the presence of nominal rigidities that makes firms more prudent when

setting nominal goods prices. Finally, the investment adjustment channel arises because of rigidities in the

household’s ability to immediately adjust investment to the desired level.

    Our decomposition of the risk propagation channels show that different forces contribute to generating

empirically realistic macroeconomic and asset pricing dynamics. The precautionary savings, investment risk

premium, and the nominal pricing bias terms are the most quantitatively important risk propagation channels

for business cycles. The parameters governing price stickiness, capital adjustment costs, and elasticity of

labor supply are critical for determining the effects from these risk propagation channels. Price stickiness

and labor supply elasticity are important for determining the sign and magnitude of the precautionary

savings channel, while capital adjustment costs are important for determining the sign and magnitude of the

investment risk premium channel. The degree of price stickiness and labor supply elasticity determines the


                                                     3
sensitivity of labor demand shifts to uncertainty changes. The degree of capital adjustment costs affects the

covariance of the return on investment and the stochastic discount factor, which determines the effect of the

investment risk premium channel. The degree of price stickiness is important for determining the effects of

the nominal pricing bias.

    The investment risk premium channel plays a key role in amplifying the response of investment to changes

in supply-driven uncertainty. The investment risk premium channel has opposite effects on investment for

supply- and demand-side uncertainty. The underlying reason is that physical capital is a poor hedge against

negative TFP shocks, but a good hedge for adverse preference shocks. In particular, demand and supply-side

shocks produce different signs in the covariance between the pricing kernel and the return on investment.

In response to a negative TFP shock, marginal utility increases but the value of physical capital decreases.

Therefore, investment in physical capital commands a positive risk premium with respect to TFP shocks.

In contrast, preference shocks produce the opposite pattern. A negative preference shock increases marginal

utility and the value of capital. Therefore, investment commands a negative risk premium with respect to

preference shocks. Consequently, when supply-side uncertainty increases, households have an incentive to

lower investment so as to reduce exposure to TFP shocks. Instead, when demand-side uncertainty increases,

households have an incentive to increase investment to hedge against preference shocks. Overall, this channel

plays a key role in explaining why the cumulative decline in investment to an increase supply-side (demand-

side) uncertainty is amplified (dampened).

    We then use our decomposition to understand the small response of inflation to demand-driven uncer-

tainty shocks, but a large response to supply-driven uncertainty. These inflation responses can be accounted

for by differences in how the precautionary savings and nominal pricing bias channels operate under the two

uncertainty shocks. Both demand- and supply-side uncertainty shocks trigger a strong precautionary savings

channel effect, which generates downward pressure on inflation. However, for demand-driven uncertainty,

another quantitatively important propagation channel is the nominal pricing bias, which is natural given

that level preference shocks are one of the main drivers of inflation dynamics. For demand-side uncertainty

shocks, the precautionary savings and nominal pricing bias channels have opposite effects on inflation that

cancel each other out, and consequently, the cumulative effect on inflation is close to zero. In contrast,

for supply-side uncertainty, the nominal pricing bias is not quantitatively important, since TFP growth

shocks are not important for explaining inflation dynamics. Therefore, the cumulative effect of an increase

in supply-side uncertainty is driven by the precautionary savings propagation channel, leading to a large

decline in inflation.

    Our paper relates to Basu and Bundick (2017) in that we also consider the role of the precautionary


                                                     4
savings channel, in conjunction with sticky prices, for the propagation of demand-side uncertainty shocks.

In our estimation, we find that this channel is quantitatively important. Thus, we complement the findings

of Basu and Bundick (2017), but differ along the following dimensions. First, we develop a novel analyt-

ical decomposition that unveils four additional risk propagation channels. In our estimation, we find that

two of these four channels, the investment risk premium and nominal pricing bias, are as quantitatively

important as the precautionary savings channel. Second, we conduct a structural estimation of our model

using macroeconomic and bond yield data instead of calibration. In our structural estimation the process

for uncertainty is not exogenously given, but jointly estimated with the rest of the model. We find that un-

certainty plays a key role for both macro and term structure dynamics. Finally, we allow for both demand-

and supply-side uncertainty changes, while Basu and Bundick (2017) only consider demand-side uncertainty

shocks. While both types of uncertainty shocks are important for explaining business cycles, we find that

the macroeconomic responses to these shocks to be quite different. For example, supply-side uncertainty

changes generate more severe recessions, with significantly larger effects on inflation and investment. Our

analytical decomposition allows us to carefully disentangle the economic margins that account for these

different responses.

    Our paper connects to the broader literature studying the impact of uncertainty shocks in macroe-

conomic models (e.g., Bloom (2009), Bloom, Floetotto, Jaimovich, Saporta-Eksten, and Terry (2012),

Bachmann and Bayer (2014), Fernández-Villaverde, Guerrón-Quintana, Rubio-Ramı́rez, and Uribe (2011),

Fernández-Villaverde, Guerrón-Quintana, Kuester, and Rubio-Ramı́rez (2015), Justiniano and Primiceri

(2008), Bianchi, Ilut, and Schneider (2014), Schaal (2017), Fajgelbaum, Schaal, and Taschereau-Dumouchel

(2017), and Saijo (2017), etc.). We differ from these papers in that we (i) allow for multiple sources of

uncertainty, (ii) conduct a structural estimation, (iii) use asset pricing data, in the form of nominal bond

yields in the estimation and a prior on the investment risk premium, to discipline the effects of uncertainty,

and (iv) do not deviate from the assumption of rational expectations.

    The pricing of consumption and volatility risks builds on the endowment economy models of Bansal and

Yaron (2004), Piazzesi and Schneider (2007), and Bansal and Shaliastovich (2013). However, we differ by

considering a general equilibrium framework with production, where the dynamics of stochastic consumption

volatility risks are linked to the time-varying second moments of structural macroeconomic shocks and to

the endogenous response of the macroeconomy to changes in the volatility of these shocks. Furthermore, our

production-based setting allows us to consider the endogenous feedback between risk premia and business

cycle fluctuations via uncertainty shocks. The role of preference shocks for generating a positive real term

premia relates to the endowment economy model of Albuquerque, Eichenbaum, Luo, and Rebelo (2016). We

build on this work, and show that time discount factor shocks also provide a novel endogenous source of

inflation risk premia in a New Keynesian framework.

    More broadly, our paper relates to an emerging literature studying asset prices in New Keynesian mod-

els (e.g., Bekaert, Cho, and Moreno (2010), Bikbov and Chernov (2010), Hsu, Li, and Palomino (2014),

Rudebusch and Swanson (2012), Dew-Becker (2014), Bretscher, Hsu, and Tamoni (2017), Weber (2015),

Kung (2015), and Campbell, Pflueger, and Viceira (2014)). With respect to these papers, we conduct a

structural estimation of a micro-founded model assuming continuity between how assets are priced by the

representative agent in the model and by the econometrician.

    This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a simplified model to introduce the decomposition

of the effects of uncertainty into five distinct risk channels. In this section, we also explain our solution

approach. Section 3 describes the full model. Section 4 contains the main results. Section 5 concludes.



2     Risk Propagation Channels

To illustrate the key model mechanisms and our solution method, we consider a simplified version of the

benchmark model used for structural estimation. We find that in a New-Keynesian model, uncertainty shocks

can be contractionary – even when the precautionary savings channel places upward pressure on investment

– due to the presence of four other risk propagation channels, unveiled in our analytical decomposition char-

acterized below. Thus, the overall effect of uncertainty is determined by how uncertainty propagates through

the different channels. Analyzing uncertainty changes through the lens of these risk propagation channels

helps us to understand (i) the heterogeneous effects of different uncertainty shocks on the macroeconomy,

(ii) the role of risk premia for imposing restrictions on the propagation channels, and (iii) how various model

frictions pin down the effect of the propagation channels. This approach can be applied to other models and

it is therefore of independent interest.

2.2       Log-linearization with risk-adjustment

 Our goal is to study the effects of uncertainty on both asset prices and the macroeconomy. If standard log-

linearization techniques were applied, all of the effects of uncertainty would be lost. Instead, we implement a

risk-adjusted log-linearization of the model (e.g., Jermann (1998), Lettau (2003), Backus, Routledge, and Zin

(2010), Uhlig (2010), Dew-Becker (2012), Malkhozov (2014), and Bianchi, Ilut, and Schneider (2014)). The

idea behind this approximation method is that all expectational equations are approximated assuming that

the variables are conditionally log-normal. The approximate solution indeed satisfies this condition, because

it is linear in the state variables. Then we solve a resulting system of linear expectational difference equations

augmented with an iterative procedure designed to capture a risk-adjustment component. This procedure

allows us to solve rational expectation models in which uncertainty is controlled by a Markov-switching

process by using solution methods that have been developed for log-linear approximations. It is important

to emphasize that we allow risk to affect not only asset prices, but also the policy functions controlling the

macroeconomic variables. This is crucial to study the effects of uncertainty on the macroeconomy.
       We apply the risk adjusted log-linearization to the first-order conditions and market clearing conditions
presented above. Define the risk-free rate, Rf,t as the return on a theoretical risk-free asset, which pays one

bond in real terms is uncertain. Indeed, the rate of return on this bond in consumption units depends on the

realization of inflation next period. Therefore, the covariance of inflation with the pricing kernel determines

the inflation risk premium on the short-term nominal bond. If inflation tends to be high when the marginal

utility of wealth is high, then nominal short-term bonds are risky and investors demand a risk premium for

holding them.
    We log-linearize and risk-adjust the equation characterizing the investment decision of the household,
Eq. (12), and use Eq. (31) to obtain:

The risk adjustment component in brackets embodies an investment risk premium. If the return on invest-

ment is low when the marginal utility of wealth is high, then the return on investment in physical capital

is risky and will command a risk premium. Therefore, in equilibrium, households will choose a level of

investment such that the expected investment return will be higher than the risk-free rate by an amount

sufficient to compensate them for the risk that they are exposed to.
    The expression for qrt is obtained by log-linearizing Eq. (11):

where ∆it     1    rit 1 rit     xt   1   is log investment growth. The risk adjustment term in this equation captures

the fact that when making an investment decision at time t, households consider its impact on the capital

adjustment costs at time t              1, which depends on investment growth ∆it                               1.   Therefore, the household takes

into account uncertainty about future investment growth and how it co-varies with the shadow value of

capital and the pricing kernel.
    Next, consider the price-setting decision of the intermediate firms. We apply the same risk-adjustment
technique to log-linearize the equation characterizing the price-setting decision of the intermediate firms
(Eq. (25)) to obtain the risk-adjusted Phillips Curve:

term captures a precautionary price-setting motive due to the presence of the price-adjustment costs. The

covariance term between inflation and the pricing kernel relates to the inflation risk premium. In addition,

the nominal pricing bias also depends on covariance terms between output and TFP with inflation.
    The rest of the equations, which are needed to close the system, do not have terms which depend on
expectations of the endogenous variables. As a result, a simple log-linearization suffices and no additional
risk-adjustment terms are needed:

Note that this equation is only required to compute the risk-adjustment terms.

     To summarize, based on the risk-adjusted log-linearization of the model above, we identify five risk

propagation channels through which uncertainty affects the economy: a precautionary savings motive channel

represented by the risk adjustment terms in the Eq. (33); an inflation risk premium channel represented by

the risk-adjustment terms in the equation for short-term nominal interest rate (Eq. (34)); an investment risk

premium channel captured by the risk adjustment terms in the intertemporal investment decision (Eq. (35));

a nominal pricing bias channel represented by the risk-adjustment terms in the Phillips Curve (Eq. (37)); a

investment adjustment channel captured by the risk adjustment terms in Eq. (36).

2.3     Solution Method

The key step for implementing our solution method is realizing that in a model in which stochastic volatility
is modeled as a Markov-switching process, uncertainty at time t only depends on the regime in place at time
t, denoted by ξt . Thus, the system of equations presented above can be written by using matrix notation as
in a standard log-linearization:

where the DSGE state vector St contains all variables of the model known at time t, Qξt is a regime-
dependent diagonal matrix with all standard deviation of the shocks on the main diagonal, εt is a vector
with all structural shocks, ηt is a vector containing the expectation errors, and the Markov-switching constant
Γξt captures the effects of uncertainty:

      However, we cannot compute the volatility terms in Γc,ξt without knowing the solution for St . This is
because to compute the one-step-ahead variance and covariance terms, we need to know how the economy
reacts to the exogenous shocks, εt , and the regime changes themselves. Therefore, we employ the following

                r c,ξ . This iterative procedure continues until the desired level of accuracy is reached. It
and then update Γ    t


is worth emphasizing that only Cξt depends on Γc,ξt , while the matrices, T and R, do not depend on it,

so we only need to iterate on Cξt . Furthermore, standard conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a

stationary solution apply, given that regime changes enter the model additively. Thus, we know that a finite

level of uncertainty exists, as long as a solution exists and the shocks are stationary.

      In the solution (Eq. 47), the matrices, T and R, are equivalent to a standard log-linear solution.

Therefore, conditional on the volatility regime, the dynamics of the model are the same as in a standard

log-linear solution. Volatility matters in two ways. First, like in log-linearized models, volatility affects the

size of the innovations, captured by Qξt . Second, volatility affects the level of uncertainty in endogenous

variables. Changes in uncertainty, in turn, impact the risk adjustment term, Cξt , which is not present in a

standard log-linear approximation. This term reflects the endogenous response of the economy to uncertainty

and it is a source of uncertainty itself. Thus, the overall level of uncertainty is larger than in a model with

no risk-adjustment. Thus, the risk adjustment term adjusts the levels of the variables, determines model

dynamics in response to a volatility regime change, and produces additional uncertainty.
     Rewrite Eq. (47) in the following form to emphasize dependence of the solution on structural parameters,
θ , the stochastic volatility processes, θv , and transition probability matrix, H:

Importantly, the Markov-switching constant, Cξt          C pξt , θv , θp , H q depends on the structural parameters
because for a given volatility of the exogenous disturbances, different structural parameters determine the

various levels of uncertainty. In a standard log-linearization, this term would always be zero. As shown

below, this approach allows us to capture salient asset pricing features despite having approximated a model

with a conditionally linear solution. Furthermore, given that agents are aware of the possibility of regime

changes, uncertainty also depends on the transition matrix, H. Finally, given that regime changes enter the

system of equations additively, the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a solution are not affected

by the presence of regime changes. The model can then be solved by using solution algorithms developed

for fixed coefficient general equilibrium models (Blanchard and Kahn (1980) and Sims (2002)). The model

can also be solved by using the solution algorithms explicitly developed for MS-DSGE models (Farmer,

Waggoner, and Zha (2009), Farmer, Waggoner, and Zha (2011), Cho (2016), and Foerster, Rubio-Ramı́rez,

Waggoner, and Zha (2016)), but these methods are more computationally expensive. The appendix shows

that the risk-adjusted log-linearization provides a good approximation of the model solution.

where the variables with a tilde denote log deviations of the corresponding variables from the deterministic

that the gross short-term nominal interest rate is an inverse of the price of a one-period nominal bond,

2.5      Uncertainty Decomposition

To understand the role of each of the five risk propagation channels described above, we consider a calibration

of the simplified model. The ensuing analysis shows that the overall effects of the different sources of

uncertainty on the macroeconomy are pinned down by how uncertainty propagates through these different

channels. We find that in a New-Keynesian model, uncertainty shocks can be contractionary and generate

positive comovement between investment and consumption – even when the precautionary savings motive

works in the opposite direction – due to the presence of the four other channels.

      Figure 3 displays impulse response functions for an increase in the volatility of the preference shock



                                                                   16
(panel a) and of the TFP growth shock (panel b). An increase in demand uncertainty generates positive

comovement between consumption, investment, and output (solid red line). The other lines illustrate the

contribution to the overall effect of heightened uncertainty from the following propagation channels: precau-

tionary savings (dashed line), investment risk premium (line with circles), the nominal pricing bias (dotted

line) and investment adjustment channel (dotted line with diamond markers). The inflation risk premium

is not quantitatively important in this calibration and have small overall effects on the economy. Therefore

we plot it separately on a different scale (see Figure 4). The effects of the individual propagation channels

on each variable differ depending on the origin of uncertainty. Importantly, the degree of price adjustment

and capital adjustment costs are important for determining the sign and magnitude of these channels.

     With higher supply or demand uncertainty, the precautionary savings channel increases the desire

for saving, reflected in the drop in consumption and a rise in investment. This effect is reflected in the

variance of marginal utility growth, given by Eq. (33). In this calibration, we only have a moderate degree

of price adjustment costs, however with a sufficiently high degree of price stickiness, higher uncertainty will

generate a large enough downward shift in labor demand that translates to a fall in investment, labor hours,

and output, which is the mechanism that Basu and Bundick (2017) uses to produce positive comovement

between macroeconomic aggregates. Importantly, our decomposition in this example illustrates how other

risk propagation channels – namely, the investment risk premium, nominal pricing bias, and investment

adjustment – can also help to offset the positive investment response from the precautionary savings channel

to deliver a negative overall investment response to an increase in uncertainty.

    The sign of the investment risk premium channel depends mainly on the covariance between the return

on investment and the pricing kernel (see Eq. 35). This covariance is determined by the response to the

level shocks, and the impulse responses are depicted in Figure 5. The level preference and TFP shocks give

rise to negative comovement between the return on investment and the real stochastic discount factor, which

translates into a positive investment risk premium, on average. Therefore, when uncertainty increases, either

with demand or supply, the investment risk premium rises, as investing in capital becomes riskier; and in

equilibrium, investment declines. The fall in investment generates a subsequent decline in output. The fall

in investment also leads to an increase in consumption through the resource constraint.

    The effect of the investment risk premium channel is not quantitatively large for demand-side uncertainty,

because the response of the return on investment to a level preference shock is quantitatively small (see the left

panel in figure 5). Therefore, the preference shock contributes relatively little to the riskiness of investing

in capital. In contrast, for supply-side uncertainty changes, the investment risk premium channel is the

most important for determining the investment response. It is also worth noting that the investment risk


                                                       17
premium channel is most important for determining the dynamics of investment relative to its effect on other

macroeconomic quantities. The equity premium is closely tied to the investment risk premium in the model,

and consequently, in our structural estimation, we require this term to be positive on average, and we verify

that it increases with an increase in investment risk.

    The investment adjustment channel depends on the volatility of future investment growth, and how it

comoves with the real stochastic discount factor and marginal q (see Eq. 36). Both level supply- and demand-

side shocks produce similar comovement between these variables, and therefore, both types of uncertainty

propagates through this channel in a similar way. They lead to a decline in investment and output, while

also having a small positive effect on consumption. Qualitatively, the effect is similar to how an uncertainty

shock propagates through the investment risk premium channel.

    The nominal pricing bias channel depends on (i) the variance of inflation and (ii) the covariance between

inflation and the real stochastic discount factor, output, and TFP growth (see Eq. 37). The variance

term relates to a precautionary price-setting effect highlighted in Fernández-Villaverde, Guerrón-Quintana,

Kuester, and Rubio-Ramı́rez (2015) that creates a desire for firms to increase prices more when uncertainty

is higher in the presence of sticky prices. However, the sign of the overall effect of the nominal pricing

bias also depends on the comovement between inflation and the pricing kernel, output, and TFP, which are

determined by the responses to the level shocks depicted in Figure 5. A demand shock generates positive

comovement between inflation and the real stochastic discount factor, while a TFP shock generates negative

comovement. Consequently, the response of the macroeconomy to an increase in TFP growth volatility has

the opposite sign with respect to the response to an increase in the volatility of preference shocks. Therefore,

the source of the uncertainty shock plays an important role in determining its effects through this channel.

    As mentioned earlier the inflation risk premium channel has small quantitative effects in this calibration,

however for completeness, we provide economic intuition for how the effects of this channel are determined.

The inflation risk premium channel depends on the covariance between the stochastic discount factor and

inflation (see Eq. 34). In Figure 5, we can see that in this calibrated example, a preference shock generates

positive comovement between inflation and the real stochastic discount factor (therefore, positive nominal

term premium), while the technology shock generates negative comovement (therefore, negative nominal term

premium). Given the different signs in the covariances, supply-side and demand-side uncertainty generate

opposite responses (Figure 4).

    Both the nominal pricing bias and the inflation risk premium channels depend on the covariance between

the real pricing kernel and inflation, and are therefore tightly linked to nominal term premia. Hence, we can

discipline these channels using asset pricing data, namely, nominal bond yields across different maturities. As


                                                         18
we show below, in the estimated model, both supply-side and demand-side uncertainty contribute positively

to term premia, albeit through two very different mechanisms.



3        Quantitative Model for Estimation

In this section, we describe the full model used for the structural estimation. We enrich the simplified model

from the section above with a series of ingredients that have been proven important to match macroeconomic

dynamics. We also allow for a rich set of shocks to show that even when additional disturbances are intro-

duced, uncertainty plays a key role in explaining the bulk of business cycle and term structure fluctuations.

Overall the estimated model has seven exogenous shocks: preference, TFP growth, monetary policy shock,

markup, relative price of investment, government spending, and liquidity. We also allow for two stochastic

volatility processes to distinguish between supply-side (TFP) and demand-side (preferences) uncertainty.

The volatility processes are modeled as two independent Markov-chains, ξtS and ξtD , with transition matrices

H S and H D , where the letters, S and D, are used to label the supply- and demand-side shocks, respectively.
                                                                            (
We then obtain a combined chain, ξt                              ξtD , ξtS , with the corresponding transition matrix, H               H D bH S .
A detailed description of the model follows below.

4      Empirical Analysis

We estimate the model by using Bayesian methods. The sample 1984:Q2-2015:Q4 is considered. The model

solution retains the key non-linearity represented by regime changes, but it is linear conditional on a regime

sequence. Thus, Bayesian inference can be conducted using Kim’s modification of the basic Kalman filter

to compute the likelihood (i.e., Kim and Nelson (1999)). In addition to the priors on the single model

parameters, we also have priors on the unconditional means of inflation, the real interest rate, the slope


                                                                               22
of the nominal yield curve, and the investment risk premium. Unlike in a linear model, the unconditional

means of these variables are not pinned down by a single parameter. Thus, these priors induce a joint prior

on the parameters of the model, in a way similar to Del Negro and Schorfheide (2008). The priors for the

model parameters are combined with the likelihood to obtain the posterior distribution.

       Eleven observables are used: GDP per-capita growth, inflation, FFR, consumption growth, investment

growth, price of investment growth, one-year yield, two-year yield, three-year yield, four-year yield, and

five-year yield. Given that there are more observables than shocks (i.e., eleven variables compared to seven

shocks), we allow for observation errors on all variables, except for the FFR. We also repeated our estimation

excluding the zero-lower-bound period, with no significant changes in the results. Finally, alternative versions

of the model are estimated, such as, a specification in which both volatility processes are perfectly correlated

or another specification where all shocks exhibit stochastic volatility that are perfectly correlated, but these

versions did not lead to a better fit of the data. As it will become clear below, the data seems to favor a

separation between supply- and demand- side uncertainty shocks.


4.1       Parameter Estimates and Model Fit

Table 1 reports the posterior mean for the structural parameters together with the 90% error bands and the

priors. A few comments are in order. First, we fix the elasticity of intertemporal substitution to 1. Second,

the parameters controlling the magnitude of the price adjustment cost, φR , and the average markup, ν,

cannot be separately identified. Thus, when solving the model, we define and estimate the parameter,

κR      νφ1 ,
           R
                  while we fix the parameter, ν.6 The resulting estimated value for κR implies an elevated level

of price stickiness, in line with the existing New Keynesian literature. Third, in accordance with previous

results in the literature, we find a more than one-to-one response of the FFR to inflation, despite the long

time spent at the zero lower bound. The fact that the response is well above 1 guarantees that the Taylor

principle is satisfied.

       Table 1 reports estimates for the volatilities of the shocks and the persistence of the two regimes. Figure

6 reports the probability of the High volatility regimes (Regime 2 for each chain) for the preference shock

(top panel) and the TFP shock (bottom panel). The high volatility regime for the preference shock is less

persistent than the low volatility regime, while the opposite is true for the high TFP-volatility regime.

       Figure 7 compares the variables as implied by our model with the observed variables. Recall that we

have observation error on all variables except for the FFR. The figure shows that the model does a very good
   6
    The average markup (ν) affects the steady state of the model. For the purpose of computing the steady state
we fix this parameter to 6, a value that implies an average net markup of 20% and that is considered in the ballpark
(see Gali (1999)).

job in matching the behavior of both the macro variables and the term structure. We observe some visible

deviations between model-implied and observed variables only for the growth rate of the price of investment.

Thus, observation errors do not play a key role in matching the observed path for yields and macro variables.

The last panel of the figure also shows that the model tracks very well the behavior of the slope of the yield

curve, defined as the difference between the one-year and five-year yields. As we will see below, variations

of the term premium over the business cycle play a key role in generating such a close fit.


4.2     The Effects of Uncertainty

Given that the model allows for two TFP volatility regimes and two preferences volatility regimes, there are

a total of four regimes labeled as follows: (i) Low Preference-Low TFP volatility; (ii) Low Preference-High

TFP volatility; (iii) High Preference-Low TFP volatility; and (iv) High Preference-High TFP volatility. We

are interested in characterizing the level of uncertainty across the four regimes. Uncertainty is computed

taking into account the possibility of regime changes, following the methods developed in Bianchi (2016).

For each variable, zt , we measure uncertainty by computing the conditional standard deviation, sdt pzt            s   q
a                   b
  Vt pzt   s   q   Et rzt   s    Et pzt s qs2 , where Et pq  E p|It q and It   denotes the information available at

time t. We assume that It includes knowledge of the regime in place at time t, the data up to time t, and

the model parameters for each regime, while future regime realizations are unknown. These assumptions

are consistent with the information set available to agents in our model, and so our measure of uncertainty

reflects uncertainty supposedly faced by the agent in the model across the four regimes. Note that there

are two sources of uncertainty. The first one is straightforward: As the size of the Gaussian shocks hitting

the economy increases, uncertainty goes up. The second one is more subtle: The endogenous response of

the macroeconomy to uncertainty is in itself a source of uncertainty. Thus, the magnitude of the response

to uncertainty and the frequency of regime changes matter for the overall level of uncertainty. The relative

contribution of these two sources of uncertainty are described in detail below.

      Figure 8 reports the levels of uncertainty across the different regimes. The time horizon s appears on

the x-axis. Solid and dashed lines are used to denote Low and High preference shock volatility regimes,

respectively. Conditional on these line styles, we use lines with dots and without dots to denote Low and

High TFP shock volatility, respectively. Not surprisingly, when both demand-side and supply-side volatilities

are high (dashed-line with dots), uncertainty is high for all variables at all horizons. When only one of the

shocks is in the high volatility regime, the effects differ across the variables. For inflation, the FFR, and

the slope of the yield curve, the main driver of uncertainty is the volatility of the preference shock. Instead,

uncertainty about the growth rate of the real variables is higher when TFP is in the high volatility regime.


                                                              24
It is also interesting to notice that uncertainty for consumption and GDP is slightly hump-shaped when

the High TFP volatility regime prevails. In other words, when TFP volatility is high, uncertainty is not

monotonically increasing with the time horizon, as agents are more uncertain about the short-run than the

long-run. This is because two competing forces are at play. On the one hand, events that are further into

the future are naturally harder to predict, as the possibility of shocks and regime changes increase. On the

other hand, in the long run, the probability of still being in the high volatility regime declines.

     Figure 9 presents a simulation to understand the impact of these changes in uncertainty on business

cycle fluctuations and the term structure. We take the most likely regime sequence, as presented in Figure

6, and simulate the economy based on the parameters at the posterior mode, setting all Gaussian shocks to

zero. The top left panel reports the cyclical behavior of GDP and the slope of the yield curve implied by

the model. An increase in uncertainty produces a drop in real activity and an increase in the slope of the

yield curve, which consequently generates negative comovement between the slope of the yield curve and

real activity, as in the data (e.g., Ang, Piazzesi, and Wei (2006)). The four panels in the second and third

row of the figure compare the movements in the slope, GDP, consumption, and investment, induced by the

increase in uncertainty, with the business cycle fluctuations of the actual series. The estimated sequence of

the volatility regimes produces business cycle fluctuations and changes in the slope of the yield curve in a

way that closely tracks the observed fluctuations in the data.

    The fluctuations in uncertainty also lead to significant breaks in the term premium. Term premium is

defined as the difference between the yield on a 5-year bond and the expected average short-term yield (1

quarter) over the same five years (following Rudebusch, Sack, and Swanson (2006)). The expected value

is computed taking into account the possibility of regime changes using the methods developed in Bianchi

(2016). The top-right panel of Figure 9 shows that both supply-side and demand-side uncertainty lead to an

increase in the term premium. Specifically, Table 4 shows that the nominal (real) term premia associated

with the different regimes are: (1) Low Preference - Low TFP volatility: 0.58% (0.33%); (2) Low Preference

- High TFP volatility: 0.84% (0.60%); (3) High Preference - Low TFP volatility: 1.03% (0.51%); and (4)

High Preference - High TFP volatility: 1.29% (0.78%). In Subsection 4.4, the mechanisms that lead to these

sizeable premia are explored in detail. For now, we are highlighting that term premia are large and vary

considerably in response to changes in uncertainty.

    Our estimated model allows for a rich set of shocks to avoid forcing the estimation to artificially attribute

a large role to the uncertainty shocks. The results presented above suggest that uncertainty shocks can in

fact lead to sizeable fluctuations for both the macroeconomy and bond risk premia. In order to formally

quantify the importance of uncertainty shocks with respect to the other disturbances, we proceed in two


                                                      25
steps. First, we compute a variance decomposition by comparing the unconditional variance, as implied by

the model when only one shock is active, to the overall variance. Second, we explore how much variation

in endogenous variables at business cycle frequencies can be generated by uncertainty shocks. We do this

by computing the volatility of business cycle fluctuations in an economy where only uncertainty shocks are

present and comparing it to the volatility of business cycle fluctuations in an economy where both uncertainty

and level shocks are active.7

       The decomposition of the unconditional variance for the observables is reported in the left panel of

Table 2. The results confirm that uncertainty shocks play an important role in explaining fluctuations in

the slope of the yield curve (28% of the unconditional variance), but they also account for a large fraction

of the variability of consumption and investment growth (14.26% and 9.67%, respectively). The right panel

of Table 2 highlights that uncertainty shocks appear even more important if we focus on their ability to

generate sizable business cycle fluctuations. Uncertainty shocks explain a substantial part of the variation

in consumption, investment, and output over the business cycle. In particular 24.52% of the variation in

consumption and around 31% of the variation in investment at business cycle frequencies can be explained

by uncertainty shocks. Finally, uncertainty shocks also explain 38.44% of business cycle variation in the

slope of the yield curve, confirming the evidence presented in Figure 9.

       Finally, the variance decomposition in the left panel of Table 2 shows that the combination of TFP

shocks, preference shocks, and their corresponding volatility shocks accounts for a very large fraction of the

volatility of the macroeconomy and bond yields. Specifically, these shocks combined account for more than

80% of the variance of GDP growth, for more than 90% of the variance of consumption growth, for more

than 85% of the variance of investment growth, and for almost 60% of the variance of inflation and the slope

of the term structure of interest rates. The only other shock that plays a significant role is the markup shock.

However, this shock only appears to account for high-frequency movements in the volatility of inflation, as

it is often the case in estimated New-Keynesian models. Thus, the combination of first and second moments

shocks to TFP and preferences account for the bulk of the volatility of the observed variables, despite the

fact that we allow for a series of other shocks, like the liquidity shock, that generally play a significant role in

the estimation of New-Keynesian DSGE models without the risk-adjustment. This suggests that extending

standard estimation technique to include the first-order effects of uncertainty shocks can significantly change

the importance of the other shocks, possibly allowing for more parsimonious models to explain the observed

fluctuations.
   7
    From a technical point of view the contribution of uncertainty shocks is given by the amount of volatility generated
by the Markov-switching constant.

4.3     Inspecting the Mechanism

To better understand the mechanisms at work, we decompose the effects of the uncertainty shocks into the

five risk propagation channels that were discussed in the context of the simplified model of Section 2: Pre-

cautionary savings, investment risk premium, inflation risk premium, nominal pricing bias, and investment

adjustment. The results show that the origins of uncertainty are important to understand its effects.

      Figure 10 presents the median and 90% error bands for the impulse responses to a demand-side (dashed

line) and a supply-side (solid line) uncertainty shock, while Figure 11 presents the median and 90% error

bands for the difference between these impulse responses. Impulse responses are computed as the change

in the expected path of the endogenous variables following an initial impulse, in line with the way impulse

responses are computed for shocks to levels. Specifically, these impulse responses assume a shift from low to

high uncertainty in the first period, but from that point on they are computed integrating out future regime

changes. Thus, the impulse responses are conceptually different from the simulations reported in Figure 9

where the posterior mode regime sequence was imposed.

      Despite these technical differences that take into account uncertainty about the future regime path,

uncertainty shocks still emerge as a driving force of the business cycle. Both demand- and supply-side

uncertainty shocks generate positive comovement between consumption, investment, output, as there is an

economic contraction following heightened macroeconomic uncertainty. Also, higher uncertainty increases

the nominal and real slope and term premia, consistent with the observed dynamics in the data. However, a

supply-side uncertainty shock leads to a much larger decline in inflation. Furthermore, the recession generated

by a supply-side uncertainty shock is visibly larger, as confirmed by the first row of Figure 10. The effects

on term premia are also quantitatively different, with the supply-side uncertainty shock generating a smaller

increase in the nominal term premium and a larger increase in the real term premium.

      Figure 12 decomposes the effect of uncertainty increases for preferences (Panel a) and in TFP (Panel b).

Note that, in contrast to the calibrated simplified model presented above, the precautionary savings channel

generates positive comovement between consumption, investment, and output. In our estimated model, the

magnitude of price adjustment costs is sufficiently high that it flips the sign of investment (due to a larger

downward shift in labor demand). However, while this channel plays a key role in driving consumption down

following an uncertainty shock, other channels play an equally important role to understand the effects of

uncertainty on the other macroeconomic variables.

      When the economy experiences a supply-side uncertainty shock, the investment risk channel is equally

(and at certain horizons more) important than the precautionary savings channel in determining a decline




                                                      27
in investment. On the other hand, when the economy experiences a demand-side uncertainty shock, the

risk propagation channel works in the opposite direction and mitigates the decline in investment. Thus,

demand and supply uncertainty propagate differently through the investment risk premium channel. The

difference is determined by how the shadow value of capital responds to adverse demand and supply shocks

(figure 13). For the household, capital works as a hedge against adverse preference shocks, because the

return on investment is positive in a state of the world with high marginal utility of wealth (high SDF). The

opposite is true for a negative TFP shock, as the return on investment is negative in the high SDF state.

So, when supply side uncertainty increases, the effect of the investment risk premium channel is driven by

investment becoming riskier and households, keeping all else equal, optimally choosing to cut investment. In

contrast, when demand uncertainty increases, investment becomes less risky and the effect of this channel

is determined by the household choosing a relatively higher level of investment than it would choose if

investment risk premium remained constant.

    Importantly, the net effect of demand-side uncertainty on investment is still negative because of the

combined effect of the precautionary savings and nominal pricing bias channels. Indeed, when the economy

experiences a demand-side uncertainty shock, the nominal pricing bias channel contributes to the decline in

consumption and investment. In response to an increase in demand-side uncertainty the nominal price bias

determines effects similar to a markup shock, given that it enters the New-Keynesian Phillips curve in an

isomorphic way. Inflation goes up, consumption and investment go down. This contributes to exacerbating

the recession while mitigating the effects on inflation.

    The decomposition also helps in understanding why the response of inflation is so muted in the two

cases. In both cases, the precautionary savings channel determines deflationary pressure. However, following

a demand-side uncertainty shock the pricing bias channel essentially nullifies the effects on inflation, while

in the case of the supply-side uncertainty shock this channel plays a very little role. To understand why, it is

useful to revisit the impulse responses presented in Figure 13. Inflation experiences a persistent increase in

response to a demand shock, while a supply shock has very little quantitative impact on inflation dynamics.

As a result, the nominal pricing bias channel is not quantitatively important for supply side uncertainty:

Firms do not adjust their price-setting decision, as supply side uncertainty has limited impact on uncertainty

about future inflation. In contrast, the preference shock is an important driver of inflation dynamics, and

demand-side uncertainty directly translates into uncertainty about future inflation. Hence, the nominal

pricing bias is an important determinant of the economy’s response to demand-side uncertainty.

     Finally the other two channels, inflation risk premium and investment adjustment, have small quanti-

tative effects.


                                                      28
4.4     Yield Curve

In this section, we provide more details about the fit of the model and the mechanisms at play by inspecting

the ability of the model of matching movements in the term structure. We already conducted a first check on

the fit of the model in Figure 7 showing that the yields across various maturities, as implied by our model,

track very closely observed yields despite allowing for observation errors on all variables, except for the FFR.

In what follows, we analyze how the model is able to match the dynamics of yields and the slope so closely.

    Table 3 reports the nominal and real yield curve as implied by our estimated model. Our model generates

an upward-sloping real and nominal yield curve with sizable average term spreads. Both preference and

TFP shocks are important for generating the unconditional real term premium, while the preference shock

is important for generating the unconditional inflation risk premium. It is worth emphasizing that in our

estimated model, the endogenous risk premium is significantly more important than the liquidity premium

in generating nominal premia and the only determinant of real premia. The liquidity premium is the

premium arising from a linear term that captures the preference of the household for short-term bonds, and

it is controlled by the parameter, ζB . Thus, liquidity shocks seem to play only a small role for explaining

business cycle fluctuations, and moreover, the liquidity premium seems less important in determining term

premia compared to the risk-based channels.

    The right side of Table 3 shows that the overall nominal term premium is 0.96%, generating an uncon-

ditional slope of the term structure very much in line with the data (1.05%). The risk premium accounts

for the bulk of the term premium: 0.90% Vs. 0.06%. The real term premium is 0.56% and it is all due to

the risk premium arising from the preference and TFP shocks. To understand the relative importance of

demand-side versus supply-side uncertainty in generating the premia, we consider a counterfactual simulation

in which the standard deviations of all shocks are set to zero, except for preference (TFP) shocks. When

only preference (TFP) shocks are allowed, the nominal term premium is 0.77% (0.29%), while with only

preference (TFP) shocks, the real term premium is 0.26% (0.34%). These results show that demand-side

uncertainty is relatively more important in determining the nominal term premium, while the two sources of

uncertainty contribute to the real term premia of a similar magnitude. Next, we study how the two sources

of uncertainty lead to sizable risk premia.

      Persistent shocks to time discount rates coupled with recursive preferences contributes significantly to

both the real term premia and inflation risk premia. To understand the mechanism behind this finding,

Figure 14 presents the impulse responses to such a shock for some key variables. A negative preference shock

(less patience) induces household to consume more and save less, which decreases the wealth-to-consumption




                                                      29
ratio. A drop in the wealth-to-consumption ratio implies a decline in the return on a claim to aggregate

consumption. When agents prefer an early resolution of uncertainty (ψ      ¡ 1{γ), a decrease in the return on
the consumption claim increases marginal utility. When the shock is persistent, this leads to a sharp increase

in marginal utility. A persistent negative time preference shock also increases the real rate persistently, which

erodes the payoffs of long real bonds more than short ones. Given that a negative time preference shock is

associated with high marginal utility, long real bonds provide less insurance against bad states of the world

relative to short real bonds. In equilibrium, this helps to generate an upward-sloping real yield curve and a

positive real term premia, in a way similar to Albuquerque, Eichenbaum, Luo, and Rebelo (2016).

     The time preference shock endogenously generates a negative relation between marginal utility and

inflation, which translates into positive inflation risk premia increasing with maturity. A persistent negative

time preference shock increases aggregate demand, which raises inflation persistently. The negative time

preference shock is also associated with high marginal utility as discussed above. Persistently higher inflation

erodes the value of long nominal bonds more than short nominal bonds during high marginal utility states.

Consequently, the nominal yield curve is upward-sloping.

    The persistent TFP growth shocks in conjunction with habits contributes positively to real term pre-

mia. A negative TFP growth shock decreases consumption today relative to habit (proportional to lagged

consumption), decreasing surplus consumption (i.e., the difference between consumption and habits), and

raising marginal utility. However, next period, the habit catches up and increases expected surplus consump-

tion growth. This induces a borrowing motive to smooth surplus consumption, which therefore increases

the real rate akin to Wachter (2006). A persistent increase in the real rate erodes the value of long-term

real bonds more than short-term ones. Therefore long-term real bonds provide less insurance against high

marginal utility states induced by negative TFP shocks, which contributes to the upward-sloping real yield

curve and positive real term premia. However, the TFP shocks do not generate significant inflation risk

premia as TFP shocks have a very small effect on inflation (see Figure 13). Therefore, the impact of TFP

shocks on the nominal term premia are primarily through the real term premia component.

     Table 4 illustrates how the dynamics of real and nominal term premia are driven by the preference

and TFP uncertainty shocks. As preference uncertainty shocks contribute significantly to the unconditional

real term premia and inflation risk premia, changes in demand-side uncertainty generates sizable variation

in the conditional real term premia and the conditional inflation risk premia. In contrast, TFP uncertainty

shocks mainly contribute to real term premia and not towards inflation risk premia since the level TFP

shocks mainly contribute to the unconditional real term premia. Quantitatively, changes in demand-side

uncertainty produce large fluctuations in term premia through the effects on inflation risk premia.

4.5     Informational Content of the Term Structure

Given the importance of demand- and supply-side uncertainty for term premia movements, the use of term

structure data in our estimation is crucial for identifying the overall effects of uncertainty and distinguishing

between the two types of uncertainty. Figures 15 and 16 plot the impulse response functions for demand

and supply uncertainty shocks from our benchmark estimation using term structure data (solid line) and an

estimation without using term structure data (dashed line). Interestingly, the estimated effects of demand-

side uncertainty are significantly amplified using term structure data than without, while the effects are

muted for supply-side uncertainty. As demand-side uncertainty is more important for nominal term premia

compared to supply-side uncertainty, including term structure data in the estimation therefore increases the

relative importance of demand-side uncertainty.

      Figure 17 illustrates that the inclusion of term structure data in the estimation affects the timing,

duration, and importance of uncertainty shocks. In particular, comparing this figure with Figure 9, it is

evident that using term structure data provides valuable information for the role of uncertainty in explaining

business cycle fluctuations. When the term structure is not included, periods of high uncertainty have a

shorter duration and produce smaller effects. Furthermore, in the 1991 recession there is no visible effect

from the increase in demand-side uncertainty, consistent with the impulse responses from Figure 15. Overall,

when the term structure is not included, liquidity shocks become more important for explaining business cycle

fluctuations as they account for around 77% and 29% of investment and consumption volatility, respectively,

compared to 2.31% and 0.94% in the benchmark estimation. On the other hand, the estimation excluding

the term structure also implies a counterfactual yield curve, as the unconditional nominal slope is only

0.27%, with most of the nominal spread coming from the real curve (see Table 5). This is due to the fact

that demand shocks are a key source of inflation risk premia, but when term structure data is excluded, the

role of demand shocks are significantly reduced as illustrated in Figure 15. Thus, the term structure encodes

important information about uncertainty and macroeconomic fluctuations, and also disciplines the relative

importance of liquidity shocks. The joint estimation exploits the strong relation between the slope of the

yield curve, business cycle fluctuations, and uncertainty.



5     Conclusion

This paper quantitatively explores the effects of different macroeconomic uncertainty shocks on business

cycle and asset pricing fluctuations. We build and estimate a DSGE model that features realistic bond

risk premia. We estimate the model using macroeconomic data, the term structure of interest rates, and


                                                       31
imposing restrictions on the average investment risk premium. Our model allows for stochastic changes in

the volatility of demand-side (preferences) and supply-side (TFP) shocks, while at the same time controlling

for other disturbances often included in the estimation of New-Keynesian DSGE models. Uncertainty shocks

are triggered by changes in stochastic volatility, but the endogenous response of the macroeconomy to these

changes is in itself a source of uncertainty.

    We study the effects of uncertainty through the lens of a novel decomposition that identifies five endoge-

nous risk propagation mechanisms: precautionary savings, investment risk premium, inflation risk premium,

nominal pricing bias, and investment adjustment channels. The effects arising from the investment and in-

flation risk premia channels are disciplined by the investment risk and nominal term premia, respectively.

    We find sizable effects of changes in uncertainty. Both demand-side and supply-side generate a positive

comovement in consumption, investment, and output. The responses of inflation and term premia differ

depending on the source of uncertainty. Supply-side uncertainty leads to larger contractions in both invest-

ment and consumption. These differences are explained in light of the way uncertainty propagates through

the real economy. In response to an increase in supply-side uncertainty, an increase in the risk of investing in

physical capital contributes to determine a larger recession. Instead, when demand-side uncertainty is high,

investment in capital becomes more attractive, reducing the fall in investment. In response to an increase

in demand-side uncertainty, the negative effects on inflation from the precautionary savings channel are

nullified by a nominal bias in pricing. The joint estimation of macro and yield curve variables put additional

discipline on the relative importance of these channels, as the model is also asked to account for the negative

comovement between term premia and the macroeconomy. Overall, our results highlight the importance of

accounting for the origins of macroeconomic uncertainty and for using asset prices to discipline the various

risk propagation channels for uncertainty.

Figure 3: Calibrated model. The impulse responses represent a change in the expected path of
the corresponding variable in response to a volatility regime changes. The units of the y-axis are
percentage deviations from a steady state (values for inflation, FFR and Slope are annualized).
Units on the x axis are quarters. The red solid line depicts the total effect of the volatility regime
change. The black dashed line shows the contribution of the precautionary savings motive. The
black line with circles shows the contribution of the channel operating through change in risk
premium on investment return. The black dotted line shows the contribution of a channel operating
through the nominal pricing bias. The dotted line with diamond markers shows the contribution of
the investment adjustment channel. We use the following parameter values: β  0.996, ρβ  0.98,

Figure 8: Uncertainty. The figure reports the level of uncertainty at different horizons. Uncertainty
is computed taking into account the possibility of regime changes.

Figure 9: Uncertainty-driven fluctuations. The figure plots selected variables from the simulation
of the model with estimated volatility regime sequence (all Gaussian shocks are set to zero in
this simulation). Top left panel: simulated path of GDP, expressed in log-deviations from steady
state, and slope of the yield curve, expressed as a difference between 5-year yield and 1-year
yield. Top right panel: simulated dynamic of nominal term premium in the model, expressed as a
difference between 5-year nominal yield and an expected average yield on 1-quarter nominal bond
over the next 20 quarters. Middle left panel: simulated slope of the yield curve and slope of the
yield curve observed in the data. The subsequent panels plot the model-implied path of GDP,
consumption, and investment in response to changes in uncertainty and the cyclical components of
the corresponding series in the data (obtained using bandpass filter). Units on the y-axis for macro
variables are percentage points (model and data). Units on the y-axis for Term premium and Slope
are annualized percent (data and model).

low uncertainty regime to high uncertainty regime for preference and TFP growth shocks. The
gray areas represent 90% credible sets. The impulse responses are computed as the change in
the expected path of the corresponding variables when the volatility regime changes. The figure
plots impulse responses of consumption, investment, GDP, inflation, Fed Funds Rate (1-quarter
nominal interest rate), the slope of the yield curve expressed as the difference between 5-year and
1-year nominal yields, nominal term premium defined as the difference between 5-year nominal
yield and an expected average yield on 1-quarter nominal bond over the next 20 quarters, the real
term premium defined as the difference between 5-year real yield and an expected average yield on
1-quarter real bond over the next 20 quarters, the real slope expressed as the difference between
5-year and 1-year real yields. The units of the y-axis are percentage deviations from a steady
state (values for inflation, interest rates and term premia are annualized). Units on the x axis are
quarters.

Figure 17: Uncertainty-driven fluctuations in an estimated model without the term structure. The
figure plots selected variables from the simulation of the model estimated without asset pricing
data. The simulation only considers the effects of uncertainty based on the estimated regime
sequence (all Gaussian shocks are set to zero in this simulation). Top left panel: simulated path
of GDP, expressed in log-deviations from steady state, and slope of the yield curve, expressed
as a difference between 5-year yield and 1-year yield. Top right panel: simulated dynamic of
nominal term premium in the model, expressed as a difference between 5-year nominal yield and
an expected average yield on 1-quarter nominal bond over the next 20 quarters. Middle left panel:
simulated slope of the yield curve and slope of the yield curve observed in the data. The subsequent
panels plot the model-implied path of GDP, consumption, and investment in response to changes
in uncertainty and the cyclical components of the corresponding series in the data (obtained using
bandpass filter). Units on the y-axis for macro variables are percentage points (model and data).
Units on the y-axis for Term premium and Slope are annualized percent (data and model).

Table 2: The left panel presents the contribution of the different shocks to the unconditional
variance of the macroeconomic variables and the slope of the yield curve. The right panel analyzes
the importance of uncertainty shocks in generating business cycle fluctuations with respect to
the traditional level shocks. Specifically, we use the posterior mode parameter values to simulate
two economies 1,000 times. In the first economy, only uncertainty shocks occur. In the second
economy, we have level shocks on top of the same uncertainty shocks. For each simulation and
for each variable we extract business cycle fluctuations using a bandpass filter. Finally, for each
simulation we compute the ratio between the volatilities of the business cycle fluctuations for the
two economies.

Table 3: The left panel reports unconditional means of nominal and real yields in the estimated
model for the following maturities: 1-quarter and 1,2,3,4,5 years. The right panel reports the
slopes of the corresponding term structures, defined as the difference between yields on 5-year
and 1-quarter bonds. The first column in the right panel reports the total value, while the next
two columns decompose the difference between 5-year and 1-quarter yield into risk premium and
liquidity premium. The last two columns report the slope of the term structure in a model with
only preference shocks and only TFP growth shocks. Values are annualized percent. The 1-quarter
real yield corresponds to the risk free rate rf,t in the model. Real bond prices are computed as
  pnq             pn1q

B      Appendix. Accuracy test

To assess the accuracy of the log-linear solution with risk adjustment employed in this paper, we
conduct a Den Haan and Marcet (1994) test for the estimated model. We simulate 5000 economies
for 3500 periods and drop first 500 observations using the posterior mode for the parameter values.
We use the conditionally linear policy functions for consumption, value function, and nominal
interest rate to compute the time path of the corresponding variables. We then use the original
non-linear Euler equation (64) to compute realized Euler equation errors:

Under the null hypothesis this statistic has a chi-squared distribution. We obtain 5, 000 statistics,
one for each simulated economy and we check how many of them are above the 95% and below
the 5% chi-squared critical values. Table 6 shows that the percentages of realized test statistics
below 5% and above 95% critical values of a χ2 distribution are very close to the theoretical ones.
This result shows that our log-linearization approach with risk adjustment terms provides a good
approximation of the model solution.

Table 6: This table reports the proportion of realized Den Haan, Marcet (1994) test statistics below 5% and above 95% critical
values of χ2 distribution. We simulate 5000 economies for 3500 periods and discard the first 500 observations.
