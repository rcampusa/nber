The Loan Covenant Channel: How Bank Health Transmits to the Real Economy
Gabriel Chodorow-Reich and Antonio Falato
NBER Working Paper No. 23879
September 2017, Revised June 2020
JEL No. E44,G21,G32

                                         ABSTRACT

We document the importance of covenant violations in transmitting bank health to non-financial
firms using a new supervisory data set of bank loans. Roughly one-third of loans in our data
breach a covenant during the 2008-09 period, providing lenders the opportunity to force a
renegotiation of loan terms or to accelerate repayment of otherwise long-term credit. Lenders in
worse health are more likely to force a reduction in the loan commitment following a violation.
The reduction in credit to borrowers who violate a covenant accounts for the majority of the
cross-sectional variation in credit supply during the 2008-09 crisis.

1.       Introduction
      A large literature documents the importance of the health of the banking sector for nonfinancial
firm outcomes such as investment and employment.1 Most recently, the 2008-09 period contained
both a financial crisis and the deepest recession in the United States in 60 years. Yet, at the start
of the financial panic in 2008 only 10% of bank loans had remaining maturity of less than one
year and the typical firm did not face the prospect of a maturing bank loan until 2011. This fact
reveals an important gap in our understanding of the transmission of bank health: why do shocks
to lenders affect their existing corporate borrowers despite the prevalence of long-term credit?
      We document the central role of loan covenant violations in this transmission mechanism. Loan
covenants appear in nearly all commercial loan contracts. They circumscribe the set of actions a
borrower may take (nonfinancial covenants) or specify minimum or maximum thresholds for cash
flow or balance sheet variables (financial covenants). Breaching of a covenant puts a borrower into
technical default and gives the lender the right to accelerate repayment of the loan. Thus, loan
covenant violations increase lenders’ bargaining power and provide them broad opportunity to
renegotiate contract terms when their internal cost of funds rises. As a result, covenant violations
allow lenders to reduce the existing stock of credit, potentially affecting many more borrowers
than just those with expiring credit or seeking new originations. We refer to the transmission of
lender health to existing borrowers through the forced renegotiation of contract terms as the loan
covenant channel.
      We assess the covenant channel in the context of the 2008-09 financial crisis using a new
supervisory data set of covenant compliance in syndicated loans. We observe the identities of
borrowers and lenders and follow individual loans over time, including through amendments.
Following the violation of a covenant, a lender may accelerate repayment, force a renegotiation of
the loan contract, or simply waive or reset the covenant with no further impact on the loan. Our
data track each of these potential outcomes.
      We document two key facts using these data: most bank loans have long stated maturity, but
many loans breach covenants. Our full data set covers $2 trillion of loan commitments at the start
of 2008. Of these, 91% have at least one year maturity remaining and the mean maturity remaining

    See e.g. Peek and Rosengren (2000), Lin and Paravisini (2012), Chodorow-Reich (2014), and Benmelech,
Bergman, and Seru (2015) for evidence from the United States and Gan (2007), Amiti and Weinstein (2018), and
Bentolila, Jansen, and Jiménez (2017) for evidence in other countries.



                                                     1
within this group is 3.3 years. Roughly one-quarter of loans in the data breach a covenant during
a typical year before the 2008-09 financial crisis and one-third of loans breach a covenant each
year during the financial crisis. Together, long stated maturity but high violation frequency make
the loan covenant channel a potentially important transmission mechanism.
   For a causal assessment of the covenant channel we turn to variation in the cross-section of
lenders during the 2008-09 financial crisis. The write-downs on assets linked to real estate loans led
to an enormous decline in the market equity of the U.S. financial sector and coincided with a sharp
increase in bank funding costs. Both factors increased the internal cost of funds at lenders. A body
of evidence documents the transmission from the reduction in credit supply at lenders to outcomes
at nonfinancial firms during the crisis (Campello, Graham, and Harvey, 2010; Duchin, Ozbas, and
Sensoy, 2010; Campello, Giambona, et al., 2011; Chodorow-Reich, 2014; Duygan-Bump, Levkov,
and Montoriol-Garriga, 2015; Siemer, 2016). However, banks varied greatly in their exposure to
the crisis. We assign lender health by combining three measures used in Chodorow-Reich (2014)
that capture a bank’s exposure to the crisis through counterparty risk and mortgage-related losses.
   Our empirical exercises ask whether the outcome of a covenant violation during the 2008-09
crisis depended on the lead lender’s financial health. A simple comparison of outcomes of violations
based on lender health raises two main concerns. First, firms that violate covenants and have
unhealthy lenders may differ along other dimensions from firms that violate covenants and have
healthier lenders. We attempt to assuage this concern by presenting evidence that borrowers of
healthier and less healthy lenders appear similar along numerous observable dimensions including
pre-crisis leverage, risk rating, and ex ante covenant tightness, have similar propensities to violate a
covenant during the crisis, and that the balancing of observable characteristics holds even within
the subset of firms that violate covenants. The second concern is that violation of a covenant
correlates with other firm characteristics and loan outcomes may also depend on the interplay of
lender health and these other characteristics. We address this concern by including as covariates
in our main specification measures of borrower quality interacted with lender health, which isolate
the impact of lender health× violation from the impact of lender health×borrower quality.
   We also offer two additional causal identification strategies. The first follows an influential
literature using regression discontinuity methods to study the impact of covenant violations on
firms (Chava and Roberts, 2008; Roberts and Sufi, 2009a; Nini, Smith, and Sufi, 2012; Falato and
Liang, 2016). We provide conditions under which this analysis causally identifies the treatment


                                                   2
effect of a violation separately for borrowers of healthy and less healthy lenders, even if the
overall distribution of borrowers or of covenant violators differs across lender type. The second
is an instrumental variables design with covenant violation status an endogenous variable. We
introduce four excluded instruments for covenant status: (i) the opening of a new airline route that
reduces the travel time between the lender’s and borrower’s headquarters, which, similar to Giroud
(2013) and Bernstein, Giroud, and Townsend (2016), allows lenders to substitute monitoring for
covenant tightness, reducing violation propensities during the crisis; (ii) the bankruptcy of an
airline servicing the primary route connecting the headquarter cities, which increases travel time
and has the opposite effect to a new route; (iii) the strictness of the lender’s supervisor at the time
of origination, similar to Agarwal et al. (2014); and (iv) abnormal snow cover in the borrower’s
county, which Brown, Gustafson, and Ivanov (forthcoming) show predicts earnings.
   Across all of our research designs, we find strong evidence of less healthy lenders using covenant
violations to contract credit. Conditional on breaching a threshold, the likelihood of a reduction
in the loan commitment rises by more than 20 p.p. for borrowers of the least healthy lenders
relative to the healthiest lenders and the average loan size falls an additional 25 to 30%. Affected
borrowers appear unable to substitute toward alternative sources of credit, reflecting the difficulty
of obtaining new credit while in technical default. Instead, these borrowers increase the utilization
on their existing credit lines, reduce payouts, and reduce investment and employment relative to
firms that violate a covenant but have a healthier lender. The impact on real outcomes echoes
previous literature, which has found an adverse effect of a covenant violation on debt issuance
(Roberts and Sufi, 2009a; Nini, Smith, and Sufi, 2012), investment (Chava and Roberts, 2008;
Nini, Smith, and Sufi, 2012), and employment (Falato and Liang, 2016), but with the added twist
that the health of the lender crucially affects the consequences for the borrower.
   A number of additional results support the causal interpretation of these findings. First,
unhealthy lenders do not reduce credit to borrowers with long-term credit who do not violate a
covenant, suggesting that borrowers of less healthy lenders did not experience a correlated decline
in loan demand. Second, adding borrower and loan-level controls and interactions of borrower and
lender health measures increases the explanatory power of the regressions, but the point estimates
remain extremely stable. Third, we obtain similar second stage coefficients across sets of excluded
instruments that capture very different sources of variation in the propensity to violate. Fourth,
the lead lender’s share of the loan commitment declines after a violation if the lead has poor


                                                  3
health, providing “within-loan” evidence that what shifts is the lead lender’s credit supply. Fifth,
we conduct placebo exercises and find no differential treatment of borrowers who breach a covenant
in 2006-07 based on lender health in 2008-09. Finally, we show robustness to plausible alternative
definitions of lender health and to sample composition.
   We evaluate the macroeconomic importance of the loan covenant channel as follows. A partial
equilibrium aggregation of our loan-level regressions, weighted to be representative of the universe
of syndicated loans, finds that total loan commitments contracted by 4.9% in 2008 and 5.2%
in 2009 solely as the result of borrowers who started the year with a long-term loan contract
but nonetheless had their borrowing limit lowered by an unhealthy lender following a covenant
violation. The same aggregation exercise applied to a bank-level regression finds contractions
of 8.6% in 2008 and 6.1% in 2009 relative to if each bank behaved the same as the healthiest
lender along all margins, including expiring and new credit. Therefore, the contraction due to the
covenant channel accounts for a large share of the total cross-sectional variation in lender credit
supply.
   We discuss related literature next. Section 2 provides institutional background on covenants.
Section 3 describes the supervisory data and documents the maturity of bank credit and the
prevalence of covenant violations. Section 4 introduces the lender health measures and the cross-
lender empirical strategy. Section 5 reports borrower and loan-level effects of lender health on the
outcome of a covenant violation. Section 6 contains the aggregation exercise. Section 7 concludes.

Related literature. The main contribution of our paper is to establish the importance of
covenant violations to the contraction in bank credit supply during the 2008-09 financial crisis.
This finding relates to a number of strands of previous literature.
   First, a tradition tracing to Bernanke (1983) studies the importance of bank credit supply
contractions and firm-bank relationships during financial crises. This literature finds a rapid
transmission from lender health to firms; for example, Chodorow-Reich (2014) finds borrowers of
lenders in worse health during the 2008-09 financial crisis had lower employment within 9 months
of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. The prevalence of long-term contracts poses a challenge
for this literature insofar as they insulate borrowers from the health of their lender. Earlier
work such as Huang (2010) has found suggestive evidence of the availability of pre-committed
lines of credit being sensitive to lender health during the financial crisis, but has not established
a mechanism through which this occurs. Other explanations for the rapid transmission from

                                                 4
lender health to borrower outcomes include lumpiness or granularity in the economy together with
strong effects in the subset of borrowers needing to refinance or new credit (Almeida, Campello,
Laranjeira, et al., 2012; Benmelech, Bergman, and Seru, 2015; Siemer, 2016) and precautionary
saving by firms anticipating future credit contraction (Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach, 2004;
Bacchetta, Benhima, and Poilly, 2014; Melcangi, 2016; Xiao, 2017). We view these channels
as complementary and our contribution as establishing a novel mechanism and highlighting its
quantitative importance. For instance, while maturing credit and a covenant violation both allow
a lender to end its relationship with a borrower, in 2008 and 2009 three times as many loans in
our data had covenant violations as reached the final year of their maturity. Since lower quality
borrowers are more likely to violate covenants, the covenant channel also can account for the
common empirical finding that the effects of bank health concentrate on smaller, lower quality
borrowers. Methodologically, our paper follows much of this literature in using cross-sectional
variation in lender health to distinguish contractions in credit due to lender supply from those due
to borrower demand.
   A second literature documents the negative consequences to the firm of violating a covenant
(Chava and Roberts, 2008; Roberts and Sufi, 2009a; Nini, Smith, and Sufi, 2012; Falato and Liang,
2016). Our results suggest that the overall effects reported in these studies may understate the
economic importance of covenant violations in bad times, because they mask important response
heterogeneity based on the health of the lender. Acharya et al. (2017) also find evidence of hetero-
geneity in independent and contemporaneous work based on amendments reported in DealScan.
Their results complement ours by showing the impact on spreads and fees, variables not available
in SNC. On the other hand, superior measurement of covenant violations and subsequent changes
in credit in SNC produce much sharper results on the contraction in loan commitments and permit
a comparison of the covenant channel to the overall contraction in credit supply by banks.
   A third related literature concerns the renegotiation of debt contracts and the purpose and
consequences of covenants. This literature has traditionally viewed covenants as a means to
overcome the agency problem inherent in lending contracts by limiting the possible actions taken
by the borrower and shifting control to the lender if the borrower’s financial condition deteriorates
(Aghion and Bolton, 1992; Nini, Smith, and Sufi, 2009; Gârleanu and Zwiebel, 2009; Acharya et
al., 2014; Bradley and Roberts, 2015). Yet, covenant violations occur routinely and lenders often
provide waivers for the violation while taking minimal additional action. Our work complements


                                                 5
the borrower-centric view by showing that covenants also allow lenders to adjust loan terms when
lender health deteriorates, consistent with the symmetric view of incomplete contracting in Hart
and Moore (1988). More broadly, almost all long-term debt contracts undergo renegotiation prior
to maturity (Roberts and Sufi, 2009b; Denis and Wang, 2014; Roberts, 2015; Mian and Santos,
2018). While this literature has found evidence of borrower characteristics affecting the timing and
outcome of such negotiations, our results emphasize the role of lender health in such renegotiations,
as in Murfin (2012).
      Finally, a macroeconomic literature studies the link between banks and the real economy in
dynamic general equilibrium models (Gertler and Kiyotaki, 2010; He and Krishnamurthy, 2013;
Brunnermeier and Sannikov, 2014). These models typically assume one period or continuously
updated contracts, in contradiction to the long face-value maturity of most debt. Our results
provide some justification for this simplification by showing that even long-term contracts have
de facto much shorter horizons due to loan covenants. Our evidence also points to lender health
affecting the allocation as well as the quantity of credit, an aspect that has received less attention
but could substantially impact the welfare implications of these models.



2.       Institutional Background
      This section provides a brief overview of covenants in loan contracts. We highlight two features
most relevant to the existence of a loan covenant channel. First, absent a covenant violation, missed
payment, or unusual circumstance, a lender cannot renege on a loan commitment before the stated
maturity. Second, the violation of a covenant gives the lenders the right but not the obligation
to terminate the loan, including forcing immediate repayment of any outstanding principal and
interest.
      We use an actual loan contract to illustrate these features. In October 2006, Lifetime Brands,
Inc. and a lending syndicate with HSBC as the administrative agent agreed to extend the maturity
of a credit line to April 2011.2 Section 2 of the contract specifies the obligations of the lenders:
“Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender having a Revolving Commitment
agrees to make Revolving Loans to the Borrower (p.18).” That is, as long as the borrower remains
  2
   As a public company, Lifetime Brands filed a copy of the agreement with the SEC (https://www.sec.gov/
Archives/edgar/data/874396/000091068006001052/ex99-1_f8k10312006.htm, accessed July 20, 2017).



                                                   6
compliant with the terms of the loan, the lenders must provide funds.
   Table A.1 lists the covenants in the agreement. The left panel lists affirmative covenants, ac-
tions which the borrower must take to remain compliant. These include providing timely financial
statements and maintaining fire insurance on the firm’s properties holdings. The right panel lists
negative covenants. Many of these, such as restrictions on other borrowing, have in common with
the affirmative covenants that compliance is directly under the borrower’s control.
   Most important to our study are two financial covenants, leverage ratio and interest coverage
ratio, which may be violated due to changes in financial conditions not directly under the bor-
rower’s control. As defined in sections 1.01, 7.12, and 7.13 of the agreement, the leverage ratio
covenant proscribes the ratio of consolidated senior secured debt to a four-quarter trailing moving-
average of consolidated ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) from
exceeding 3:1 except following an acquisition approved by the lenders, while the interest coverage
ratio covenant prohibits the ratio of the four-quarter trailing moving average of ebitda to interest
expense to be less than 4:1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. For these covenants, a decline in
earnings could cause an involuntary violation by the borrower.
   Section 8 of the agreement defines default and the remedies available to the lender. Events of
default include failure to make a principal or interest payment on a loan (8.01(a-c,f,j)), the filing
of an involuntary or voluntary bankruptcy petition on behalf of the borrower (8.01(h,i)), and,
crucially, if “the Borrower shall fail to observe or perform any covenant, condition or agreement
contained in Sections 6.02, 6.03, 6.08, 6.11, 6.12, 6.13 or 6.14 or in Article 7” (8.01(d), p.56).
Section 8.02 (p.58) specifies contract remedies:

 (a) “in the case of an Event of Default specified in Section 8.01(h) or 8.01(i) [i.e. a bankruptcy
     filing], without declaration or notice to the Borrower, the Revolving Commitments (including
     the Letter of Credit Commitment) shall immediately and automatically terminate, and the
     Loans, all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other amounts owing under the Loan
     Documents shall immediately become due and payable, and

 (b) in all other cases, upon the direction of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall,
     by notice to the Borrower, declare all of the Revolving Commitments (including the Letter of
     Credit Commitment) to be terminated forthwith, whereupon such Revolving Commitments
     (including the Letter of Credit Commitment) shall immediately terminate, or declare the


                                                   7
       Loans, all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other amounts owing under the Loan
       Documents to be due and payable forthwith, whereupon the same shall immediately become
       due and payable.”

     Thus, under section 8.02(b) a covenant violation gives lenders the right but not the obligation to
terminate the credit line and make any outstanding amounts immediately payable. This discretion
makes lender health potentially relevant to the resolution of a covenant violation.3



3.      Data on Covenant Compliance and Loan Outcomes
     Our data on loan contracts and covenant compliance come from the Shared National Credit
Program (SNC). We describe the main features here and provide additional details in the online
appendix. We then present two key facts concerning the maturity of bank credit and the prevalence
of covenant violations.

3.1.     SNC

     The Shared National Credit Program (SNC) is a confidential supervisory data set jointly
administered by the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC. SNC collects information on all loans of at
least $20 million shared by three or more unaffiliated financial institutions under the regulatory
purview of one of the SNC administrators. For each loan, we observe the borrower, loan type,
drawn and undrawn balance on December 31st of the reporting year, and the ownership shares
of the syndicate lead lender and all participants, including institutions not regulated by a SNC
supervisor. Unlike the Thomson Reuters DealScan database, SNC maintains a single loan identifier
through subsequent modifications and refinancings.4 Still, very large changes in loan terms may
   3
     The subsequent evolution of this particular loan agreement has anecdotal value in illustrating the covenant
channel. Recall the stated maturity provided a credit line through April 2011. According to the firm’s FY2008
10K filing (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/874396/000091068009000143/f10k12312008.htm, pp.
8,21), the lenders agreed to modify the covenant terms and thresholds in March and September 2008 in anticipation
of declining firm sales. Even so, the firm violated one of the revised covenants in December 2008. In March 2009
the firm signed an amended agreement, which again modified the covenant terms and thresholds and reduced the
maximum amount borrowable under the agreement.
   4
     The official term for the unit of observation in the SNC data set is a credit. A credit may consist of multiple
facilities jointly arranged by the same syndicate and signed on the same date. The corresponding term in the
Thomson Reuters DealScan database is a package. For simplicity, in the text we use “loan” interchangeably with
SNC credit. According to Ivashina and Scharfstein (2010), roughly 95% of loans in DealScan also appear in SNC.
Sufi (2007) analyzes the structure of lending syndicates and finds that the median loan has 5 lenders, well above
the cutoff for inclusion in SNC, and that the number of lenders increases with borrower and loan size and if the
borrower is publicly traded.

                                                         8
provoke creation of a new loan identifier. We re-code these cases as modifications to the original
loan based on the simultaneous disappearance of an existing loan and appearance of a new loan
with the same lead lender and borrower.
       The syndicated lending market covered by SNC accounts for a large share of total lending
volume in the U.S. economy. As shown in figure A.1, the full SNC universe contained $1.2
trillion of loans drawn and $2.79 trillion of loans drawn and unused commitments outstanding as
of the end of 2007.5 For comparison, the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call
Reports) contain $1.44 trillion of commercial and industrial loans drawn and $2.37 trillion of
unused commitments not associated with real estate or credit cards from all U.S. commercial
banks on that date.6 Thus, while our analysis does not directly apply to small loans or firms not
included in the SNC data, the loans in SNC aggregate to a quantitatively large share of the U.S.
corporate loan market. In the remainder of the paper we further exclude a small share of loans
not listed as a term loan or credit line and loans to financial borrowers.7

3.2.       SNC Covenant Review Sample

       In 2006 SNC began collecting information on covenant compliance for a subset of loans covering
about 1/3 of the loan volume in the SNC universe. We refer to loans in this subset as the covenant
review sample. For each loan in the covenant sample, SNC obtains information on covenant
compliance throughout the year from loan documentation augmented by supervisory inquiries to
the banks when information is missing or incomplete.
       The SNC covenant sample offers important advantages for measuring covenant compliance over
previous data sets constructed by starting from the DealScan database and either hand-collecting
information on subsequent loan outcomes from public filings (Nini, Smith, and Sufi, 2009; Roberts
   5
      The SNC review for year t covers loan commitments as of December 31st of year t − 1. Thus, while SNC
press releases would refer to $1.2 trillion outstanding and $2.79 trillion committed in review year 2008, these totals
actually refer to loans as of December 31st of 2007.
    6
      Besides the $20 million threshold and syndication requirement for inclusion in the SNC data, totals in the Call
Reports and SNC may differ because SNC includes the part of loans provided by non-bank lenders if they are part of
a syndicate covered by SNC, because SNC may include some lending not classified as commercial and industrial in
the Call Reports, and because the residual category for unused commitments in the Call Report data may contain
non commercial and industrial loans. While these differences affect the levels, figure A.1 shows that the growth
rates of aggregates in the two data sets track each other closely. As an alternative benchmark, in November 2012
the Federal Reserve Survey of Terms of Business Lending began reporting the fraction made under syndication of
all origination volume of commercial and industrial loans made by commercial banks; averaged across all months
from November 2012 through August 2016, this fraction is 47.5%.
    7
      Loans to bank borrowers (< 0.5%) and loans to non-bank financial borrowers (8%) make up a small share of
SNC and our results are robust to not excluding them.


                                                          9
and Sufi, 2009b; Nini, Smith, and Sufi, 2012; Denis and Wang, 2014; Roberts, 2015; Freudenberg
et al., 2015) or by matching to Compustat to track financial ratios encoded in covenants (Chava
and Roberts, 2008; Falato and Liang, 2016). Relative to these data sets, SNC contains many
more observations per year including a representative share of non-public borrowers, contains
supervisory information on covenant compliance including when the breach results in a waiver,
and contains information on the lender’s response to the violation.
      Table 1 reports summary statistics for the pre-crisis and crisis periods for the full SNC universe
of term loans and credit lines to nonfinancial borrowers (columns 1 and 4), for the subset of these
loans in the covenant sample (columns 2 and 5), and for those loans in the covenant sample for
which we have a measure of the health of the lead lender (columns 3 and 6, described shortly). The
covenant review sample over-weights non-investment grade and criticized credits.8 Nonetheless,
it still contains a large share of credits with the highest (“Pass”) rating, with 71% of loans in
the review sample in the pre-crisis period and 47% in the crisis period receiving this designation.
Furthermore, “special mention” loans, the highest category of non-passing loans and which consist
of assets with potential weaknesses but which remain in good standing, account for about one-
half of the over-sampling of non-passing loans during the crisis period. The sample is otherwise
representative of the SNC universe; loans in the covenant sample are of similar average size and
maturity, exhibit a similar breakdown between term loans and credit lines, have similar utilization
rates, and have similar propensities to get modified as those in the full universe. The sector
composition of loans in the covenant sample is also similar to the SNC universe and broadly
representative of the sectoral composition of the U.S. economy – more than one-quarter of loans
are to firms in the services sector and roughly one-third are to firms in manufacturing or retail.
The shares of loans attributed to each lead lender in the full SNC universe and SNC covenant
sample are also similar, as shown in figure O.1 of the online appendix. In short, selection into the
covenant review sample occurs along a single dimension, rating, which we observe for all loans in
the SNC universe. We exploit this feature to re-weight the aggregation analysis in section 6 to be
representative of the SNC universe.

 Notes: The table reports summary statistics for the pre-crisis (2006-07) and crisis (2008-09) periods and for three
samples. Columns with header “Universe” report summary statistics for the universe of credit lines and term loans
to nonfinancial borrowers in the full SNC data set. Columns with header “Covenant” report summary statistics for
the subset of these loans in the SNC covenant sample. Columns with header “Lender-covenant” report summary
statistics for our final sample of all credit lines and term loans in the covenant sample to nonfinancial borrowers and
where the lead lender is in the Chodorow-Reich (2014) lender health data set. Credit reduced equals 1 if either the
loan is terminated before maturity or the loan commitment is reduced. Bindt and Bindt−1:t are indicator variables
equal to 1 if a loan breached a covenant in the current or either the current or previous year, respectively. Total
committed is the sum of loans outstanding and unused commitments averaged over the two year period.



                                                          11
Fact 1: Bank credit has long maturity. The vast majority of bank loans are of long maturity.
As shown in table 1, in both the full SNC data and the covenant sample roughly 90% of all loans
and commitments outstanding at the end of 2007 had at least 1 year of maturity remaining.
Conditional on a loan having a year maturity remaining, the mean remaining maturity at the end
of 2007 was about 3.3 years. These numbers do not merely represent unusual maturity at the
height of a boom.9 The long maturity of bank debt constricts the channels through which bank
health can transmit to borrower outcomes.

Fact 2: Many loans breach covenants, especially in bad times. For each loan in the
covenant sample, SNC reports a flag for whether the loan remained compliant throughout the
year. If the loan remained compliant, SNC reports whether it would have been noncompliant but
for a covenant waiver or reset granted by the lender. We consider a covenant to bind in either
circumstance. This classification separates the event of breaching a covenant threshold from the
subsequent resolution. Formally, we define the variable Bindt to equal 1 if a loan breaches any
covenant threshold during year t.
       Covenant violations occur routinely, and especially so during the financial crisis. As shown
in table 1, roughly one-quarter of non-maturing loans in the SNC covenant sample breached a
covenant during a typical year before the 2008-09 financial crisis. One-third of loans breached
a covenant in each crisis year. This frequency exceeds by an order of magnitude the fraction of
credit to nonfinancial firms that became delinquent.10 Such a high violation frequency makes the
covenant channel potentially relevant to a wide swath of borrowers and quantitatively significant
in its aggregate importance.
       Because the macroeconomic importance of the covenant channel depends on the finding of
a high violation frequency, it is important to validate this finding with respect to the full SNC
   9
      For example, average maturity remaining in 2005 was also 3.3 years. Mian and Santos (2018) plot the distribu-
tion of maturity remaining for all SNC loans pooled over 1988-2010 and show a similar distribution. The maturity
of loans in SNC also closely resembles the maturity structure of all long-term debt. Of firms in Compustat with
positive long-term debt outstanding, the median amount due in less than one year is about 5% of the total and
the 75th percentile is less than 20%. Across all firms in Compustat, the median firm has long-term debt maturing
within a year of less than 0.2% of assets and the 75th percentile firm has maturing debt of less than 2% of assets.
These ratios are roughly the same in each of 2007, 2008, and 2009 and are based on all firms in the Compustat An-
nual file with non-negative revenue, assets, investment, or cash, with assets greater than each of cash, investment,
and property, plant, and equipment, and with assets of at least $10 million and asset growth lower than 200%.
   10
      According to Call Report data, the fraction of all commercial and industrial loans non-current on payments –
the main alternative event of default giving lenders the right to alter the terms of the loan – peaked during the
2007-09 episode in the third quarter of 2009 at 3.6%. Expanding to corporate bond defaults, Moody’s Default and
Recovery Database reports corporate bond default rates of just over 4% 2008 and roughly 2.5% in 2009.

universe and to explain why we obtain a higher violation frequency than previous studies. The
higher violation frequency does not stem from attributes particular to the covenant sample. To
make this point, we run the loan-level regression in the covenant sample:
              X
Bindl,b,f,t =   β1,I,t [Industry=I]f + β2,t [Log committed]l,t + β3,t [Utilization]l,t + β4,t [Credit line]l,t
               I
               X                                  X
           +       β5,P,t [Loan purpose=P]l,t +       β6,R,t [Loan rating=R]l,b,f,t + el,b,f,t .          (1)
               P                                  R

This regression projects Bindl,b,f,t , the indicator for loan l from bank b to firm f violating a
covenant in year t, on a set of variables observed in both the covenant sample and the full universe.
These variables include borrower industry, loan size, loan utilization rate, loan type, loan purpose
(working capital, general purpose, etc.), and the internal rating of the loan, each interacted with
year. We then use the coefficients from equation (1) to impute Bindt for the full SNC universe.
This exercise re-weights the covenant sample using relevant features of the SNC universe, most
importantly the loan rating which governs selection into the covenant review sample. The imputed
fraction of covenant violations in the SNC universe is 0.23 pre-crisis and 0.30 in the crisis, very
close to the values for the covenant sample.
   It is instructive to compare to two prominent earlier approaches to determine why the violation
frequency in SNC exceeds that reported in previous studies. Dichev and Skinner (2002), Chava
and Roberts (2008), and Falato and Liang (2016) use Compustat to follow current ratio and net
worth covenants reported at inception in DealScan. Dichev and Skinner (2002) report that roughly
30% of loans violate one of these covenants at some point during the life of the loan. However, this
approach mechanically understates the frequency of total violations because it considers only two
types of covenants and contains measurement error due to covenant thresholds changing after the
initial loan contract (Denis and Wang, 2014; Roberts, 2015). In an innovative approach, Roberts
and Sufi (2009a), Nini, Smith, and Sufi (2009), and Nini, Smith, and Sufi (2012) scrape SEC 10-Q
and 10-K filings of publicly-traded firms looking for phrases associated with violations. Roberts
and Sufi (2009a) find just 1% of firms rated A or above report a violation in a typical year, rising to
9% for B rated borrowers and 18% for borrowers rated CCC or worse. Nini, Smith, and Sufi (2012)
use an improved version of the text-scraping algorithm and find roughly 12% of all publicly-traded
firms report a violation in each of 2006 and 2007. Yet, while their data cover all covenant types,
SEC regulation S-X governing disclosure does not require firms to report violations if they obtain
an amendment or waiver before the end of the reporting period. Indeed, while each year roughly

                                                      13
25% of loans in the SNC covenant sample breach a covenant during 2006 or 2007, only 9% of
loans breach a covenant and do not receive a waiver in the same year.11 Finally, both previous
approaches necessarily cover only publicly-traded borrowers.
       Following a violation, a lender may choose to waive or reset the covenant or may force re-
payment or restructuring of the loan. These options are not mutually exclusive; a waiver can
come with conditions and does not necessarily mean that the violation gets resolved without ad-
verse consequences to the borrower. In practice, the final resolution of a loan restructuring takes
a few months to achieve. In what follows we therefore use as our main measure the variable
Bindt−1:t = max{Bindt−1 , Bindt }, which equals 1 if a loan breached a covenant in either the
current or previous year.12



4.        Causal Identification
       To causally assess whether lender health affects the resolution of covenant violations, we turn
to variation in the cross-section of lenders. In the next section, we report regressions of the form:

            Yl,b,f,t = β0 + β1 [Bad Lenderb ] + β2 [Bindl,t−1:t ] + β3 [Bad Lenderb × Bindl,t−1:t ]

                  + γ 0 Xl,b,f,t + l,b,f,t ,                                                                    (2)

where Yl,b,f,t denotes an outcome in year t ∈ {2008, 2009} for loan l to firm f from lender b,
Bad Lender measures the health of lender b, and Xl,b,f,t includes any covariates.
  11
     We can more directly assess the importance of waivers in explaining the different violation propensities between
SNC and Nini, Smith, and Sufi (2012, hereafter NSS) by comparing firm-years that appear in both the NSS data
set and the SNC covenant sample. In the 601 overlapping firm-years covering the period 2006-2008, the violation
propensity in SNC is roughly double that in NSS, reflecting 140 firm-years in which SNC identifies either a covenant
violation or a covenant waiver while according to the NSS data the firm made no mention of such a violation or
waiver in a regulatory filing. (There are 26 firm-years in which NSS identify a violation and SNC does not. These
reflect cases where a firm obtained a preemptive waiver, for example in anticipation of missing a filing deadline or
taking a one-time charge-off on earnings, where a firm had multiple loans and violated a covenant on a loan not in
the SNC sample, and a few cases where we could not identify from the SEC filing why the NSS procedure assigned
a violation.) We are grateful to Amir Sufi for providing us with the Nini, Smith, and Sufi (2012) data set.
  12
     Loans can contain cross-default provisions by which a covenant breach on one loan triggers technical default
on another. We have experimented with defining Bindt−1:t based on whether any loan to the borrower breaches
a covenant with no meaningful changes in our loan-level analysis. Similarly, our results remain quantitatively
similar if we use Bindt as our main measure of a violation. Nini, Smith, and Sufi (2012) emphasize that covenant
terms tighten following a violation with the possible implication that the likelihood of violating a covenant in 2009
depends on the 2008 health of the lender. The backward-looking two-year treatment window negates this problem
because the value in 2009, Bind2008:2009 , equals 1 for any loan that violates a covenant in 2008 and in particular
does not depend on the outcome of the violation.

   Section 4.1 describes the measurement of Bad Lender. We then present our empirical strate-
gies. Section 4.2 discusses conditions under which OLS consistently identifies β1 , β2 , and β3 and
provides suggestive evidence of these conditions being satisfied in our sample, including ex ante
balancing of observable characteristics of borrowers of healthier and of less healthy lenders. Sec-
tion 4.3 details a regression-discontinuity refinement using a sub-sample of loans on either side of
but close to a covenant threshold. Section 4.4 introduces the instrumental variables design and
four excluded instruments that predict Bind.

4.1.    Lender Health Measures

   The 2008-09 period offers a useful laboratory for studying the transmission from banks to
corporate borrowers because the origins of the financial distress lay outside the corporate sector.
Rather, prominent explanations include the exposure of financial institutions to real estate markets
and toxic assets, and counterparty risk and network proximity to failing institutions (see e.g.
Ivashina and Scharfstein, 2010; Cornett et al., 2011; Erel, Nadauld, and Stulz, 2011; Fahlenbrach,
Prilmeier, and Stulz, 2012; Santos, 2011). The variable Bad Lender combines measures of lender
health, adopted from Chodorow-Reich (2014), that reflect these forces.
   The first measure, originally proposed by Ivashina and Scharfstein (2010), identifies a bank’s
exposure to Lehman Brothers through the fraction of the bank’s syndication portfolio in which
Lehman Brothers had a lead role. This exposure affected banks directly through the syndicated
market as firms with credit lines provided by Lehman Brothers drew down the remainder of their
credit line as a precautionary measure following the Lehman bankruptcy, draining liquidity from
the other syndicate members. The second lender health variable measures a bank’s exposure to
private-label mortgage-backed securities through the correlation of its daily stock return with the
return on the ABX AAA 2006-H1 index in the fourth quarter of 2007. The ABX AAA 2006-H1
index follows the price of residential mortgage-backed securities issued during the second half of
2005 and with a AAA rating at issuance. The correlation indicates the market’s perception of
the bank’s exposure to the mortgage crisis. The third measure is 2007-08 trading revenue as a
share of assets, as most writedowns occurred on the trading book. We extract the first principal
component of the three measures and create the rank-normalized variable Bad Lender as the
rank of the first principal component divided by the number of lenders. The variable Bad Lender
therefore lies on the unit interval with a value of 1 assigned to the lender in the worst health.


                                                 15
       Syndicated loans include a lead lender and participant lenders. The lead lender manages the
servicing of the loan and typically provides the largest share of the funds. Most loan contracts
require the agreement of lenders providing at least 51% of the commitment to accelerate repayment
or modify loan terms following a covenant breach.13 Because the lead lender provides the largest
share of the loan, plays an organizing role among syndicate members, and as the servicing agent
has responsibility for carrying out any renegotiation, in our main results we assign lender health
on the basis of the lead lender only. Effectively, we assume the lead lender is always pivotal in
resolving a covenant violation. Our main results are robust to alternative definitions of the health
of the syndicate, as shown in section 5.5.
       Following Chodorow-Reich (2014), we construct the health measures for the most active lead
lenders in the syndicated lending market. After excluding lenders in the Chodorow-Reich (2014)
data set without a publicly traded stock price (required to compute the ABX loading) or otherwise
missing one of the key health variables, our final data set includes 34 lenders.14 As shown in
columns (3) and (6) of table 1, more than 90% of the loan volume in the covenant sample comes
from loans with lead lenders in our lender data set and these loans appear similar to the full
covenant sample along all dimensions. Figure O.2 of the online appendix reports the distribution
of lender health, weighted by the shares of each lender in SNC.
       Figure 1 reports the time series of the shares of aggregate commitments from lenders in the
top and bottom quartile of the lender health distribution. These shares are stable between 2005
and 2007, indicating that ex post distressed banks did not lend more aggressively ex ante. The
share of commitments from lenders in the least healthy quartile falls sharply in 2008 and remains
depressed in 2009, before stabilizing in 2010 and 2011. In section 6, we quantify how much of
the difference in lending behavior in 2008 and 2009 is attributable to the differential response to
covenant violations of healthier and less healthy lenders.
  13
     For example, the credit agreement described in section 2 defines the “Required Lenders” in Section 8.02(b) as
“(i) Lenders having Revolving Exposures and unused Revolving Commitments representing not less than 51% of
the sum of the total Revolving Exposures and unused Revolving Commitments at such time and (ii) in any event
not less than two Lenders. (p.15)” Unlike in DealScan where many loans list multiple lead arrangers, the SNC
supervisors always identify a single lead arranger as the servicing agent.
  14
     The lender health measures from Chodorow-Reich (2014) are available at http://scholar.harvard.edu/
files/chodorow-reich/files/final_bank_variables.xlsx. About one-quarter of the lenders in the Chodorow-
Reich (2014) data set are foreign-owned or otherwise not under the regulatory purview of the SNC supervisors.
Nonetheless, SNC captures many loans from these lenders because the syndicate participants include multiple
supervised lenders, as is the case with the loan described in section 2.

4.2.       OLS

       Estimating equation (2) with ordinary least squares (OLS) raises two main concerns. First,
firms that violate covenants and have unhealthy lenders may differ along other dimensions from
firms that violate covenants and have healthier lenders. Second, violation of a covenant correlates
with other firm characteristics and loan outcomes may also depend on the interplay of lender
health and these other characteristics.
       We start by presenting evidence that borrowers of healthier and less healthy lenders in fact look
similar along numerous observable dimensions, including within the subset of firms that violate
covenants. Such balancing is consistent with “as good as random” matching of borrowers and
lenders at origination. “As good as random” does not preclude any matching of borrowers and
lenders along even unobservable dimensions. Rather, because our bank health measures capture
exposure to largely unforeseen shocks during the crisis such as the losses in MBS markets and
the collapse of Lehman Brothers, it requires that any such matching not correlate with lenders’
exposure to these tail events.15
       The origin of the 2008-09 crisis outside of the corporate loan sector makes “as good as ran-
  15
    Notably, financial markets before the crisis, as embodied in credit default swaps, did not predict the subsequent
distress in the banking sector. Schwert (2018) finds evidence that bank-dependent borrowers (those without a credit
rating) are more likely to borrow from better-capitalized banks. This sorting affects our results only insofar as better
capitalized banks also avoided MBS exposure and did not cosyndicate with Lehman Brothers. In this case, such a
correlation would bias against our empirical results. We also control extensively for borrower-level characteristics
below; in particular, our main results change minimally if we control for whether a borrower is bank-dependent.



                                                                                          17
dom” assignment a priori plausible. Supporting this assumption, Chodorow-Reich (2014) reports
similarity of borrowers of healthier and less healthy lenders along observable characteristics such
as the employment decline in the borrower’s industry and county and balancing along unobserved
characteristics using a specification with borrower fixed effects. Columns (1)-(3) of table 2 provide
further evidence of balancing of borrower and loan characteristics by quantile of lender health.16
Panel A uses variables drawn from SNC and restricts to non-expiring loans. Borrowers of lenders
below and above the median of crisis lender health had statistically indistinguishable mean assets,
leverage, supervisory risk rating, and remaining maturity on their loans at the start of the crisis.
Panel B restricts the sample to borrowers in Compustat and shows balancing on additional mea-
sures of financial health from those data, including on cash flow, profitability, Tobin’s Q, market
beta, and volatility.
       Even if matching at origination occurred as good as randomly, covenant violators of unhealthy
lenders may still be different. Of particular concern, ex post distressed lenders may have offered
looser covenants ex ante, and borrowers of unhealthy lenders may have worked harder to avoid
violating covenants in expectation of worse treatment. If active, these mechanisms would make
OLS an inconsistent estimator. Contra this concern, table 2 shows that loans from lenders in
good and bad health had economically and statistically similar covenant tightness before the
crisis (Panel A, row 1, columns (1)-(3)) and exhibited similar propensities to violate a covenant
during the crisis (Panel C, columns (1)-(3)).17 These results provide evidence against ex post
distressed lenders having offered looser covenants ex ante or of many borrowers of distressed
lenders successfully manipulating the covenant threshold to avoid violating. Columns (4)-(6)
provide additional evidence by demonstrating balancing of borrower and loan characteristics within
the subset of violators. Violators who had borrowed from healthier and less healthy lenders
  16
      Online table O.1 reports balancing along the same variables as in table 2 but in a regression setting with a
continuous measure of lender health.
   17
      Covenant tightness refers to the percent distance from threshold of the most tightly binding covenant. We
obtain this variable from text fields accompanying the SNC covenant sample. These text fields do not have a
uniform layout, reducing the sample for this variable. We have also confirmed the similarity of ex ante covenant
tightness using data from DealScan covering the last general purpose or working capital loan issued to each non-
financial borrower before the crisis. For this analysis, we follow Bradley and Roberts (2015) and define covenant
restrictiveness using the number of covenants in the loan package and BerlinNiniYu in excluding observations
with no covenants reported as these appear to reflect missing data rather than an actual absence of covenants. The
mean number of covenants in the DealScan sample is 2.3 with a standard deviation of 1.0. The difference in the
number of covenants in loans from a lead lender in the top and bottom half of the lender health distribution is an
economically trivial 0.12 (t-statistic 1.03). Finally, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test does not reject equality of the full
distributions of pre-crisis covenant tightness from healthy and less healthy lenders.

appear similar in size, pre-crisis leverage, risk rating, maturity remaining, and along the financial
characteristics drawn from Compustat. We cannot reject equality of means for any variable.
   The second concern with OLS is that covenant violation status is not randomly assigned. Com-
paring columns (1) and (2) to columns (3) and (4) of table 2, borrowers that violate covenants
during the crisis were ex ante riskier, more levered, less profitable, more volatile, already closer
to a violation threshold, and had lower cash flows. These differences raise the possibility that un-
healthy lenders prioritized negotiations to reduce exposure to all weak firms, and not only to those
that violated covenants. The long-term nature of contracts should have limited lenders’ ability
to tighten credit to non-violators, mitigating the plausibility of this alternative interpretation. To
further address this possibility, our baseline specification includes as covariates measures of bor-
rower quality interacted with lender health, which isolate the impact of lender health× violation
from the impact of lender health×borrower quality.

4.3.    Near Violation Threshold Sample

   The preceding sub-section argued that OLS may in fact provide consistent estimates in our
setting. Nonetheless, we present two additional research designs that further relax the assumptions
embedded in the OLS approach. The first restricts the sample to loans on either side of but close to
a covenant threshold. This approach follows an influential literature using regression discontinuity
methods to study the impact of covenant violations on firms (Chava and Roberts, 2008; Roberts
and Sufi, 2009a; Nini, Smith, and Sufi, 2012; Falato and Liang, 2016). The logic is that even if
borrowers of less healthy lenders were of worse quality or worked harder to manipulate violation
status than borrowers of healthier lenders, as long as manipulation is not precise, then status is
randomly assigned in a neighborhood around the threshold (Lee and Lemieux, 2010). In support
of this assumption, McCrary (2008) density tests do not reject the null of continuous density of
distance to violation in either the full sample (p-value=0.75) or in the subsample of loans from
lenders in the worse half of the lender health distribution (p-value=0.46). Absence of precise
manipulation is sufficient to causally identify treatment effects for borrowers of healthy and less
healthy lenders separately, as we show formally in Online Appendix O.2. It follows that the
interaction term Bad Lender × Bind in equation (2) identifies the additional effect of a violation
in the set of loans from less healthy lenders, even if the overall distribution of borrowers or of
covenant violators differs across lender type.


                                                 20
4.4.       Instrumental Variables

       Our final research design treats Bind as an endogenous variable and introduces four excluded
instruments (and their interactions with Bad Lender) that predict Bind and Bad Lender × Bind
but should not otherwise affect the dependent variable Y . We describe the instruments and then
show first stage results.
       The first two instruments affect the travel time between the headquarters of the lead lender
and the borrower. Similar to Giroud (2013) and Bernstein, Giroud, and Townsend (2016), we
expect reduced travel time to increase the monitoring ability of a bank. In our setting, this would
lessen the need for restrictive covenants, making it less likely the borrower violates during the
2008-09 crisis. We follow these articles and use as our first excluded instrument the introduction
in the year of loan origination of a new airline route (direct or indirect) that reduces the air travel
time between the lead lender’s and borrower’s headquarters counties. The second instrument is
an indicator for whether an airline that services the primary route connecting the lender’s and
borrower’s counties is in bankruptcy proceedings during the year of origination. Both of these
events are strong predictors of the minimum travel time between two cities. The main threat to
the exclusion restriction is that the opening of an airline route anticipates growth of the origin or
destination and that an airline bankruptcy reflects declining conditions in these cities. The fact
that large national airlines account for all of the airline bankruptcies in the sample mitigates the
second concern. We also follow Giroud (2013) in reporting robustness exercises that include lender
and borrower location fixed effects to address the possibility that new airline routes anticipate
growth of the origin or destination city.
       The third instrument is an indicator for whether a bank has a strict or lax supervisor at the
time of origination. As in Agarwal et al. (2014), we find that some supervisors systematically
impose stricter or laxer lending standards.18 We expect stricter regulators to demand tighter
covenants, increasing the likelihood of a violation during the crisis. Importantly for the exclusion
restriction, having a lax supervisor at the time of origination does not correlate with Bad Lender
during the crisis (see table O.2).
       The fourth instrument captures a random cash flow shock. Brown, Gustafson, and Ivanov
  18
   The main supervisor is one of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, FDIC, OCC, or a state regulator.
We are prevented from disclosing the assignment of strict or lax to each supervisor. However, our attribution
methodology is consistent with Agarwal et al. (2014).

 Notes: The table reports the first stage regressions for endogenous variable Bind. The sample consists of all loans
in the SNC covenant sample at the start of 2008 or 2009 with at least one year maturity remaining and a lead
lender in the lender health data set. Bind is an indicator variable equal to 1 if a borrower violated a covenant in
either the current or previous year. Controls: year, industry, log assets, leverage, risk rating, the interaction of
each with Bad Lender, and loan purpose and loan type. Standard errors two-way clustered by borrower and lead
lender reported in parentheses. *,**,*** indicate significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels, respectively.


(forthcoming) show that abnormally high snow fall in a firm’s location results in temporarily
higher costs and lower earnings. Since most financial covenants depend on earnings, we expect
higher abnormal snow fall to predict covenant violations. Our measure is the level of snow fall in
the winter quarters (Q1 and Q4) of the year relative to the ten year trailing average. Importantly,
firms that violate covenants because of extreme weather events should not differ along other
dimensions that would affect how lenders resolve the violation. For ease of interpretation, we
rank-normalize this variable to lie on the unit interval.
    Columns (1) to (3) of table 3 report the first stage results for Bind, separately for the two travel
time instruments, the lax supervisor indicator, and abnormal snow cover. We also include in each
regression our baseline set of covariates: year and industry fixed effects, borrower size, leverage, and
risk rating, loan purpose and type, and the interaction of each borrower covariate with Bad Lender.
Each excluded instrument predicts Bind with the expected sign and has strong explanatory power,
with partial F-statistics ranging between 9 and 43. The instruments also generate meaningful
economic variation in Bind; a new airline route reduces the likelihood of a covenant binding by
7.7 p.p., an airline bankruptcy increases the likelihood by 13.9 p.p., a lax supervisor reduces the
likelihood by 6.8 p.p., and moving from the 25th to the 75th percentile of abnormal snow fall

increases the violation propensity by 5.3 p.p. Column (4) groups all of the instruments together.
Each coefficient retains its expected sign and remains highly statistically significant, indicating
substantial independent predictive power of each instrument. The joint F-statistic of 28 signifies
a strong first stage. To provide some context for the exclusion restriction, table O.2 of the online
appendix reports placebo first stage results replacing Bind with Bad Lender as the dependent
variable. The exclusion restriction requires that the excluded instruments affect outcomes only
through their effect on Bind; in particular, they should not affect Bad Lender. Individually or
jointly, the excluded instruments have no statistical power for predicting Bad Lender and the
confidence intervals rule out economically meaningful effects.

     We present empirical results at the borrower and loan level. Section 5.1 displays our main find-
ing non-parametrically by comparing the average change in loan commitment by cells of covenant
compliance and lender health. Section 5.2 analyzes linear probability models for whether a loan
undergoes a reduction in committed amount. Section 5.3 measures the change in total credit at
the loan and borrower level and reveals that affected borrowers do not substitute toward other
sources of credit. Section 5.4 shows that the covenant channel transmits to balance sheet and real
outcomes such as investment and employment. Section 5.5 reports robustness and specification
tests to bolster the causal interpretation of the results. Finally, section 5.6 explores treatment
heterogeneity by loan characteristics.

5.1.     Non-parametric Evidence

     Table 4 displays a non-parametric version of our main result by comparing the average change
in loan commitment by quartile of lender health and whether the loan breached a covenant.
To focus on seemingly insulated borrowers, we restrict to loans with at least one year maturity
remaining. Because of the rarity of loans with shorter maturity, imposing this sample restriction
has a negligible effect, and we report the corresponding table including expiring credit in table O.3.
Among loans that do not breach a covenant, the average change in commitment is small, positive,
and does not differ much by lender health. These changes reflect the frequent renegotiation of
loan terms even absent a covenant violation (Roberts and Sufi, 2009b; Denis and Wang, 2014;

 Notes: The table reports the average change in loan commitment in each cell. The sample consists of all loans
in the SNC covenant sample at the start of 2008 or 2009, with at least one year maturity remaining, and with a
lead lender in the lender health data set. Bad Lender is the rank of the lead lender’s health normalized to lie on
the unit interval, with a value of 1 corresponding to the least healthy lender. Bind is an indicator variable equal
to 1 if a borrower violated a covenant in either the current or previous year. The brackets report the number of
observations in each cell.


Roberts, 2015; Mian and Santos, 2018). In contrast, loans that violate a covenant experience
large average reductions in credit, rising from an average decline of 6.5% in the healthiest quartile
of lenders to a decline of 15.6% in the least healthy quartile. Thus, changes in credit on existing
loans concentrated on covenant violators, and more so for loans from less healthy lenders. The
additional 13.1 percentage point reduction in credit for loans that violate covenants and come
from lenders in the least healthy relative to the healthiest quartile is a non-parametric difference-
in-difference estimate of the effect of having a lender in bad health following a covenant violation.

5.2.     Probability of Credit Reduction

    We now turn to regression analysis in order to quantify statistical significance, control for
covariates, and employ our alternative identification strategies. We start with linear probability
models of how lender health affects credit availability following a covenant violation. The outcome
variable, Credit reduced, equals 1 if either the loan is terminated before maturity or the loan
commitment is reduced. The structure of SNC allows us to follow a loan through amendments,
modifications, and refinancing in constructing this variable. Standard errors are two-way clustered


                                                        24
by borrower and lead lender.19
       Table 5 reports results using equation (2). For readability, all coefficients are multiplied by 100.
The first column imposes β3 = 0, i.e. no interaction of Bad Lender and Bind, controls only for year
and industry fixed effects, and restrict to loans with at least one year maturity remaining in order
to focus on seemingly insulated borrowers. In this specification, both un-interacted variables have
positive and significant coefficients. Column (2) adds the interaction term Bad lender × Bind.
The coefficients on the main effects fall substantially and become statistically insignificant upon
addition of the interaction term. Recalling the normalization of the lender health measure to lie on
the unit interval, the coefficient on the interaction of 25.9 has the interpretation that moving from
a lender at the 25th percentile of the lender health distribution to a lender at the 75th percentile
raises the likelihood of a reduction in credit following a violation by 25.9/2=12.9 percentage points.
This difference is statistically significant at the 1% level.
       In column (3) we additionally control for borrower size, leverage, and risk rating, and loan
purpose and type, and the interaction of each borrower covariate with Bad Lender. Including these
control variables allows borrowers of healthier and less healthy lenders to differ along observable
dimensions and for weaker lenders to reduce credit by more to all weak borrowers and not just
to covenant violators. While the explanatory power of the regression rises with the controls, the
magnitude and statistical significance of the interaction coefficient remains stable.20 The coefficient
stability with and without the controls is consistent with the ex ante matching of borrowers and
lenders and covenant tightness being as good as randomly assigned.21
       The results so far apply only to long-term loans in order to focus on seemingly-insulated
  19
      We cluster along the lead lender dimension because the treatment Bad Lender does not vary across loans from
the same lead lender. The borrower dimension accounts for borrowers with multiple loans in the sample each with
a different lead lender. The sample contains relatively few such borrowers and the standard errors are virtually
unchanged if we cluster by lead lender only.
   20
      These control variables all come from SNC, so that their inclusion does not diminish the sample size. Table O.4
in the online appendix reports robustness to additional controls including financial variables available only in
Compustat.
   21
      Not shown, the coefficients on the interaction of Bad Lender and borrower quality are all not statistically
significant and close to zero, providing further evidence against unhealthy lenders having reduced credit to all low
quality borrowers irrespective of violation status. The statistically insignificant estimate of β1 also merits brief
comment. Borrowers attached to bad lenders but who did not violate a covenant did not experience a significantly
higher likelihood of having their credit diminished. This result militates against a correlated decline in loan
demand and voluntary reduction of credit across all borrowers of less healthy lenders as an explanation for why
these banks reduced lending. We also find in unreported regressions based on merging the SNC data with loan
pricing information in DealScan an increase in interest costs for covenant violators of unhealthy lenders, a result
again inconsistent with a voluntary reduction in loan amount. Finally, the probability of a waiver is substantially
lower for loans from less healthy lenders.

β2 [Bind] + β3 [Bad Lender × Bind] + γ 0 Xl,b,t + l,b,f,t . The sample consists of all loans in the SNC covenant sample
at the start of 2008 or 2009 and a lead lender in the lender health data set. The variable Credit reduced equals 1
if either the loan is terminated before maturity (T erm.) or the loan commitment is reduced (Intensive margin).
Bad Lender is the rank of the lead lender’s health normalized to lie on the unit interval, with a value of 1
corresponding to the least healthy lender. Bind is an indicator variable equal to 1 if a borrower violated a covenant
in either the current or previous year. Reported coefficients are multiplied by 100. Borrower controls: log assets,

borrowers. In this sample, unhealthy lenders can force a reduction in exposure only on covenant
violators. In column (4), we expand the sample to expiring loans.22 We continue to find an
economically and statistically significant interaction term. Perhaps more surprising, the main
effect on Bad Lender remains small and statistically insignificant, despite lenders’ contractual
freedom to reduce credit on expiring loans. This result obtains because, as shown in table 1, very
little credit is actually short-term. Thus, this column illustrates our main conclusion: differences in
financial health across banks mattered through their effect on the resolution of covenant violations.
       Columns (5) and (6) return to the sample of long-term loans and split the dependent variable
into outright terminations and intensive margin reductions in credit. By construction, the coeffi-
cients in these columns sum to the coefficients reported in column (3) for the combined variable
  22
    Recall that we re-code all new loans from the same lead lender to the same borrower to have the same loan ID
as a simultaneously expiring loan. Therefore, for expiring loans the dependent variable in column (4) captures the
change in credit from the expiring loan’s lead lender to the borrower.

Credit reduced. The higher likelihood of a reduction in credit for a covenant violator with an un-
healthy lender comes roughly half from a higher likelihood of an outright termination and roughly
half from a higher likelihood of an intensive margin reduction in credit.
       Table 6 repeats the analysis using our alternative estimation strategies. Columns (1) imple-
ments a regression discontinuity (RD) approach. Specifically, we add as control variables the
percent distance from the threshold of the most tightly binding covenant at the start of the year
and the interaction of this variable with Bad Lender and we exclude observations for which the
absolute value of the distance control exceeds 30%.23 The interaction coefficient of 23.0 is little
  23
    While the flag for covenant compliance covers the entire year, we have the distance measure only at the start
and end of the year. For firms that breach a threshold, distance at the end of the year obviously depends on the
response of the lender and would not constitute a valid control. We have the distance measure for 1,717 of the
3,420 observations in the full sample.

changed from the full-sample OLS coefficient of 22.9 reported in column (3) of table 5. Table O.5
of the online appendix reports robustness of this result to higher order polynomials in distance
and to a smaller bandwidth around the violation threshold.
       Columns (2)-(5) report the IV specifications. We obtain similar second stage coefficients using
the travel time (column 2), lax supervisor (column 3), or abnormal snow (column 4) instruments
(as well as their interaction with Bad Lender) separately. The similarity and statistical signifi-
cance of the interaction term across instrument sets bolsters the credibility of the instruments, as
they capture very different sources of variation in Bind. Grouping all of the excluded instruments
together in column (5), we obtain similar coefficients on the main effects and a slightly larger
interaction coefficient than with OLS. Not shown in the table, the J-statistic cannot reject joint
exogeneity of the excluded instruments (p-value 0.18). Table O.6 of the online appendix reports
additional robustness of the IV estimators, including (i) controlling for borrower and lender loca-
tion in the specification with the travel time instrument, as in Giroud (2013); (ii) controlling for
lender fixed effects in the specification with the supervisor strictness instrument, which restricts
the variation to coming from changes in a lender’s supervising institution arising from the periodic
rotation of supervisors, as in Agarwal et al. (2014); (iii) controlling for borrower location fixed
effects in the specification with the abnormal snow instrument to account for time-invariant char-
acteristics of borrowers’ locations; and (iv) controlling for borrower location and lender fixed effects
in the specification combining all excluded instruments together.24 For example, the interaction
coefficient becomes 27.6 (standard error 9.7) in the specification with all excluded instruments and
including borrower location and lender fixed effects, while the coefficient on Bind remains small
and insignificant.

5.3.       Effect on Credit Available and Substitution

       We now examine the effect on total credit available to the borrower including the ability to
switch to other lenders. Panel A of table 7 reports OLS results using the full covenant review
sample, Panel B restricts to loans within 30% of a covenant violation threshold and controls for
the distance to threshold, and Panel C reports IV results grouping all of the excluded instruments
  24
     Note that including lender fixed effects necessitates removing the main effect on Bad Lender from the spec-
ification. The interpretation of the coefficient on Bad Lender as the effect of lender health on firms that do not
violate covenants explains why we include it instead of lender fixed effects in our baseline specification. Likewise,
identification of the robustness specifications with borrower county fixed effects comes only from counties with
multiple borrowers.

together. All panels and columns include the full set of controls shown in table 5.
    Column (1) reports estimates of equation (2) where the dependent variable is the percent
change in the total amount committed and the sample contains only loans that began the year
with remaining maturity greater than one year and remain extant at the end of the year. Thus, this
column shows the intensive margin change in credit at the loan level.25 The interaction coefficient
of -16.4 in Panel A has the interpretation that a covenant violation results in an intensive margin
decline 16.4/2=8.2 percentage points larger when moving from a lender at the 25th percentile of
the lender health distribution to a lender at the 75th percentile. The decline is larger in Panels B
and C, although the confidence intervals overlap.
    Column (2) adds to the sample loans that began the year with maturity greater than one year
but are prematurely terminated. Thus, column (2) captures the intensive and extensive margins
of adjustment. Including loan terminations causes the interaction coefficient to rise by about two-
thirds in absolute value relative to the specification including only the intensive margin. Across
these two columns and similar to the results in table 5, the much smaller coefficients on the main
effects for Bad Lender and Bind reflect the insulation of borrowers with long-term loan contracts
who do not violate a covenant from the health of their lender in the case of Bad Lender and the
pervasiveness of covenant waivers granted by lenders in good health in the case of Bind.
    Figure 2 illustrates graphically the result from column (2) in the near-violator sample. The
figure shows two separate plots. The left panel contains only loans from lenders in the less healthy
half of the distribution. These loans have been partitioned into 20 equally-spaced bins based on
the distance to a covenant violation at the start of the year, with loans to the left of zero already
in violation and loans to the right of zero not in violation.26 Each dot shows the average change in
commitment for loans in a bin and represents 19.5 loans on average (780 loans in the near-violator
sample divided by 40 total bins). The solid lines report local linear regressions and the dashed
lines 95% confidence bands. There is a visible jump down in credit growth for loans in violation
at the start of the year. The right panel contains the same plot but for loans from lenders in
the healthier half of the health distribution. For this sample, there is no discernible jump for
loans in violation at the start of the year. The difference in the size of the jumps provides the
   25
      For this specification only, the sample also excludes loans that receive a new loan identifier in SNC but that
we re-code as a continuous loan based on continuity of the borrower-lender pair.
   26
      Of course, loans that start the year in compliance may breach a covenant during the year. In this sense, the
figure reports the reduced form of a fuzzy regression discontinuity.

 Notes: The table reports regressions of the form: Y = β0 + β1 [Bad Lender] + β2 [Bind] + β3 [Bad Lender × Bind] +
γ 0 X + . Bad Lender is the rank of the lead lender’s health normalized to lie on the unit interval, with a value
of 1 corresponding to the least healthy lender. Bind is an indicator variable equal to 1 if a borrower violated a
covenant in either the current or previous year. In column (1) the sample excludes loans that disappear or change
identifier by the end of the year; in column (2) the sample is the same as table 5; and in columns (3)-(5) the
sample contains all loans in the SNC universe to a borrower in the table 5 sample and the data are collapsed to
the borrower-year level. The dependent variable is the percent change in total committed credit associated with
loan l (1); the percent change in total committed credit on loans from lead lender b to borrower f (2); the percent
change in total committed credit aggregated across all loans in the SNC universe to borrower f (3); the change in
the utilization rate across all loans to borrower f (4); or the percent change in total credit outstanding, defined
as the sum of term loans and the drawn portion of credit lines, aggregated across all loans to borrower f in the
SNC universe (5). SNC Borrower controls: log assets, leverage, risk rating. Loan controls: loan purpose, loan

 Notes: The figure plots the average annual growth in loan commitment against the distance from a covenant
threshold at the start of the year, separately for loans from lenders with Bad Lender above the median (left panel)
and below the median (right panel). The loans in each panel have been partitioned into 20 equally-spaced bins
based on the distance to a covenant violation at the start of the year, with loans to the left of zero already in
violation and loans to the right of zero not in violation. Each dot shows the average change in commitment for
loans in a bin and represents 19.5 loans on average (780 loans in the near-violator sample divided by 40 total
bins). The solid lines report a local polynomial of order 1 and the dashed lines 95% confidence bands based on
bootstrapped standard errors.


above/below median version of the interaction term shown in column (2) of table 7. The figure
also illustrates the argument in appendix O.2 concerning causal identification in the near-violator
sample; as long as manipulation around the violation threshold is not precise, status is randomly
assigned in a neighborhood around the threshold (Lee and Lemieux, 2010) and the specification
causally identifies treatment effects for borrowers of healthy and less healthy lenders separately.
               Column (3) of table 7 aggregates to the borrower level. Here and elsewhere, when we aggregate
to the borrower level we define both Bind and Bad Lender as the maximum across all loans for
firms with multiple loans in the covenant sample. The dependent variable is the percent change in
all loans to the borrower in the full SNC universe. Analyzing the effect on loan commitment at the
borrower level allows for any substitution margin by borrowers toward lenders already servicing
different loans or the opening of new loans. We find even larger percent declines in credit available
after aggregating to the borrower level. Because the denominator of the dependent variable in
column (3) includes all loan commitments to the borrower and therefore (weakly) exceeds the
denominator in column (2), the larger interaction coefficient in column (3) indicates that affected




                                                                         31
borrowers receive less credit from other lenders.27 Previous literature has motivated costly switch-
ing to new lenders from asymmetric information between old and new lenders (Williamson, 1987;
Sharpe, 1990; Hachem, 2011; Darmouni, 2016). An even simpler “covenant overhang” explanation
may apply in the case of covenant violators—lenders do not want to provide new loans to a bor-
rower with an unresolved covenant violation because of the uncertain resolution of that violation,
and firms that have breached an interest coverage or debt covenant face a contractual prohibition
on obtaining new lending.
       Column (4) shows that firms respond to the decline in commitments in part by increasing
their utilization rate. The higher utilization reinforces our causal interpretation that the decline
in credit to these borrowers reflects a supply contraction and not a lower demand for borrowing
by covenant violators of unhealthy lenders. Column (5) shows that there is nonetheless an overall
decline in loans outstanding to the firm, defined as the sum of term loans and the drawn part of
credit lines. Thus, the covenant channel not only reduces unused credit line commitments, but
also affects on-balance sheet lending.

5.4.       Balance Sheet Adjustment and Real Outcomes

       We now turn in table 8 to how borrowers adjust to lower bank credit. Panel A reports results
using the full covenant review sample, Panel B restricts to loans within 30% of a covenant violation
threshold, and Panel C reports IV results grouping all of the excluded instruments together.
       Columns (1) and (2) examine whether borrowers substitute non-bank credit. Column (1) uses
the measure of total debt reported in SNC. This variable has the advantage of existing for all firms
in SNC, including non-public firms, but the drawback that a firm must appear in SNC at the end of
the year for us to observe the end-of-year value, so that the column (1) sample excludes borrowers
whose loans were terminated. To isolate substitution toward non-SNC debt, we subtract from the
total the sum of SNC term loans and the drawn part of credit lines and compute the difference
between the beginning and end of the year as a percentage of beginning of period total assets.
Column (2) studies the effect on debt issuance reported in Compustat. While the restriction to
  27
    Recall that the SNC universe contains all loans of at least $20 million shared by three or more unaffiliated
financial institutions under the regulatory purview of one of the SNC supervisors. If borrowers substitute loans
not in the SNC universe, then the result in column (3) could overstate the magnitude of the total bank credit
decline. We have estimated a similar specification for the number of new loans reported by a borrower in DealScan,
which does not condition on the identity of the lender, and also find a reduced likelihood of a new loan reported in
DealScan for borrowers of unhealthy lenders who violate a covenant.

  Notes: The table reports regressions of the form: Y = β0 + β1 [Bad Lender] + β2 Bind + β3 [Bad Lender ×
Bind] + γ 0 X + . In column (1) the sample contains all borrowers in the table 5 sample with at least one SNC
loan outstanding at the end of the year and the data are collapsed to the borrower-year level. In columns (2)-(5)
the sample is borrowers in the table 5 sample that also appear in Compustat and the data are collapsed to the
borrower-year level. Bad Lender is the rank of the lead lender’s health normalized to lie on the unit interval,
with a value of 1 corresponding to the least healthy lender. Bind is an indicator variable equal to 1 if a borrower
violated a covenant in either the current or previous year. The dependent variable is the change in non-SNC debt
as a share of assets (1); bond issuance as a share of assets (2); shareholder payouts as as share of assets (3); capital
expenditure as a share of book assets (4); or the log change in employment (5). The variables in columns (2)-(5) are
winsorized at the 1% level. Borrower controls: log assets, leverage, risk rating. Standard errors two-way clustered
by borrower and worst lead lender reported in parentheses. *,**,*** indicate significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent
levels, respectively.

firms in Compustat reduces the number of observations, it avoids the censoring problem of firms
that exit SNC.28 We find no evidence of affected borrowers substituting toward non-SNC credit in
either sample, likely for the same reasons that prevent substitution toward other lenders covered
by SNC. Column (3) shows that firms also adjust by reducing shareholder payouts, again signaling
scarcity of internal funds.
       Columns (4) and (5) examine effects on real variables using the merged-Compustat sample.
Previous research has found evidence of both lender health (e.g. Chodorow-Reich, 2014) and
covenant violations (Chava and Roberts, 2008; Nini, Smith, and Sufi, 2012; Falato and Liang,
2016) negatively affecting firm investment and employment. We show that the interaction of
these two variables matters above the main effects. For both investment and employment growth
and across all research designs, the interaction term is statistically significant and the magnitude
is such that essentially all of the negative impact of either Bad Lender or Bind on investment and
employment goes through the interaction term and not through the main effects. These results
provide direct evidence of the tight link between the the loan covenant channel and the financial
accelerator in macroeconomic models such as Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010).29

5.5.       Robustness and Specification Tests

       This section reports a number of robustness and specification tests. To streamline presentation,
we focus on the binary outcome specification of whether credit was reduced during the crisis and
the full sample OLS specification. The online appendix reports additional robustness exercises
where the outcome variable is the percent change in committed credit at the loan or borrower
level.
       Table 9 reports robustness to the measure of lender health. Column (1) reproduces the baseline
regression from column (3) of table 5. Column (2) replaces the measure of lender health with the
health of the pre-crisis lead lender, defined using loans outstanding in June 2007.30 Therefore,
  28
      The merge uses company names and the string matching algorithm SAS SPEDIS. We manually review each
proposed match for accuracy. The online appendix provides additional details on the merge procedure. We winsorize
all Compustat variables at the 1% level.
   29
      Subsequent to our paper circulating, Lian and Ma (2019) and Greenwald (2019) have also emphasized how
covenants put cash-flow based lending at the heart of the financial accelerator mechanism.
   30
      This date falls a few weeks before the implosion of the two Bear Stearns hedge funds marking the start of
the subprime crisis, but at a point when few observers expected significant financial disruption. For example, the
Federal Reserve meeting statement from June 28, 2007 acknowledges “ongoing adjustment in the housing sector”
but expects the economy to expand “at a moderate pace over coming quarters” and sees the “risk that inflation
will fail to moderate as expected” as the “predominant policy concern.”



                                                       34
it uses only information on borrower-lender matches made before lender health during the crisis
became apparent. In practice, the stickiness of bank-borrower relationships makes lender health
in June 2007 highly correlated with lender health at the start of 2008 or 2009 and we obtain very
similar quantitative results using the June 2007 health variable.
   Columns (3)-(6) demonstrate the robustness to including the health of syndicate participants,
by using a commitment share-weighted mean (columns (3) and (4)) or median (columns (5) and
(6)) of syndicate health. Recalling that the standard loan contract requires the agreement of
lenders providing at least 51% of the commitment to accelerate repayment following a covenant
breach, the weighted median assigns Bad Lender based on the health of the marginal lender
required to build a coalition to renegotiate the loan. As a caveat, we lack a measure of the health
of non-bank participants such as hedge funds, pension funds, or CLOs. However, while these
non-bank participants provide 40% of the total commitment of the average loan, they typically
play a relatively passive role in syndicate management. We assume they either follow the banks
in the syndicate (columns (3) and (5)) or follow the direction of the lead (columns (4) and (6))
and impute a health measure for the non-banks accordingly. These specifications yield similar
(and statistically significant) point estimates of the coefficient on Bad Lender × Bind, β3 , as the
baseline coefficient in column (1). The larger standard errors for β3 in columns (3)-(6), however,
accord with our baseline assumption that lead lender health alone best captures the health of the
pivotal member in resolving a covenant violation.
   Columns (7)-(9) show results using the three measures of lender health separately, each rank-
normalized. The largest absolute pairwise rank correlation across the measures is 0.36. Yet, using
each lender health measure on its own gives similar results to the baseline coefficients.
   Column (10) changes the dependent variable Yl,b,f,t to be the change in the lead lender’s share
of the loan commitment. If a decline in its health caused the lead lender to force a tightening
of credit provision following a covenant violation, we should expect the lead lender’s share of the
renegotiated loan to decline on average. If instead the tightening of credit reflected only some
unobservable attribute of the borrower, the lead lender share should remain constant or even
increase due to enhanced agency problems between the lead and the other syndicate members.
Notably, using the change in the lead’s share as the dependent variable in equation (2) is akin to
having bilateral credit to a borrower as the dependent variable but including a borrower-loan fixed
effect. This specification therefore closely resembles the “within estimator” of Khwaja and Mian

     where Bad Lender is normalized to lie on the unit interval, with a value of 1 corresponding to the least healthy lender, and Bind is an indicator variable
     equal to 1 if a borrower violated a covenant in either the current or previous year. Column (1) reproduces column (3) of table 5. In column (2) the sample
     and variable definitions are the same as in column (1) except that the sample excludes loans to borrowers without a loan in SNC as of June 2007 and
     lender health assignment is based on the lead lender as of June 2007. In columns (3)-(6) the sample and variable definitions are the same as in column
     (1) except that lender health assignment is based on the weighted mean health of banks in the crisis syndicate (3), the weighted mean health of the crisis
     syndicate imputing the health of the lead for non-banks (4), the weighted median health of banks in the crisis syndicate (5), or the weighted median health
     of the crisis syndicate imputing the health of the lead for non-banks (6). In columns (7)-(9) the sample is the same as in column (1) but lender health is
     defined using only the Lehman exposure measure (7), the ABX exposure (8), or the trading revenue measure (9). In columns (1)-(9), the dependent variable
     Credit reduced equals 1 if either the loan is terminated before maturity or the loan commitment is reduced. In column (10) the sample excludes loans that
     disappear by the end of the year and the dependent variable is the change in the fraction of the loan commitment from the lead lender. Reported coefficients
     are multiplied by 100. Borrower controls: log assets, leverage, risk rating. Loan controls: loan purpose, loan type. Standard errors two-way clustered by
     borrower and lead lender reported in parentheses. *,**,*** indicate significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels, respectively.
(2008) in that it differences out any heterogeneity across borrowers in loan demand. The negative
coefficient for the interaction term in column (10) indicates a reduction in lending by the lead
lender relative to other syndicate participants, consistent with the tightening of credit reflecting
the increase in internal cost of funds for the lead lender. The magnitude, a decline in commitment
share of about 5 percentage points between lenders at the 25th and 75th percentiles of the lender
health distribution, is equal to roughly one-third of the sample mean lead commitment share of
15% during the crisis reported in table 1.
   Table 10 and figure 3 demonstrate the stability of the results to changes in the sample. Column
(1) of table 10 reproduces the baseline result. Columns (2)-(4) address the over-weighting of low
quality loans in the covenant review sample, in column (2) by re-weighting the sample to match
the distribution of risk ratings in the full SNC universe, in column (3) by including only loans with
a pre-crisis rating of “Best”, and in column (4) by excluding loans that violated a covenant before
the crisis so that the sample only includes new violators. Column (5) only includes loans with at
least 2 years maturity remaining. Column (6) excludes loans for which the lead lender does not
retain any part of its share. Columns (7) and (8) expand the sample by merging into the full SNC
data information on covenant compliance for loans not in the covenant review sample from Nini,
Smith, and Sufi (2012) and from financial covenants reported in DealScan, respectively. The basic
pattern remains similar across all of these specifications.

      Notes: The table reports linear probability model regressions of the form: Yl,b,f,t = β0 +β1 [Bad Lender]+β2 [Bind]+β3 [Bad Lender×Bind]+γ 0 Xl,b,t +l,b,f,t .
     Column (1) reproduces column (3) of table 5. Column (2) reweights the sample to match the distribution of risk ratings in the full SNC universe. Column
     (3) only includes loans with a pre-crisis rating of “Best”. Column (4) excludes loans that violated a covenant before the crisis. Column (5) includes loans
     with less than 1 year maturity remaining. Column (6) only includes loans with at least 2 years maturity remaining. Column (7) excludes loans for which
     the lead lender does not retain any part of its share. Columns (8) and (9) expand the sample by including information on covenant compliance from Nini,
     Smith, and Sufi (2012) and from DealScan, respectively. The dependent variable Credit reduced equals 1 if either the loan is terminated before maturity or
     the loan commitment is reduced. Bad Lender is the rank of the lead lender’s health normalized to lie on the unit interval, with a value of 1 corresponding
     to the least healthy lender. Bind is an indicator variable equal to 1 if a borrower violated a covenant in either the current or previous year. Reported
     coefficients are multiplied by 100. Borrower controls: log assets, leverage, risk rating. Loan controls: loan purpose, loan type. Standard errors two-way
     clustered by borrower and lead lender reported in parentheses. *,**,*** indicate significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels, respectively.
       Figure 3 reports the interaction coefficients and 95% confidence intervals from re-estimating
the baseline specification while excluding one lender at a time from the sample.31 The coefficients
cluster tightly around the full sample estimate and the 95% intervals exclude zero in all sub-
samples. Thus, the covenant channel is not driven by the behavior of any single lender.
       Table 11 reports placebo exercises. Columns (1) and (2) keep the measure of lender health
assigned to each borrower the same as in our baseline specification but re-estimate the regressions
from table 5 and table 7 for the likelihood and amount of a credit commitment reduction in 2006
and 2007. Borrowers of lenders in worse health during the crisis were not treated differently before
the crisis upon violating a covenant.32 Column (3) replaces the variable Bind with an indicator
for whether the borrower is in the first quartile of the size distribution. This specification shows
that less healthy lenders did not simply cut credit to smaller borrowers irrespective of whether
they violated a covenant. Column (4) follows Imbens and Lemieux (2008) and splits the sample
of close violators into subsamples with Bind = 1 and Bind = 0, and for each subsample redefines
Bind based on whether the variable Distance is above or below the median within the subsample.
This specification shows that the jump in the likelihood of a credit reduction occurs only at the
true threshold for violating a covenant.

5.6.       Heterogeneity

       The structure of loan contracts offers predictions for how the intensity of the treatment effect
of having an unhealthy lender and violating a covenant may vary by type of borrower and loan.
Table 12 explores this treatment heterogeneity. The table reports the coefficients β3 and β3,I from
the fully-interacted OLS regression:

        Yl,b,f,t = β0 + β1 [Bad Lender] + β2 [Bind] + β3 [Bad Lender × Bind] + γ 0 Xl,b,t

              + β0,I [I] + β1,I [Bad Lender × I] + β2,I [Bind × I] + β3,I [Bad Lender × Bind × I]

              + γI0 [Xl,b,t × I] + l,b,f,t ,                                                                     (3)
  31
     Due to disclosure limitations, we cannot report the identity of each lender. The lender identifiers labeling
the y-axis of the figure correspond to those shown in figures O.1 and O.2 of the online appendix, which show the
concentration of lead lenders in SNC and lender health, respectively.
  32
     In contrast, we find statistically significant evidence that having a covenant bind lowers credit unconditionally
in the pre-crisis period. This result does not invalidate the placebo exercise. We would expect lenders to use
covenant violations to restrict credit on some loans even outside the crisis. But this outcome should not occur
differentially at lenders more impacted by the crisis, exactly as we find.

 Notes: The figure reports the interaction coefficient (blue circle) and 95% confidence interval (blue line) from
repeating the specification shown in column (3) of table 5 while dropping one lender at a time from the sample.
The dashed black line shows the value of the coefficient in the full sample.


where Yl,b,f,t is the variable Credit Reduced and I is an indicator variable described in the table
header. Thus, β3 is numerically equivalent to the coefficient from a separate regression including
only observations for which variable I takes a value of 0, while β3 + β3,I is numerically equivalent
to the coefficient from a separate regression including only observations for which variable I takes
a value of 1. The statistical significance of β3,I answers whether the data reject the null hypothesis
of a homogeneous coefficient on [Bad Lender × Bind] in the two subsamples.
   The first column of table 12 explores heterogeneity along the dimension of loan type. Because
reducing the size of a term loan requires immediate repayment while reducing the limit on a credit
line can impact only the unused portion of the commitment, the latter may have a less immediately
drastic effect on borrowers. If so, lenders may more readily take action when the loan is a credit
line than if it is a term loan. Column (1) shows that this heterogeneity holds in the data. While
unhealthy lenders reduce credit to covenant violators with both term loans and credit lines, the

 Notes: The table reports regressions of the form: Yl,b,f,t = β0 + β1 [Bad Lender] + β2 [Bind] + β3 [Bad Lender ×
Bind] + γ 0 Xl,b,t + l,b,f,t . In all columns, the variable Bad Lender is the rank of the crisis health of the assigned
lender as of the period indicated in the table header normalized to lie on the unit interval, with a value of 1
corresponding to the least healthy lender. In columns (1) and (2) the sample consists of loans in the SNC covenant
sample at the start of 2006 or 2007 with at least one year maturity remaining, the dependent variable is based
on outcomes in 2006 and 2007, and lender health assignment is based on the lead lender at the start of the crisis.
In column (3), Bind is replaced with an indicator for whether the borrower is in the bottom quartile of the size
distribution. In column (4), Bind is replaced with an indicator for whether Distance is below the median on each
side of the covenant threshold. Reported coefficients are multiplied by 100. Borrower controls: log assets, leverage,
risk rating. Loan controls: loan purpose, loan type. Standard errors two-way clustered by borrower and lead lender
reported in parentheses. *,**,*** indicate significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels, respectively.


likelihood of a credit reduction is nearly double if the loan is a credit line, although the difference
is not statistically significant.
    Columns (2)-(4) explore the importance of the syndicate structure. In column (2), the inter-
action variable equals 1 if the lead’s share of the total commitment is above the sample median,
in column (3) the interaction variable equals 1 if the number of syndicate members is below the
sample median, and in column (4) the interaction variable equals 1 if the concentration (herfindahl
index) of the lender shares is above the sample median. Smaller, more concentrated, syndicates
and those with a larger lead share are more likely to reduce credit, and these differences are statis-
tically significant at the 5% level. The larger effect for loans with a higher lead share is indicative

 Notes: The table reports linear probability model regressions of the form: Yl,b,f,t = β0 + β1 [Bad Lender] +
β2 [Bind] + β3 [Bad Lender × Bind] + γ 0 Xl,b,t + β0,I [I] + β1,I [Bad Lender × I] + β2,I [Bind × I] + β3,I [Bad Lender ×
Bind × I] + γI0 [Xl,b,t × I] + l,b,f,t . The sample is the same as table 5. The dependent variable Credit reduced
equals 1 if either the loan is terminated before maturity or the loan commitment is reduced. Bad Lender is the
rank of the lead lender’s health normalized to lie on the unit interval, with a value of 1 corresponding to the least
healthy lender. Bind is an indicator variable equal to 1 if a borrower violated a covenant in either the current or
previous year. In column (1), I is an indicator variable for whether the loan is a credit line. In column (2), I is
an indicator variable for whether the lead lender’s share of the loan commitment is above the sample median. In
column (3), I is an indicator variable for whether the number of syndicate members is below the sample median.
In column (4), I is an indicator variable for whether the Herfindahl index of loan commitment shares is above the
sample median. Reported coefficients are multiplied by 100. Borrower controls: log assets, leverage, risk rating.
Loan controls: loan purpose, loan type. Standard errors two-way clustered by borrower and lead lender reported

of the lead lender having a special role in the syndicate due to its monitoring and organizing
responsibilities and responding to greater incentive to organize and oversee a renegotiation when
it provides a larger share of the loan commitment.33 The results in columns (3) and (4) suggest
that smaller, more concentrated syndicates may be easier to organize.
  33
    Alternatively, since the variable Bad Lender reflects the health of the lead lender, the variable may simply better
proxy for the true health of the pivotal syndicate member when the lead provides a larger share of the commitment.
While we cannot rule out this possibility, in unreported regressions we also find a statistically significant larger
treatment effect for loans with a higher lead share even when we define Bad Lender using the weighted median
lender’s health as described in the previous subsection. Thus, the positive interaction term appears to reflect true
dependence on the lead’s share.

6.      Aggregation
     The previous section showed that unhealthy lenders squeeze borrowers who trigger a covenant
violation and that this interaction matters to loan and borrower-level outcomes. We now quantify
the importance of the loan covenant channel in accounting for the total cross-sectional variation
in lender credit supply, including along the margins of expiring loans and potential new borrowers.
To be clear, this aggregation exercise does not answer what would have happened to bank credit
if loan covenants did not exist, in which case banks might have adjusted more on other margins,
such as further restricting credit to new borrowers or reducing non-corporate lending. Rather, the
exercise speaks to how especially unhealthy banks reduced lending in the actual event.
     We first use our regression results to aggregate the credit decline due to the covenant channel.
For this exercise, we weight both the regression and the aggregation to account for the selection into
the covenant sample along the dimension of risk rating. Therefore, we start with the interaction
coefficient β3 from the weighted regression combining the intensive and extensive margin percent
change in loan volume for loans from unhealthy lenders and that violate a covenant, shown in
column (2) of table O.7. The fitted decline in lending volume (including unused commitments)
due to unhealthy lenders squeezing violators implied by this coefficient is:
                                           X
         Fitted decline = − (0.01 × β3 ) ×    Bad Lenderb × Bindl,t−1:t × Commitl,t−1 ,           (4)
                                              l

where Commitl,t−1 is the loan commitment at the end of the previous year re-weighted to make
the covenant review sample representative of the SNC universe along the dimension of risk rating.
Dividing this sum by beginning-of-year total committed credit (including of short maturity) yields
an estimate of the total fraction of credit that disappeared because unhealthy lenders contracted
credit on long-term loans that violated covenants. As shown in row (1) of table 13, this share
equaled 4.9% in 2008 and 5.2% in 2009.
     We put this decline in credit into context by comparing the importance of the covenant channel
to the overall effect of lender health on the cross-section of credit in the crisis. To do so, we
aggregate all term loans and credit lines to nonfinancial borrowers in the full SNC data set up to
the bank level and regress the percent change in total committed credit between the beginning and
end of the year on the variable Bad Lender. We then integrate over the measure of lender health
to obtain an estimate of the total contraction in credit, including along the extensive margins
of expiring and new credit, due to cross-sectional variation in lender health in each year. The

second row of table 13 shows that total bank credit contracted by 8.6% in 2008 and by 6.1% in
2009 relative to if each bank behaved the same as the healthiest lender along all margins. Thus,
the contraction due to the covenant channel accounts for a large share of the total cross-sectional
variation in lender credit supply in each year.



7.      Conclusion
     We have investigated the importance of lender health in determining the response to a covenant
violation. Using a new supervisory data set of bank loans, we document a higher covenant violation
propensity than found in previous work, with roughly one-third of loans breaching a covenant each
year during 2008 and 2009. Lenders in worse financial condition are more likely to force a reduction
in the loan balance following a violation. Quantitatively, the reduction in credit to borrowers with
long-term credit but who violate a covenant accounts for a large part of the total cross-bank
variation in credit supply during the crisis.
     The quantitative significance of the covenant channel raises important questions for future
research. We highlight four implications not explored in this paper. First, when writing loan
contracts ex ante, do lenders and borrowers internalize the effective option to shorten maturity
provided by covenants? Our results suggest they should. However, a body of research finds
that managers may be overconfident in their outlook for their firm (Malmendier and Tate, 2015),
in which case they may underestimate the likelihood of breaching a financial covenant or the
consequences of doing so. Intriguingly, loans with less strict covenants became more common
following firms’ experiences during the 2008-09 crisis. Second, given a need for banks to delever,

                                                      44
how would they have done so absent the ability to reduce credit to covenant violators, and is
concentrating the credit contraction on covenant violators socially efficient? Smaller, ex ante
riskier firms are more likely to violate covenants. In macroeconomic models with a financial
sector, unhealthy banks typically want to reduce credit especially to riskier borrowers because the
value of a marginal dollar of losses rises as the bank moves closer to its default boundary. Yet, firms
with less collateral, such as R&D intensive firms, may also have higher violation rates because of
the substitutability of collateral and covenant tightness as protection for lenders. Whether the
covenant channel focuses credit reductions on those borrowers that banks would prefer to reduce
exposure to even absent contractual constraints, or on R&D intensive borrowers with a high growth
path, matters for the welfare implications. Third, our evidence comes from a particularly acute
crisis period. While such episodes merit special attention due to their macroeconomic importance,
the pervasiveness of covenant violations in non-crisis periods means that this channel may also
matter in more tranquil times. Fourth, the literature on covenants has almost exclusively used
U.S. data. Yet, the transmission of bank health to corporate borrowers appears active in other
countries as well. Do covenant violations abroad play as important a role as they do in the United
States? If not, what is the transmission mechanism?

less loans to financial borrowers (red line); and in our final sample of all term loans and credit lines to nonfinancial
borrowers in the SNC covenant sample with a lead lender in the Chodorow-Reich (2014) data set and which start
the year with at least one year of maturity remaining.

O.1.      Additional Results
   This appendix reports additional results. Figure O.1 reports the share of loans attributed
to each (anonymized) lead lender in the full SNC universe and the SNC covenant sample. Fig-
ure O.2 reports the standardized lender health for each (anonymized) lender. Table O.1 reports
the coefficients and t-statistics from regressions of borrower and loan characteristics on the con-
tinuous variable Bad Lender. Table O.2 reports placebo first-stage results that replace Bind
with Bad Lender as the left hand side variable. Table O.3 repeats the non-parametric analysis
at the level of the borrower and including expiring loans. Table O.4 reports robustness to inclu-
sion of additional covariates. Table O.5 reports additional specifications related to the regression
discontinuity exercises. Table O.6 reports additional robustness of the instrumental variables spec-
ifications. Tables O.7 and O.8 repeat the sample robustness shown in table 10 of the main text but
for the outcome %∆Total committed at the loan (all margins) and borrower level, respectively.

 Notes: The table reports placebo regressions for the excluded instruments predicting Bad Lender. The sample
consists of all loans in the SNC covenant sample at the start of 2008 or 2009 with at least one year maturity
remaining and a lead lender in the lender health data set. Bad Lender is the rank of the lead lender’s health
normalized to lie on the unit interval, with a value of 1 corresponding to the least healthy lender. Controls: year,
industry, log assets, leverage, risk rating, the interaction of each with Bad Lender, and loan purpose and loan
type. Standard errors two-way clustered by borrower and lead lender reported in parentheses. *,**,*** indicate
significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels, respectively.

O.2.      Causal Identification in the Near Violation Threshold
          Sample
   This appendix formalizes the claim in the text that the close violator sample can identify the
causal impact of lender health on a covenant violation even if borrowers differentially attempt to
manipulate violation status. The argument and notation closely follow Lee and Lemieux (2010).
   Let Wb,f measure the (possibly unobserved) quality of firm f that borrows from bank b. W
is drawn from a distribution that may be lender-specific. For simplicity, suppose covenants are
written uniformly by each lender but may differ across lenders. Let Xf be the variable on which
the covenant is written, cb the threshold for bank b, and Df an indicator for firm f violating a
loan. The true causal model is:

                                   Yb,f = τb Df + δ1 Wb,f + Ub,f ,                               (O.1)

                                    Df = I {Xf ≤ cb } ,                                          (O.2)

                                    Xf = δ2,b Wb,f + Vf .                                        (O.3)

Equation (O.1) is the outcome equation and captures the possibility of a heterogeneous response
to covenant violations through the lender-specific coefficient τb . Equation (O.2) is the covenant
status assignment equation. Equation (O.3) relates borrower quality to the variable on which the
covenant is written. The b subscript on δ2 accommodates the possibility that borrowers of lenders
with larger τb work harder to manipulate the variable Xf .
   We make no assumptions on the correlation structure of W, U, V , or the correlation of the
borrower quality distribution for bank b and τb . In particular, unobserved borrower quality Wb,f ,
which influences outcomes directly, may be correlated with τb . Instead, we assume only:

Assumption 1 Imprecise control: Conditional on W = w, U = u, and lender b, the density of
V (and hence X) is continuous.
                                                                                    Pr{Wb,f =w,Ub,f =u}
Under Assumption 1, Pr {Wb,f = w, Ub,f = u|Xf = x} = gb (x|Wb,f = w, Ub,f = u)             gb (x)
                                                                                                        ,
where gb (.) and gb (.|.) are marginal and conditional densities for X at bank b. In particular,
Pr {Wb,f = w, Ub,f = u|Xf = x} is continuous in x. Therefore:

          lim E [Yb,f |Xf = cb + ] − lim E [Yb,f |Xf = cb + ]
           ↑0                         ↓0
                            Z
          = τb + lim − lim         (δ1 w + u) Pr {Wb,f = w, Ub,f = u|Xf = cb + } dx = τb .
                    ↑0   ↓0



                                                 11
It follows that any relationship between τb and the health of lender b is non-parametrically iden-
tified.



O.3.          Details of Sample Construction and Variable Defini-
              tions
This appendix gives additional details on how we construct the main sample and the variables used
for our analysis. The variables used in this paper are extracted from four major data sources: the
Shared National Credit Program (SNC), Loan Pricing Corporation’s (LPC) Dealscan database,
COMPUSTAT, and Capital IQ. For each data item, we indicate the relevant source in square
brackets.
       To construct our sample, we start with the universe of loans to firms incorporated in the United
States that are included in the supervisory review, which covers about 1/3 of the loan volume in
the SNC universe each year. Starting in 2006, loans in the supervisory review contain information
on covenants and compliance as well as loan (non-price) terms and borrower characteristics. Su-
pervisors gather this information from loan documentation and follow up directly with the banks
when needed, such as in instances when the information is either missing or incomplete.
       The SNC supervisory review sample is “weighted toward non-investment grade and criticized
credits,” a category which comprises a relatively broad range of all credits that are below the
highest (“pass”) rating – i.e., both so-called special mention and classified credits.1 Under the
Uniform Loan Classification Standards, classified credits have well-defined weaknesses, including
default in some cases. Special mention credits exhibit potential weaknesses, which may result
in further deterioration if left uncorrected. Two important considerations merit mention. First,
while the sample over-weights non-investment grade and criticized credits, it also contains many
passing credits. For example, in the pre-crisis period (2006-2007) the share of credits to non-
financial borrowers with the highest rating (“pass”) is about 91% in the SNC universe and 73%
in the covenant review sample. Second, the over-weighting occurs on a single dimension — the
loan rating — which is observed in the entire SNC universe. These features allow us to re-weight
the covenant review sample to be representative of the SNC universe when we do our aggregation
exercise. Importantly, there are no other selection criteria. For example, manufacturing firms

                                                    12
account for 17% of the SNC universe and 16% of the covenant review sample. Firms in service
sectors account for 33% of the SNC universe and 29% of the covenant review sample. About
44% of loans in the SNC universe and 38% of loans in the covenant review sample are for working
capital or capital expenditures. Loans for project or trade financing are about 4% in both samples.
Loans for debt repayment or consolidation are about 5% in the SNC universe and about 4% in
the SNC review. Loans for mergers and acquisitions are about 9% in the SNC universe and about
15% in the SNC review. On average, loans in the SNC review are a bit larger than those in the
SNC universe, but the differences are not large ($350M vs 330M).
   Because information on covenants is available only from 2006, we focus our attention on the
sample of loans between 2006 and 2011. The basic unit of observation in SNC is a credit, which is
comparable to a deal or package in Dealscan. SNC provides information on covenant compliance
for each credit-year surveyed. Each credit-year in SNC is classified as either non-compliant if the
borrower has breached a covenant threshold as of the end of the year, or compliant if the borrower
has not breached any covenant threshold as of the end of the year, or compliant after receiving a
waiver or an amendment if the borrower has not breached a covenant threshold after it was reset,
but would have otherwise breached it (if it had not been reset) as of the end of the year. We
classify a firm’s loan covenants to be binding in a given year if the firm is either non-compliant or
compliant after receiving a waiver or an amendment on one of its credits in that year.
   While conceptually straightforward, the measurement of covenant violations poses several chal-
lenges. Specifically, SNC allows us to deal with four main measurement issues following the stan-
dard practice in the literature. First, firms can have multiple loan deals during a given year in our
sample period. For the case when multiple deals overlap (i.e., one deal matures after the start of
another deal) and the analysis is at the borrower level, we define covenant compliance to be the
tightest (i.e., we classify a borrower covenants to be binding if they are binding on at least one of
the borrowers’ credits in any given year) unless it corresponds to a refinancing deal, in which case
we define the relevant covenant status to be that specified by the refinancing credit regardless of
whether or not it is tightest. Second, for the case when there are dynamic covenants that change
over the life of the loan, SNC includes complete information on the covenant dynamics, which we
use to define the compliance status over the life of the loan accordingly. Third, SNC also includes
complete information on post-origination amendments to the loan contract, which we also use to
define compliance status over the life of a loan. Finally, since our data has a lower annual (and not


                                                 13
quarterly) time frequency than existing studies, we opted for including a relatively small fraction
(number) of the newly originated loans, 5.6% (181), that are classified as non-compliant in the
year of the loan origination, a phenomenon also encountered by Dichev and Skinner (2002) and
Chava and Roberts (2008).
   Finally, we retrieved information on loan pricing from Dealscan, as well as borrower balance
sheet information from Compustat for publicly-traded firms and from Capital IQ for privately-held
firms. The final step of our data assembly process is to merge the SNC loan data with information
from these sourced by matching company names. Firms in the SNC universe were compared to
firms in each of these additional data sources using a standard matching algorithm (see, for ex-
ample, Lee and Mas (2012)), which is the SAS SPEDIS function. This function matches company
names in each of the additional data sources to company names in SNC based on a “spelling
distance,” which considers those comparisons with a spelling distance below a predetermined
threshold as candidate matches. For the cases when the algorithm matches a company in SNC to
more than one company name in any of the additional data files, we selected the lowest spelling
distance as the candidate match. Research assistants reviewed every match and manually dropped
those where, based on company headquarter location (state and city) and web searches from mul-
tiple sources including company web sites, Lexis-Nexis, Google, and Factiva, they assessed that
the automated procedure resulted in an incorrect match. As a final quality check of the matching
procedure, we retrieved an additional match file by using the same procedure for the Dealscan-
Compustat linking file from Chava and Roberts (2008), which is available at Michael Robert’s
web page, and verified that the resulting firm identifiers (gvkeys) were the same as those from our
merge with Dealscan.

   The variables used in the analysis are defined as follows.

   Main Explanatory Variables:
Bind is a dummy that takes value of one for any given loan-year when the borrower is either non-
compliant with any of its loan covenants or compliant after receiving a waiver or an amendment
in a given year, i.e., if the borrower either breaches a covenant threshold in any given firm-year
or a covenant is reset or waived so that an otherwise non-compliant borrower would remain in
compliance. [SNC]
Bad Lender is based on Chodorow-Reich (2014) and is the cumulative density (cdf) of the

                                                14
beginning-of-the-period lead-lender exposure to asset-backed securities as measured by the correla-
tion of their daily stock return with the return on the ABX AAA 2006-H1 index (ABX Exposure),
to balance sheet losses not directly affected by the corporate loan portfolio as measured by the
ratio of 2007-2008 trading account losses to total assets (B/S Exposure), and to the Lehman failure
as measured by the fraction of a bank’s syndication portfolio where Lehman Brothers had a lead
role (LEHMAN Exposure), in turn. We use factor analysis to aggregate over these individual ex-
posure proxies and extract an overall exposure proxy which is measured as the cumulative density
(cdf) of the (first) principal component of the three individual proxies calculated using the entire
SNC universe (ALL).

   Outcome Measures:
Credit Reduced is a dummy that equals one for either existing loans that end before their most
recently stated maturity in a given year and are not followed by a new loan to the borrower from
the current lead lender or for existing loans that experienced a reduction in the total dollar amount
limit the borrower is legally allowed to borrow up to according to the loan contract terms in a given
year relative to the previous year. We are able to track loan paths over time because each loan in
SNC is assigned a unique permanent credit identifier, which remains unchanged throughout the
life of the loan including in those years when loan terms are amended or modified or when the
loan is refinanced. [SNC]
Waiver is a dummy that equals one if any of the loan covenants are waived or reset in a given
year. [SNC]
Lead Share (Committed) is the ratio of the dollar amount limit the lead lender is legally committed
to lend divided by the total dollar amount limit the borrower is legally allowed to borrow according
to the loan contract terms in a given year. [SNC]
Lead Amount (Committed) is the natural logarithm of the dollar amount limit the lead lender is
legally committed to lend up to according to the loan contract terms in a given year. [SNC]
Lender Share (Committed) is the ratio of the dollar amount limit the lender is legally committed to
lend divided by the total dollar amount limit the borrower is legally allowed to borrow according
to the loan contract terms in a given year. [SNC]
Lender Amount (Committed) is the natural logarithm of the dollar amount limit the lender is
legally committed to lend up to according to the loan contract terms in a given year. [SNC]


                                                 15
Loan Utilization Rate is the ratio of the loan balance (the dollar amount the borrower has drawn
which has not been repaid) divided by the total dollar amount limit the borrower is legally allowed
to borrow according to the loan contract terms in a given year. [SNC]
Payouts/Assets is dividends (item 21) plus net-repurchases divided by lagged total book assets
(item 6). Net-repurchases are stock purchases (item 115) minus stock issuances (item 108) and
are set to zero if negative. [Compustat]
Capex/Assets is capital expenditures (item 128) divided by lagged total book assets (item 6).
[Compustat]
Employment Growth is the ratio of the total number of employees (item 29t ) minus the lagged
total number of employees (item 29t−1 ) divided by the lagged total number of employees (item
29t−1 ). [Compustat]
Bond Issuance/Assets is total dollar proceeds from new issuance of bonds divided by lagged total
book assets (item 6) [FISD & Compustat]

   Firm and Industry Variables:

   Sample-Split Variables:
Credit line is a dummy variable for whether the loan is a credit line. [SNC]
High Lead Share is a dummy variable for whether the lead share is above the sample median in a
given year. [SNC]
Small Syndicate is a dummy variable for whether the number of syndicate members is below the
sample median in a given year. [SNC]
Concentrated Syndicate is a dummy variable for whather the Herfindahl index of loan commitment
shares (calculated as the sum of squared shares across lenders) is above the sample median in a
given year. [SNC]

   Additional Controls:
Loan origination year is a full set of dummies that equal one for each year in which any given loan
was originated. [SNC]

in SNC, such as, for example, M&As, CAPEX, working capital, general corporate purposes. [SNC]
Loan type is a full set of dummies that equal one for each of the loan type categories included in
SNC, such as, for example, term loan, revolving credit, non-revolving line of credit. [SNC]


                                                 16
Borrower sector is a full set of dummies that equal one for each of the 8 borrower sector categories
included in SNC, such as, for example, manufacturing, services, distribution. [SNC]

to borrow up to according to the loan contract terms in a given year. [SNC]
Borrower size is the natural logarithm of the book value of assets. [SNC]
Leverage is the ratio of total book debt to book value of assets. [SNC]
Risk rating is an indicator variable equal to 1 if the supervisory risk rating assigned to the loan
is “Pass”. There are five possible supervisory risk rating categories: Pass (for loans that are
considered to be in good standing), Special Mention (for loans that are in good standing but have
potential weaknesses that, if left uncorrected, could result in further deterioration of the repayment
prospects), Substandard (for loans that are inadequately protected by the current sound worth
and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any), Doubtful (for loans that
are considered substandard and, in addition, have weaknesses that make collection or liquidation
in full, on the basis of available current information, highly questionable or improbable), and Loss
(for loans that are considered uncollectible and of so little value that their continuance as bankable
assets is not warranted and, as such, should be promptly charged off). [SNC]
Cash flows is the ratio of income before extraordinary items plus depreciation and amortization
(item 18+item14) over lagged total book assets (item 6). [Compustat]
Return on assets (ROA) is the ratio of operating income after depreciation (item 178) over lagged
total assets (item 6).[Compustat]
Tobin’s Q is the market value of assets divided by the book value of assets (item 6), where the
market value of assets equals the book value of assets plus the market value of common equity
less the sum of the book value of common equity (item 60) and balance sheet deferred taxes (item
74). [Compustat]
Z-score is the Altman’s Z-Score, which is defined as the sum of 3.3 times pre-tax income, sales,
1.4 times retained earnings, and 1.2 times net working capital all divided by total assets (itme 6).
[Compustat]
Discretionary accruals are defined as Accruals DD in Chava and Roberts (2008). [Compustat]

                                                 17
Market beta is the estimated slope coefficient on the market excess return from projecting the
firm excess return on the market excess return using daily stock return data. We obtain annual
estimates by annualizing the average of monthly estimates. [CRSP]
Idiosyncratic volatility is the variance of estimated residuals from projecting the firm excess re-
turn on the market excess return using daily stock return data. We obtain annual estimates by
annualizing the average of monthly estimates.[CRSP]
Total volatility is the variance of the firm excess return using daily stock return data. We obtain
annual estimates by annualizing the average of monthly estimates.[CRSP]
   Excluded instruments:
    New Route is a dummy that takes value of one for introduction of a new airline route that
reduces the travel time between the borrower and the lender in the year of loan origination, similar
to Giroud (2013) and Bernstein, Giroud, and Townsend (2016), to which we refer for additional
details. Location is headquarter county. Data on airline routes is from the T-100 Domestic
Segment Database, which is compiled from Form 41 of the U.S. Department of Transportation
(DOT). All airlines operating flights in the United States are required by law to file Form 41 with
the DOT. For all flights that have taken place between any two airports in the United States, the
T-100 contains (monthly) data for each airline and route (segment) on the origin and destination
airports, flight duration (ramp-to-ramp time), and scheduled and performed departures. We define
New Route as an indicator variable that equals one if a new airline route is introduced that reduces
the travel time between the borrower and the lender in the year of loan origination. [DOT]
   Airline Bankruptcy is exposure to an airline bankruptcy for the primary route that connects
the borrower and the lender in the year of loan origination. Location is headquarter county. Data
on airline routes is from the T-100 Domestic Segment Database, which is compiled from Form 41 of
the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). All airlines operating flights in the United States
are required by law to file Form 41 with the DOT. For all flights that have taken place between
any two airports in the United States, the T-100 contains (monthly) data for each airline and
route (segment) on the origin and destination airports, flight duration (ramp-to-ramp time), and
scheduled and performed departures. Data on major airlines bankruptcies is hand-collected from
the airlines’ public filings with the SEC, which we cross-check with corporate announcements from
the CapitalIQ Key Developments Dataset. We include the following major airline bankruptcies
(bankruptcy process dates in parentheses): Delta (Sept 14 2005-April 30 2007), Northwest (Sept


                                                18
14 2005-May 31 2007), United (Dec 9 2002-Dec1 2006), US Air (Aug 11 2002-Mar 31, 2003; Sept
12 2004-Sept 27 2005). [DOT and SEC filings]
   Lax Supervisor is a dummy that equals one if the supervisory institution in the quarter of loan
origination is lax, similar to Agarwal et al. (2014), to which we refer for additional details. We
use the National Information Center (NIC) of the Federal Reserve System to retrieve information
about lead examiner institutions’ identity (e.g. FDIC, Fed, States, and OCC) and dates for each
lead lender in our sample. We employ the information at the level of the commercial bank. [NIC]
   Abnormal Snow is the rank-noramlized abnormal snow cover in a given borrower county-year
calculated for current year Q1 and Q4 relative to the average weather in the same county Q1 and
Q4 for the past 10 years similar to Brown, Gustafson, and Ivanov (forthcoming), to which we
refer for additional details. Specifically, we construct the measure using county-level data on daily
snow cover (in inches) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s
website, which reports daily snow cover (SNWD) for each weather station in the United States.
For each day and county, we first compute the median value of snow cover across weather stations
to mitigate the effect of weather in high elevation geographic areas. We then calculate the average
of daily snow cover in each county-quarter. We aggregate these values into a baseline average
of snow cover in the first and fourth calendar quarters for each county-year using data from the
previous 10 years. Abnormal Snow is defined as the rank-normalization of the difference between
the average daily snow cover during the first and fourth quarters in a given county-year minus the
county’s average daily snow cover in the first and fourth quarters during the previous ten years.
[NOAA]
