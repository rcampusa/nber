This paper studies the determinants of mismatch in educational attainment. Mismatch arises when
high ability individuals do not obtain a college degree and/or low ability individuals do. Using
data from the NLSY97 survey, the paper estimates a structural model of education choice that
matches the moments of mismatch, college attainment and labor market outcomes. The analysis
conditions on gender, race and socio-economic status. Ignoring the role of parents, mismatch is
explained by differences in tastes for education and the presence of occasionally binding
borrowing constraints. But parents matter. This channel operates through both the attitudes and
ability of offspring. Once these links between parents and children are taken into account, the
influence of borrowing constraints disappears. Mismatch reflects variations in tastes as well as
noise in test scores, the underlying measure of ability. The paper also presents a decomposition of
the college wage premium into the returns to schooling and the selection into higher education.
The analysis highlights the power of selection into higher education as an explanation of the
college wage premium by gender, race and socio-economic status.

          This paper studies the determinants of mismatch in educational attainment. Mismatch arises when high
      ability individuals do not obtain a college degree and/or low ability individuals do. Using data from the NLSY97
      survey, the paper estimates a structural model of education choice that matches the moments of mismatch,
      college attainment and labor market outcomes. The analysis conditions on gender, race and socio-economic
      status. Ignoring the role of parents, mismatch is explained by differences in tastes for education and the presence
      of occasionally binding borrowing constraints. But parents matter. This channel operates through both the
      attitudes and ability of offspring. Once these links between parents and children are taken into account, the
      influence of borrowing constraints disappears. Mismatch reflects variations in tastes as well as noise in test scores,
      the underlying measure of ability. The paper also presents a decomposition of the college wage premium into the
      returns to schooling and the selection into higher education. The analysis highlights the power of selection into
      higher education as an explanation of the college wage premium by gender, race and socio-economic status.

1       Introduction
This paper studies mismatch in the allocation of individuals to educational attainment. This is a topic of considerable
interest as it is central to the debate on both the efficiency and equity of the educational system. Mismatch is often
viewed as a signal of misallocation in the assignment of individuals to education outcomes.
    Mismatch in educational attainment can arise in essentially two forms. In the case of an under-match, a relatively
high ability individual does not go to college. Under-match is frequently associated with imperfect capital markets
so that high ability individuals with limited resources find a college education too expensive. Alternatively, it might
be that the individual is simply not motivated nor otherwise equipped for the rigors of college life. These competing
explanations are summarized as “money” or “grit”, though as we shall see, the non-financial factors that influence
the education choice may go well beyond determination alone.

1.        INTRODUCTION


      In the alternative case of over-match, a relatively low ability individual obtains a college degree. This is not the
consequence of capital market imperfections. But, as in the case of under-match, tastes might matter in the form of
motivation and grit strong enough to compel a low ability individual through college.
      This paper is about the magnitudes and determinants of mismatch. Bowen and Bok (1998) brought widespread
attention to the significance of mismatch. There are now numerous studies of mismatch using US data, many follow
the approach of Smith, Pender, and Howell (2013). Dillon and Smith (2013) study mismatch based on the National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth from 1997 (hereafter NLSY97). They find evidence of both under- and over-match.
Their analysis includes a measure of college quality so that mismatch also refers to the relationship between the
ability of a student and the quality of college the student attends.
      The approach and findings differ from the extant literature as it formulates a dynamic choice problem and uses
that structure to estimate key parameters.1 An outgrowth of the estimation is a determination of the sources of
mismatch. The estimation follows a simulated method of moments approach, where the mismatch rates are prominent
features of the data that we match.
      The estimation uses moments from the NLSY97. In addition to the measured under- and over-match rates, the
moments include the individual’s education choice as a function of their (ASVAB) test score as well as their labor
market outcomes, also as a function of their test score. The moments are calculated, and thus the estimation is
undertaken, for the whole sample as well as sub-groups distinguished by gender, race and socio-economic status
(SES).2
      This data set figures prominently in the literature on mismatch and more generally in the discussion of the effects
of borrowing constraints on educational attainment. As discussed in Belley and Lochner (2007a), capital market
imperfections appear more prominent in the NLSY97 data compared to the NLSY79 data, as studied by Cameron
and Heckman (2001) and Keane and Wolpin (2001). The paper returns to this debate both through an analysis
of the role of borrowing constraints and more generally by linking family resources and background to educational
attainment and mismatch.
      The model allows for three sources of mismatch. First, borrowing constraints can create under-match. Second,
variations across individuals in tastes for education can create both under- and over-match. Finally, the test score
observed in the data, as described below, may itself be a noisy measure of ability. In this case, mismatch is simply
measurement error.
      For the baseline model without explicit parental influence, there are two initial findings. First, there is evidence
of capital market frictions for the full sample as well as the groups distinguished by gender, race and SES. Second,
taste shocks (grit) are important source of mismatch, noisy test scores are not.
      The paper includes a section on robustness with respect to the measurement and model of ability. Following
Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua (2006), ability is allowed to have both cognitive and non-cognitive components. Each
influence the education decision and each are reflected in compensation. This extension brings additional moments,
reflecting the dependence of educational attainment and wages on two measures of ability into the analysis. There
is some evidence of capital market frictions and, once again, a prominent role for taste shocks. The latter point is
important since mismatch due to the exclusion of non-cognitive ability would be attributed to taste shocks in the
     1 Cooper   and Liu (2016) undertakes a similar exercise looking at college attainment across countries.
     2I   appreciate the suggestion of Dubravka Ritter of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia to include the SES breakdown.

baseline model.
    The baseline model also provides a decomposition of the college wage premium. The return to education is
estimated and the selection into college, determined by the choice problem of individual agents, is characterized.
    It is natural to study the influence of the families in generating these results. One might conjecture that the
estimated borrowing constraint provides a channel through which family resources influence education choice. But,
as emphasized in Cameron and Heckman (2001), family income may be highly correlated with other dimensions of
family life that impact educational decisions through tastes and/or ability rather than through the budget constraint.
    Accordingly, the analysis expands to allow either family income and/or mother’s education to influence the
education choice. The specification in which the mother’s education proxies for tastes fits the moments very closely.
A specification which links mother’s education to the child’s ability produces a close fit as well.
    As in Cameron and Heckman (2001), it seems that family influence through tastes and/or ability is
more powerful than simply shifting a budget constraint. In these model with an active role for parent’s
education, mismatch arises largely from taste shocks as there is no evidence of binding borrowing
constraints. For this specification, noise in the test score contributes as well to explain mismatch.



2     Evidence of MisMatch
This section presents the data and evidence of mismatch. The moments presented here are subsequently used in the
structural estimation.


2.1     Data
The data are drawn from the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97).3 The data include individuals
born between 1980 and 1984. At the time of first interview in 1997, respondents’ ages ranged from 12 to 18. The
respondents were 28 to 34 at the time of their round 16 interviews in 2013. Most respondents graduated high school
and made their college choice between 1999 and 2002.
    ASVAB is the measure of ability used in this study. Most NLSY97 respondents participated in the administration
of the computer-adaptive form of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (CAT-ASVAB) in 1997. The
ASVAB test has 12 components, a subset of which including mathematical knowledge (MK), arithmetic reasoning
(AR), word knowledge (WK), and paragraph comprehension (PC) is referred to as Armed Forces Qualification Test
(AFQT). It has been demonstrated in the literature that AFQT is a good measure of ability and is statistically
significant in predicting outcomes (see Cawley, Conneely, Heckman, and Vytlacil (1997) and Cawley, Heckman, and
Vytlacil (2001)). The analysis categorizes individuals according to their AFQT score quartiles.
    Educational attainment is dichotomous, indicating whether an individual has at least obtained a bachelor’s degree
or not in 2013, the latest round of interview. Individuals who have only obtained an Associate of Arts degrees are
not counted as having college attainment.
   3 Further details on the variables used in this study are presented in the appendix. For details on the data set, see https://www.

nlsinfo.org/content/cohorts/nlsy97. Education attainment and wages are taken from the 2013 wave and the ASVAB exam score is
reported in the 1999 wave.




                                                                 3
2. EVIDENCE OF MISMATCH


    Some of the analysis conditions on gender, race/ethnicity and SES status. The analysis focuses on two ethnic
groups: blacks and whites (defined as non-black and non-hispanic). The determination of high and low SES is based
on whether parent’s income was above or below the sample median.
    The following criteria were used to drop missing observations: negative test scores, negative wages, negative
education and negative parents income. The resulting sample size was 2882 in total.


2.2     Mismatch
Motivated by Smith, Pender, and Howell (2013), consider a logistic regression to characterize education choice at the
individual level:
                                                                       expα0 +α1 ai
                                                    P r(ei = 1) =                                                                       (1)
                                                                     1 + expα0 +α1 ai
where ai is the AFQT test score of individual i. Here ei = 0 signifies that an individual has no college degree and
ei = 1 signifies college attainment and beyond. As the analysis proceeds additional covariates will be added to this
basic regression.
    Measures of under- and over-match rates come from this regression. A household is under-matched if it does not
have a college degree but, through (1), the probability ei = 1 exceeds the 80th percentile of the predicted values of
individuals with college attainment. Likewise, a household is over-matched if it has attained a college degree but the
predicted probability that ei = 1 is less than the 20th percentile of those without a college degree. An attractive
feature of this measure is that at an efficient allocation, where there is a critical level of ability for college attainment,
there is neither over- nor under-match.4
    Clearly, the 20% and 80% percentiles are arbitrary, mismatch measures can be calculated with other cut-off values
as well. Despite this, these measures are informative. These same cut-offs are used in the structural estimation so
that actual and simulated data are treated in a similar way.
    Note that these measures are within a group: a low SES household is over-matched if he has a college degree but
has a sufficiently low probability of college attainment compared to other low SES households. Section 6.2 considers
other measures in which the over- and under-match rates are relative to the whole sample, not the group. Again,
this is not an issue for estimation, just for interpretation.


2.3     Moments
The set of data moments for the baseline models is presented in Table 1. The first row combines the sample and
subsequent rows break down by gender, race and SES status.
    The first column indicates the college attainment rate, ranging from 48% for female to 30% for low SES households.
The under- and over-match rates also vary substantially across the groups. The under-match rate is largest for the
high SES group, at 4.4%. For all groups, the under-match rate exceeds the over-match rate, particularly for females
and low SES households. This is an important feature of the data that the estimated model will have to match.
   4 In a previous version of this paper, the comparison was with all predicted values rather than the 80th percentile of those with college

attainment. With that approach, mismatch could arise in an efficient solution. See Cooper and Liu (2016) for further discussion of these
alternative measures.

            This table reports data moments from the NLSY97. “College” is the college attainment rate. The regression
            coefficients α0 and α1 are from (1). The predicted values from this regression are used to create the under-
            match and over-match rates. The regression coefficients ν1 and ν2 are from (2) and (3) and characterize the
            response of wages to test scores. The last column indicates sample size. Standard errors are provided below
            regression coefficients.


    The regression coefficients from (1), (α0 , α1 ), are included as moments. This provides an informative link between
the test score and the educational choice.
    A final piece of evidence used in the analysis is the dependence of compensation on the test score. This comes
from a regression of the log of the real hourly wage on the test score, with and without including an educational
attainment dummy as a covariate. Specifically, letting i be an individual, the coefficients, ν1 and ν2 on the test score
in Table 1 came from the following two regressions:


                                                    E[ωi |·] = ν01 + ν1 ∗ testi                                            (2)

and
                                             E[ωi |·] = ν02 + ν2 ∗ testi + ν3 ∗ edi .                                      (3)

This set of moments is important as it disciplines the noise of the test score in predicting ability.



3     Model
This section outlines the household choice model, drawing on Cooper and Liu (2016). The focus is on the education
choice and the influence of tastes, capital markets and information on that decision. The model is used as a basis
for estimation.
    The model is simplified to highlight the education decision. In particular, there is no uncertainty over income
or periods of unemployment. Further, the household does not have a complicated portfolio decision. As studied,
for example in Cooper and Zhu (2015), households who differ by educational attainment also differ in terms of
asset market participation, portfolio composition and portfolio adjustment patterns. While of interest, none of the


                                                                 5
3. MODEL


dimensions of household finance seemed crucial to the educational attainment decision.
    The households are of different “types”. The heterogeneity is along multiple dimensions including: (i) cognitive
ability, (ii) taste for education and (iii) initial wealth. These factors all contribute to the education decision.


3.1     LifeCycle
To study education choice and mismatch, consider a simple life-cycle model of the household. The model is complex
enough to capture the costs and benefits of the college choice, abstracting from other choices on the allocation of
time between study and work as well as the decision to complete college.
    The three phases of the lifecycle are illustrated in Figure 1. During the first T s periods of life, the individual
can attend school and/or work. The second and third phases, of length T e and T l , are both periods of work with
compensation reflecting two features: the education decision made in the first phase and the role of experience. The
role of experience interacts with the education decision. In this way, the education choice influences both the level
of lifetime compensation and its pattern over time. Let T = T s + T e + T l be the total lifetime of the household.

                                                          Figure 1: Phases of Lifecycle

                               This figure shows the household’s lifecycle.




3.2     Perfect Capital Markets
The household compares the utility flow from a college degree with the utility without college attainment. Initially
assume that the household is able to borrow and lend in perfectly competitive capital markets at an interest factor
of R. In this setting, the household ranks these options by comparing lifetime income, net of education costs. The
only complicating factor is the presence of taste shocks in this choice.
    For the analysis, let e ∈ {0, ē} denote the education choice. Further, let θ denote the ability of the individual.5
Throughout we assume that θ is known to the agent.
    The lifetime discounted present value of income for the individual is the sum of the discounted values from the
three periods:
                                                                             Y e (e, θ) Y l (e, θ)
                                               Y (e, θ) = Y s (e) +                    + T s +T e ,                                        (4)
                                                                               RT s     R
                                                                               Rx−1
for e ∈ {0, ē}. Throughout this discussion, define R̃x =                (1+R+R2 +...+Rx−1 )    where R is the real interest rate and x is
the length of the period of the flow that is being discounted.
    The income flow during the school phase is given by:

                                                                       ω1 (1 − e) − p(e)
                                                           Y s (e) =                     .                                                 (5)
                                                                              R̃T s
   5 At this point, θ is considered cognitive ability and thus reflected in the AFQT test. In section 7, we consider a model with non-cognitive

ability as well.




                                                                             6
3. MODEL


This expression allows both the income and the tuition paid in the education phase to depend on the choice of e.
   The return to education depends on the agent’s ability through labor earnings in the second and third phases of
the lifecycle. Specifically, a household of ability θ that chooses education e ∈ {0, ē} obtains labor income of ωj H(e, θ)
for j = 1 (early work) and j = 2 (late work). H(e, θ) will be specified to create a complementarity between ability
and education.
   The discounted present value of income over the early work phase of life is:

                                                                         ω1 H(e, θ)
                                                     Y e (e, θ) =                                                      (6)
                                                                            R̃T e
                          e
for e ∈ {0, ē} where R̃T discounts the flow of income during the middle phase back to the start of the early work
period. Similarly, the discounted present value of income over the late work phase of life is:

                                                                      ω2 H(e, θ)
                                                     Y l (e, θ) =                                                      (7)
                                                                         R̃T l
                              l
for e ∈ {0, ē} where R̃T discounts the flow of income during the final phase back to the start of the late work
period. Both of these flows depend on ability, θ, only if the agent attends college. Assume ω2 ≥ ω1 to allow for some
experience effect on wages which, as noted above, interacts with education and ability.


3.2.1   No College

If the agent does not go to school, the discounted present value of net income during the school years is given by:

                                                                               ω1
                                                          Y s (0, θ) =              .                                  (8)
                                                                              R̃T s

In this case there is no tuition charge and the individual works full time, earning a base wage of ω1 . Note that the
agent’s ability θ does not factor into earnings during this period.
   Further,



                                                   ω1                                          ω2
                                   Y e (0, θ) =                and             Y l (0, θ) =         .                  (9)
                                                  R̃T e                                       R̃T l

Substituting these flows into (4) yields the discounted present value of income for the no college choice.
   The household chooses consumption in each period of life, ct , to maximize the discounted present value of lifetime
utility subject to (4).

                                                                         X
                                                  V n = maxc(t)                β t u(c(t))                            (10)
                                                                          t

subject to:
                                                          X c(t)
                                                                     ≤ Y (0, θ).                                      (11)
                                                           t   R̃t

where β is the household’s discount rate and u(·) is strictly increasing and strictly concave. Assume Rβ = 1 so that


                                                                     7
3. MODEL


the household has an incentive to completely smooth consumption.
   Let V n denote the solution of (10). To be clear, this value is independent of the ability of the agent.


3.2.2      College

If the agent goes to school, then the discounted present value of net income for the school phase becomes:

                                                                         ω1 (1 − ē) − p
                                                         Y s (ē, θ) =                                               (12)
                                                                              R̃T s

with p = p(ē). Here the agent works (1 − ē) units of time when not in school and pays tuition p. Again, ability does
not enter into income during the education phase. Instead, ability is reflected in the return to education.
   The incomes during the two working phases are given by:

                                                  ω1 H(ē, θ)                                 ω2 H(ē, θ)
                                  Y e (ē, θ) =                    and        Y l (ē, θ) =               .          (13)
                                                     R̃T e                                       R̃T l

Substituting these flows into (4) yields the discounted present value of lifetime income if college is chosen.
   Let Ṽ c (θ) denote the value, dependent on ability, obtained by maximizing lifetime utility subject to a lifetime
budget constraint given by Y (ē, θ) from (4). The value of college is also influenced by a taste shock, denoted by ε.
The taste shocks can reflect differences in parental attitudes about education and/or peer group pressure. They can
also reflect determination and grit at the individual level.
   The value of college, inclusive of these taste shocks, is given by


                                                           V c (θ, ε) = Ṽ c (θ) + ε.                                (14)


3.2.3      Optimal Choice

As there are no capital market imperfections, then the household choice of education is simply a comparison of V n
and V c (θ, ε). Since lifetime income is an increasing function of ability, there will exist a critical value of ability,
denoted θ∗ (ε) such that V n = V c (θ∗ , ε). For this ability and above, college is the optimal choice of the household.
   It is certainly possible for a high (low) ability agent to choose no college (college) because of a low (high) draw
of the taste shock. Since, for example, the empirical model in (1) includes only a test score, taste shocks would be a
source of measured mismatch.


3.3       Borrowing Constraints
As noted above, there is considerable evidence suggestive of capital market frictions impacting the education choice.
This motivates the inclusion of borrowing constraints in the analysis.
   The borrowing constraint limits the amount of debt an agent can accumulate to finance education expenses during
the schooling phase.6 Though this constraint does not arise directly from an incentive compatibility condition, the
borrowing limit is estimated so that the frequency the constraint binds is a result rather than an assumption.
  6 For   the other phases of the lifecycle, the household is able to perfectly smooth consumption.




                                                                         8
3. MODEL


      Suppose an agent enters the early work period with B of debt outstanding. The value of income over the early
and late working years discounted back to the start of the early work period is given by

                                                                                      Y l (ē, θ)
                                                    Y el (ē, θ, B) = Y e (ē, θ) +               −B                                      (15)
                                                                                        RT e
with Y e (ē, θ) and Y l (ē, θ) defined above. Since there are no further borrowing constraints, the household will smooth
consumption over the early and late working periods given this level of income.
      Given the absence of borrowing constraints after the first phase, the household will smooth consumption over the
last two phases of life generating a flow of utility captured by the value V el (e, θ, B) given by

                                                                                           (T e +T l )
                                                    V el (e, θ, B) = u(cel (e, θ, B))β̃                                                   (16)

          cel (e,θ,B)
where                   = Y el (e, θ, B).7
             R̃T el
      During the school years, suppose the household is unconstrained and has no outside wealth. The household will
borrow b each period and consumes cs = ω(1 − ē) − pē + b. At the end of the school period, their debt outstanding
                                      s
                                          −1
is B = b(1 + R + R2 + ...RT                    ).
      Let B̄ be a ceiling on debt outstanding at the end of the school period. When the constraint binds, i.e. B > B̄,
the household will continue to smooth consumption during the school phase but it is not able to smooth consumption
between the school and working phases. Thus household consumption during each period of the school phase is given
by

                                                      cs (ē, θ, B̄)   ω1 (1 − ē)
                                                                     =             − pē + B̄.                                            (17)
                                                          R̃T s           R̃T s
      Using (16) as well as the consumption level given by (17), a household that chooses to go to college with a binding
                                                                         Ts                              s
borrowing constraint has lifetime utility of V c (θ, B̄) = β̃                 u(cs (ē, θ, B̄)) + β T V el (e, θ, B). The household will choose
to go to college iff V c (θ, B̄) + ε ≥ V n . Clearly if the borrowing constraint binds the value of obtaining a college
degree is lower.
      The analysis ignores outside wealth of the agent. Yet for many students transfers from family members relax
borrowing constraints. This can be included in the analysis as an additional source of wealth, denoted Z, in (17).8
This transfer from parents could be individual specific, depending on a number of factors such as: (i) parental wealth,
(ii) ability of their child and (iii) tastes for higher education.9 Clearly a large enough Z offsets the effects of a binding
borrowing constraint. This will be discussed further in the context of the estimation of a model that includes parental
income and/or wealth.
      The borrowing constraint can lead to an under-match. Some high ability individuals will choose not to attend
college simply because the borrowing constraint limits their ability to smooth consumption and thus reduces the
value of education. This will be more costly for small B̄ and this will be part of the estimation.
     7 Here,     el        T e +T l
            R̃T and β̃        are defined following the notation previously developed.
     8 The constraint becomes

                                                                  =             − pē + B̄ + Z.

4. ESTIMATION


4      Estimation
This section outlines the estimation approach and the functional forms. It provides a bridge from the theory model
to the results presented in the next section.


4.1        Functional Forms and Calibration
As in Cooper and Liu (2016), there are some functional form assumptions used in the empirical analysis. The ability
distribution is assumed to be Pareto with a parameter of φ.10 Taste shocks are assumed to be uniformly distributed
around zero, i.e. ε ∈ [−ε̄, ε̄]. The parameters (φ, ε̄) are estimated. Period utility is represented by u(c) = ln(c). The
                          1
discount factor is β =    R   with R = 1.025.11 Section 5.3 relaxes some of these assumptions and studies robustness of
our findings.
    The analysis uses the ASVAB test score in the estimation of (1) from data. In the model, a test score is simulated
from the agents’ ability according to:


                                                            tsi = θi + σζi .                                                        (18)

Here ζi is noise in the mapping between ability and the test score of agent i.12 The parameter σ controls the amount
of noise and is estimated. The rank of an agent’s test score, based upon tsi , is used in the structural estimation,
parallel to the data analysis.
    This noise becomes another source of mismatch. But unlike a binding borrowing constraint or a taste shock, this
mismatch reflects an underlying measurement problem. In the Cooper and Liu (2016) cross-country study, this was
the major source of (measured) mismatch.
    The human capital accumulation equation is given by H(ē, θ) = h(ē)θ and H(0, θ) = 1 for all θ. The return
to education, h(ē), is estimated by gender, race and SES. Note that this specification assumes a complementarity
between ability and education as the difference H(ē, θ) − H(0, θ) is increasing in θ. This is common in the literature
though there are some notable exceptions, such as Fang (2006).
    There are a number of variables calibrated for the analysis. From Table B1 in Johnson (2013), the cost of going
                                                                     p
to school, relative to labor income in the school phase, is          ω1   = 0.25. From the labor market outcomes reported in
Table 2 of Johnson (2013), the time spent in school is given by ē = 0.5. The total cost of going to college is 0.75 ∗ ω1 .
The robustness section considers other values for these costs. Both tuition and the opportunity cost of education are
assumed constant across groups.
    The wage rate in the initial period is normalized: ω1 = 1. The wage rate for the late work period, ω2 , is set
at 1.148. This is taken from estimates of the wage profile for the US in Hanushek, Schwerdt, Wiederhold, and
Woessmann (2015).13
                                                                               φ
  10 Specifically,the CDF of ability, θ, is given by 1 − θ−φ with a mean of φ−1  .
  11 The curvature of utility and discount factor surely matters for the education choice. But absent data on intertemporal consumption
patterns, estimation of these parameters seemed beyond the scope of the analysis. See Cooper and Zhu (2015) for estimation of these
parameters given educational attainment.
  12 The noise is drawn from a standard normal distribution.
  13 As a cross-check, lifecycle income profiles were estimated by education group for the PSID and the return for the two age groups was

calculated from those estimates. Thanks to Guozhong Zhu for this evidence.




                                                                   10
5. RESULTS


    For the estimation, these wage levels do not vary by gender, race and SES. Instead, the parameters, particularly
h(ē), are estimated by gender, race and SES to match the moments for each group. Thus underlying differences in
return to education which might appear as wage differences are absorbed by the group specific estimates of h(ē). As
developed below, the selection into education induces differences across groups in the college wage premium despite

4.2     Approach
The estimation is through simulated method of moments. The parameter vector Θ = (φ, ε̄, σ, h(ē), b̄) is chosen to
minimize the distance between simulated and data moments. Formally, the estimation solves

                                                                                           0
                                                   (M d − M s (Θ)) (M d − M s (Θ))
                                            minΘ                  W                ,                                                (19)

where W is the identity matrix. Here M d are data moments and M s (Θ) are moments calculated from simulated
data. The procedure solves the household choice problem given the parameter vector Θ. Given these choices, a large
data set (100,000 individuals) is simulated. The moments in M s (Θ) are calculated, with one exception, from the
simulated data in exactly the same manner as the data moments.14
    The distance metric is the percentage difference between simulated and data moments. There is no weighting
matrix used in the analysis.15 Adda and Cooper (2003), and references therein, discusses this estimation approach.
    The moments used for the estimation are given in Table 1. These are: the college attainment rate, the logistic
regression coefficients characterizing individual educational attainment, the under- and over-match rates and the
coefficients from the regressions of (log) wages on test scores. These moments and thus the parameter estimates are
studied for the entire sample as well as by gender, race and SES.



5     Results
This section reports initial findings in which there are three potential sources of mismatch: (i) borrowing constraints,
(ii) taste (grit) shocks and (iii) mismeasurement due to noisy test scores. The inference is based upon the initial
model in which family characteristics and income are absent.


5.1     Estimates and Moments: Baseline Model
This section establishes the baseline results. The parameter estimates are reported in Table 2 and the moments in
Table 3. The rows correspond to a particular group in the sample. There are two blocks in each table, indicating
if there is no borrowing constraint imposed (“No BC”) or if a borrowing constraint is estimated, (“BC Baseline”).
The “fit” measure is the sum of the percentage differences between the simulated and data moments, as in (19).
  14 The exception has to do with the treatment of the test score. In the NLSY97 data, the normalized rank of the test score is reported,

where the normalized score is over the entire sample. For computational ease, the ranking is within group in the simulated data. Using
simulated data from the baseline model, the overall rank was calculated and the correlation of the within rank and overall rank was 0.98.
The estimation matches a moment based upon this rank.
  15 Section 5.3 presents the estimation using an alternative objective function.

                  This table reports parameter estimates for the baseline model without and with borrowing
                  constraints.


   This section discusses main findings common to all groups. Section 5.2 is devoted to evaluating differences across
groups.


5.1.1     Borrowing Constraint

The first finding is evident from the fit measure reported in Table 3. Specifically, comparing the last columns of
Table 3 for the cases of borrowing constraints and no borrowing constraints reveals an important result: the model
is able to better match the moments with an occasionally binding borrowing constraint.
   To be clear, this case estimates b̄, the per period borrowing limit during the school phase as a fraction of ω1 .
Thus the estimation nests the case in which there are no binding borrowing constraints.
   The case with borrowing constraints improves the fit of the model for all agents and for each group. The
fit improves from 1.192 in the pooled sample to 0.889. As noted earlier, a binding borrowing constraint creates
asymmetric mismatch by increasing under-match relative to over-match. This is clear in the results.
   Note though that the over-match rate exceeds the under-match rate, even in the baseline model. Thus it seems that
the inclusion of borrowing constraints is not enough to produce the observed asymmetry in mismatch rates. However,
as discussed in sub-section 6.2, the asymmetries are very apparent in a slightly different measure of mismatch.
   To be clear, the presence of a borrowing constraint does not mean it binds for all households. For this discussion,
a binding borrowing constraint means that the household education choice switched to no education because of the
borrowing constraint.
   By this definition, the constraint is likely to bind for households with ability high enough to rationalize college
with perfect capital markets but for whom the borrowing constraint makes education too costly. Also, it can bind
for relatively low ability households who draw a high taste shock. These households may choose college and use
earnings over the middle and late period to support consumption during the education phase. But the borrowing

constraint implies that the gains from education, which are not that large due to their relatively low ability, are not
enough to compensate for the unequal consumption.
   Table 4 studies the determinants of a binding borrowing constraint. The table contains coefficient estimates for
the covariates listed in the columns where the dependent variable was whether the borrowing constraint was binding
or not. For all the groups, an increase in the taste for education reduces the likelihood of the constraint binding.
Logically, for those with high tastes, the desire for more education overcomes the cost of not being able to smooth
consumption.
   The coefficients on ability are all negative. As discussed Lochner and Monge-Naranjo (2011), in the presence
of a borrowing constraint, the influence of ability on education attainment is influenced by two forces. First, high
ability agents have higher future earnings and thus want to obtain more education even if their borrowing is limited.
This would imply that the coefficient on ability in Table 4 would be negative. Second, high ability agents want to
borrow more and the binding constraint effectively reduces the return to education and thus can generate a positive
coefficient on ability. For our estimated model, the first effect dominates.
   Table 5 explores the impact of the borrowing constraint on college choice. From this table, for all households,
at the estimated parameters, the education rate without the borrowing constraint would be 33.0% while the college

rate falls to 25.3% once the constraint is imposed.16
    Overall, the borrowing constraints reduce the college attendance rates by almost 8 percentage points. Along the
same lines, Carneiro and Heckman (2002) conclude “at most 8% of American youth are subject to short term liquidity
constraints that affect their post-secondary schooling.” For black households, the borrowing constraint reduces the
college rate from 36.4% to 29.3%. The effect is largest for whites as the college rate drops 16.4 percentage points.
    The borrowing constraint influences educational outcomes in two ways. First it impacts the choice of agents over
education. This directly influences educational attainment. Second, it creates mismatch in so far as high ability
agents face binding constraints. The fact that the coefficient on ability is negative in Table 4 implies that this
selection aspect is not that powerful.


5.1.2    Role of Taste Shocks

A second main finding regards the role of taste shocks. From Table 2, the range of these shocks is substantial. In
comparison, there is no evidence of noise in the test score.
    This claim is further substantiated by the panels of Tables 6 and 7 in which the tastes shocks are eliminated
(“ε̄ == 000 ) and when there is no noise in the test score (“σ == 0”). For these exercises, the models are re-estimated
after setting one of the parameters to zero.
    As is clear from these tables, the fit is substantially worse than the baseline when the taste shocks are eliminated.
Of course, the estimated model “substitutes” for the taste shocks by adding noise to the test score, as indicated by
the estimates of σ in the top panel of Tables 6. The inclusion of the test score coefficient in the wage regression limits
the amount of noise in the test score that can be added. The fit is not as good in part from the model’s inability to
match the mismatch, particularly the under-match, in the data.
    But, from Table 7 eliminating the noise in the test score does essentially nothing to the fit of the model. The
estimated σ is indeed very close to zero.
    From the estimation, the mismatch comes from taste shocks. Noise in the test scores is almost irrelevant. Though
the taste shock is, by construction, distributed symmetrically around zero, it generates more under-match compared
to over-match. The non-linearity is, in part, arising from the logistic function. As noted earlier, mismatch is largest
for black households and one source is the larger dispersion of tastes.


5.1.3    Identification of Key Parameters

The previous discussion highlights the estimates of the taste shocks and test score noise and the implications of the
borrowing constraints. Here we focus on the estimates of ability and the return to education.
    To evaluate the estimated parameters and how well the moments are matched, it is useful to characterize the
mapping from parameters to moments. Table 8 reports the elasticities of the moments with respect to the param-
eters. These are computed at the baseline estimates for the pooled sample with an occasionally binding borrowing
constraint.17
  16 To be clear, this exercise computes the fraction attaining college with and without the borrowing constraint at the estimated

parameters for the baseline borrowing constraint model.
  17 At the baseline, each of the parameters is varied, the model is resolved and the moments are recomputed. In doing so, the 20th and

80th percentiles of the distribution of predicted educational attainment changes since the logistic regression coefficients from (1) adjust.
Thus the under-match and over-match rates adjust both because decisions change and because the cut-offs change.

                  This table reports parameter estimates for the no taste shocks and the no test noise cases.


   The first row shows how the simulated moments respond to variations in the parameter of the ability distribution,
φ. An increase in φ reduces the mean of the ability distribution and thus reduces the college rate. At this lower
college attainment rate there is more under-match and more over-match. Changes in the distribution of ability also
reduce the response of the education decision and wages to the test score. When φ increases, evidently the test score
becomes less informative about ability.
   The return to education, h(ē), not surprisingly, impacts the college attainment rate. As the college rate increases,
both the under-match and the over-match rates rise. The regression coefficients are also sensitive to the return to
education: (i) the test score is less important in the logistic regression and (ii) wages become more responsive to the
test score.
   The channels through which these parameters operate are complex. This is particularly the case for the under-
match and over-match moments since changes in parameters impact the entire distribution of predicted probabilities
of college, not just the position of a single agent. What should be clear from the table is that, with the exception of
the noise in the test score, locally the variation in parameters has a relatively large influence on the moments.


5.2     Across Groups
This discussion focuses on differences across groups, both in terms of moments and parameters. It presents a
counterfactual exercise where groups are forced to have some common parameters.


5.2.1   Moments and Parameters

One striking feature of the data is the relative variations in moments across groups. The college rate as well as the
mismatch rates vary widely: the college rate for the high SES groups is about 20 percentage points above the low
SES group. The under-match rates for females are about twice that of males and the over-match rates are more

than three times larger for the high SES group compared to males. Yet, the variation in the response of wages to
test scores is much smaller across these groups.
   While the estimated model does generate some dispersion in college rates by gender and race, the differences are
not nearly as large as in the data. These differences in college rates reflect group specific estimates of the ability
distribution and the returns to education. But often these pull in different directions since these same parameters
influence the returns to education, (ν1 , ν2 ). For example, the high college rate for females follows from a relatively
high estimate of h(ē) and relatively low estimate of φ. Likewise, whites have the highest estimated values of φ and
h(ē), one of the lowest predicted college rates and a low estimated return to education captured by (ν1 , ν2 ). In this
case, the effect of the high φ dominates. For blacks, the estimated return to education, h(ē), is lower than for other
groups, offsetting the low estimate of φ and thus contributing to the lower college rate and high estimated return to
education.


5.2.2   Counterfactuals

This exercise studies, through counterfactuals, which of the differences in parameters across the groups is more
important for the observed patterns in moments. To do so, one of the parameters for each group is replaced by the
estimates from the “all” case. The remaining parameters are kept at their estimated values from the baseline model
with borrowing constraints, as indicated in Table 2. This exercise gauges the importance of each of the “behavioral”

parameters individually to understand which are responsible for the observed differences in mismatch.
   The results are displayed in Table 22, in the appendix. For all groups, the differences in φ are important.
As indicated in the ‘Same Ability’ block, when all groups are forced to have the same ability parameter the fit
deteriorates, particularly for whites. But these changes in moments and thus fit are not large compared to other
parameter variations.
   Imposing the same tastes has a very large impact on both whites and blacks. Making the taste distribution the
same, reduces the range for blacks and increases it for whites. The black college rate falls and it rises for the whites
relative to the baseline. This change in parameterization leads to a substantial increase in mismatch for the white
and almost eliminates mismatch for blacks.
   Imposing the same return from college leads to relatively large changes in the fit except for the low SES group.
The college rate rises considerably for blacks, as does the over-match rate, when the return to education is higher.
In contrast, the white college rate falls with a lower return and there is almost no mismatch.
   Finally, imposing the same borrowing limit has a considerable impact on females and blacks. The college rate
rises for females and falls slightly for blacks, for whom the over-match rate nearly doubles.
   From the perspective of mismatch, the key to understanding the differences across groups stems largely from
differences in tastes and the returns to education. Relative to the baseline estimates, reducing the dispersion in
tastes, as in the case of blacks, leads to a reduction in mismatch. Increasing the dispersion of tastes, as in whites,
implies large increases in mismatch. The differences in returns to education are also very important for mismatch,
as indicated for both blacks and whites.


5.3     Robustness
This subsection studies the robustness of these findings. It considers variations in the calibrated parameters and the
use of a weighting matrix. Results are shown for the baseline model with borrowing constraints.


5.3.1   Calibrated Parameters

The baseline model assumed log utility and imposed a college cost of 25% of the compensation received by young
                                                                               c1−γ
workers. Instead, consider a CRRA representation of utility, u(c) =            1−γ ,   with the parameter γ = 2, as in Johnson
(2013). Further, consider a higher cost of education, increasing the price by 20%. For both of these exercises, the
model is re-estimated. The results are reported in Tables 23 and 24, found in the Appendix. There are two key



                                                                18

findings.
    First, as with the baseline parameters, noise in the test score plays essentially no role. That is, the estimated
value of σ is near zero for all the cases. Instead, mismatch comes from either the taste shock or, in some cases,
occasionally binding borrowing constraints. Second, the models with borrowing constraints fit better than those
with perfect capital markets.18


5.3.2    Weighting Matrix

The last experiment replaces (19) with a weighting matrix equal to the inverse of a matrix with the variances of the
moments along the diagonal. This objective is given in (20).


                                             minΘ (M d − M s (Θ))W (M d − M s (Θ))0 .                                               (20)

    This weighting matrix puts considerably more weight on matching the coefficients from the wage regression. As
indicated in the tables in the Appendix, the same patterns in estimates and moments remain. The noise in the test
score remains small. Second, there is again an improvement in fit once the borrowing constraint is introduced.



6       Implications
This section uses the baseline model to discuss two implications. The first is a decomposition of the college wage
premium. The second is an expanded discussion of mismatch using a measure that is common across groups.


6.1     Decomposing the College Premium
This section studies the implications of the model for the college wage premium. The difference in returns to college
matters for the education choice and hence for mismatch. Here, the analysis decomposes the premium, by race and

    To study the premium in detail return to the wage regression, given in (3):


                                               E[ωi |·] = ν02 + ν2 ∗ testi + ν3 ∗ edi .                                             (21)

In this regression, edi , was a dummy variable for person i denoting college completion or not. Hence this coefficient,
from the regressions conditional on race and gender, provides one estimate of the college premium.19 In contrast
to the baseline model, this coefficient on education, denoted ν3 , is included in the set of moments matched in the
estimation.
    The estimates from the extended model along with the baseline estimates are given in Table 9. The moments are
reported in Table 10. In this second table, the counterfactuals of “Same Ability” and “Same Return” are simulations
using the estimates from the “all” case to substitute for the gender/race specific estimates.
  18 To reduce the proliferation of tables, the estimates without borrowing constraints are not shown. In fact, the fit of the model with

γ = 2 is better than the baseline for some groups. As noted earlier, independently estimating with curvature of the utility function
without consumption data seems problematic.
  19 Of course this estimate is from a reduced form relationship with all the usual concerns of omitted variable bias.

                     This table reports parameter estimates for the model with education as a covariate (ν3 ) in
                     the wage regression included in the moments.


   Focus first on the ν3 coefficient in the “Data” block of Table 10 as it is informative about the college premium
by group. This coefficient is positive for all groups and largest for the black and female groups. From the NCES
data, the 2012 premia follow a similar pattern: the premium is larger for blacks than whites and larger for females
compared to males.20
   Including this moment generates the parameter estimates in Table 9. Qualitatively the parameter estimates are
quite similar to the baseline estimates. The φ is lowest for blacks and that group has high taste variability, and a low
return to college. As in the baseline with ν3 == 0, this group also has the tightest borrowing constraint. Whites, in
contrast, have the lowest mean ability, the smallest taste shock and the highest return to school.
   The fit of the expanded model is not much worse than the baseline with ν3 == 0. The ν3 estimates from the
simulated data are relatively large (compared to the return to the test score), though not as large as in the data.
Overall, the model does capture the joint returns to the test score and education.
   Generally, the measured average college premium reflects two forces: (i) the physical return to schooling, h(ē)
and (ii) the selection of college attainment by ability. In principal, the relative magnitude of these factor may
differ across gender and race. From the model, in the late working period the college wage premium is given by
E ω2 h(e)θ
     ω2    = h(ē)E(θ|e = ē).
   Using this expression, Table 11 shows decompositions of the college premium by gender and race. These are

            This table reports data and simulated moments for the estimated model adding the education coefficient in
            the log wage regression as a moment, denoted ν3 . The counterfactuals are simulated, not re-estimated.


calculated from simulated data based upon the estimated model with ν3 included in the moments. This analysis
uses, for the two counterfactual exercises, either the same value of φ or h(ē) imposed as the “Same Ability” or “Same
Return” cases respectively.
   There are a couple of key points from this table. First the college wage premium is largest for blacks and smallest
for whites. Second, the estimated return to education is nearly the opposite: relatively low for blacks and the highest
for whites. This difference is reconciled by selection. The mean of ability for college education relative to no college is
about 8.1 for blacks and only about 2.1 for whites. The low SES group has a strong selection effect as well compared
to the high SES.
   The two counterfactuals shown in Table 11 make clear how the college premium and the selection depends on
differences in ability and return. The moments from these counterfactuals are shown in Table 10. These models do
not fit as well as the baseline, with the imposition of the same returns generating the largest deterioration.
   Imposing the same ability eliminates the wage premium for blacks, though the selection effect remains strong.

                   The college premium is the ratio of earnings in the late work phase for agents with college and
                   without and h(ē) is the estimated return to college independent of ability. These calculations
                   are from the estimated model with borrowing constraints, adding ν3 as a parameter.


The premium for whites more than doubles and the selection effect is stronger.
   Imposing the same return provides another perspective on the decomposition of the wage premium. In this case,
the selection effect is stronger for blacks and whites to compensate for the reduced return to college. The premia are
close to the baseline estimates.


6.2    Other Measures of MisMatch
As explained earlier, the measure of mismatch is group specific. Under-match, for example, represents individuals
without a college education whose predicted probability of education exceeds the 80th percentile of the predicted
values of individuals with college attainment within the individual’s own group. Under- and over-match are defined
in the same way in the simulated data to match moments. So this is not an issue for the estimation per se.
   But, for interpretation it is also useful to look at the calculation of mismatch relative to the whole population.
So, for example, the under-match rate for males would be calculated using the 80th percentile of the predicted values
of individuals with college attainment for all groups, i.e. using a common threshold.
   The baseline and this alternative measure of mismatch are shown in Table 12. There are some interesting
differences across these measures. The starkest are the large increases in the under-match rates for the female and
black groups. The under-match rate is about 10 times larger for females and 5 times larger for blacks with this new
measure. Further, the asymmetry is apparent for these groups.


                                                                 22
7. NON-COGNITIVE ABILITY


    These groups are under-matched relative to the whole population but not relative to their own group. That is,
there are females or blacks with relatively high test scores who do not go to college. Relative to those within their
own group, these scores and thus the predicted probability of college attendance is not that high. But relative to
the whole population, these scores are high and thus these agents are under-matched. Note that for the baseline
estimates, blacks and females had the lowest estimate of φ and thus the highest estimated mean ability.

              from the “all” estimation treatment rather than group specific.




7      Non-Cognitive Ability
The analysis thus far has ignored non-cognitive ability. This omitted factor may be important for our analysis of mismatch.21
An individual with a high cognitive test score who does not attend college would be classified as under-matched. Because
education choices depends on non-cognitive ability as well, if this individual had low non-cognitive ability, then the decision
not to attain a college degree may not reflect mismatch.22
    This robustness exercise introduces non-cognitive ability into the baseline model, retaining much of that structure. In
particular, the agent chooses education attainment given random draws of cognitive and non-cognitive ability. As in Heckman,
Stixrud, and Urzua (2006), these draws are assumed to be independent. These components of ability combine to create an
aggregated measure of ability, treated as θ in the above choice model. For this exercise, θ is assumed to be a constant returns
to scale Cobb-Douglas function of cognitive and non-cognitive ability, with the coefficient estimated.
    The perceived compensation from education remains θh(ē). Through the construction of θ, compensation depends on both
components of ability and thus both contribute to the education decision.
    The set of moments is altered to include a measure of non-cognitive ability.23 First, the same logistic regression to predict
education in the baseline model, (1), was supplemented with non-cognitive ability. Second, modify both (2) and (3) to include
non-cognitive ability as a regressor. As noted below, for some of these regressions the measure of non-cognitive ability was
not statistically significant.24
    The construct of non-cognitive ability is the Rosenberg measure, taken from NLSY79.25 This is one of the measures
discussed in Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua (2006). It is a measure of self-esteem. The other measure used in Heckman,
Stixrud, and Urzua (2006), the Rotter scale, was not significant for predicting wages and so was not used.
  21 This extension was suggested by James Heckman.
  22 See Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua (2006) for evidence linking non-cognitive ability and college attainment.
  23 For this exercise, the low and high SES group is omitted due to data limitations.
  24 For the block of moments labeled “Non-Cog”, the stars indicate coefficient that are significantly different from zero at a 5% significance

level.
  25 There is no comparable measure in NLSY97.

8. ROLE OF PARENTS


    Table 13 has the parameter estimates and Table 14 reports moments. As indicated by the blocks of these tables, there
are three cases. The first, termed “baseline”, uses the baseline moments from the NLSY97 baseline. As this case excludes the
non-cognitive measures, this facilitates a comparison of estimates across data sets using comparable moments. The second,
“non-cog wages” allows the measure of non-cognitive ability to influence wages but not the education decision. The third case,
labeled “non-cog”, allows non-cognitive ability to impact both wages and the education decision.
    The parameters include the coefficient on cognitive ability, denoted α in the Cobb-Douglas technology that combines
the two forms of ability to create θ. Second, the noise, σ, is in the non-cognitive ability measure for the second and third
treatments and remains a measure of noise in the cognitive score for the baseline treatment.26
    Looking first at the baseline, from Table 14, there are some interesting differences in moments across the two samples.
The education rates are much closer together in the NLSY79 sample, except for blacks whose college attainment rate is much
lower in the earlier sample. The mismatch rates are lower in the NLSY79 sample. Further, under-match rates are less than
the over-match rates except for males.
    The model fit improves with the presence of borrowing constraints. So, in contrast to previous studies which found no
evidence of borrowing constraint in the NLSY79 sample, these constraints improve the fit. The average return to education,
h(ē) remains highest for whites and lowest for blacks. The estimated parameters for the Pareto distribution of ability are
much less dispersed, with the highest value for whites. The estimated borrowing limits are all close to zero. The fit is better
with these tight constraints. There is essentially no noise in the test score except for the black group.
    For the “non-cog wages” case, looking at Table 15, the wages regressions indicate the effects of non-cognitive skills through
the regression coefficients (ν1nc , ν2nc ). These more important for females rather than males and blacks more than whites.
    For this case, the model with borrowing constraints improves the fit slightly. From the parameter estimates, the model
puts nearly 90% of the weight, through α, on cognitive ability. Thus the influence of non-cognitive ability on wages is not
very strong.
    For the “non-cog” case, the effects of non-cognitive ability on the education choice and wages are reported in Table 15.
The significant coefficients (at the 5% level) on non-cognitive ability are marked with a“*”. These coefficients are significant
and positive for the pooled, female and white groups, not for males and blacks.
    For this case, again the borrowing constraints matter and improve the fit. From the parameter estimates, noise in the test
score is not important and tastes matter. As before the point estimate of α is above 0.5 for all groups, but is only 0.66 for
females and 0.738 for whites, allowing non-cognitive ability to matter in the overall ability measure.
    Overall, a couple of key results remain with this extension of the model. First, the model with borrowing constraints does
fit the data moments slightly better. Second, the main source of mismatch is taste shocks, not noise in the test score. This is
true for the baseline as well as the other cases. However, there is considerable noise in the non-cognitive test score for females
and whites.



8     Role of Parents
Thus far the analysis reaches an important conclusion. Borrowing constraints and taste differences matter for the
education decision and generate mismatch.
    But it has ignored the role of parents. Disentangling the influence of parents from borrowing constraints is an
important check on our finding of the contribution of capital market imperfections to mismatch.
  26 Based on the earlier results of no noise in the cognitive measure, confirmed here as well for the NLSY79 baseline, we focus on noise

in the non-cognitive test.

8. ROLE OF PARENTS


   The split between low and high SES groups is indicative. From the baseline moments, the education rate is about
20 percentage points lower and mismatch is also lower for the low SES group. But, the finding in the baseline model
that borrowing constraints even improve the fit for the high SES group suggests that perhaps these constraints are
not just reflecting capital market imperfections. As we shall see, parents’ influence extends well beyond the relaxation
of a borrowing constraint.
   Accordingly, this section studies the influence of parents on education choice and thus mismatch. It returns to the
motivation of distinguishing between the transfer of resources and of direct influence of parents on children through
tastes and/or ability: i.e. is it “money or grit?”. Here, again, the term “grit” aptly captures non-cognitive influences
of parents on the work habits, determination and even role models.
   The literature identifies two main channels linking educational attainment with parent’s characteristics: (i) the
provision of resources and (ii) the creation of environments for the accumulation of human capital (both cognitive
and non-cognitive skills).27 There is a large extant literature on the relative importance of these links between
parents and education attainment. Looking at the NLSY79 sample, Cameron and Heckman (2001), and Carneiro
and Heckman (2002) argue that the second channel is the main way in which parents influence the education outcome
of their children.
   Belley and Lochner (2007a), comparing the NLSY79 and NLSY97 samples, argue that the role of family income
has increased over time, partly due to increased tuition between the samples. From their Table 3, both family income
and family characteristics, such as the parent’s educational attainment, are significant in explaining education for
the NLSY97 sample. In fact, the coefficient in the reduced form regression on family income is considerable higher
in the NLSY97 sample compared to the NLSY79 sample.
   The paper addresses these issues in a couple of ways. First, in sub-section 8.1, the model includes outside family
income. The moments to match are supplemented by allowing these flows to influence educational attainment. In
one specification, the resource flow is correlated with ability in the model allowing us to match a correlation between
the flow and test score in the data. For this extended model the borrowing constraint continues to matter.
   Sub-section 8.2 studies the impact of parent’s education on either the child’s tastes or ability. Here parent’s edu-
cation is correlated with either the taste shock or ability and match, in the latter case, an additional moment linking
parent’s education to test scores. The estimated model without capital market imperfections matches
the moments very well. Adding in the borrowing constraint does not improve the fit of the model.
Further, in this case, while there is some noise in the test score, the main factor creating mismatch remains taste
shocks.
   Sub-section 8.3 allows both channels of influence to operate. Parent’s income can relax the borrowing constraint
and parent’s education can influences tastes. The estimation matches moments including the joint effects of income
and parent’s education on child educational attainment. Again, there is no evidence of borrowing constraints as a
determinant of mismatch.

8. ROLE OF PARENTS


8.1     Family Income
This section studies the impact of family resources on the chid’s educational attainment and mismatch. Flows from
parents were not explicitly incorporated into the educational choice problem specified above. Here we introduce those
flows into the model and then re-estimate parameters. This section excludes the low and high SES groups since the
analysis is about the impact of family income.
    Consider an extension of the model to include a transfer from parents, received at the start of the education
phase.28 The household head chooses transfers to a child, denoted Z, that solves maxZ up (Y − Z) + λV (Z, θ) with
up (·), strictly increasing and strictly concave, representing the parents utility given income Y and V (Z, θ) being the
indirect utility of a child with resources Z and ability θ. This value comes from the college choice problem studied
in section 3 with Z added to the resources in (17). The parameter λ is a weight between the parents consumption
and the value of the child’s optimization problem. The optimal transfer will be increasing in parent’s income.29
    Though this model is not included explicitly in the estimation, it frames the analysis that follows. The next
sub-section considers the effect of family income on college choice. As argued above, the optimal transfer will depend
on family income. It is common in the literature on the empirical effects of family income on education choice to
treat family income as representing the resources available to the child. The reduced form estimates reported in
this section on the dependence of educational attainment on family income provide a useful comparison with these
previous findings.


8.1.1    Additional Moments

The estimation includes an additional set of moments that link family income to educational attainment. Specifically,
a version of the logistic regression, (1), is estimated where both family income and the test score are used as covariates:

                                                                r   r        r   2   r   3   r   4
                                                         expα0 +α1 ai +µ2 inci +µ3 inci +µ4 inci 30
                                      P r(ei = 1) =             r   r      r    2   r    3   r   4 .                                     (22)
                                                       1 + expα0 +α1 ai +µ2 inci +µ3 inci +µ4 inci

    As in Belley and Lochner (2007a), family income is included through dummy variables indicating the quartile
of the income distribution. But, in contrast to Belley and Lochner (2007a), the dependent variable is educational
attainment not enrollment.31 The regression coefficients are denoted µrj where j is the index of the quartile (with
j = 1 excluded). The test score is continuous with a coefficient of α1r in the regression with family income as
additional covariates.
    Note that the additional moments use the quartile of family income as a proxy for family resources and thus
transfers. Since the transfer function is monotone in income, the quartile of family income is a good proxy for the
quartile of the transfer.
    These results from estimation of (22), for the entire sample as well as the sub-groups, are shown in Table 16.
In the data, the response of the education choice to family income is not monotone. The coefficients for the second
  28 Appendix B of Belley and Lochner (2007b) outlines a more elaborate model along the same lines. Of course, the transfer may take

many forms. As in Glomm and Ravikumar (1992), parents may directly choose education quality for their children.
  29 This follows directly from the strict concavity of up (·) and the curvature of V (Z, θ) with respect to Z. The dependence of the transfer

on ability is complicated by both the education decision as well as the potentially binding borrowing constraint.
  30 Weaker results obtain when using a measure of wealth rather than family income. In keeping with the literature, such as Belley and

Lochner (2007a), we focus on family income and not wealth.
  31 For their linear regression the dependent variable was educational attainment, in years, at age 21.




                                                                        29

group are negative, indicating an adverse affect of family income of educational attainment relative to the lowest
income group. This could reflect educational subsidies for the lowest family income group. The coefficients are
positive for the third and fourth groups.32 The coefficients are statistically significant at the 5% level for all groups
except for the coefficient on the second group which is significant only for the pooled sample and the white group.
The coefficient on the test score in regression (22) is generally quite close to that from regression (1).
    In terms of other moments, the mismatch rates continue to be calculated based upon the initial regression,
conditioning only on the test score, as in (1). Thus the regression coefficients from (22) are in addition to the original
set of moments.
    The simulated data are created by solving our model with the inclusion of a transfer Z. Since family income is
used as a proxy for the transfer, the distribution of Z is assumed to be Pareto and a single parameter is calibrated
by race and gender to match mean family income from the NLSY97 sample.33


8.1.2    Estimation Results

There are two cases explored, distinguished by the way family income enters the model. In the first, termed “No
Correlation”, parents income influences the household choice problem only through the direct provision of resources.
This will influence the education choice since utility is strictly concave so that the transfer impacts the marginal
utility of consumption during the schooling phase. Whether this relaxes a borrowing constraint depends on whether
the borrowing constraint is imposed, as in the “BC” treatment.
    The second case, termed “Correlated Income and Ability”, allows parents income to influence the child’s ability.
This dependence of ability on the transfer from parents is parameterized by θpinc . For this treatment, an additional
moment is added: the correlation between family income and the child’s test score, denoted “c(t, Y )” in Table 16.
The model links income to ability through θpinc and this is reflected in c(t, Y ). The parameter estimates are reported
in Table 17.
    In the initial block of moments in Table 16, in which the family influence is through resources only, the effect
of family income is monotone and relatively small compared to the data. In particular, the estimated model in the
BC case mimics very closely the influence of parent’s income on education attainment for the higher quartiles but
is unable to match the negative coefficients on the second quartile. The fit of the model is slightly better in the
borrowing constraint (BC) case. The fit improves for every group but only by a small amount.
    Once the family income influences ability as well, the results are somewhat different. First, the noise in the test
score matters, particularly for the white and female sub-groups. Second, despite adding an additional moment, the
fit of the model is better for the male, female and white groups compared to the case of no correlation between
family income and ability. In this case, the simulated data does capture the positive correlation between income and
the test score seen in the data through a positive estimate of the parameter θpinc . Thus allowing family income to
affect ability fits the data better for these groups.34 There is modest improvement with the borrowing constraint
case, though none for the white and black groups treated separately. Again, this specification does not capture the
  32 This pattern is in contrast to the findings reported in Table 3 of Belley and Lochner (2007a) for college attendance in the NLSY97

as they find the coefficients are all positive.
  33 From simulation, the mean of Z is 1.5, the median is 1.26 and the fraction of zero transfers is about 5%.
  34 This is consistent with the reduced form findings in Belley and Lochner (2007a) and Johnson (2013) where the regression coefficients

on family income are lower when other family characteristics are included as covariates.



                                                                   30

non-monotone relationship between family income and educational attainment.


8.2       Parent’s Education
This section studies the impact of parent’s (throughout this is mother’s) education on educational outcomes.35 This
is taken as an alternative to a family link based on income or transfers alone. Importantly, for our sample the
correlation between family income and mother’s education is around 0.2 for the pooled sample and the sub-groups.
Thus we are looking at a variation in the data different from the effects of family income.


8.2.1      Additional Moments

There are two avenues of influence explored. First, the parent’s education impacts the tastes of the child. This is
the case labeled “Correlated with Tastes” in the tables. Second, the parent’s education impacts the ability of the
child. This influence is measured by a correlation between parent’s education and test score in the data. This is the
case labeled “Correlated with Ability” in the following tables.
   Specifically, to capture the influence of parent’s education on outcomes, the mother’s completion of high school
or not, is treated as a dummy variable, denoted pei , in a version of (1):

                                                                          r   r     p
                                                                    expα0 +α1 ai +µ pei
                                                 P r(ei = 1) =             r   r     p    .                                            (23)
                                                                  1 + expα0 +α1 ai +µ pei
The estimates obtained from (23) are included in the moments to be matched.
   In addition, for the “Correlated with Ability” model, the moments include the observed correlation between
parent’s education and the child’s test score. There is no comparable moment for the “Correlated with Tastes” case
as tastes are not directly observed, nor is a signal of them.


8.2.2      Results

The parameter estimates are given in Table 18 and the moments in Table 19 in blocks depending on the channel of
influence. The parameters and moments are specific to the blocks.
   The estimated parameter εpe is the shift in the mean of the distribution of tastes if the mother attains a high school
degree. The estimated parameter θpe captures the influence of mother’s education on the mean of the distribution
of ability. In the simulated data, mother’s education is randomly drawn to match the group specific high school
attainment rates.36
   From the discussion of the baseline models, there were two key findings. The first was the estimate of no noise
in the test score. The second was the slight improvement in fit with an occasionally binding borrowing constraint.
   Neither of those conclusions survives these extensions of the model. Despite matching additional moments,
both of these cases fit the moments, such as the college attainment rate, better than the baseline
model and do so without borrowing constraints. This is particularly noteworthy relative to the specification
in which the influence within the family arises through resource flows. Of these two cases, the “Correlated with
Tastes” fits the data moments very closely.
 35 In   keeping with the literature, including Belley and Lochner (2007a), the analysis isolates the effects of mother’s education.
 36 These   rates are 78.77 (all), 79.17 (male), 78.35 (female), 75.61 (black) and 88.61 (white).



                                                                     31
8. ROLE OF PARENTS


    The models do fail in one important dimension: they do not create under-match. Interestingly, this is true for
the specification with borrowing constraints: this source of under-match is not enough to improve the fit along the
mismatch dimension.
    Further, there is some evidence of noise in the test scores. Specifically, looking at indicated in Table 18, for both
models of correlation and regardless of the imposition of a borrowing constraint, the estimate of σ is much larger
than the baseline estimate.37 The linking of parent’s education to either tastes or ability limits the influence of these
factors and thus enlarges the role played by noise in the test score for creating (measured) mismatch. This source
of mismatch is unrelated to the efficient allocation of individuals to educational attainment. It is simply noise from
the perspective of the researcher.
    Note that the parameters that govern the influence of parent’s education on tastes (εpe ) or ability (θpe ) are
positive. In the estimated model, an increase in mother’s education either increases the taste for higher education
or the ability of offspring.
    The blocks labeled “No BC” and “BC” for each of the “correlated with taste” case are identical and this is the
case for four of the five groups in the “correlated with ability” case, with the black sub-group being an exception.
This indicates that no substantial improvement in fit was obtained by allowing an occasional borrowing constraint.
The estimation of the “BC” case was conducted at numerous starting values for b̄, searching for an improvement.
    Looking at the moments in Table 19, the treatment allowing a correlation between parent’s education and ability
adds an additional moment from the data, the correlation between parent’s education and test score. Note that the
simulated model includes a link between parent’s income and ability that, in part, helps to match this correlation.
In the data, for all sub-groups, the correlation of test score and parents ability is positive. The estimated model
reproduces these correlations quite well. As is clear from this table, the fit of this model is extremely good. While
the model does not nest the baseline and has an additional parameter, the fit of the moments is better than the
baseline.
    Returning to the theme of mismatch, note that the estimated models in either the “correlated with tastes” or
“correlated with ability” cases produce a substantial amount of over-match but no under-match is present. The
models do a good job of matching the college rates.


8.3     Parent’s Education and Income
If borrowing constraints are not a significant factor in the estimated model with parent’s education influencing tastes
and/or ability, then matching regression results, such as those reported in Belley and Lochner (2007a), in which both
parent’s income and education are significant is a challenge. This sub-section pursues that issue, with attention to
the implications for mismatch as well.
    This specification allows heterogeneity in both parent’s income and education. As in the data, the correlation
between these two attributes is set at 0.20. The model allows parent’s education to influence tastes and parent’s
income to relax the budget constraint.38
    The moments, shown in Table 20, include a version of (22) supplemented to include parent’s (mother’s) education:
  37 The panel in Table 19 labeled “No Noise” shows how the fit deteriorates in a simulation using the estimated parameters for the case

with σ == 0.
  38 To isolate these two channels, neither influences ability.

As shown in Table 20 by a “*”, the coefficient on parent’s education, µp , was significantly different from zero for all
groups while the income coefficients were often insignificant in the data moments. As before, the effect of the second
quartile on the likelihood of a college education is negative, some are significant. The effects of the third quartile are
insignificant for all groups.
   The estimated model allows parents education to influence tastes, parameterized by εpe and shown in Table 21.
As before, there is no comparable moment in the data as tastes are unmeasured.
   The main results described in the case where parent’s education influenced tastes in the absence of an effect of
parent’s income remain. There is no evidence of a borrowing constraint mattering: the “No BC” and “BC” cases
are identical. Test scores remain noisy.
   Despite the added moment associated with the inclusion of parent’s education in (24), the model fits better than
the specification with parent’s income effects alone. Interestingly, the estimated model produces negative effects of
parent’s income on the likelihood of college for the second and third quartiles. This is induced by the correlation
between parent’s income and education, not through a borrowing constraint. As before, the model fails to produce
sufficient under-match.




 39 Weaker results obtain when using a measure of wealth rather than family income. In keeping with the literature, such as Belley and

Lochner (2007a), we focus on family income and not wealth.

9. CONCLUSION


9     Conclusion
This paper studies the determinants of mismatch using the NLSY97 sample. It does so through two approaches.
One that ignores the influence of family income and education and another in which these factors are apparent.
    There are a couple of key findings from the initial analysis. First, mismatch is largely a consequence of variations
in tastes for education rather than noise in the test score. Second, a model with occasionally binding (estimated)
borrowing constraints fits the data slightly better than a model without capital market frictions.
    Once the influence of parents, either through the relaxation of a budget constraint or through the impact of
mother’s education on tastes and/or ability, is introduced the results change. The influence of parents arises largely
through the impact of mother’s education rather than by relaxing a binding borrowing constraint. That is, once
parent’s education is taken into account, there is no evidence of a binding borrowing constraint. In this case, the
mismatch arises from variations in tastes and, in contrast to the results without family influences, noise in test scores.
    There is an open issue, unresolved within the model, about the implications of mismatch arising from taste shocks.
At one extreme, tastes represent exogenous influences on the choice of an agent. From this perspective, the optimal
allocation conditions jointly on tastes and ability and the resulting assignment to educational attainment is efficient.
Measured mismatch reflects the neglect of tastes in determining education choice and is not a measure of inefficiency.
    At the other extreme, tastes themselves may reflect social interactions. Put differently, taste differences may
reflect social capital accumulation influenced by peers.40 Someone with very high ability brought up in a setting
where college attainment is not highly valued may choose not to attend college. In this case, an efficient allocation
might indeed assign that person to a higher level of education attainment to avoid the loss of an under-match.
    One natural extension of the analysis is, as in Dillon and Smith (2013), to consider variations in college quality
as another dimension of mismatch. In this case, mismatch may arise from the assignment of low (high) ability
individuals to high (low) quality schools.
    Another extension is to consider mismatch in both labor markets and in educational attainment. The model
abstracts from labor market frictions. Their interaction with education decisions remains an open issue.
