A Generalized Approach to Indeterminacy in Linear Rational Expectations Models

                                         ABSTRACT

We propose a novel approach to deal with the problem of indeterminacy in Linear Rational
Expectations models. The method consists of augmenting the original model with a set of
auxiliary exogenous equations that are used to provide the adequate number of explosive roots in
presence of indeterminacy. The solution in this expanded state space, if it exists, is always
determinate, and is identical to the indeterminate solution of the original model. The proposed
approach accommodates determinacy and any degree of indeterminacy, and it can be
implemented even when the boundaries of the determinacy region are unknown. As a result, the
researcher can estimate the model by using standard packages without restricting the estimates to
a certain area of the parameter space. We apply our method to simulated and actual data from a
prototypical New-Keynesian model for both regions of the parameter space. We show that our
method successfully recovers the true parameter values independent of the initial values.

1    Introduction

Sunspot shocks and multiple equilibria have been at the center of economic thinking at least since
the seminal work of Cass and Shell (1983), Farmer and Guo (1994) and Farmer and Guo (1995).
Furthermore, in many of the Linear Rational Expectation (LRE) models used to study the
properties of the macroeconomy the possibility of multiple equilibria arises for some parameter
values, but not for others. This paper proposes a novel approach to solve LRE models that
easily accommodates both the case of determinacy and indeterminacy. As a result, the proposed
methodology can be used to easily estimate a LRE model that could potentially be characterized
by multiplicity of equilibria. Our approach is implementable even when the analytic conditions
for determinacy or the degrees of indeterminacy are unknown and can be implemented to study
indeterminacy in standard software packages, such as Dynare and Sims’(2001) code Gensys.
To understand how our approach works, it is useful to recall the conditions for determinacy
as stated by Blanchard and Kahn (1980). Indeterminacy arises when the parameter values
are such that the number of explosive roots is smaller than the number of non-predetermined
variables. The key idea behind our methodology consists of augmenting the original model by
appending additional autoregressive processes that can be used to provide the missing explosive
roots. The innovations of these exogenous processes are assumed to be linear combinations of
a subset of the forecast errors associated with the expectational variables of the model, and a
newly de…ned vector of sunspot shocks. Whether the autoregressive processes are mean-reverting
or explosive is central, and the intuition follows. When a model is determinate, the roots of the
additional autoregressive process are within the unit circle (i.e., the Blanchard-Kahn condition is
satis…ed) and the auxiliary process is irrelevant for the dynamics of the model. The law of motion
for the endogenous variables is in this case equivalent to the solution obtained using standard
solution algorithms (King and Watson (1998), Klein (2000), Sims (2001)). When the model is
indeterminate, the appended autoregressive processes are explosive, and the solution we obtain
for the endogenous variables is equivalent to the one obtained with the methodology of Lubik
and Schorfheide (2003) or, equivalently, Farmer et al. (2015).
Our methodology simpli…es the common approach used to deal with indeterminacy. First, the
common procedure requires the researcher to solve the model di¤erently depending on the area of
the parameter space that is being studied. Second, the procedure requires to estimate the same
model twice, …rst under determinacy, then under indeterminacy. This is the same procedure that
would be followed if the researcher were comparing two structurally di¤ erent models, while she
is in fact estimating the same structural model in alternative regions of the parameter space. Fi-
nally, the estimation under indeterminacy is not generally implementable in standard estimation
packages and requires a signi…cant amount of coding work on the side of the researcher.


                                                2
In this respect, our methodology provides three main advantages. First, it accommodates both
the case of determinacy and indeterminacy while considering the same augmented system of
equations. The model can therefore be solved by using standard solution algorithms. Instead,
existing methods require to rewrite the model based on the existing degree of indeterminacy
(Farmer et al. (2015)) or to construct the solution under indeterminacy ex-post following the
seminal contribution of Lubik and Schorfheide (2003). Second, given that the method accom-
modates both the case of determinacy and indeterminacy, the researcher does not need to take
a stance on which area of the parameter space she is interested in exploring. We show that our
methodology ensures that standard estimation algorithms explore the entire parameter space,
increasing the probability of …nding a global maximum over the parameter space. This is par-
ticularly relevant when considering that the posterior mode is a crucial object used for Bayesian
inference.1 Finally, even when the region of determinacy is unknown, the methodology allows the
researcher to estimate the model without imposing a priori assumptions about the uniqueness
of the equilibrium, which can be equivalently thought of as restrictions on the parameter space
over which inference is conducted. Hence, information contained in the data indicates whether
an estimated model is characterized by a unique solution or by multiplicity of equilibria.
Our work is related to the vast literature that studies the role of indeterminacy in explaining
the evolution of the macroeconomy. Prominent examples in the monetary policy literature in-
clude the work of Clarida et al. (2000) and Kerr and King (1996), that study the possibility
of multiple equilibria as a result of violations of the Taylor principle in New-Keynesian (NK)
models. Applying the methods developed in Lubik and Schorfheide (2003) to the canonical NK
model, Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) test for indeterminacy in U.S. monetary policy. Using a
calibrated small-scale model, Coibon and Gorodnichenko (2011) …nd that the reduction of the
target in‡ation rate in the U.S. also played a key role in explaining the Great Moderation, and
Arias et al. (2015) support this …nding in the context of a medium-scale model à la Christiano
et al. (2005). In a similar spirit, Arias (2013) studies the dynamic properties of medium-sized
NK models with trend in‡ation. More recently, Aruoba and Schorfheide (2015) study in‡ation
dynamics at the Zero Lower Bound (ZLB) and during an exit from the ZLB.
The paper closest to our is Farmer et al. (2015). As explained above, the main di¤erence
between the two approaches is that our method accommodates both the case of determinacy and
indeterminacy while considering the same augmented system of equations. Instead, the method
proposed by Farmer et al. (2015) require to rewrite the model based on the existing degree of
indeterminacy. With respect to Lubik and Schorfheide (2003), the main novelty of our approach
    1
      Speci…cally, using simulated data we show that our methodology leads the estimation algorithm to converge
to the "right" area of the parameter space. Once the algorithm converges to such area, the probability of leaving
it is very low, in line with the results of Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) that show that the likelihood presents
potentially very large jumps/drops between the determinacy/indeterminacy regions.

is to provide a uni…ed approach to study determinacy and indeterminacy of di¤erent degrees.
Ascari et al. (2016) allow for temporarily unstable paths, while we require all solutions to be
stationary, in line with previous contributions in the literature. Finally, we deliberately use
Dynare in all the examples presented in this paper to show that our method can be combined
with standard packages. However, our solution method can be combined with more sophisticated
estimation techniques such as the ones developed in Herbst and Schorfheide (2015).
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 builds the intuition by using a
univariate example in the spirit of Lubik and Schorfheide (2004). Section 3 describes the meth-
odology and shows that the augmented representation of the LRE model delivers solutions which
under determinacy are equivalent to those obtained using standard solution algorithms, and un-
der indeterminacy to those obtained using the methodology provided by Lubik and Schorfheide
(2003, 2004) and Farmer et al. (2015). Section 4 provides an analytic example of the theoretical
result and in Section 5, we apply our theoretical results to the NK model of Lubik and Schorfheide
(2004). In Section 5.1, we …rst generate series of simulated data for parameter values which sat-
isfy the condition for determinacy and indeterminacy, respectively. We then estimate the model
by using the proposed augmented representation for both cases. The model is estimated over the
entire parameter space and the true parameter values are recovered, providing evidence in favor
of determinacy or indeterminacy. Section 5.2 shows that this is true even when we assume that
the researcher does not know the boundaries of the determinacy region. Hence, our methodology
can be used to test for indeterminacy in a wide class of models, including medium- and large-
scale models for which the region of determinacy cannot be derived analytically. We also repeat
the exercise on actual data using the dataset from Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) in Section 5.3.
Finally, we provide guidance on how to properly implement our methodology in Section 6 and
our conclusions are presented in Section 7.


2    Building the intuition

Before presenting the theoretical results of the paper, this section builds the intuition behind
our approach by considering a univariate example similar to the one proposed in Lubik and
Schorfheide (2004). While Section 2.1 explains our approach from an analytical perspective,
Section 2.2 addresses questions which could arise at the time of its practical implementation.




                                                4
2.1       A useful example

Consider a classical monetary model characterized by the Fisher equation

                                               it = Et (             t+1 )   + rt ;                                (1)

and the simple Taylor rule


                                                      it =                t;                                       (2)

where it denotes the nominal interest rate. We assume that the real interest rate rt is given and
described by a mean-zero Gaussian i.i.d. shock.2 To properly specify the model, we also de…ne
the one-step ahead forecast error associated with the expectational variable,                     t,   as

                                                t         t          Et      1 ( t ):                              (3)

Combining (1) and (2), we obtain the univariate model

                                              Et (   t+1 )     =              t       rt :                         (4)

First, we consider the case        > 1. Rewriting equation (4), it is clear that this case is associated
with the determinate solution,

                                                      1                                 1
                                          t    =              Et (     t+1 )      +          rt                    (5)
                                                      1
                                               =              rt :                                                 (6)



where the last equality is obtained by solving equation (5) forward and recalling the assumptions
on rt . The strong response of the monetary authority to changes in in‡ation (                         > 1) guarantees
that in‡ation is pinned down as a function of the exogenous real interest rt . From a technical
perspective, the condition          > 1 is such that the Blanchard-Kahn condition is satis…ed: the
number of explosive roots matches the number of expectational variables, that in this univariate
case is    t.

The second case corresponds to                 1. The solution to (4) is obtained by combining (4) with
   2
    In the classical monetary model, the real interest rate results from the equilibrium in labor and goods market
and it depends on the technology shocks. We are considering an exogenous process for the technology shocks and
therefore we take the process for the real interest rate as given.




                                                                 5
(3), and it corresponds to any process that takes the following form

                                       t   =        t 1           rt   1   +       t:                                      (7)

When the monetary authority does not respond aggressively enough to changes in in‡ation
(     1), there are multiple solutions for the in‡ation rate,                           t,   each indexed by the expectations
that the representative agent holds about future in‡ation,                              t.   Equivalently, the solution to the
univariate model is indeterminate: the Blanchard-Kahn solution is not satis…ed since there is no
explosive root to match the number of expectational variables, that is                                 t.

From a methodological and computational perspective, the latter case constitutes a challenge.
Standard software packages such as Dynare do not allow for indeterminacy. Of course, a re-
searcher could in principle code an estimation algorithm herself, following the methods outlined
in Lubik and Schorfheide (2004). However, this approach requires a substantial amount of time
and technical skills. Hence, the result is that in practice most of the papers simply rule out the
possibility of indeterminacy, even if the model at hand could in principle allow for such a feature.
From a purely technical point of view, the problem that a researcher faces when solving a LRE
model such as the one presented in (4) using standard solution algorithms is the following.
Under determinacy, the model already has a su¢ cient number of unstable roots to match the
number of expectational variables. However, under indeterminacy, the model is missing one
explosive root since it still has one expectational variable, but no unstable root. Therefore, our
approach proposes to augment the original model by appending an independent process which
could be either stable or unstable. The key insight consists of choosing this auxiliary process
in a way to deliver the correct solution. When the original model is determinate, the auxiliary
process must be stationary so that also the augmented representation satis…es the Blanchard-
Kahn condition. In this case, the auxiliary process represents a separate block that does not
a¤ect the law of motion of the model variables. When the model is indeterminate, the additional
process should however be explosive so that the Blanchard-Kahn condition is satis…ed for the
augmented system, even if not for the original model. In what follows, we apply this intuition
to the example considered in this section and explain how to choose the auxiliary process.
Our methodology proposes to solve an augmented system of equations which can be dealt with
by using standard solution algorithms such as Sims (2001) under both determinacy and inde-
terminacy. Consider the following augmented system
                                   (
                                           Et (   t+1 )   =            t       rt ;

zero sunspot shock with standard deviation            v.   Table 1 summarizes the intuition behind our
approach.
When the original LRE model in (4) is determinate,                   > 1, the Blanchard-Kahn condition
for the augmented representation in (8) is satis…ed when 1=                   < 1. Indeed, for                       > 1 the
original model has the same number of unstable roots as the number of expectational variables.
Our methodology thus suggests to append a stable autoregressive process. When                                        > 1 and
1=       < 1, the solution method of Sims (2001) delivers the same solution for the endogenous
variable      t   as in equation (5). Since the coe¢ cient 1=         is smaller than 1, the solution also
includes the autoregressive process ! t . Importantly, its dynamics do not impact the endogenous
variable yt .
Considering the case of indeterminacy (i.e.                1), the original model has one expectational
variable, but no unstable root, thus violating the Blanchard-Kahn condition. By appending
an explosive autoregressive process, the augmented representation that we propose satis…es the
Blanchard-Kahn condition and delivers the same solution as the one resulting from the meth-
odology of Lubik and Schorfheide (2003) or Farmer et al. (2015) described by equation (7).
Moreover, stability imposes conditions such that ! t is always equal to zero, and the solution for
the endogenous variable does not depend on the appended autoregressive process.
                                               1
Summarizing, the choice of the coe¢ cient          should be made as follows. For values of                            greater
than 1, the Blanchard-Kahn condition for the augmented representation is satis…ed for values
of       greater than 1. Conversely, under indeterminacy (i.e.                     1) the condition is satis…ed


                                                      7
when      is smaller than 1. The choice of parametrizing the auxiliary process with 1=       instead
of    induces a positive correlation between       and   that facilitates the implementation of our
method when estimating a model.
Finally, note that under both determinacy and indeterminacy, the exact value of 1= is irrelevant
for the law of motion of    t.   Under determinacy, the auxiliary process ! t is stationary, but its
evolution does not a¤ect the law of motion of the model variables. Under indeterminacy, ! t
is always equal to zero. This makes clear that introducing the auxiliary processes does not
a¤ect the properties of the solution in the two cases. These processes only serve the purpose
of providing the necessary explosive roots under indeterminacy and of creating the mapping
between the sunspot shocks and the expectation errors. As we will see in Section 3, this result
can be generalized and applies to more complicated models with potentially multiple degrees of
indeterminacy.


2.2    Choosing

A natural question that arises with the approach we propose is how to choose          . We consider
the following three cases: (1) The researcher knows the analytic condition de…ning the region of
determinacy; (2) she only has an relatively good idea of the threshold of the determinacy region;
(3) the region of determinacy is completely unknown to the researcher. We consider the three
cases separately.
We …rst consider the case in which the researcher is able to analytically derive the condition
which de…nes when the model is determinate or indeterminate. For the example considered in
this section, this case corresponds to knowing that when         1 the model in (4) is indeterminate.
We thus suggest to write the parameter      as a function of the parameter     so that the augmented
representation in (8) always satis…es the Blanchard-Kahn condition. This can be obtained by
setting          . When the original model is determinate (      > 1), the appended autoregressive
process is stationary since 1=     < 1. Under indeterminacy (         1) of the original model, the
coe¢ cient 1= is greater than 1 and the appended process is therefore explosive. Hence, when the
region of determinacy is known, the researcher should carefully choose       such that the augmented
representation always delivers a solution under both determinacy and indeterminacy. Using the
NK model in Lubik and Schorfheide (2004), we implement this suggestion in Section 5.1 where
we estimate the model assuming that the researcher knows the region of determinacy.
There are however instances in which the researcher does not know the exact properties of the
determinacy region. Suppose that the researcher does not know the region, but for values of
the parameter       slightly above 1 she can solve the original model under determinacy, while for
values just below 1 the model is indeterminate. She thus has a relatively good idea that the


                                                   8
threshold for determinacy is somewhere around 1, even if she is not able to derive the analytical
condition. In this case, she could set a prior distribution for the parameter                   such that there
is a higher probability of drawing values above 1 when the parameter                      is greater than 1 and
vice versa. Similarly, the variance-covariance matrix used by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
to propose new draws should be chosen to display a positive correlation between the values of
         and . This practice would increase the likelihood of obtaining a solution in the augmented
representation and therefore the e¢ ciency of the algorithm.
Finally, it could be the case that the region of determinacy is completely unknown to the re-
searcher. For a given draw of the parameter              , the researcher would like to make draws of
smaller or greater than 1 with equal probabilities. In this case, the researcher could use a uniform
distribution over the interval [0; 2] or any symmetric interval around 1 as a prior distribution.
Also, note that the prior distribution does not necessarily have to be continuous. A discrete
probability distribution that allows to make draws of               to be either equal 0:5 or 1:5 could also
be speci…ed as a prior. In this context, the e¢ ciency of the algorithm would also be improved if
it were to be designed as follows. If for a given draw of                 and     the augmented representation
in (8) does not have a solution, the algorithm should be coded as to make a new draw of                  0   equal
to the inverse of the earlier draw .


3         Methodology

Given the general class of LRE models described in Sims (2001), this paper proposes an aug-
mented representation which embeds the solution for the model under both determinacy and
indeterminacy.3 In particular, the augmented representation of the LRE model delivers solu-
tions which under determinacy are equivalent to those obtained using standard solution al-
gorithms, and under indeterminacy to those obtained using the methodology provided by Lubik
and Schorfheide (2003, 2004) or equivalently Farmer et al. (2015). In the following, we generalize
the intuition built in the previous section. Consider the following LRE model

                                 0(   )Xt =   1(   )Xt   1   + ( )"t + ( ) t ;                                 (9)

where Xt 2 Rk is a vector of endogenous variables, "t 2 R` is a vector of exogenous shocks,
 t   2 Rp collects the one-step ahead forecast errors for the expectational variables of the system
and         2   is a vector of parameters. The matrices         0   and    1    are of dimension k   k, possibly
singular, and the matrices         and    are of dimension k              ` and k      p, respectively. Also, we

(1998) use perturbation methods to solve DSGE models using higher order approximations.

Consider a model whose maximum degree of indeterminacy is denoted by m.4 The proposed

where the vector         f;t    is a subset of the endogenous shocks and the vectors                                  !t;   t ; f;t    are
of dimension m          1. The equations in (12) are autoregressive processes whose innovations are
linear combinations of a vector of sunspot shocks,                            t,   and a subset of forecast errors,          f;t ,   where
Et   1( t)   = Et   1 ( f;t )   = 0. As we will show below, the choice of which expectational errors to
include in (12) does not a¤ect the solution.
The intuition behind the proposed methodology works as in the example considered in the previ-
ous section. Let m ( ) denote the actual degree of indeterminacy associated with the parameter
vector : Under indeterminacy the Blanchard-Kahn condition for the original LRE model in (9)
is not satis…ed. Suppose that the system is characterized by m ( ) degrees of indeterminacy,
then it is necessary to introduce m ( ) explosive roots to solve the model using standard solu-
tion algorithms. In this case, the (absolute value of the) m ( ) of the diagonal elements of the
matrix       are assumed to be outside the unit circle, and the augmented representation is there-
fore determinate since the Blanchard-Kahn condition is now satis…ed. On the other hand, under
determinacy the (absolute value of the) diagonal elements of the matrix                                            are assumed to be
all inside the unit circle, since the number of explosive roots of the original LRE model in (9)
already equals the number of expectational variables in the model (m ( ) = 0). Also, in this
case the augmented representation is determinate due to the stability of the appended auxiliary
processes. Importantly, as shown for the univariate example in Section 2, the block structure
of the proposed methodology guarantees that the autoregressive process, ! t , does not a¤ect the

     Denoting by n the minimum number of unstable roots of a LRE model, the maximum degrees of indeterminacy
are de…ned as m p n. When the minimum number of unstable roots of a model is unknown, then m coincides
with number of expectational variables p. This represents the maximum degree of indeterminacy in any model
with p expectational variables.

Section 3.1 and 3.2 show that the augmented representation of the LRE model delivers solutions
which under determinacy are equivalent to those obtained using standard solution algorithms,
and under indeterminacy to those obtained using the methodology provided by Lubik and Schorf-
heide (2003, 2004) and Farmer et al. (2015). In order to simplify the exposition, when analyzing
the case of indeterminacy we assume, without loss of generality, m ( ) = m. As it will become
clear, the case of m ( ) < m is a special case of what we present below.


3.1     Equivalence under determinacy

This section considers the case in which the original LRE is determinate, and shows the equi-
valence of the solution obtained using the proposed augmented representation with the one from
the standard solution algorithm described in Sims (2001).


3.1.1    Canonical solution

Consider the LRE model in (9) and reported below as (14)

                                                  0 Xt    =      1 Xt 1        +          "t +           t :                                       (14)

The method described in Sims (2001) delivers a solution, if it exists, by following four steps.
First, Sims (2001) shows how to write the model in the form

                                               SZ T Xt = T Z T Xt             1   + Q "t + Q                    t;                                 (15)


                                                                             11
where    0   = QT SZ T and         1   = QT T Z T is the QZ decomposition of f                               0;   1 g,   and the k     k
matrices Q and Z are orthonormal, upper triangular and possibly complex. Also, the diagonal
elements of S and T contain the generalized eigenvalues of f                                0;       1 g.

Second, since the QZ decomposition is not unique, Sims’algorithm chooses a decomposition that
orders the equations so that the absolute values of the ratios of the generalized eigenvalues are
placed in an increasing order, that is

                                         jtjj j = jsjj j        jtii j = jsii j      for j > i.

The algorithm then partitions the matrices S; T , Q and Z as
                   "        #                        "                  #                   "        #            "        #

              S=                   ;         T =                            ;        Z =                 ;   Q=                ;     (16)
                         0   S22                           0      T22                           Z2                    Q2

where the …rst block corresponds to the system of equations for which jtjj j = jsjj j < 1 and the
second block groups the equations which are characterized by explosive roots, jtjj j = jsjj j > 1 .

                                                                                 2;t

where n is the number of explosive roots, and the transformed parameters

the second block can be written as

                                   2;t   = S221 T22            2;t 1   + S221 ( e 2 "t + e 2 t ):                                    (19)

Since this system of equations contains the explosive roots of the system, then a bounded solution,
if it exists, will set

                                                                         2;0        = 0                                              (20)

A necessary condition for the existence of a solution requires that the number of unstable roots (n)
equals the number of expectational variables (p). In this section, we are considering the solution
under determinacy and this guarantees that there are no degrees of indeterminacy m ( ) = 0.
The su¢ cient condition then requires that the columns of the matrix ~ 2 are linearly independent
so that there is at least one bounded solution. In that case, the matrix ~ 2 is a square, non-singular
matrix and equation (21) imposes linear restrictions on the forecast errors,                                                   t,   as a function of

a system of stable equations, and we show that the solution for the endogenous variables, Xt ,

We can …nd a solution to the augmented representation in (24) by using Sims’algorithm. Sim-
ilarly to the previous section, we follow the four steps which describe the algorithm. First, the
solution algorithm performs the QZ decomposition of the matrices f ^ 0 ; ^ 1 g and the augmented
representation takes the form

Importantly, note that the inner matrices of fS;           ^ are the same as those which de…ne
the matrices fS; T; Z T ; Qg in (16) found in the previous section.
Second, the algorithm chooses a QZ decomposition which groups the equations in a stable and
an explosive block. Since this section assumes that the original model is determinate and that
the diagonal elements of the matrix                are within the unit circle, the explosive block corresponds
to the third system of equations in (25) which is characterized by explosive roots. Recalling the
de…nition of the matrices ^ and ^ , the system of equations in the third block is

                                    2;t   = S221 T22   2;t 1       + S221 ( e 2 "t + e 2 t ):                                  (26)

The third step imposes conditions to guarantee the existence of a bounded solution. However,
the explosive block in (26) is identical to the system of equations found in (19). Therefore, the
algorithm imposes the same restrictions to guarantee the existence of a bounded solution, that



                                                                   14

and as found earlier
                                                t   =     e       1e
                                                                       2 "t :                              (28)
                                                              2

Finally, the last step combines these restrictions with the system of equations in the stable block
which corresponds to the …rst and second systems of equations in (25),

                        1;t   = S111 T11    1;t 1       + S111 e 1              e1 ~

                                                                                           1~
                                                                                                2   "t ;   (29)
                        !t =       !t   1   +       t     f;t :                                            (30)

The solution in (27) (30) obtained for the augmented representation of the LRE model delivers
the same solution for the endogenous variables of interest, Xt , found in the previous section and
de…ned in equations (20), (22), and (23).
Two remarks should be made when comparing the two solutions. First, as shown in (28), the
forecast errors are only a function of the exogenous shocks "t , and not of the sunspot shocks
vt . It is therefore clear that the endogenous variables, Xt , of the original LRE model in (14)
do not respond to sunspot shocks either, as expected under determinacy. Second, (29) and (30)
indicate that under determinacy the appended system of equations constitutes a separate block,
which does not a¤ect the dynamics of the endogenous variables, Xt , and therefore the likelihood
function associated with Xt .


3.2     Equivalence under indeterminacy

This section shows the equivalence of the solutions obtained for a LRE model under indeterminacy
using the proposed augmented representation and the methodology of Lubik and Schorfheide
(2003, 2004).


3.2.1    Lubik and Schorfheide (2003)

As in Section 3.1, we consider the LRE model in (14) and reported below as (31)

                                    0 Xt    =       1 Xt 1        + "t +          t:                       (31)

In this section we assume that the model is indeterminate, and we present the method used by
Lubik and Schorfheide (2003). The authors implement the …rst two steps of the algorithm by Sims



                                                          15
(2001) and described in Section 3.1.1.6 They proceed by …rst applying the QZ decomposition
to the LRE model in (31) and then ordering the resulting system of equations in a stable and
an explosive block as de…ned in (15) and (16). However, their approach di¤ers in the third step
when the algorithm imposes restrictions to guarantee the existence of a bounded solution. In
particular, the restrictions in (20) and (21) reported below as (32) and (33) require that

                                                                    2;0    = 0;                                             (32)
                                                                   n 1
                                               ~
                                               2 "t     + ~2      t        = 0:                                             (33)

Nevertheless, it is clear that the system of equation in (33) is indeterminate since the number
of forecast errors exceeds the number of explosive roots (p > n). Equivalently, there are less
equations (n) than the number of variables to solve for (p). To characterize the full set of
solutions to equation (33), Lubik and Schorfheide (2003) decompose the matrix ~ 2 using the
following singular value decomposition
                                                             h                   i

where m represents the degrees of indeterminacy. Given the partition V                                              V1    V2   ;
                                                                                                          p p      p n   p m
equation (33) can be written as

                                         D111 U T ~ 2 "t + V1T               t   = 0:                                       (34)

Since the system is indeterminate, Lubik and Schorfheide append additional m equations,

     It is relevant to mention that in this section the matrices obtained from the QZ decomposition and the ordering
of the equations into a stable and an explosive block di¤er from those in Section 3.1 both in terms of the elements
constituing them and their dimensions. However, we opted to use the same notation for simplicity.


                                                                  16
equations in (35) to the equations in (34), the expectational errors can be written as a function
of the fundamental shocks, "t ; and the sunspot shocks,                                       t;



                             t       =       V1 D111 U1T ~ 2                      f

More compactly,
                                       t   =        V1 N              f
                                                                 + V2 M                    "t      + V2  t ;                                   (36)

where
                                                           N                 D111 U1T ~ 2 :

is a function of the parameters of the model.
Given the earlier restriction in (32) and (36), the fourth step in the algorithm combines these
equations with the system of stable equations in the …rst block as in Section 3.1.1,

            1;t   = S111 T11             1;t 1   + S111 ( e 1 "t + e 1 t )

Using the method in Lubik and Schorfheide (2003), the solution for the original LRE model
under indeterminacy is described by (32), (36) and (37).


3.2.2   Augmented representation

We now consider the augmented representation as in (24) and reported below as

                                                 ^ 0X

where X     (Xt ; ! t )T , ^"t        ("t ;      t)
                                                   T   and
                  "         #                          "             #                    "              #                 "           #
           ^0         0    0               ^1              1     0                 ^                0               ^          n   f
                                 ;                                       ;                                   ;                             :   (39)

where the matrix          is partitioned as                    =[        n        f]   without loss of generality.
The novelty of our approach is that, given our representation, we can easily obtain the solution by
using Sims’algorithm even when the original LRE is assumed to be indeterminate. It is enough
to assume that the auxiliary processes ! t are characterized by explosive roots, or equivalently
that the diagonal elements of the matrix                             are outside the unit circle. This guarantees that the


                                                                             17
Blanchard-Kahn condition for the augmented representation is satis…ed and, given the analytic
form that we propose for the auxiliary processes, we show that the solution for the endogenous
variables of interest, Xt , is equivalent to the method of Lubik and Schorfheide (2003).
To show this result, we simply apply the four steps of the algorithm described in Sims (2001) to
the proposed augmented representation. First, the QZ decomposition of (38) takes the form

                                     S^Z^ T X
                                            ^ t = T^Z^ T X
                                                         ^t                 1
                                                                                 ^ ^ ^"t + Q
                                                                                +Q         ^ ^ t;                                               (40)

where ^ 0 = Q
            ^ T S^Z^ T and ^ 1 = Q
                                 ^ T T^Z^ T is the QZ decomposition7 of f ^ 0 ; ^ 1 g and

  S^ = 4 0 S22 05 ;              ^
                                 T = 4 0 T22                        05 ;                 Z^ T = 4Z2 05 ;                       Q 4Q2 05 : (41)

Second, the QZ decomposition chosen by the algorithm groups the explosive dynamics of the
model in the second and third system of equations in (40), which are reported below as (42)

                                             =                                           +                                     t   ;            (42)

where    t   Z T Xt .
In the third step, the following restrictions are imposed,

Equation (46) shows transparently how the explosive auxiliary process that we append help to
solve the original LRE model under indeterminacy. The system of equations in (46) is determinate
as the number of equations de…ned by the explosive roots of the system equals the number of
expectational errors of the model. This guarantees that the necessary condition for the existence
of a bounded solution for the augmented representation is satis…ed. Assuming that the columns
of the matrix associated with the vector of non-fundamental shocks,                                            t,   are linearly independent,
we can therefore impose linear restrictions on the forecast errors as a function of the augmented
vector of exogenous shocks ^"t                       ("t ;        T;

The indeterminate equilibria found using the methodology of Lubik and Schorfheide (2003)
are parametrized by two sets of parameters.                                        The …rst set is de…ned by                1   2   1,   where

The following theorem establishes the equivalence between the characterizations of indeterminate
equilibria obtained by using the methodology in Lubik and Schorfheide (2003) and the proposed
augmented representation.

Conversely, for every LS equilibrium, parametrized by                            , there is a unique matrix                     vv   and a
unique covariance matrix       v"   such that        3   = vec(      vv ;    v")T ,       and f 1 ;       3g      2      BN   de…nes an
equivalent BN equilibrium.

Proof. See Appendix B.

In the paper Farmer et al. (2015), the authors also show that their characterization of indeterm-
inate equilibria is equivalent to Lubik and Schorfheide (2003). Therefore, the following corollary
holds.

                                                BN
Corollary 2 Given a parametrization                      of a Bianchi-Nicolò indeterminate equilibrium, there
exists a unique mapping into the parametrization of an indeterminate equilibrium for Farmer et
al. (2015), and vice-versa.

Moreover, the following two considerations support Corollary 3 below, which describes a relevant
result on the likelihood function of the augmented representation. First, as emphasized in this
section, the reduced form of the augmented representation has a block structure which ensures
that solution for endogenous variables in Xt is not a function of the autoregressive processes, ! t .
Second, note that the appended autoregressive processes, ! t , have no economic interpretation and
therefore have no relation with the observable variables used in a measurement equation. These
two considerations imply that the parameters of the matrix                       introduced with the augmented
representation are not identi…ed (within a certain region). Corollary 3 then follows.8

Corollary 3 The likelihood function associated with the newly de…ned vector of endogenous vari-
       ^ t , does not depend on the additional parameters included in the augmented representation,
ables, X
 , and is equivalent to the likelihood function associated with the endogenous variables, Xt .

While Section 3.1 shows that the augmented representation of the LRE model delivers solutions
which under determinacy are equivalent to those obtained using standard solution algorithms,
Theorem 1 proves that under indeterminacy the solutions of our methodology are equivalent
to those obtained using Lubik and Schorfheide (2003, 2004) and Farmer et al. (2015). This
theoretical result is crucial for the estimation exercises conducted in Section 5. The augmented
representation guarantees that the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm explores the entire domain of
the parameter space.


4     Analytic example

This section considers the canonical NK model to provide an analytic example of the theoretical
result presented in Section 3. Let

                                    xt = Et (xt+1 )                (Rt    Et (xt+1 ))                        (53)
                                      t   =    Et      1 ( t+1 )   + xt                                      (54)
                                   Rt =            t   + "R;t                                                (55)

                                    1;t   = xt         Et   1 (xt )                                          (56)

                                    2;t   =    t       Et   1( t)                                            (57)
   8
     Notice that Corollary 3 holds when the augmented representation has a unique solution. This happens in two
cases. First, values of the structural parameters which guarantee determinacy in the original LRE model should
be combined with values for i in the matrix       whose absolute value lies within the unit circle. Second, values
of the structural parameters for which the original model is indeterminate should be combined with (absolute)
values of i outside the unit circle.




                                                            21
where equations (53) (55) represent the dynamic IS curve, the NK Phillips curve and a monetary
policy reaction function, respectively. The variable xt represents log deviations of GDP from a
trend path and      t   and Rt are log deviations from the steady state level of in‡ation and the
nominal interest rate. The one-step ahead forecast errors for the deviations of output from its
trend and of in‡ation from its steady state are de…ned in (56) and (57). This model can be
expressed in matrix form as
                                         0 Xt   =     1 Xt 1       + "t +          t;                                    (58)

where Xt = (xt ;                               T                                                      T.
                    t ; Et (xt+1 ); Et ( t+1 )) ,   "t = ("R;t ) and         t   =(     1;t ; 2;t )

It is well known that the region of determinacy is associated with an active response of the
monetary authority to changes in in‡ation, a condition satis…ed when j j > 1. Alternatively,
the equilibrium is indeterminate when the monetary policy is “passive”, that is 0 < j j                                 1. In
the latter case, there is one degree of indeterminacy (m = 1) since there are two forecast errors
while the system is characterized by only one unstable root.9 Given that m = 1, the proposed
methodology consists in appending to the original LRE model in (58) the following equation

                                                     1
                                           !t =          !t   1   +   t    2;t :                                         (59)

To provide the intuition, consider                  j j. When the monetary authority is “passive,” inde-
terminacy arises and the Blanchard-Kahn condition for the original LRE model is not satis…ed.
Our representation augments the system in (58) with the explosive autoregressive process in
(59). Note that under indeterminacy 0 < j j                           1, which implies 1=                  > 1. The augmented
representation not only mechanically satis…es the Blanchard-Kahn condition, but, as proven in
Theorem 1, it describes all the set of equilibria which would be equivalently obtained using the
methodology of Lubik and Schorfheide (2003, 2004) or Farmer et al. (2015). Alternatively, when
the monetary policy adopts an “active”stance, the original system is determinate and the auxil-
iary autoregressive process is stationary (i.e. 0 < 1= < 1), thus satisfying the Blanchard-Kahn
condition under determinacy. Importantly, as shown both in this example and more generally
in Section 3, the block structure of the augmented representation ensures that the endogenous
variables contained in the vector Xt are not a function of the process ! t for both regions of the
parameter space.
We now show that the equivalence results in Section 3 hold for the NK model described by
(53)     (57). As described in the previous section, the proposed methodology de…nes a new
   9
    As shown in Appendix C, one of the roots of the system is always outside the unit circle. This implies that
the maximum degree of indeterminacy is m = 1; and that we append only one auxiliary autoregressive process.
However, it is not always possible to derive this analytical results. Under those circumstances, the number of
auxiliary processes to append to the original LRE model equals the number of expectational variable. The latter
indeed corresponds to the maximum degree of indeterminacy of the original model.

The representation in (60) always delivers a solution of the following form under both determinacy
and indeterminacy,
                                            ^ t = T^X

In what follows, we show the equivalence of our solutions under determinacy with the one from
Sims (2001), and under indeterminacy with the solution proposed by Farmer et al. (2015).


4.1    Determinacy

This section clari…es the details for the equivalence of the solutions which are obtained in the
determinacy region of the parameter space when using the following two representations:

a) The matrix representation of the model in (58) and reported here as equation (62)

                                            0 Xt   =   1 Xt 1           + "t +        t                                (62)


b) The proposed augmented representation in (60) and reported here as equation (63)

                                          ^ 0X
                                             ^t = ^ 1X
                                                     ^t             1   + ^ ^"t + ^ t :                                (63)


Representations a) and b) deliver the equilibrium conditions reported in Table 2, where
j j > 1.10 Comparing the obtained solutions, it is clear that they are equivalent. While our
augmented representation potentially allows for the sunspot shock to a¤ect the model dynamics,
the coe¢ cients which determine its impact on the endogenous variables equal zero. Moreover,
the dynamics of the endogenous variables Xt = (xt ;                                                  0
                                                                          t ; Et (xt+1 ); Et ( t+1 ))    are not a¤ected by
the autoregressive process ! t since it constitutes a separate block.


4.2    Indeterminacy

Under indeterminacy, the Blanchard-Kahn condition is not satis…ed and to solve the model we
use the solution method suggested by Farmer et al. (2015).11 The solution obtained using the

    Details on the derivation of the solutions are provided in the Appendix C.

method of Farmer et al. (2015) is equivalent to Lubik and Schorfheide (2003,2004). We use
Farmer et al. (2015) solution because easier to compare with our solution. Hence, the solutions
that we compare in this section derive from the following two representations:

To understand the equivalence result, it is useful to compare the linear restrictions imposed on
the vector of forecast errors using the augmented representation. In particular, note that our
methodology imposes the restriction        2;t   =    t.     Thus, the solution to the augmented representa-
tion sets restrictions on the forecast error,        2;t ,   (which has been rede…ned as fundamental using
the methodology of Farmer et al. (2015)) such that it corresponds to the sunspot shock,                       t.   Also,
to guarantee a bounded solution, restrictions are imposed such that the autoregressive process
! t equals zero at any time t. Therefore, the solutions for the two alternative representations are
equivalent.
Also, two relevant comments can be made. First, under indeterminacy the endogenous variables
are also a¤ected by the sunspot shock. Second, comparing the form of the matrices under determ-
inacy in Table 2 with those under indeterminacy in Table 3, it is evident that the propagation
mechanism di¤ers according to which region of the parameter space is considered.


5    Applications

While the previous section provides an analytic example clarifying the equivalence results shown
in Section 3, this section highlights the importance of our results for the estimation of LRE mod-
els. We consider the three-equation NK model of Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) and we conduct
the following exercises. Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 deal with simulated data. In particular, we
run two simulations of the model for parameter values which lie in the region of the parameter
space associated with determinacy and indeterminacy. Given the two simulations, Section 5.1
assumes that the region of determinacy is known. In Section 5.2, we then assume that the region
of determinacy is unknown. In both cases the MCMC algorithm converges to the correct area
of the parameter space. Section 5.3 then provides an example on how to implement our meth-
odology when using real data. We consider the data of Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) for the
period prior to the appointment of Chairman Paul Volcker, and we retain the assumption that
the researcher does not know the region of determinacy. We show that our method enables to
successfully recover the same posterior distributions reported by Lubik and Schorfheide (2004),
regardless of the region of the parameter space in which the estimation is initialized. Finally, we

run the estimation several times and verify that the results presented below hold across all of
them.
We consider the NK model estimated by Lubik and Schorfheide (2004). The model is described
by equations (66) (71) and consists of a dynamic IS curve

                                           xt = Et (xt+1 )                 (Rt     Et (     t+1 ))      + gt ;                                      (66)

a NK Phillips curve
                                                       t   = Et (        t+1 )   + (xt         zt ) ;                                               (67)

and a Taylor rule,

                                 Rt =          R Rt 1      + (1         R) [ 1 t   +     2 (xt          zt )] + "R;t :                              (68)




                                                                           26
The demand shock, gt , and the supply shock, zt , follow univariate AR(1) processes

                                                            gt =            g gt 1    + "g;t ;                                                         (69)
                                                            zt =            z zt 1    + "z;t ;                                                         (70)

where the standard deviations of the fundamental shocks "g;t , "z;t and "R;t are denoted by                                                            g,   z
and     R,   respectively. As in Lubik and Schorfheide (2004), we allow for the correlation between
demand and supply shocks,                     gz ,   to be nonzero. The rational expectation forecast errors are
de…ned as
                                       1;t   = xt          Et   1 [xt ] ;            2;t   =        t      Et   1 [ t] :                               (71)

                                                                                                                                                    T
We de…ne the vector of endogenous variables as Xt                                          (xt ;        t ; Rt ; Et (xt+1 ) ; Et ( t+1 ) ; gt ; zt ) ,   the
vectors of fundamental shocks and non-fundamental errors,

                                                                                                                     T
                                        "t = ("R;t ; "g;t ; "z;t )T ;                      t    =        1;t ; 2;t


and the vector of parameters

                                                                                                                            T
                              =        1;     2; R;         ; ; ;      g; z;         g;        z;   R ; gz ; gR ; zR            :

This leads to the following representation of the model,

                                             0(   )Xt =         1(    )Xt    1   + ( )"t + ( ) t :                                                     (72)

The LRE model in (72) is determinate when the following analytic condition is satis…ed, j                                                             j > 1;
                      (1   )
where            1+               2.   However, when the model is indeterminate, 0 < j                                              j   1, the system is
characterized by one degree of indeterminacy (m = 1) since there are two expectational variables
fEt (xt+1 ) ; Et (            T
                     t+1 )g       and only one root outside the unit circle. The methodology we propose
consists in augmenting the representation of the model in (72) with the autoregressive process

                                                                  1
                                                     !t =               !t       1   +      t           2;t :                                          (73)

                                                     ^t
Hence, we de…ne a new vector of endogenous variables X                                                   (Xt ; ! t )T and a newly de…ned vector
of exogenous shocks as ^"t              ("t ;          T                                         T
                                                  t)       = ("R;t ; "g;t ; "z;t ;             t) .     The system in (72) and (73) can then
be written as
                                                     ^ 0X
                                                        ^t = ^ 1X

(i.e.      = (1 + r )    1=4 ).   We then simulate the model under both determinacy and indeterminacy
and Table 4 reports the parameter values used for the simulations.12
While under determinacy we set                1   = 2:1 (thus guaranteeing j   j > 1), for the simulation under
indeterminacy we impose              1   = 0:7 for which 0 < j    j < 1. Also, under indeterminacy we use the
values for the standard deviation of the sunspot shock and its correlation with the fundamental
shocks reported in Farmer et al. (2015). Finally, Table 5 reports the prior distributions used for
the estimation exercises in the following sections.


5.1       Known region of determinacy

In this section, we assume that the region of determinacy is known. We show that our aug-
mented representation accommodates with a single framework both the case of determinacy and
indeterminacy. This feature of our solution method makes it possible for the optimization al-
gorithm to search over the entire parameter space, therefore increasing the probability of …nding
the posterior mode. As explained in An and Schorfheide (2007), the posterior mode is a crucial
object for Bayesian inference. First, the posterior mode is often used as a point estimate for
the parameters of the model. Second, it is often used as a starting point for the Metropolis-
Hastings algorithm. Finally, a scaled version of the inverse of the Hessian matrix evaluated at
  12
    The parameter values are those that we estimate in the following section using the data of Lubik and Schorf-
heide (2004) for the Pre-Volcker period. These estimates are in line with those that the authors report. Also, for
the purpose of this paper changing the values assigned to the parameters which are not directly related to the
analytic condition de…ning the region of determinacy is irrelevant.

the posterior mode is often used as the covariance matrix for the proposal distribution in the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
Since we assume that the region of determinacy j                     j > 1 is known, we set               j   j. This
assumption implies that when the model is determinate, the autoregressive process is stable and
the solution is equivalent to the solution of the original model (72). On the other hand, when the
model is indeterminate (i.e. 0 < j             j   1), the autoregressive process is unstable, satisfying the
Blanchard-Kahn condition. The assumption                        j   j enables to search for the posterior mode
over the entire parameter space.
First, we consider the simulation of the model under determinacy, and we compute the posterior
mode of the model parameters using three di¤erent representations of the Lubik and Schorfheide
(2004) model. We consider the augmented representation proposed in this paper, the representa-
tion of the model under determinacy using Sims’(2001) algorithm, and the representation of the
model under indeterminacy using the methodology of Farmer et al. (2015).13 Figure 1 reports

considers the augmented representation, panel (b) and (c) report the plots for the representations
under model determinacy and indeterminacy, respectively.
The red dots on the horizontal axis in panel b) and c) indicate parameter values for which,
given the chosen model representation, the model could not be solved due to a violation of the
Blanchard-Kahn condition. While in panel b) the model violates these conditions for values of
the parameter      1      smaller than 1, panel c) shows that the representation of Farmer et al. (2015)
does not allow to solve the model for values of         1   greater than 1.14 Figure 1 highlights that the
augmented representation guarantees that the optimization algorithm explores the entire domain
of the parameter space. Note that as pointed out by Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) the posterior
presents a discrete jump between the two parameter regions. This makes it unlikely that once
the correct region of the parameter space is reached, the estimation algorithm will leave such
region. We will further elaborate on this point in Section 6.
Similarly, when using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, candidate parameter values can be
drawn from both the determinacy and the indeterminacy region. However, once the algorithm
converges to the “correct”area of the parameter space, it is unlikely to leave it. This is re‡ected

the simulation. Indeed, the term (1 ) 2    0, thus implying that the region of determinacy is approximated by

in Table 6, that reports the mean and the 90% probability interval of the posterior distribu-
tions.15 The posterior estimates indicate that the true parameter values are recovered under the
augmented representation. All the parameter values used to simulate the model fall within the
90% probability intervals of the posterior distributions.
We perform the same estimation exercise using the simulation of the model under indeterminacy.
Figure 2 plots how the posterior varies with            1   while the other parameters are constant at their
posterior mode estimates. As before, the vertical line reports the corresponding posterior mode.
Figure 2 provides similar evidence as in Figure 1. Panel (a), panel (b) and panel (c) refer to the
augmented representation and the representation under determinacy and under indeterminacy,
respectively.
Contrary to the alternative representations, the proposed augmented representation ensures to
run the optimization routine to compute the posterior mode over the entire parameter space.
Reasonably, the shape of the maximized functions in panel (a) of Figure 2 mirrors the plot of panel
(a) in Figure 1, with the di¤erence that now the peak for the posterior occurs in the indeterminacy
region. Table 7 reports the mean and 90% probability of the posterior distribution. Also in this
case, we recover the true parameter values by using the proposed augmented representation. Since
the posterior estimates indicate that the model is characterized by indeterminacy, we report the
standard error of the sunspot shock,             , and its covariance with the fundamental shocks (i.e.
  R;    g;     z ).
  15
     Since the posterior estimates satisfy the analytic condition for determinacy, the endogenous variables, Xt , are
not a function of the sunspot shock and we therefore do not report the estimates of the standard error of the
sunspot shock and its correlation with the fundamental shocks.

5.2    Unknown region of determinacy

In this section, we assume that the region of determinacy, j               j > 1, is unknown. By considering
this case, we show that our methodology can be used to study LRE models for which it is non-
trivial to derive an analytic condition describing the region of determinacy. Thus, the approach
allows a researcher to estimate medium- and large-scale LRE models that could potentially
be characterized by indeterminacy. Our methodology allows the researcher to conduct Bayesian
inference on the model parameters over the entire parameter space and to compute their posterior
estimates which could potentially lie in both regions of determinacy and indeterminacy.
The assumption that the region of determinacy is unknown implies that it is no longer possible to
impose        j   j. To ensure that the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm explores the entire parameter
space, we assume a uniform distribution over the interval [0; 2] as a prior distribution for the
parameter      .16 Equivalently, we assume that there is an equal probability of making draws of
  from the interval [0; 1) as well as from the interval [1; 2]. Draws of                      from [1; 2] combined
with draws of the other parameters            which satisfy the condition j             j > 1 ensure to solve the
augmented representation under determinacy. Similarly, draws of                        from [0; 1) combined with
draws of the other parameters of interest           such that 0 < j        j      1 ensure to solve the proposed
  16
     The choice of the interval [0; 2] is arbitrary. For any value 0 < a       1, it is su¢ cient to specify an interval

Importantly, the same intuition described in Section 5.1 still holds. The Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm makes draws of            and     which could solve the augmented representation under de-
terminacy and indeterminacy, and it compares the posterior obtained for draws in both regions.
Having speci…ed the prior for , we estimate the augmented representation using the same two
simulations of the data as in Section 5.1. We …rst estimate the augmented representation of the
model using the data simulated under determinacy and the same prior distributions reported in
Table 5.
The posterior distribution for the parameter              is plotted in Figure 3. Two remarks should be
made. First, the posterior distribution is distributed over the interval [1; 2], thus providing evid-
ence that the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm explores the entire parameter space and successfully
recovers the information contained in the simulated data about model determinacy. Second, the
posterior distribution approximates a uniform distribution over the same interval. This result is
in line with the non-identi…ability of the parameter            stated in Corollary 3. Finally, the posterior
mean and 90% probability intervals of the parameters are the same as those reported in Table
6 when we assume that the region of determinacy is known. As in Section 5.1, the estimation
procedure conducted on our augmented representation recovers the true parameter values. Also
in this case, the results are independent of the initial parametrization used to start the algorithm.
Regardless of whether the starting parametrization is in the ’correct’region, the estimation al-

    The virtue of using a continuous distribution for and treating it as any other parameter of the model is that
the algorithm can be easily implemented in Dynare. However, the e¢ ciency of the algorithm could be improved
by using a discrete distribution for given that the only thing that matters is if this parameter is inside or outside
the unit circle. Furthermore, the MCMC algorithm could be modi…ed to allow for the possibility that whenever
the augmented model does not have a solution, the value of is ‡ipped.

gorithm successfully recovers the true parameter values used for the simulations. However, the
speed of the convergence for the parameter estimates might be a¤ected.
The estimation of the augmented representation using simulated data under indeterminacy de-
livers a mirrored posterior distribution for the parameter    (Figure 4). In this case, the posterior
distribution of the parameter      is distributed over the interval [0; 1) and it closely resembles a
uniform distribution over the same interval due to its non-identi…ability. As for the simulation
under determinacy, we obtain the same posterior mean and the 90% probability interval as for
the case of a known region of determinacy reported in Table 7. Hence, also when we assume that
the region is unknown to the researcher, we recover the true parameter values by estimating the
augmented representation.


5.3   Indeterminacy in the 1970s

This section provides an example on how to implement our methodology when using real data.
We retain the assumption that the researcher does not know the region of determinacy, and
we show that our method enables the algorithm to jump across the regions of determinacy and

indeterminacy, thus facilitating the search for the global maximum in the marginal data density.
We consider both the model and the data that Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) use to test for
indeterminacy in U.S. monetary policy. The model is described by equations (66) (71) at the
beginning of Section 5 and, as previously explained, we append the process in (73) to obtain
the augmented representation that we propose. Finally, equation (75) presents the measurement
equations that link the endogenous variables of the model to the data. In the following, we focus
on the data for the pre-Volcker period (1960Q1 - 1979Q2) since Lubik and Schorfheide (2004)
show that during this period the monetary authority did not respond aggressively enough to
changes in in‡ation, thus not suppressing self-ful…lling in‡ation expectations.
We proceed by starting the algorithm from initial conditions in both regions of the parameter
space and by allowing for a large number of draws.18 We veri…ed that this approach guarantees
the proper convergence of the posterior distributions for any initial parametrization by repeating
this estimation exercise 100 times and successfully recovering the same posterior estimates in
each case. Figure 5 reports the posterior distribution for both                 1   and   which clearly favor
the indeterminate model regardless of the initial values for the parameters.19 Table 8 reports
the corresponding posterior mean and 90% probability interval of the model parameters. As
expected, the estimates obtained using our procedure are in line with the empirical results in
Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) that we report in the …rst column.20
  18
     In particular, we run two chains of 1,000,000 each and discard the …rst half of the draws.
  19
     The prior that we used for the parameter 1 is the same as in Table 5 and is de…ned on both regions of
determinacy and indeterminacy. This is important for the possibility of the posterior estimates to lie in either
region since having a prior distribution which assigns zero probability to either one would also imply that the
posterior would have no mass in the same region.

6    Tips for implementation

In this section, we present some suggestions for the practical implementation of our method.
Convergence. We repeat the estimation of the model of Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) by using
parameters in the “wrong” region of the parameter space and considering only a few (200,000)
draws to show the importance of checking convergence before interpreting the estimation results.
Figure 6 reports the posterior distribution for the parameter               1   and   obtained for an initial
parametrization close to the Taylor Principle (i.e. we set          1   = 1:1). At …rst glance, the posterior
distribution of the parameter       1   would appear to be bimodal. This is consistent with the fact that
the proposed augmented representation allows the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to visit both

supply shocks, gz , derives from the prior distribution that we assume for this parameter. While Lubik and
Schorfheide (2004) assume a normal prior centered at 0 and with standard deviation 0:4, we assume a ‡at, uniform
distribution over the interval ( 1; 1). Nevertheless, both in Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) and in this paper, the
estimate of gz is not statistically signi…cant.

regions of the parameter space. At the same time, the posterior distribution for the parameter
  is very similar to the prior distribution, which is speci…ed as a uniform distribution over the
interval [0; 2]. Such a result is just the other side of coin of the posterior for   1   since the algorithm
explores both regions by considering draws of       which are within as well as outside the unit circle.

Figure 6: Initial parametrization 1 = 1:1. The grey line represents the prior distribution and
the black line is the posterior distribution.

A researcher should then verify the occurrence of either of the following two circumstances. This
bimodal distribution could arise because the log-likelihood is highly discontinuous between the
two regions. In this case, the algorithm could have jumped towards the region where the peak
of the posterior lies, without having spent a signi…cant time there. In other words, convergence
has not occurred yet. Alternatively, if the log-likelihood function varies smoothly between the
two regions of the parameter space, the posterior distribution plotted in Figure 6 could be the
result of the algorithm travelling across the two regions multiple times.
We therefore recommend the researcher to analyze the draws of the parameter                which have been
accepted during the MCMC algorithm. By inspecting the behavior of the auxiliary parameter
 , a researcher can detect if the algorithm reached convergence or not. We report the draws
that we obtained during our exercise in Figure 7. After approximately 40,000 draws of                 in the
region of determinacy (i.e. outside the unit circle), the algorithm jumps to the indeterminate
region and never visits the determinacy region again.
Figure 6 and 7 suggest that we are in the …rst case, for which the log-likelihood function is
highly discontinuous at the boundary between the two regions. Therefore, the researcher should
repeat the estimation exercise, increase the number of draws, and make sure that the parameter
  stabilizes on one region of the parameter space. Under di¤erent circumstances, the researcher
could face the second scenario, for which the log-likelihood function transitions smoothly between
the two regions. In this case, the parameter       would repeatedly transition between the two areas

of the parameter space and could be used to infer the probability attached to determinacy.
Only (in)determinacy. In some cases, a researcher might want to estimate the model exclus-
ively under determinacy or exclusively under indeterminacy. Our approach easily accommodates
this need. If the researcher is only interested in the solution under determinacy, the parameter
vector of alpha should be chosen in a way to guarantee stationarity of the auxiliary process (for
example, …xing all values of the alphas to 2). Furthermore, all parameters that are relevant only
under indeterminacy could be …xed to zero or any other constant, given that they do not a¤ect
the …t of the model under determinacy. If instead the researcher is only interested in estimating
the model under indeterminacy, the parameters of the auxiliary process can be chosen in a way to
guarantee that the correct number of explosive roots are provided. In this case, the parameters
describing the properties of the sunspot disturbances should also be estimated.
Model comparison. A researcher might also be interested in comparing the …t of the model
under determinacy and under indeterminacy. Model comparison can be conducted by using
standard techniques, such as the harmonic mean estimator proposed by Geweke (1999). If the
researcher is interested in comparing the same model under determinacy and under indeterm-
inacy, we recommend the following procedure that adapts the approach used by Lubik and
Schorfheide (2004):

  1. Estimate the model under determinacy by …xing the parameter(s) alpha to a value larger
     than one in a way that the model is solved only under determinacy. Note that in this case
     all parameters that pertain to the solution under indeterminacy, such as the volatility of the
     sunspot shocks, should be restricted to zero (or any other constant). This restriction avoids
     penalizing the model for extra parameters that do not a¤ect its …t under determinacy.

  2. Estimate the model under indeterminacy by …xing the parameter(s) alpha to a value smaller
     than one in a way that the model is solved only under indeterminacy. Note that in this

                                                    39
      case all parameters that pertain to the solution under indeterminacy, such as the volatility
      of the sunspot shocks, should be estimated.

    3. Use standard methods to compare the …t of the model under determinacy with the …t of
      the same model under indeterminacy.


7     Conclusions

In this paper, we propose a generalized approach to solve and estimate LRE models over the entire
parameter space. Our approach accommodates both cases of determinacy and indeterminacy
and it does not require the researcher to know the analytic condition describing the region of
determinacy or the degrees of indeterminacy.
When a LRE model is characterized by m degrees of indeterminacy, our approach augments it
by appending m autoregressive processes whose innovations are linear combinations of a subset
of endogenous shocks and a vector of newly de…ned sunspot shocks. The resulting augmented
representation embeds both the solution which is obtained under determinacy using standard
solution methods and that delivered by solving the model under indeterminacy using the approach
of Lubik and Schorfheide (2003) and equivalently Farmer et al. (2015). We provide an analytical
example for the theoretical result using a canonical NK model.
We …nally apply our methodology to the NK model in Lubik and Schorfheide (2004). We simulate
two series of data under the assumption of model determinacy and indeterminacy and we then
estimate our augmented representation for both cases in which the region of determinacy is
known or unknown to the researcher. In both case, the parameters used to generate the data are
correctly recovered independently of the initial parametrization. This shows that our method is
suitable for the estimation of medium- and large-size DSGE model for which the determinacy
region is generally unknown. This feature of the solution method is used by Nicolò (2017) to
study the possibility of multiple solutions in Smets and Wouters (2007).

8     Appendix

8.1     Appendix A

In this Appendix, we show how the normalization chosen in Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) maps
into the methodology we propose. Recall the following notation: p denotes number of expect-
ational variables, n is the number of explosive roots and m = (p                                           n) are the corresponding
degrees of indeterminacy.
As in Lubik and Schorfheide (2004), consider the following structural model

                                       0(   )Xt =       1(    )Xt      1   + ( )"t + ( )               t                         (76)

where Xt is the vector of endogenous variables, "t is the vector of exogenous shocks,                                       t   is the
vector of endogenous shocks and we assume that the matrix                                      0   is invertible. The system can
therefore be written as
                                       Xt =        1(   )Xt    1   +        ( )"t +          ( )   t                             (77)

Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) …nd that, if it exists, the solution to express the forecast errors as
a function of the exogenous shocks "t and sunspot shocks                                 t   takes the form


                         t   =      V1 D111 U1T ~ 2                ~
                                                              + V2 M                "t   + V2 M      t :
                       p 1         p n n n n nn `                  p mm `          ` 1        p mm mm 1


More compactly,
                               t
                                                    ~ "t + V 2 M
                                   = V 1 N "t + V 2 M                                        t ;                                 (78)
                             p 1        p nn ` ` 1            p mm `` 1               p mm mm 1

where
                                            N( )              D111 ( )U1T ( ) ~ 2 ( ):
                                             n `               n n           n n      n `

is a function of the parameters of the model.
Combining (77) with (78), the solution that appears in eq. (26) of their paper is

          Xt =    1(   )Xt    1   +[        ( )+        ( )V1 ( )N ( )] "t +                            ~ "t + M
                                                                                              ( )V2 ( ) M              t         (79)




Determinacy Under determinacy, Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) show that V2 ( ) = 0. Hence,
the endogenous variables only respond to exogenous shocks. From (79) the solution is


                                                                   43
                            Xt =             1(   )Xt    1   +[       ( )+      ( )V1 ( )N ( )] "t                             (80)

Using the augmented representation that we propose in this paper, the solution under determ-
inacy is equivalent to (80). Indeed, we are appending a stationary process which constitutes a
separate block and does not interact with the endogenous variables of the model.



Indeterminacy Under indeterminacy, Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) show that V2 ( ) 6= 0 and
the endogenous variables not only respond to exogenous shocks but also to the sunspot shock                                      t.
Their solution is in eq. (79) and reported below

         Xt =                                                                                        ~ "t + M
                1(   )Xt    1   +[           ( )+         ( )V1 ( )N ( )] "t +             ( )V2 ( ) M                 t   :   (81)

Now we consider the solution under indeterminacy that we obtain using our methodology. Also
in our case we assume that           0   is invertible and the system in (76) can be written as

                                     Xt =           1(   )Xt      1   +    ( )"t +        ( ) t:                               (82)

Nevertheless, we can show that, if it exists, the solution to express to the endogenous shocks as
a function of the exogenous shocks "t and sunspot shocks                              t   takes the form

                                                    t   = C1 ( ) " t + C2 ( )     t :                                          (83)

Combining (82) and (83), we obtain the following reduced form

                     Xt =       1(   )Xt      1   +[         ( )+         ( )C1 ( )] "t +           ( )C2 ( ) t :              (84)


Identi…cation    As shown in the previous section, the solution under indeterminacy provided
by Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) is derived by combining the following system of equations

                                     Xt =           1(   )Xt      1   +     ( )"t +       ( )   t                              (85)

with the solution for the endogenous shocks as a function of the exogenous shocks "t and the


                                                                      44
sunspot shock    t


                        t
                                                          ~ "t + V 2 ( ) M
                                = V1 ( )N ( ) "t + V2 ( ) M                                      t ;                       (86)
                      p 1           p n      n ` ` 1           p m m `` 1                p m m mm 1


Similarly, the solution obtained using our methodology is derived by combining the same system
of equations in (85) with our solution for the endogenous shocks

                                              t   = C 1 ( ) "t + C 2 ( )     t :                                           (87)
                                            p 1        p l ` 1          p m m 1


So, in order to understand how the identi…cation strategy implemented in Lubik and Schorfheide
(2004) maps into our solution, we only have to study the solutions for the endogenous shocks
expressed in (86) and (87).

Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) consider a three equation NK model for which the degree of
indeterminacy is at most 1 (i.e. m = 1). This implies that M ;                              t   and   t   are scalars. Moreover,
the authors assume the following two normalizations

                                                      E("t 0t ) = 0;                                                       (88)
                                                           M         = 1:                                                  (89)



To understand the mapping of these normalizations, we equate the RHS of (86) and (87),


                                           ~ "t + V2 M
                                 V1 N + V2 M                           t    = C 1 "t + C 2 t :                             (90)

Pre-multiplying by V20 and recalling that the matrix V2 is orthonormal,

                                M   t   =     V20 C1       V20 V1 N         ~ " t + V 0 C2 t :
                                                                            M                                              (91)
                                                                                     2


                          0
Post-multiplying by       t,   we take expectation and consider the normalization in (88) to obtain

                                                       2
                                                  M        =     V20 C2              :                                     (92)

                          !
Noting that      V20 C2        is also a scalar
                1 pp 1


                                                                  M          2
                                                           =                     :                                         (93)
                                                                (V20 C2 )

                                                                45
So, the normalization in (88) corresponds to specify a relationship between the covariance of the
sunspot shock introduced in Lubik and Schorfheide (2004),                                       t,   and the sunspot shock that we
specify in our methodology,            t,   with the standard deviation of the sunspot shock,                              t,   scaled by
M . Therefore, the normalization M = 1 in (89) is such that the relationship in (93) becomes

                                                                               1
                                                                =    V20 C2         2
                                                                                        :                                            (94)

In this section, we provide the derivation for the solutions under the two alternative representa-

a) Under determinacy, it is possible to use standard solution algorithms, such as Sims (2001).

Consider the three equations NK model in (53) (55) and reported below as equations (101) (105)

                                      xt = Et (xt+1 )                         (Rt       Et (xt+1 ))                                         (101)

The LRE model can be written in the following matrix form

                                              0 Xt   =        1 Xt 1        + zt +              t;                                          (106)

where Xt = (xt ;                              T                                                                 T
                   t ; Et (xt+1 ); Et ( t+1 )) ,          "t = ("R;t ) and              t   =(       1;t ; 2;t ) .

The solution to (106) can be found following four steps. First, since the matrix                                              0   is non-singular,
the LRE model in (106) can be written as

                                              Xt =       1 Xt 1        +         "t +           t;                                          (107)

Third, restrictions which eliminate the explosive dynamics of the system have to be imposed.
Under determinacy both roots of (111) are unstable, which requires to impose the following

Fourth, the restrictions imposed on the endogenous variables and on the forecast errors are
combined with the equations which de…ne the remaining endogenous variables, that is (108) and
(109). This implies
  21                                                                                      1
     The Jordan decomposition of the matrix A is A                             J J            , where the diagonal elements of the matrix             are
the roots of the system.

The proposed methodology consists in appending to the original LRE model the following equa-

exogenous shocks ^"t          ("t ; vt   )T   =   ("R;t ; vt )T , the augmented representation of                                 the LRE model is

Given (116), the same steps are followed to obtain the solution to the system. First, the system
in (116) is pre-multiplied by ^ 1 to obtain
                                          0

  22
     Note that m = 1, thus implying that only one equation should be appended. Also, since Farmer et al. (2015)
show that the choice of which forecast errors should be rede…ned as fundamental, it is without loss of generality
that we consider the case when 2;t is rede…ned.

In Section 4.2, the NK model is indeterminate and the derivations for the solutions under two
alternative representations are provided.

c) To select a unique, bounded rational expectation equilibrium, we follow the solution method
        suggested by Farmer et al. (2015) when the forecast error for the deviations of in‡ation from
        its steady state is included as newly de…ned fundamental shock. De…ning ~"t = ("t ;                                                                   T

outside the unit circle, under indeterminacy it is the case that j                                                             1j   > 1 and j   2j   < 1. This

d) The derivation of the solution provided by the proposed methodology when the model is
     indeterminate closely follows the one described in Appendix B, part b). In particular,
     the …rst two steps of the solution method are equivalent and, recalling the de…nition of
     ^    ( t ; ! t )T = (Et (xt+1 ); Et ( t+1 ); ! t )T and ^"t ("t ; vt )T = ("R;t ; vt )T , equation (121) is

It is however important to note that under indeterminacy not only j                                     1j   > 1 and j   2j   < 1 as in
representation c), but also j   3j   = (1= ) = (1= ) > 1. Hence, the third steps imposes restrictions
on the …rst two equations of (134), which result in the following conditions
