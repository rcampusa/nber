Who Gentrifies Low-Income Neighborhoods?

                                               ABSTRACT

This paper uses confidential Census data, specifically the 1990 and 2000 Census Long Form data,
to study the demographic processes underlying the gentrification of low-income urban neighborhoods
during the 1990's. In contrast to previous studies, the analysis is conducted at the more refined census-tract
level with a narrower definition of gentrification and more closely matched comparison neighborhoods.
The analysis is also richly disaggregated by demographic characteristic, uncovering differential patterns
by race, education, age and family structure that would not have emerged in the more aggregate analysis
in previous studies. The results provide no evidence of displacement of low-income non-white households
in gentrifying neighborhoods. The bulk of the increase in average family income in gentrifying neighborhoods
is attributed to black high school graduates and white college graduates. The disproportionate retention
and income gains of the former and the disproportionate in-migration of the latter are distinguishing
characteristics of gentrifying U.S. urban neighborhoods in the 1990's.

I. Introduction



        “Concern, and anger, over gentrification has grown in communities across the country
        as housing rental and sales prices have soared .… there are numerous reports of resident
        displacement from neighborhoods long ignored that now attract higher-income
        households.”1

                 -2006 Urban Institute Report


        Over the past several decades, there has been substantial gentrification of low-income

neighborhoods in many U.S. urban areas. These neighborhoods typically experience large

increases in household income and housing prices. Some laud the revitalization of decayed

neighborhoods and others criticize the displacement of low-income, often minority, households.

The distribution of benefits from neighborhood change is a crucial policy issue. Since 1974 the

U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has allocated nearly $120 Billion

in Community Development Block Grants.2 These grants, that are intended to benefit low and

moderate-income individuals by eliminating slums or blight and addressing urgent community

development needs, have been allocated to more than 1000 U.S. cities. While public investment

in neighborhood revitalization is ubiquitous, the consequences of neighborhood gentrification for

low-income and minority individuals remain an open question.

        Advocacy groups for low-income neighborhoods in cities across the U.S. have raised

concerns about a potential link between gentrification and the displacement of existing low

income and/or minority residents. In contrast, potential displacement from gentrifying

  This figure understates the actual level of federal expenditures targeted to Urban Renewal. Community
Development Block Grant (CDBGs) comprise a relatively small portion of HUD’s budget (for FY 2008, CDBGs
represented $3.9 Billion of HUDs overall budget authority of $40.4 Billion). A significant portion of HUD’s
remaining budget is spent on programs that either directly or indirectly promote community development. Sources:.

neighborhoods does not appear to be a major concern for HUD.3 Given the high levels of public

investment in improving neighborhood quality, it is important to understand which of these two

policy perspectives accurately reflects the impacts of neighborhood gentrification vis-à-vis

displacement of low-income households. Further, missing from this debate on displacement is

consideration of both the role of in-migrants and the impacts of gentrification on households that

remain in gentrifying neighborhoods.

         Surprisingly, many questions regarding the distributional impacts of gentrification remain

unanswered. Some recent studies have examined the issue of displacement, and have found little

to suggest that low-income households exit gentrifying neighborhoods any faster than they exit

other neighborhoods. These studies, however, have been severely constrained by data

limitations. As a result they either define neighborhoods as rather large geographic areas

(regions on the order of 100,000+ in population), use overly broad definitions of gentrification,

and/or focus on a single location – raising issues about what broader inferences can be drawn

from their results.4 Even less is known about the role of in-migration in gentrification and the

impact of gentrification on residents who remain in neighborhoods that experience gentrification.

         In this paper we take advantage of confidential Census data, specifically the 1990 and

2000 Census Long Form Data, to provide the richest study of gentrification to date. Overall, we

find that rather than dislocating non-white households, gentrification creates neighborhoods that

are attractive to middle-class minority households, particularly those with children or with

  While no precise consensus definition exists, neighborhoods are typically described as gentrifying if they: (i) are
urban, (ii) were previously low-income, and (iii) experience large increases in household income and housing prices.
In this paper we will define a gentrifying neighborhood as an existing urban neighborhood that had relatively low
average income in 1990 and experienced large increases in average income over the 1990s. We will give a more
precise definition below, after we have defined our samples. For a descriptive analysis that documents the
significant scale of gentrification in the 1990s see Ellen and O’Regan (2008)


                                                         2
elderly householders. Furthermore, there is evidence that gentrification may even increases

incomes for these same households.

       Our specific findings are: 1) In-migration of college graduates, particularly white college

graduates under 40 without children, is a key characteristic of a gentrifying neighborhood; 2)

The presence of children, an elderly householder or a householder with low educational

attainment dampens the likelihood that a white household moves into a gentrifying

neighborhood, but these same effects are not present, or even reversed, for black and Hispanic

households; 3) We finds no evidence of disproportionate exit of low-education or minority

householders, but do find evidence that gentrifying neighborhoods disproportionately retain

black householders with a high school degree; 4) Decomposition of the total income gains in

gentrifying neighborhoods attributes the bulk of the gains to two key groups: black high school

graduates (due to disproportionate retention and income gains) and white college graduates (due

to disproportionate in-migration and high incomes).

       The strength of our analysis relative to previous work stems largely from the use of

confidential census data. We highlight four key benefits from the use of this data that allow us to

provide a much more detailed analysis of gentrifying neighborhoods than previous studies.

First, we have the refined geographic detail, geographic coverage, and sample size to better

define the set of gentrifying neighborhoods. Second, these same data characteristics allow us to

better define a set of comparison neighborhoods, specifically other neighborhoods within the

same CMSA that have comparable incomes in 1990 or 2000. Third, we are able to identify

movers and stayers using the more detailed information on length of residence provided in the

confidential census. Fourth, we disaggregate by demographic characteristic in much more detail

than previous analysis. This uncovers differential patterns by race, education, age and family

structure that would not have emerged in the more aggregate analysis in previous studies.


                                                 3
II. Literature Review

       The literature most closely related to our current study is that on the link between

gentrification and out-migration in low-income neighborhoods. This literature investigates

whether there is empirical evidence to support the widely held belief that gentrification causes

the displacement of low-income minorities from their neighborhoods. The most recent studies,

although constrained by data limitations, find little evidence of displacement.

       Vigdor (2002) studies gentrification in the Boston metro area using American Housing

Survey (AHS) data from 1974-93 which identify “zones” of 100,000 to 200,000 individuals (The

city of Boston contains 5 zones). He finds no evidence that low-income households are more

likely to exit the current housing unit if they are located in a gentrifying zone. Freeman and

Braconi (2004) conduct a similar study of gentrification in New York City in the 1990’s using

specialized data collected as part of the city’s rent regulation policy. The data identify 55

subborough areas of approximately 46,000 households and 131,000 persons each. Identifying

seven neighborhoods in Manhattan and Brooklyn that gentrified during the 90’s, they find that

low-income households in the gentrifying neighborhoods were less likely to move than low-

income households in non-gentrifying neighborhoods.

       Freeman (2005) extends this work to a sample of U.S. neighborhoods using the geocoded

version of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), which identifies Census tract of

residence. A Census tract is a relatively permanent geographic unit designed to be as

homogenous as possible with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living

conditions at the time it is established. Census tracts generally contain between 1,000 and 8,000

people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. The PSID, therefore, allow Freeman to analyze a

much larger set of neighborhoods at a much more refined level of geographic detail. Sample size

constraints, however, require he take a rather broad definition of gentrification. It is probably a


                                                 4
result of this broad definition that his set of gentrifying neighborhoods actually experience a

$4,000 decrease in median household income during the 1990’s.5 He again finds little evidence

that gentrification is associated with displacement of low-income households.

         The above discussion of these three recent studies highlights the data issues that plague

research on residential mobility and gentrification. Data constraints typically have restricted

analysis to individual cities and/or to studies in which the identified neighborhoods are

unsatisfactorily large in size. The exception, Freeman (2005), conducted with PSID data, has

insufficient sample size to restrict the sample to the relatively small set of census tracts that are

both initially low-income and experience large and rapid income growth in a given time period.

Our use of confidential Census Long Form data allows us to circumvent these data issues as we

have a very large, nationally representative sample that identifies census tract of residence.

         Our analysis is related to the above three studies. However, rather than just focus on

households that exit gentrifying neighborhoods, we also investigate who moves into gentrifying

neighborhoods and what happens to the fortunes of households that remain in gentrifying

neighborhoods. While hampered by data limitations, the analysis to date suggests that

gentrification is not associated with unusual levels of out-migration of the existing low-income,

often non-white, residents. In other words, there is a high rate of residential mobility in the U.S.,

and there is little evidence that the rates are significantly higher in gentrifying neighborhoods.

These results suggest the characteristics of the in-migrants, and potentially the outcomes for

stayers, are critical components to understanding the process of gentrification. These two issues

5
  Freeman’s most restrictive definition of gentrified neighborhood is one that meets 1) is a central city
neighborhood, with 2) median income in previous census below the metro area’s 40th percentile, 3)proportion
housing built in last 20 years in the previous census below the metro area’s 40th percentile, 4) above median growth
in educational attainment in the intercensal period, and 5) an increase in real housing prices in the intercensal period.
While the neighborhoods that are categorized as gentrifying in the 90’s have a decrease in median household income
between 1990 and 2000, the neighborhoods that are categorized as gentrifying in the 80’s do experience an increase
in median income between 1980 and 1990.

have received almost no attention in the academic literature. Freeman and Braconi (2004) and

Freeman (2005) provide descriptive statistics that indicate that in-movers to gentrifying

neighborhoods are more likely to be white, college-educated, and higher income than in-movers

to non-gentrifying neighborhoods, but no formal multivariate analysis is conducted. We are

aware of no research addressing the issue of the impact of gentrification on the fortunes of stayer

households.

       Finally, there are two additional related literatures that warrant discussion, one on

mobility between high and low-income neighborhoods, and the other on how neighborhood

characteristics predict neighborhood change.

       The literature that studies mobility between neighborhoods as a function of individual

and neighborhood characteristics is relatively large. Much of this research is conducted with the

geocoded PSID, which records census tract of residence. Sample size constraints are less

problematic in this literature, as there are far more observations of, for example, households

moving in and out of the entire set of low income neighborhoods than in and out of the subset of

gentrifying neighborhoods. Two of the most recent and relevant papers are Crowder and South

(2005) and South, Crowder and Chavez (2005). While the primary focus of these papers is the

migration of households from low-income to higher-income neighborhoods, they also examine

movement from higher-income to low-income neighborhoods. While both Crowder and South

(2005) and South, Crowder and Chavez (2005) find that white households are far less likely to

move from higher-income to low-income neighborhoods than black or Latino households,

Crowder and South (2005) document that the rate of movement from higher-income to low-

income neighborhoods increased disproportionately for white households during the 1980’s and

1990’s, particularly for high-income white households. They suggest this is related to the

gentrification of low-income neighborhoods that occurred during the same time period.


                                                 6
       There is also a substantial literature on how current neighborhood characteristics predict

neighborhood change. One recent example is Card, Mas and Rothstein (Forthcoming), which

estimates racial “tipping points,” points at which the concentration of non-white households is

sufficiently high that the neighborhood will “tip,” generating an exodus of white households.

Two recent studies that specifically address neighborhood growth and renewal are Brueckner and

Rosenthal (Forthcoming) and Rosenthal (Forthcoming). Both papers argue that age of housing

stock is a key determinant of neighborhood growth. As a neighborhood’s housing stock ages,

richer households exit for neighborhoods with newer housing and are replaced by lower-income

households. Eventually, the housing stock ages to the point it is ripe for re-development, at

which the neighborhood gentrifies and rich households return. Both papers provide analysis to

suggest that aged housing stock is an important predictor of gentrification. An alternative view

provided by Coulson and Bond (1990) suggests that is square footage, not age of housing per se,

which predicts residential turnover.

III. Data

       This section describes how the analysis sample and key variables are constructed using

1990 and 2000 Census data. The data are constructed in 2 stages. First, 1990 and 2000 Census

tracts are linked and a sample of urban census tracts are selected. Next, tract-level variables are

constructed. These tract-level characteristics are used to select the set of tracts in the analysis

sample and to identify tracts that gentrified between 1990 and 2000. In the second stage, the

sample of householders that reside in the tracts in the analysis sample is drawn from the 2000

data, and household-level variables are created.

A. Census Demographic Long Form Data

       The analysis in this paper uses the 1990 and 2000 Decennial Census Long Form Data.

These are confidential data products of the U.S. Census Bureau that can only be accessed from a


                                                   7
Census Research Data Center (CRDC).6 The Long Form Data contain the population of

households that respond to the Long Form survey in the Decennial Census, which is

administered to a 1-in-6 sample of all households in the U.S. The samples include 14.3 million

households and 38.6 million individuals in the year 1990 and 16.6 million households and 43.5

million individuals in the year 2000.

         The analysis in this paper would not be possible with publicly available data. The Public

Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) contain a random sample of household-level responses from the

Decennial Long Form surveys, but only identify geographic location down to the level of Public

Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs), which are areas of at least 100,000 people. In contrast, the

confidential Long Form data identify census tracts that, as described above, contain an average

of 4,000 individuals.7 There are also public Census data sets that report aggregate census tract-

level characteristics based on the Long Form data. These tabulated data, however, are not

sufficiently disaggregated for the purposes of our analysis. For example, they do not

disaggregate by the migration status of the household, which is a key variable in our analysis.

B. Census Geography and Sample Criteria

         While census tracts are designed to be relatively permanent geographic units, they do

change over time as neighborhoods evolve and as tract populations increase or decrease.

Therefore, the census tracts must be linked between the 1990 and 2000 Censuses. Census Tract

Relationship Files from the U.S. Census Bureau show how 1990 census tracts relate to 2000

census tracts. Using this information, we developed a concordance file that creates


6
  All analysis for this paper was conducted at the Triangle Census Research Data Center (TCRDC) at Duke
University.
7
  The census block, an even smaller geographic unit, is also identified. Because, however, CRDC researchers are
not currently allowed to link census data over time at the block level, and because the tract more closely relates to
our concept of neighborhood, we conduct our analysis at the tract level. Using survey data, Lee and Campbell
(1990) find that self reported neighborhoods of residence on average cover 15 square blocks. This finding suggests
that census tracts offer a reasonable neighborhood definition for urban areas.


                                                          8
neighborhood definitions that are unique and consistent across the two census years. If, for

example, a 1990 tract split into two tracts in 2000, the two 2000 tracts were merged into a single

neighborhood that would be consistent with the original 1990 tract. There were some cases of

overlapping tract splits and merges, which required that we aggregate over several tracts to

obtain one consistent neighborhood.8 In this paper, the terms neighborhood and census tract will

refer to these census tract groupings that we have linked between 1990 and 2000.

        We select our sample of census tracts for analysis by first focusing on Consolidated

Metropolitan Statistical Areas (CMSAs) as defined by the Census Bureau. We select only those

CMSAs in the continental U.S. with populations of at least 500,000 in 1990, producing a sample

of 72 CMSAs. Most CMSAs include some areas that are very rural and in which census tracts

cover very large geographic areas. For this reason, we further refine our sample. The Census

Bureau has compiled a list of incorporated places with populations of 100,000 or more in 1990.

We only include tracts from the 72 largest CMSAs that are within a 5km buffer of one of these

large incorporated places. This effectively selects off the more densely populated areas of the

CMSAs, and excludes some of the less-populous CMSAs that do not contain a single Census

place. Our final sample consists of 15,040 linked tracts from 64 CMSAs. A list of included

CMSAs appears in Appendix A

C. Definition of Gentrification and Comparison Groups

        Table 1 provides some descriptive statistics on income and income change for our sample

of 15,040 urban area tracts, by quintile of average family income in 1990.9 The construction of

the family income variable is described below in section D. The most interesting result in

Table 1 is that the bottom quintile of neighborhoods has median income growth substantially


8
  82% of the constructed time-consistent neighborhoods contain only one 2000 census tract, and 94% contain no
more than two 2000 census tracts.
9
  All income figures are reported in year 2000 dollars.


                                                        9
above that experienced by neighborhoods in the four richer quintiles, and the 90th percentile of

income growth is only higher in the top quintile. This indicates that gentrification is an

important phenomenon among the lowest-income neighborhoods during this period.

        To create our primary analysis sample, we first take the set of tracts that are in the bottom

quintile of average family income in 1990.10 These neighborhoods have average family income

less than $30,079 (in 2000 dollars) in 1990. We refer to this set of neighborhoods as the low-

income neighborhood sample. We take gentrifying neighborhoods to be those tracts in the low

income neighborhood sample that experience an increase in average family income between

1990 and 2000 of at least $10,000. 15.2% of tracts in the bottom quintile experience income

growth of this magnitude. Only 13.2% of tracts in the upper 4 quintiles experience growth of

this magnitude.

        Most of our analysis compares gentrifying neighborhoods to non-gentrifying

neighborhoods in the low-income neighborhood sample. The fact that most gentrifying tracts

have exited the bottom quintile suggests another interesting comparison. Thus, we also take a

sample of middle-class neighborhoods in 2000 and distinguish those that were low-income

neighborhoods in 1990 from those that were not low-income in 1990. To be more specific, we

take as our middle-class neighborhood sample those tracts that have average family income in

2000 between $33,000 and $47,000. This sample is comprised of neighborhoods from the very

top of the first quintile through the middle of the 3rd quintile of average family income in 2000.

These cut-off points for the middle-class neighborhood sample are chosen to maximize the

concentration of gentrifying tracts. For analysis with the middle-class neighborhood sample,

gentrification is still defined as those neighborhoods in the sample that were originally in the



10
  We also conducted alternative analysis in which we selected tracts from the bottom quintile of neighborhood
income, calculated within each CMSA, and found this had little effect on the results.

bottom quintile in 1990 and for whom average family income increased by at least $10,000

between 1990 and 2000. 5.8% of tracts in the middle-class sample are gentrifiers and 63.4% of

gentrifying tracts in the low-income neighborhood sample appear in the middle-class

neighborhood sample.

D. Measurement of Key Variables

         Having identified two samples of urban neighborhoods, the low-income neighborhood

sample and the middle-class neighborhood sample, we then select the sample of all householders

in the 2000 Long Form Census data who reside in these tracts to create the data for our

analysis.11 Key variables in our analysis include family income of the householder and

migration status of the householder. To create the family income measure, we sum all forms of

income across all members of the householder’s family.12 Income from unmarried partners is

included in family income, but we exclude income from individuals in the household who are

otherwise not related to the householder (such as roommates or boarders).

         We wish to distinguish those householders who moved into their current residence

between 1990 and 2000 from those who lived there prior to 1990. The PUMS data report, for

each household member, whether or not he or she lived in the same housing unit 5 years prior to

the survey. The confidential data, fortunately, provide even more detailed information on when

the householder moved into the housing unit, which allows us to exactly identify whether or not

the householder moved into the housing unit in the past 10 years. In this paper, householders

11
   We define “household” and “householder” the same way the Census Bureau does: a household refers to the
people living in a housing unit, with the householder being the one in whose name the home is owned, being bought,
or rented, in any kind of housing unit.
12
   The definition of family used by the Census Bureau is “two or more individuals related by birth, marriage, or
adoption who reside together.” Our definition of family income is similar to that used by the Census Bureau, the
largest difference being that householders who do not reside with any relative are still included in our analysis as a
family of size one. Unlike the definition of family income used by the Census Bureau, we include income from
individuals designated as the unmarried partner of the householder. Individuals who do not live alone, but are not
related to the householder, are not included in our analysis. Their income does not belong in the householder’s
family’s income, but we do not have the migration information to create separate observations for them.



                                                         11
who moved into their housing unit in the past 10 years are referred to as migrants.

Unfortunately, there is no way to identify whether migrant householders previously lived in

another housing unit in the same neighborhood or whether they moved in from another census

tract.

IV. Methods

A. Migrants to Gentrifying vs Non-Gentrifying Neighborhoods.

           We investigate the differences in characteristics between householders who moved into

houses in neighborhoods that gentrified between 1990 and 2000 and those who moved into

houses in low-income neighborhoods that did not gentrify. We use our low-income

neighborhood sample, which, as described above, contains those census tracts in the bottom

quintile of average family income in 1990. Also as described above, tracts are considered to

gentrify if they are in the low-income neighborhood sample and experience an increase in

average family income between 1990 and 2000 of at least $10,000.                    Restricting the analysis

sample to only those householders who moved into a housing unit in the low-income

neighborhood sample between 1990 and 2000, we estimate a logit model of the form:

                               ⎛ Pr(Gi = 1) ⎞         35                    64
(1)                        log ⎜            ⎟ = β o + ∑    β  D
                                                             j ij + X i γ + ∑    δ mCMSAim ,
                               ⎝ Pr(Gi = 0) ⎠         j =1                  m =1



where G is an indicator variable that equals 1 if householder i moved into a housing unit in a

gentrifying tract. The Dj’s are 35 demographic group indicator variables created by crossing 3

race/ethnicity categories (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic) with 3

education categories (less than a high school degree, high school degree, college degree) and 4

lifecycle stage categories (age less than 40 without children, age less than 40 with children, age

40-60, age greater than 60).13 We omit the indicator for white high school dropouts under 40

13
     Children must be under 18 and living in the same household.


                                                          12
without children to create the reference category, leaving 35 demographic group indicators. X

contains controls for householder’s relationship status (married, cohabitating with unmarried

partner, or single) interacted with the 3 race/ethnicity indicators and the householder’s immigrant

status interacted with the 3 race/ethnicity indicators. X also contains a control for the average

1990 income of the current tract of residence. 14 The model also includes CMSA fixed-effects.15

         Our choice of specification in equation (1) warrants further explanation. A more

complete specification would have interacted race/ethnicity with education with age with family

structure (marital status and presence of children) and with immigration status, rather than

simply including additional controls for marital status and immigration. Unfortunately, this

creates a very large number of demographic groups and therefore an unwieldy number of

coefficient estimates to report. This also generates quite a few small cells, resulting in many

imprecise estimates. Additionally, all empirical results generated using confidential Census data

must go through a review before they are publicly released, and these small cells present a

disclosure risk. 16 We therefore picked the demographic variables to include in our key set of

interactions by determining which variables were the most important determinants of gentrifying

mobility and which had the most interesting interactions with race and education. For example,

we chose to include the interaction of presence of children with the youngest age category, but

not with the 40-60 age category, because it was only for the younger householders that presence

of children was such an important predictor of location choice. We also initially interacted

14
   We control for average 1990 income for the tract in which the householder is located in 2000. Suppose that 1990
tract income is correlated with gentrification status. Further suppose, for example, that white householders are more
likely to move into neighborhoods in the upper-end of the bottom quintile of 1990 income than the lower end.
Failure to control for 1990 income would wrongly attribute a tendency to locate in the higher-income neighborhoods
with a preference for gentrifying neighborhoods.
15
   Some CMSAs contain multiple MSAs. We also tried a specification with MSA fixed effects, but the change did
not significantly affect the results.
16
   It is because of this same concern with small cells that householders that report a race other than white or black
are not included in the analysis reported in Tables 4, 5 and 7. Once this “other race” category is sub-divided by age,
education and family structure, the cells become very small. “Other Race” householders are included in the
descriptive tables and in the decomposition in Table 8.


                                                         13
marital status with age, education and race, but found that presence of children, rather than

marriage or cohabitation, was the more important predictor and had more important interaction

effects with race and education.

       In equation (1), βo measures the differential between the migration rate into the

gentrifying tracts and non-gentrifying tracts for the reference demographic group. A positive βj

therefore indicates that this differential is larger for demographic group j than for the reference

group. These estimates indicate which demographic groups act as gentrifiers, in other words,

which groups have disproportionately high rates of migration into gentrifying neighborhoods

relative to other low-income neighborhoods.

       A related question is, conditional on demographic group, how do incomes of gentrifying

migrants compare to non-gentrifying migrants? For example, given a group of migrant

householders who are white, elderly and hold high school degrees, how does the income of those

moving into gentrifying low-income neighborhoods compare to the income of those moving into

non-gentrifying low-income neighborhoods? We estimate the following model on the same

sample of householders who have moved into a housing unit in the low-income neighborhood

sample:

                                       35          36                        64
(2)             log( Incomei ) = α 0 + ∑ α j Dij + ∑ β j ( Dij * Gi ) + X iγ + ∑ δ mCMSAim + ε i ,
                                       j =1        j =1                     m =1



where Income is the householder’s family income and all other variables are defined as they

were for equation (1). We are interested in the coefficients on the interactions of the

demographic group dummies with the gentrification dummy. A positive βj, for example,

indicates that, within demographic group j, migrants to the gentrifying neighborhoods have

higher incomes than migrants to the non-gentrifying neighborhoods.




                                                    14
        Estimation of equations (1) and (2) using the low-income neighborhood sample allows us

to compare those moving into low-income neighborhoods that are gentrifying to those moving

into low-income neighborhoods that are not gentrifying. In additional analysis, we estimate

equations (1) and (2) on the sample of middle-class neighborhoods. This allows us to compare

those who moved into houses in recently-gentrified middle-class neighborhoods compared to

those who moved into houses in neighborhoods that were already middle-class in 1990. When

using our middle-class sample, the control for tract-level income in 1990 is replaced with a

control for tract-level income in 2000.17

B. Cohort Regression Analysis of Out-Migration and Stayer Outcomes

        The final composition of the gentrifying tracts is determined not only by the

characteristics of those who exit, but also by the characteristics of those who move in and the

impacts on those who stay. The analysis described above in section A examines who moves into

gentrifying neighborhoods. We would also like to characterize the out-migration. We would, in

particular, like to determine if there is any evidence of displacement of low-income minorities in

gentrifying neighborhoods. The cross-sectional Census data cannot be used to create a sample

of individuals who used to live in the gentrifying neighborhoods. We still, however, can study

this issue by creating synthetic cohorts.

        Consider all households in a single tract in 1990 with a householder who is age 20 to 29,

white, and has a high school degree. Suppose there are 500 such households. Now, take all

households in 2000 with a householder who is 30 to 39, white, has a high school degree, and has

lived in the same housing unit for at least 10 years. If there has been no out-migration, there

should be 500 such households. The observed changes in cohort size between 1990 and 2000

17
  Using the same logic described in footnote 7, we do not want to wrongly attribute a tendency for a group to locate
in higher-income or lower-income middle-class neighborhoods with a preference for gentrifying neighborhoods.
Because the middle-class tracts are selected based on 2000 income, it is appropriate to control for average family
income in 2000, rather than 1990.


                                                        15
provide estimates of out-migration for different demographic groups in a neighborhood.

Comparing changes in a cohort’s size across neighborhoods produce estimates of relative out-

migration from different types of neighborhoods for a particular demographic group.

       We consider 4 cohorts:

              1990            2000
Cohort 1:     20-29      30-39 and in housing unit for at least 10 years
Cohort 2:     30-39      40-49 and in housing unit for at least 10 years
Cohort 3:     40-49      50-59 and in housing unit for at least 10 years
Cohort 4:     50-59       60-69 and in housing unit for at least 10 years

We divide each cohort into our 3 race/ethnicity groups crossed with our 3 education groups. We

therefore use 4x3x3=36 cohorts in our analysis.

       Our first cohort regression model is:

                                 35          36                      70
(3)            % ∆Popct = α o + ∑ α c Cct + ∑ β c (Cct * Gt ) + X t γ + ∑ δ mCMSAmt + ε .
                                 c =1        c =1                    m =1


For cohort c in tract t, the percent change in population is measured as:

                                             Pop 2000ct − Pop1990ct
                                % ∆Popct =                          ,
                                                   Pop1990ct

and the Cc’s are indicator variables for each of the 36 cohorts. The coefficients on the interaction

of the cohort indicators with the gentrification dummy indicate whether the out-migration for

that particular demographic group is higher or lower in gentrifying tracts compared to non-

gentrifying tracts. A negative estimate for βc indicates that the population loss for cohort c was

on average greater in gentrifying tracts, which would be consistent with displacement.

       It must be pointed out that in the 2000 Census, 67.3 % of householders in our sample of

urban tracts have changed houses in the past 10 years, and 68.8% of householders in the low-

income neighborhood sample have done so. The average %∆POP for cohorts in the estimation

sample is –66.3%, and reflects the natural mobility of households in the U.S. This exercise only



                                                    16
picks up differential mobility out of different types of neighborhoods for different demographic

groups.18

         We also use synthetic cohorts to study changes in income among pre-existing residents

with the following model:

                                   36          36                          70
(4)                  % ∆Incct = ∑ α c Cct + ∑ β c (Cct * Gt ) + X t γ + ∑ δ mCMSAmt + ε .
                                  c =1         c =1                       m =1


Where %∆Inc is the percent change in average family income for cohort c between 1990 and

2000. A positive coefficient for βc, for example, indicates that there was a greater increase in

average family income for cohort c in gentrifying neighborhoods than non-gentrifying

neighborhoods. A positive coefficient therefore indicates that average family income increased

for families that already lived in the neighborhood in 1990. Such a positive effect of

gentrification could result from two very different causes. One is that in gentrifying

neighborhoods, the households in a particular cohort that migrate out are disproportionately low-

income compared to those in the same cohort leaving non-gentrifying neighborhoods. This

would cause an increase in average family income due to a composition effect. The other

explanation is that gentrification causes an increase in family income in that demographic group,

for example by improving employment opportunities in the local area. Unfortunately, there is

no way to formally test between these two interpretations with the data at hand. However, as we

discuss below, the pattern of our results lead us to believe that the second interpretation is more

credible than the first.




18
  The change in cohort population will be measured with error, because cohorts are based on a random sample,
different individuals in the household could list themselves as the householder in successive censuses, and
individuals could change or misreport their age, education or race/ethnicity in successive censuses. This can
generate some attenuation bias in our estimates, but there is no reason to believe that the measurement error is
systematically correlated with gentrification status.



                                                         17
V. Results

        Table 2 provides a preliminary description of the differences between the gentrifying and

non-gentrifying tracts in our low-income neighborhood sample. The first two columns report

average tract-level characteristics in 1990 by gentrification status. Interestingly, the low-income

neighborhoods that gentrify between 1990 and 2000 have lower average income and a smaller

proportion of white households in 1990 than those low-income neighborhoods that do not

gentrify, although the proportion of householders with a college degree is marginally higher. It

is also noteworthy that the average income of householders that moved into the gentrifying

neighborhoods between 1980 and 1990 is lower than for those who moved into the non-

gentrifying neighborhoods. By most measures, the low-income neighborhoods that gentrified

during the 1990’s were worse off in 1990 than those that did not gentrify during the 90’s. There

is little evidence of “lead” indicators, or, put another way, little evidence that the gentrifying

neighborhoods were already improving prior to 1990.

        The remaining two columns report average tract-level characteristics in 2000 by

gentrification status.   By definition, the gentrifying tracts have much higher average income in

2000. The most striking features is the growth in the fraction of householders with a college

degree, increasing from 9.0 to 15.8 percent, compared to an increase from 8.2 to 10.1 percent for

non-gentrifying neighborhoods. The gentrifying neighborhoods also experience a moderate

increase in the proportion of householders who are white. The final rows of the table indicate

that the average incomes of both migrants and non-migrants increase in gentrifying tracts.

A. Migration Logit and Income Regression Results, Low-Income Neighborhood Sample

        Table 3 provides descriptive statistics for the sample of householders who moved into a

housing unit in the low-income neighborhood sample in the 1990’s. The two columns report

means separately for the householders who have moved into a housing unit in gentrifying tracts


                                                  18
vs non-gentrifying tracts. Not surprisingly, the gentrifying migrants are higher-income, higher-

education, more likely to be white and less likely to be Hispanic than non-gentrifying migrants.

They are also, however, more likely to be black than non-gentrifying migrants. At the bottom of

the table, we see that gentrifying migrants are also a little younger, less likely to have children

and less likely to be immigrants than non-gentrifying migrants.

         In Table 4 we present the results from estimating equations (1) and (2) on the low-income

neighborhood sample. Column 1 reports the logit coefficient estimates of the β j ’s from

equation (1). To better illustrate the magnitudes of the effects, we also report the predicted

probability that a migrant has located in a gentrifying neighborhood (P(Gentrify)) for all 36

demographic groups in column 3. As a point of comparison, 11.2% of the migrants in the

estimation sample used in Table 4 locate in a gentrifying tract. Therefore demographic groups

with predicted probabilities above 0.112 have above average rates of gentrification. The most

obvious finding in Table 4 is the high gentrification rate of college-educated householders,

particularly white householders with college degrees. The gentrification rates of householders in

all race/ethnicity groups with less than a college degree are remarkably similar and typically

range from 10 to 11 percent.19

         The estimates in column 1 of Table 4 do not indicate which groups are most likely to live

in a gentrifying neighborhood. They tell us which householders are more likely to move into a

gentrifying neighborhood conditional on the fact they have chosen to move into a neighborhood

that was low-income in 1990. For example, statistics reported later in Table 8 of this paper will

show that a 2000 householder in a gentrifying neighborhood is much more likely to be a black


19
   The estimates for marital status and immigration status, which are not reported in Table 4, indicate that married or
cohabitating householders have higher gentrification rates than single householders. The effect of partnership is
strongest for white householders and weakest for Hispanic householders. Among white householders, immigrants
have lower gentrification rates, but there is no effect of immigration status for non-white householders.


                                                          19
high school dropout than a white college graduate. This is because black high school dropouts

are overall much more likely to move into neighborhoods that were low income in 1990 than

white college graduates. The black high school dropouts are more likely than average to move

into a non-gentrifying low-income neighborhood than a gentrifying low-income neighborhood,

so their choice to locate in a neighborhood cannot be seen as a sign of gentrification. In contrast,

if a white college graduate moves into a neighborhood that was low income in 1990, it is much

more likely than average that it is a gentrifying neighborhood. The influx of white college

graduates is a feature that distinguishes the gentrifying neighborhoods from other low-income

neighborhoods.

       The final two columns of Table 4 present the results from estimating equation (2). It is

not very surprising that, within each demographic group, the incomes of those migrating to the

gentrifying areas are higher than those migrating to non-gentrifying areas. This differential in

income is particularly large for the college-educated householders, particularly white

householders with college degrees.

B. Migration Logit and Income Regression Results, Middle-Class Neighborhood Sample

       The first 3 columns of Table 5 report the results obtained estimating equation (1) on the

middle-class neighborhood sample. The gentrification rate in the estimation sample used in

Table 5 is 4.2%, so any group with a value above 0.042 in column 3 has a higher than average

predicted gentrification rate.   When the sample is limited to those householders who have

moved into a housing unit in a middle-class neighborhood in the past 10 years, it is not surprising

that black and Hispanic householders with less than a college degree are disproportionately

likely to have moved into the recently-gentrified, rather than established, middle-class

neighborhood. It is also not surprising that white householders typically have lower than average




                                                20
gentrification rate, but it is quite striking that the one exception is for white college-educated

householders who are under 40 without children.

        Among white householders, having less than a college degree, the presence of children,

or elderly status all substantially diminish the probability the householder will choose a

gentrifying neighborhood over an established middle-class neighborhood. These same patterns

are substantially diminished, or even reversed, for most of the black and Hispanic demographic

groups. Elderly status, lower education and presence of children are often associated with

higher gentrification rates for non-white householders.20           This pattern is not inconsistent with

the results for the low-income neighborhood sample in Table 4, though the differential effects of

elderly status and presence of children are rather subtle in that table.

        The income results from estimating equation (2) on the middle class sample are reported

in the last two columns of Table 5. For most demographic groups, among those who moved into

houses in the middle-class sample of tracts, the incomes of those who are in recently-gentrified

tracts are typically below those in the established middle-class tracts. The only statistically

significant exceptions are for white householders with college degrees, in which case the

incomes of the gentrifiers exceed the incomes of those moving to established middle-class

neighborhoods.

        The results in Tables 4 and 5 point to in-migration of young, college-educated white

householders without children as a particular hallmark of gentrifying neighborhoods. The results

also indicate that among white householders, presence of children, age and education play a




20
  Estimates for marital status and immigration status, which are not reported in Table 5, indicate that for all
racial/ethnic groups, married couples are more likely than average to move to an established middle-class
neighborhood than a gentrifying neighborhood. Black immigrants living in middle-class neighborhoods are less
likely than average to have moved into a gentrifying neighborhood, but Hispanic immigrants are more likely than
average to have chosen the gentrified middle-class neighborhood.


                                                       21
different role in determining the choice to locate in a gentrifying neighborhood than they do for

black and Hispanic householders.

C. Cohort Regression Results

       Table 6 provides some preliminary evidence regarding who exits gentrifying

neighborhoods relative to non-gentrifying neighborhoods. Table 6 reports descriptive statistics

for the sample of non-migrants, householders who have lived in their housing unit for at least 10

years, in the low-income neighborhood sample in 2000. Columns 1 and 3 report average 1990

tract-level characteristics of non-migrants for gentrifying and non-gentrifying neighborhoods,

respectively. Columns 2 and 4 report average householder characteristics for non-migrants in

2000. If gentrification is associated with widespread displacement, we should see a differential

change between columns 1 and 2 compared to columns 3 and 4. For the racial/ethnic and

educational composition variables, there is little evidence to suggest that black or Hispanic

householders are disproportionately exiting the gentrifying neighborhoods. There is, however,

modestly higher exit of low-education households and retention of high-education households in

the gentrifying neighborhoods. There is also a much bigger increase in average income between

columns 1 and 2, compared to columns 3 and 4, suggesting that the “stayers” in gentrifying

neighborhoods either experience disproportionate income gains or are disproportionately

selected from the higher income households within each demographic group.

       The results from the cohort regression in equation (3) are reported in the first two

columns of Table 7. This analysis is conducted on the low-income neighborhood sample. Recall

that a large, negative and significant coefficient is evidence that a particular cohort lost more

population in gentrifying areas than non-gentrifying low income neighborhoods, and is therefore

consistent with displacement.    The results in Table 7 provide little evidence of displacement.

Most of the coefficients are statistically insignificant, very small in magnitude, and equally likely


                                                 22
to be negative or positive. The one statistically significant coefficient suggests disproportionate

retention of prime-aged black householders with a high school degree.

         The remaining two columns report the results for the income change regression described

in equation (4).21 These results combined with those in the first column suggest that black

householders with a high school degree benefit from gentrification. The first column provides

some indication that gentrifying neighborhoods disproportionately retain black householders

with a high school degree. The third column estimates indicate that average incomes in cohorts

of black householders with high school degrees increase roughly 20% more in gentrifying than

non-gentrifying neighborhoods. We cannot formally test whether this is because gentrification

improves the earnings of these householders, or disproportionately reduces exit of the highest

earning householders in these cohorts. Given, however, that we do not see any evidence of

displacement of lower-income cohorts in Table7, it is hard to believe that this result is driven by

displacement of lower-income households within cohort. We consider the more reasonable

interpretation to be that this cohort did experience income gains.

         The estimates in Table 7 demonstrate that it is useful to disaggregate the analysis by

detailed demographic group. Specifications that control linearly for race and education or

poverty, as most previous studies have done, would not show that the effects for black high

school graduates are quite different from those for black high school dropouts, as well as from

those for white high school graduates.




21
  The sample of cohorts used to estimate this regression is smaller than that used in column 1 for two reasons. First,
because many of these tract-level cohorts are relatively small in population in 1990, and because the average
mobility rate is quite high, almost 40% of the tract-level cohorts have zero population in 2000. Because these
cohorts with zero population in 2000 have no 2000 income information, they are dropped from the analysis. In
addition, for some of the smaller cohorts that have non-zero population in 2000, the income change is calculated on
such a small number of observations that the percentage change in income can be quite dramatic. For this reason,
we trim another 3% of the sample that has greater than 400% change in average income.



                                                         23
D. Decompositions

       The previous results describe who is moving in and out of gentrifying neighborhoods.

We would like to summarize our results in a way that indicates how much of the gentrification is

due to each demographic group. In other words, how much of the increase in average family

income in gentrifying neighborhoods is generated by each demographic group?

       To answer this question, we make use of the following expression:

                                                     36
(5)                            ∆I = I 00 − I 90 = ∑ ( Pj00 I j00 − Pj90 I j90 )
                                                     j =1



where ∆I is the change in average family income from 1990 to 2000 for the group of low

income neighborhoods that gentrify, I j is the average family income for demographic group j in

the gentrifying neighborhoods, and Pj is the fraction of householders in the gentrifying

neighborhoods that belong to demographic group j. Using equation (5), we decompose the total

amount of gentrification into the part due to each individual demographic group.

       We make two adjustments to our demographic categories from those used in tables 4, 5

and 7. First, in order to avoid a small cell that would not meet Census Bureau confidentiality

guidelines, we combine the two oldest age groups for Hispanic householders with a college

degree. Second, we include a single “Non-Hispanic Other Race” category. While we excluded

other race householders from the analysis in tables 4, 5 and 7, and we cannot disaggregate the

contribution of other race householders by age or education, we can report an aggregate income

contribution for all other race householders.

       The decomposition results are reported in Table 8 using the sample of gentrifying low-

income neighborhoods. Columns 4 and 5 report the main decomposition results, with column 4

reporting the income change contributed by each of the 36 demographic groups using equation

(5). Column 5 simply reports the income change in column 4 divided by the total average


                                                     24
income change of $16,901. The first 3 columns of Table 8 report several of the component parts

of the decomposition. An individual demographic group can have a large contribution to total

income change either due to being a large fraction of the population in gentrifying

neighborhoods, having a large intercensal average income change, or both. Reporting the

population proportions for 1990 and 2000 and the average intercensal income change for each

demographic group allows us to distinguish these cases.

       The results in Table 8 indicate that a substantial 33% of the total income gain in

gentrifying tracts is contributed by black householders with a high school degree. This sizeable

contribution results from the fact that black householders are a large fraction of the population in

gentrifying tracts in 1990, increase as a fraction of the population in the 90’s, and display

particularly large increases in average income. This creates an interesting contrast with black

householders with less than a high school degree, who are also a sizeable fraction of the

population in gentrifying low-income neighborhoods in 1990. These households, however, fall

as a fraction of the population in gentrifying neighborhoods and experience much smaller

changes in average income, resulting in a contribution of only 7% of the total income gain.

       The second largest contribution to the total income gain is by white householders with a

college degree, who contribute 20% of the total gain, with over half of this gain coming from

young householders without children. This is in direct contrast to the minute contribution of less

than 3% by white householders with less than a college degree.

VI. Conclusions

       The key findings of our analysis of gentrifying urban neighborhoods in the 1990’s are:

1) The analysis points to the in-migration of white college graduates, particularly those under 40

without children, as a key hallmark of gentrifying neighborhoods. 2) The presence of children,

having less than a college degree, or elderly status dampens the likelihood that a white household


                                                 25
moves into a gentrifying neighborhood, but these same effects are much diminished, or even

reversed, for black and Hispanic householders; 3) Synthetic cohort analysis of out-migration

finds no evidence of displacement of non-white households, but does find evidence of

disproportionate retention of black householders with a high school degree; 4) A decomposition

of the total income gains in a gentrifying neighborhood attribute the bulk of the gains to two key

groups: black high school graduates (due to disproportionate retention and income gains) and

white college graduates (due to disproportionate in-migration and high incomes).

       The findings suggest that rather than dislocating non-white households, gentrification

creates neighborhoods that are attractive to middle-class minority households, particularly those

with children or with elderly householders. One reasonable interpretation is that because these

neighborhoods are experiencing income gains, but also more diverse with regards to

race/ethnicity and income than established middle-class neighborhoods, they are desirable

locations for non-white middle-class households.

       Our findings highlight the benefits of richly disaggregating by demographic characteristic

in studies of neighborhood choice and mobility. Specifications with basic controls for race,

education, age and family structure, but without interactions, would not have uncovered many of

the interesting findings of this paper. The divergent experience of black householders with and

without high school degrees, for example, would be unlikely to emerge. Our analysis also

demonstrates the benefits of studying not only out-migration but also in-migration and outcomes

for stayers. Finally, this study benefited enormously from data that allowed careful comparisons

of neighborhoods at the census tract level.
