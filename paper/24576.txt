                                             ABSTRACT

Over the past two decades, labor force participation rates for older men have been rising, reversing
a century-long trend towards earlier retirement. Participation rates for older women are rising as well.
 A number of theories have been put forward to explain the rise in participation at older ages, including
improving mortality and health, increasing education and a shift towards less physically demanding
work, and changes in employer-provided benefits and Social Security. This paper documents trends
in labor force participation and employment at older ages and in the factors that may be contributing
to rising participation. A review of these trends and of the relevant literature suggests that increases
in education, women’s growing role in the economy, the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution
pension plans, and Social Security reforms all likely played some role in the trend towards longer work
lives.

       In 2016, the share of men in their early 60s who was working or looking for work in

the U.S. was not four in ten – but it would have been, if the trend in earlier decades had

persisted. After falling continuously for over a century (Costa, 1998), the labor force

participation rate of older men suddenly began to rise starting in the mid-1990s. Today,

more than six in ten men ages 60 to 64 are in the labor force, a dramatic increase relative to

what might have been expected two decades ago. Labor force participation rates for older

women have also been rising for decades, due in part to far-reaching societal changes in the

role of women.

       Many factors have been proposed to explain the rise in labor force participation at

older ages and the resulting increase in the average age of retirement (Munnell, 2015).

These include demographic factors like improving health and rising education, shifts in the

economy away from sectors with physically demanding work, and changes to employer-

sponsored pensions and health insurance benefits and to Social Security. Rising

participation among women may also lead men to work longer if spouses prefer to retire

together. While these factors could all plausibly have contributed to the recent trend, it is

not clear whether all of them did so, nor which factors are the most important.

       This paper aims to begin to fill this gap by providing an analysis of trends in labor

force participation and employment and in factors that may influence these outcomes. The

focus is on the years 1980 to the present, a period encompassing both declining and rising

participation for men and rising participation for women. The analysis is largely

descriptive, examining whether the trends are consistent with the hypothesis that changes

in factors such as health or Social Security may be leading to longer work lives and gleaning

insights from the literature about the likely role of these factors. This analysis sets the



                                               1
stage for future work that will focus on the role of Social Security and private pensions,

documenting how the financial incentives for retirement have changed over time due to

changes in retirement programs and estimating how much of the rise in labor force

participation can be explained by these changes in incentives.



I. Trends in Labor Force Outcomes

        The rise in labor force participation at older ages is among the most significant labor

market trends in the U.S. in recent decades. As Figure 1 illustrates, for men ages 60 to 64,

participation began to rise in the mid-1990s, growing from 53 percent in 1994 to 62

percent in 2016, a 9-point increase. For men ages 65 to 69, the trend began a decade

earlier and the increase to date is 12 points, from 25 percent in 1985 to 37 percent in 2016.

By contrast, there is no U-shaped pattern for men ages 55 to 59, whose participation

declined from 82 percent in 1980 to 77 percent by the mid-1990s and remained flat

thereafter.1

        The trend for women, shown in Figure 2, is quite different. In all age groups,

participation has risen continuously since 1980, increasing by 17 points at ages 55 to 59

and 60 to 64 and by 13 points at ages 65 to 69. In 2016, nearly two-thirds of women ages

55 to 59 and half of women ages 60 to 64 were in the labor force. Women’s sustained

increases in participation led to a substantial narrowing of the male-female participation

gap – for those ages 55 to 59, the gap fell from 33 points in 1980 to 12 points in 2016.

There is some indication in the figure that participation has plateaued for women ages 55



1 CEA (2016) documents this trend and explores supply- and demand-side factors that may have contributed
to this decline, concluding that the decline in real wages of less skilled workers is an important factor


                                                    2
to 64 since about 2010, though it is not yet clear whether this is a temporary or permanent

break from the long-term trend.

       The employment rate is also of interest. As shown in Figures 3 and 4, trends in

employment are very similar to those in labor force participation, as unemployment, which

is the difference between the two series, is generally quite low in these age groups. The

average unemployment rate during the period 1980 to 2016 is 3.4 percent for men and 2.3

percent for women ages 55 to 59; rates for the two older age groups are lower. The

unemployment rate is affected by the business cycle, reaching highs of 5 to 6 percent for

men ages 55 to 59 in the early 1980s and after the Great Recession of the late 2000s. The

official unemployment rate may understate the number of older individuals who would like

to work if some discouraged workers do not report themselves to be looking for work. Age

discrimination as well as lower labor demand during troughs in the business cycle may

impede work at older ages (Lahey, 2008; Neumark et al., 2015; Coile and Levine, 2007).

       Population averages may mask substantial heterogeneity in the experiences of

different groups. Labor force participation rates by education are shown in Figures 5 and

6. Rates are reported as a three-year moving average to reduce sampling variation (here

and in similar graphs below), and the youngest age group and those with some college are

omitted for clarity of exposition. There are very large differences in participation by

education. On average across all years, the participation of college graduates is 25 points

higher than that of high school dropouts for both men and women ages 60 to 64; at ages 65

to 69, the participation gap between college graduates and high school graduates is 23

points for men and 15 points for women. For men, patterns over time by education group

are fairly similar, though there is some evidence of a widening gap in participation during



                                              3
the past decade, which could reflect a stronger effect of the Great Recession on those with

less education. For women, the increases in participation over time are much larger for

college graduates than for those with a high school education or less, leading to a

substantial widening of the participation gap by education.2

        Labor force participation rates by race are presented in Figures 7 and 8. For men,

participation rates are consistently higher for Whites than for non-Whites, but differences

are smaller than those across education groups. At ages 55 to 59, a gap of 15 points in

1980 declines to 10 points in 2016, due to falling participation of Whites. At older ages, the

gap held steady or widened slightly over time, reaching 10 points for those 60 to 64 and 7

points for those 65 to 69 in 2016. For women, differences in participation by race are

smaller, 3 to 5 points in 2016, though this represents a change from the 1980s, when the

participation rate of non-Whites was similar to if not slightly higher than that of Whites. As

these figures do not control for education, differences in participation by race could in part

reflect the effect of racial differences in educational attainment.

        Participation by marital status, shown in Figures 9 and 10, is markedly different by

gender. Single men participate at rates 10 to 20 points below their married counterparts,

depending on the age group, and these differences have been stable or widened slightly

over time. In the case of women, single women in 1980 had participation rates 16 to 18

points higher than those of married women at ages 55 to 64 and 8 points higher at ages 65

to 69. Over time, this gap was eliminated in the two younger groups and narrowed in the



2 In examining trends in labor force participation by education group, it is important to be mindful of the
large changes over time in the share of the population in each education group, discussed below. As there
are, for example, fewer high school dropouts in recent years, the average characteristics of this group may be
somewhat different from the average characteristics of high school dropouts in an earlier era. For a
discussion of this issue in the context of trends in mortality by education, see Bound et al. (2014).


                                                      4
oldest group. Thus, much of the rise in women’s participation at older ages over the past

few decades is the result of an increase in the share of married women that is working.

        Work can encompass different kinds of labor market activity, including part-time

work and self-employment. Figures 11 and 12 detail the frequency of these forms of work

at older ages. Self-employment is fairly popular among men, with 12 to 13 percent of men

ages 55 to 64 and 10 percent of men ages 65 to 69 engaged in such work in 2016; rates of

self-employment among women are about half as large. The fraction of men working part-

time (less than 35 hours per work) is low but rises with age, at about 6 percent of those

ages 55 to 59 and 9 percent of those ages 65 to 69. Part-time work is more common for

women, with 11 to 12 percent of all age groups working part-time in 2016. Part-time work

has been essentially flat since 1990, as has self-employment among women, though there is

a modest decline in self-employment among men.3 With employment rate rising over time,

the share of workers who are part-time has been falling – even so, among those still in the

labor force, 25 percent of men and nearly 40 percent of women in the oldest age group

worked part-time in 2016.

        To sum up, labor force participation by older men and women has been rising for

several decades. The increase began in the mid-1980s for men in their late 60s and a

decade later for men in their early 60s, while women’s participation has been rising since

at least 1980. There are notable differences across groups – employment at older ages is

higher for those with more education, for Whites, and for married men. Married women’s



3 Data on self-employment from the March Current Population Survey (CPS) are shown starting in 1990 due
to a break in the series that appears related to question wording. Beginning in 1988, the survey distinguishes
between incorporated and unincorporated self-employment, and there is a roughly 50 percent increase in
reported self-employment between 1987 and 1988. As the figure reports three-year moving averages, 1990
is the first year that relies solely on data from 1988 and later.


                                                      5
participation once lagged far behind that of single women, but the gap has largely been

eliminated. Part-time work and self-employment are important at older ages, with more

women engaged in the former and more men in the latter.



II. Trends in Explanatory Factors

       These dramatic changes in work at older ages, and in particular the reversal of the

century-long decline in participation of older men, naturally raise the question: what are

the causes of this trend towards longer work lives? A number of demographic and

economic factors are plausible contributors, but it is necessary to examine the trends in

these factors and review other relevant evidence to begin to draw conclusions as to the

likelihood of their each playing a role.



Mortality and Health

       One theory is that improvements in longevity and health have played a key role in

rising participation at older ages. Many studies have established that poor health is

associated with earlier retirement (e.g., Bound et al., 1999; see Coile, 2015, for a review).

Health at older ages – as measured by mortality risk – has improved substantially over

time. Figure 13 shows that the mortality rate at age 60 has declined by 40 percent for men

and one-third for women since 1980. As mortality risk may be an imperfect proxy for work

capacity, Figure 14 reports trends in self-assessed health, a frequently-used measure of




                                               6
overall health. The share of men and women ages 55 to 64 reporting fair or poor health fell

by 5 to 7 points between 1980 and the mid-1990s and has been essentially flat thereafter.4

        A simple juxtaposition of these health and labor force trends is not supportive of the

theory that health improvements are driving later retirement. The mortality rate has fallen

continuously over time, both during the period that men’s participation was falling and the

period when it was rising. Self-assessed health improved from the 1980s through mid-

1990s, while men’s participation declined, and was flat thereafter, while men’s

participation increased. Thus, neither of these health trends aligns with the U-shaped

trend in men’s participation.

        One explanation for the lack of time series evidence supporting this theory may be

that while poor health is an important determinant of retirement for some, it is not the

main reason why most people retire. Most people who are in the labor force at age 60 exit

by age 70, yet health declines only slowly with age over this range (Coile et al., 2017).

Moreover, comparing how much older individuals today work relative either to those in the

past or to slightly younger individuals in similar health suggests that there is significant

health capacity to work at older ages (ibid.). In short, while better health may have

supported longer work lives, there is little evidence that it is a primary driver.



Education and Occupation




4 Trends in other health measures are also of interest, but obtaining an overall view is complicated by the fact
that measures do not necessarily all move in the same direction, at the same time, and equally for all groups
(Crimmins, 2004). One prominent debate focuses on whether longevity increases are resulting in a
compression of disability into a shorter period before death or an increase in the number of years of
disability; see Cutler et al. (2014) and Crimins and Beltran-Sanchez (2010). For discussion of other measures
of health and disability, see Coile (2018).


                                                       7
        Another potential candidate is the increase in educational attainment of the near

retirement-age population and shift away from physically demanding jobs. Changes in

education since 1980 have been dramatic, as shown in Figures 15 and 16. For men ages 60

to 64, the share with a less than high school education has fallen by about 30 percentage

points, from 40 to 10 percent of the population, while the share with a college degree or

some college has grown from one quarter to one half of the population. Patterns for

women are largely similar, though the initial share with at least some college was lower

than for men. By contrast, changes in broad occupation category (blue collar, white collar,

service, and other) are smaller, as seen in Figures 17 and 18.5 Between the 1980s and the

2010s, the share of men working in blue-collar jobs fell by 6 percentage points and the

share working in white-collar jobs rose by an equivalent amount. For women, there was a

decline in both blue-collar and service jobs and a 12-point increase in white-collar work.

        A simple calculation may be useful to begin exploring how much the rise in

education may have contributed to the increase in work at older ages. Figure 19 simulates

the labor force participation rates that would have occurred in the years 1995 to 2016 if

participation rates by education group (Figure 5) had remained constant at 1995 levels

while the educational composition of the population (Figure 15) continued to change. In

other words, this is an estimate of the rise in work that would be expected simply by having

a more educated population, since more educated people tend to retire later. For men ages

60 to 64, the calculation suggests that participation would have risen by 3.5 points between

1995 and 2016 due to the increase in education over this period. Participation actually

                                                        8
rose by 9.9 points, suggesting that the increase in education could be responsible for about

one-third of the gains. For men ages 65 to 69, a similar calculation would suggest that

increases in education could be responsible for nearly half (44 percent) of the gains.6

Calculations for women, shown in Figure 20, suggest that increases in education between

1995 and 2016 could be responsible for 44 percent of the rise in work at ages 60 to 64 and

30 percent of the rise at ages 65 to 69.

        Caution may be warranted in drawing conclusions from such an exercise, however.

Repeating this simulation using the participation rates by education group that existed in

1980, one would have predicted that participation would rise by 4.1 points for men ages 60

to 64 between 1980 and 1995 and by 3.5 points for men ages 65 to 69; in reality,

participation fell by 9.2 and 2.6 points for the two groups, respectively, presumably for

reasons unrelated to the change in education. As in the case of health, education has

increased both during periods of falling and rising participation; indeed, educational

attainment has been fairly flat over the past decade, even as participation has continued to

rise. Moreover, as seen in Figure 5, the U-shape trend in labor force participation for men

is also evident within each education group, suggesting that there are factors beyond

education that are key to understanding the rise in participation.




6 In a similar analysis, Burtless (2013) projects that slightly over half of the increase in the participation of
men ages 60 to 74 between ages 1985 and 2010 can be attributed to rising educational attainment. Blau and
Goodstein (2007) estimate labor force participation models using data from the Current Population Survey
(CPS) and Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) aggregated by age, calendar year, and
education; their estimates suggest that the increase in participation between 1988-92 and 2001-05 can be
fully explained by changes in education. Both they and Burtless (2013) estimate that if the educational
distribution had been fixed at its 1985 level, labor force participation would have continue to decline into the
1990s rather than increase.


                                                        9
Rising Participation among Women

       The dramatic increase in women’s involvement in the economy during the 20th

century has been dubbed a “quiet revolution” (Goldin, 2006). As cohorts of women who

have invested more in their education and career reach older ages, older women’s labor

force participation rates naturally rise. This trend may lead to higher participation rates

for older men – their husbands – if there are leisure complementarities, that is, if each

spouse’s enjoyment of leisure time is enhanced when the other spouse is present. Noting

that many couples retire together, Gustman and Steinmeier (2000) and Maestas (2001)

estimate structural family retirement models and find that complementarity of leisure is a

key factor driving joint retirement. Baker (2002) and Coile (2004) find that financial

incentives for retirement from public pensions have spillover effects on to the retirement

decision of the spouse, which is also consistent with leisure complementarities.

       Estimating the causal effect of rising women’s participation on men’s participation is

challenging, given the strong possibility that other factors, such as changes to Social

Security, may affect the participation of both men and women. Schirle (2008) overcomes

this obstacle by using women’s labor force participation rate at age 40 – which will reflect

women’s changing role in the economy but will not be affected by factors such as Social

Security – to predict their participation at older ages. Figure 21 shows the labor force

participation rate of women ages 35 to 44 lagged by twenty years, which roughly

corresponds to the share of older men in a given year whose wives were working two

decades earlier. This series rises by 35 points, from 43 percent in 1980 to 78 percent in




                                              10
2016. Using this approach, Schirle (2008) estimates that the rise in older women’s

participation can explain one-quarter of the rise in older men’s participation in the U.S.7



Employer-Provided Benefits

        Employer-provided benefits including pensions and retiree health insurance may

influence retirement decisions, and thus trends in these benefits may contribute to

retirement trends. One significant change in employer benefits has been the shift from

defined benefit (DB) type to defined contribution (DC) type pension plans.8 As shown in

Figure 22, the share of private-sector workers participating in an employer-sponsored

pension plan has remained relatively constant over time, at just under half the workforce.

The share of workers with a DB plan only, however, fell from 28 percent in 1980 to 2

percent in 2014, while the share with a DC plan only rose by a similar amount, from 6 to 34

percent. The share with both a DB and DC plan remained roughly flat, averaging 13

percent over the period.9

        DB and DC plans offer very different financial incentives for continued work at older

ages. In DB plans, pension wealth typically grows until the plan’s early or normal

retirement age and declines thereafter; DC plans, by contrast, lack age-specific retirement


7 Schirle (2008) estimates that changes in U.S. men’s education and age explain about one-third of the rise,
leaving 40 percent unexplained by the combination of women’s participation and these other factors.

8In terms of the factors behind this shift, Friedberg and Webb (2005) point to the importance of regulatory
changes since 1974 that have tightened funding standards for DB plans, constrained the structure of both DB
and DC plans, and extended tax breaks for DC contributions. Poterba et al. (2007) note that firms in rapidly
expanding industries have chosen to rely on DC rather than DB plans.

9The vast majority of public sectors workers continue to be covered by DB plans. Among state and local
workers in 2012, for example, only 2 percent had a DC plan while 7 percent had a hybrid (DB and DC) plan
(Munnell et al., 2014). Most federal workers are covered by both a DB and DC plan.



                                                      11
incentives. Friedberg and Webb (2005) estimate that their absence leads workers with a

DC plan to retire nearly two years later.10 A simple calculation suggests that the shift from

DB to DC plans might have led to a roughly 5-month increase in the median retirement age,

corresponding to nearly one-fifth of the increase for men since 1995 (Munnell, 2015).11

        Another important change in employer-sponsored benefits has been the decline in

the share of firms offering health insurance to retirees. By one estimate, the share of

private-sector workers employed by firms offering health insurance to their pre-Medicare

age retirees fell from 29 percent in 1997 to 18 percent in 2011 (Fronstin et al., 2012).12 A

number of studies suggest that the availability of retiree health insurance benefits leads

workers to retire at least several months and potentially more than a year earlier (Madrian

et al., 1994; Nyce et al, 2013). Using the midpoint of these estimates suggests that the

decline in retiree health insurance coverage between 1997 and 2011 might have led to an

increase in the median retirement age of about one month.13


10While this study is one of the few to estimate the effect of the shift from DB to DC pensions on retirement,
many previous studies find that DB pension incentives have strong effects on retirement decisions – see, for
example, Stock and Wise (1990a, 1990b) and Samwick (1998).

11 Friedberg and Webb (2005) estimate that moving from a DB to a DC plan is associated with a 21-month
increase in the median retirement age. Given a 26-point decline in the share of private sector workers with
DB plans between 1980 and 2014 (Figure 22) and an estimated 84 percent of workers in the private sector
(Mayer, 2014), this suggests that the shift from DB to DC plans led to a 4.5-month decline in the median
retirement age. Munnell (2015) calculates that the median age of retirement for men rose by 26 months
between 1995 and 2013, so 4.5 months represents 18 percent of that increase. Friedberg and Webb (2005)
forecast a somewhat larger (9 to 13 month) increase in the median retirement age between 1983 and 2015,
based on projections of future age-specific rates of DB coverage with the data then available.

12 Trends in this statistic prior to 1997 are more difficult to discern. EBRI (1996) reports that the share of
full-time workers in firms with 100 or more employees who have access to retiree health benefits remained
constant between 1988 and 1993, even as a 1990 regulatory change required companies to record unfunded
benefit liabilities on their financial statements, potentially causing employers to reexamine their role in
providing these benefits. However, the number of large employers offering retiree health insurance benefits
has been declining since at least 1991 (Fronstin, 2001)

13Estimates of the effect of retiree health insurance access on retirement vary. Madrian et al. (1994) report
an effect of 5 to 16 months, while Nyce et al. (2013) find an effect of 3 to 13 months, depending on the

Social Security Reforms

        While public pension reforms in the U.S. in recent decades have not been as frequent

or dramatic as those in some other countries, there have nonetheless been meaningful

changes that have significantly impacted the incentive to work at older ages and likely

contributed to longer work lives.

        The 1983 amendments to the Social Security Act made a number of changes that

collectively were designed to put the system on firmer financial footing for coming decades.

One such change was an increase in the Full Retirement Age (FRA), which is the age at

which beneficiaries receive their full monthly benefit amount without reduction for early

claiming. The FRA has historically been age 65, but is rising over time to age 67 in a series

of steps, with the first increase for those born in 1938 (who turned 65 in 2003).14 The

increase in the FRA may affect the decision of when to retire for two reasons. First, an FRA

increase is effectively a benefit cut for any given claiming age. For example, for a worker

whose Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) is $1,000 would be entitled to a monthly benefit of

$1,000 when claiming at age 65 if her FRA is 65 versus $933 per month if her FRA is 66, a

decline of 6.67%. Economic theory suggests that she will respond to this negative wealth

shock by reducing consumption of leisure (and other normal goods), and postponing

retirement is one means of doing so. Second, the FRA may play an important role in

establishing a focal point for retirement, affecting social norms.



employee’s length of service and the share of premiums covered by the firm. Using 9 months as an
approximate midpoint of these estimates, an 11-point decrease in coverage for private sector workers (who
make up 84 percent of the workforce, as discussed above) yields an estimate of 0.8 months.

14Specifically, the FRA is 65 for those born in 1937 or earlier, rises by 2 months per birth cohort for the
1938-1942 cohorts, is 66 for those born in 1943-1954, rises again by 2 months per birth cohort for the 1955-
1959 cohorts, and is 67 for those born in 1960 and later.


                                                    13
        Mastrobuoni (2009) examines the effect of the FRA increase using data for the 1928

through 1941 birth cohorts, covering the first four steps in the FRA increase (from 65 to 65

and 8 months). He shows that the average age of retirement was rising quite gradually

across birth cohorts until the FRA increases began and then rose more rapidly thereafter.

He concludes that each two-month increase in the FRA is associated with a one-month

increase in the average age of retirement.15 Song and Manchester (2007a) show that the

spike in claiming at age 65 for men and women moved in lock-step with the FRA as it

increased, though changes in claiming behavior may not necessarily reflect changes in

retirement. Extrapolating from these results suggests that the one-year increase in the FRA

to date (from 65 to 66) may have increased the average age of retirement by six months.

        A second key change in Social Security provisions is the increase in the Delayed

Retirement Credit (DRC) for claiming after the FRA. Workers may claim Social Security

benefits starting at age 62, but receive a larger monthly benefit amount the longer they

wait to claim. Delayed claiming may increase or decrease lifetime Social Security benefits,

depending on whether the adjustment is more or less than actuarially fair. Historically,

benefits have been reduced by 6.67 percent per year for claiming before the FRA and raised

by 3 percent per year of delay after the FRA. Coile et al. (2002) show that with these rates

of adjustment, many types of worker can maximize the financial or utility value of benefits

by waiting until the FRA to claim, but no types gain from delay beyond the FRA.16


15Mastrobuoni (2009) notes that Blau and Goodstein (2007) reach a different conclusion about the effect of
Social Security reform on labor force participation; however, their approach does not isolate the change in
benefits that results solely from reforms.

16 Shoven and Slavov (2014) show that the value of delaying between age 62 and the FRA has increased since
the 1960s, with most of the increase due to improvement in mortality and declining real interest rates,
though a Social Security rule change that affects survivor’s benefits has also increased the benefit of delay for
husbands. They do not report the gains (or losses) from delay beyond the FRA in their analysis.


                                                       14
        The 1983 amendments raised the DRC from 3 to 8 percent per year in a series of

steps.17 This change has increased the value of delay beyond the FRA; Sun and Webb

(2009) report that for cohorts exposed to the higher DRC, there are many worker types for

whom delay beyond the FRA is optimal. An increase in the DRC may encourage individuals

to delay benefit claim without changing their retirement decision or could encourage

individuals to delay both retirement and claiming if they tend to treat these decisions as

linked (though they need not be). Pingle (2006) estimates the effect of the DRC on

employment in a model that includes age and year fixed effects and a polynomial in birth

year, using the step increases in the DRC for identification. He finds that each one

percentage point increase in the DRC is associated with a roughly one percentage point

increase in the employment rate of men ages 65 to 69. This estimate suggests that the five-

point increase in the DRC since 1990 could explain up to half of the increase in

participation of men ages 65 to 69 over this period reported in Figure 1.

        A final change relates to the Social Security retirement earnings test (RET). Those

who claim Social Security retired worker benefits but continue to have earnings are

potentially subject to the RET. Workers below the FRA face a benefit reduction of $1 for

each $2 of earnings above an exempt amount ($15,270 in 2016, though this amount is

higher for those reaching the FRA during the year). Workers above the FRA were

historically subject to the RET with a somewhat higher exemption amount. In 1990, the tax

rate on those above the FRA was lowered to $1 of benefit reduction per $3 of earnings, and

in 2000, the RET was eliminated for those above the FRA. Benefits lost through the RET are


17 Specifically, the DRC is 3% per year for those born in 1924 or earlier, then rises by 0.5% every other year
(e.g., to 3.5% for the 1925-1926 cohorts, to 4% for the 1927-1928 cohorts, etc.), reaching 8% for those born
in 1943 and later.


                                                      15
subsequently credited back to workers in the form of an increased actuarial adjustment,

but this appears to be a little-understood provision.

          An existing literature has explored the effect of the RET on both the extensive and

intensive work margins; the former is more relevant here.18 A number of studies employ a

differences-in-differences approach to explore the effect of changes to the RET over time

and conclude that the test has little effect on employment (see Gruber and Orszag, 2003;

Haider and Loughran, 2008; Song, 2004; Song and Manchester, 2007b).19 By contrast,

Friedberg and Webb (2009) find that the RET affects employment in some of their

specifications and conclude that its elimination above the FRA increased employment at

ages 66 to 68 by 0.5 to 2 percentage points. Gelber et al. (2017) also identify an extensive

margin response to the RET using a regression discontinuity approach based on changes in

the employment levels of 63- and 64-year-olds with earnings near the RET threshold; the

authors estimate that eliminating the RET would cause an increase in employment of 1.4

points among workers at those ages with earnings near the threshold. While these results

are not directly informative as to the effect of eliminating the RET above the FRA, they may

suggest that a modest reduction in employment was likely.

          Overall, these three changes to Social Security – the increase in the FRA, the increase

in the DRC above the FRA, and elimination of the RET above the FRA – seem likely to have

contributed substantially to the increase in employment at older ages, particularly at ages

65 and above. As the literature on the FRA and DRC increases is fairly limited and as the


18   See Friedberg (2000) and Gelber et al. (2013) for evidence of the effect of the RET on the intensive margin.

19 Gustman and Steinmeier (2008) employ a different methodology, estimating a structural model of
retirement and wealth; they conclude that the RET reduces participation between ages 62 and the FRA by
four percentage points.


                                                        16
results of the different studies are not necessarily reported in a way that allows for easy

comparison of the effects of these policy changes on employment, additional work

examining how Social Security policy changes have affected the return to work at older

ages would be helpful.



III. Discussion

       Men and women in the U.S. are working substantially longer than their counterparts

of a few decades ago, a phenomenon with profound implications both for the workers

themselves and for the economy as a whole. Many theories have been put forth to help

explain this trend. Improving health is one such theory. Yet while good health is certainly

a necessary ingredient for a longer career, there is little evidence that changes in health are

driving rising participation. Education is another likely candidate, given the steep

participation gradient with respect to education and the dramatic increases in the

educational attainment of the older population in recent decades. Although simple

calculations suggest that this factor could have played a key role, there is as yet no test of

this hypothesis based on a compelling empirical strategy.

       More persuasive evidence appears to exist with respect to several other hypotheses.

Rising women’s participation in the economy encouraged older husbands to work longer

due to leisure complementarities. A shift in employer-provided pensions from DB to DC

type plans reduced the share of workers facing strong incentives to retire at particular

ages, while a decline in retiree health coverage left some workers with no means of

obtaining health insurance other than through their job, at least until the Medicare

eligibility age of 65; both changes contributed to longer work lives. Finally, changes to the



                                               17
Social Security FRA, DRC, and RET have strengthened the incentive for work past the FRA,

contributing to the increase in participation at older ages.

       The estimates from the existing literature may be combined to get some sense of the

share of the increase in work that is explained by these various factors, although the results

this exercise should be treated very cautiously given that they are projections based on

findings from different studies that may not be directly comparable. Using Munnell’s

(2015) estimate of a 26-month increase in men’s average retirement age since 1995,

Schirle’s (2008) estimate that the rise in women’s participation accounted for one-quarter

of the increase in men’s participation would suggest a 6.5-month increase in men’s average

retirement age from this factor. In the discussion above, the effects of the DB to DC shift

and decline in retiree health insurance coverage were estimated to be 4.5 months and 0.8

months, respectively, while the effect of the FRA increase was estimated to be 6 months.

Making a projection of the effect of the rising DRC and elimination of the RET is more

difficult. Pingle (2006) suggests that the DRC increase led to a 5-point increase in

participation at ages 65 to 69 while the findings of Friedberg and Webb (2009) might

suggest a further 1- to 2-point increase from the elimination of the RET. Together these

would account for roughly half the increase in participation since 1995 in the 65 to 69 age

group, and the participation rate of this group being roughly half that of men age 60 to 64,

this might be seen as equivalent to one-sixth of the overall increase in the retirement age,

or 4.3 months. Together, these factors account for an estimated 22-month increase in the

average retirement age for men, or about 85 percent of the total increase since 1995. Social

Security is the single largest factor, with all the changes combined accounting for perhaps

10 months of the increase, although the calculations with respect to the DRC and RET are



                                              18
particularly speculative. The average age of retirement for women rose by 24 months

between 1995 and 2013, indicating that changes in Social Security can account for a large

share of the increase in women’s work over this period as well.

       Several potentially fruitful directions for future analysis are suggested from this

analysis. First, there is some evidence of a slowdown or even an end to the trend towards

longer work lives for men and women in Figures 1 and 2, although this period coincides

with the recovery from the Great Recession and so trends could reflect business cycle

effects. It will be important to monitor these trends to see how retirement behavior

continues to evolve in the future. Second, trends by socioeconomic status merit further

attention. There is clear evidence of a widening gradient in participation by education for

women (Figure 6), and some evidence of this for men as well (Figure 5), although the

changing distribution of educational attainment complicates the evaluation of trends over

long periods of time. It would be useful to explore trends in retirement and benefit

claiming by other key measures of socioeconomic status, such as lifetime income group. In

addition, as noted earlier, better evidence regarding the effect of rising education on

participation at older ages is needed.

       Finally, this discussion highlights the need for more analysis of how changes to

Social Security since 1980 have affected the incentives for work at older ages and how

much these reforms have contributed to the increase in work at older ages. Making

projections based on results from different studies, as has been done here, necessarily

provides only tentative answer to these important questions. Future work on these

questions will not only provide a better understanding of past reforms but lay the

groundwork for projecting the effect of future reforms as well.
