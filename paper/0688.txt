                PITFALLS IN THE CONSTRUCTION AND USE
                       OF EFFECTIVE TAX RATES


                              ABSTRACT

    A cost of capital formula can be a useful tool in estimating the

effective tax rate on a dollar of marginal investment in a particular

industry. There are a number of procedural issues, however, which can

greatly affect the resulting estimates. First, tax rate estimates vary

with the interest rate used in the formula.   Second, the nonlinearity of

tax rate formulas may lead to anomalous results. For example, an invest-

ment that is actually subsidized may appear to bear a positive tax. Or,
                                         when the project's rate of return
tax rates may become arbitrarily large

approaches zero. Third, effective tax rate results depend on the assumed

relationship between inflation and nominal interest rates. Our conclusion
                                                    are required in studies
is that much sensitivity analysis and specificity

that undertake to estimate effective tax rates.

I.   Introduction
        The easiest and most common approach to estimating effective tax
rates   on investment has been to calculate actual taxes paid as a proportion

of capital income. This "flow of funds" approach is particularly useful

for income effects to capital owners, revenue effects to government, or

generally for discussing the relative size of the public sector.   Some have

also used this approach to capture the different incentive effects for

using capital in different industries. The implicit assumption is that

marginal tax rates in a given industry are not far from the ratio of actual

taxes to capital income in that industry. Harberger (1966) estimated the

efficiency cost of differential capital income taxation using this approach,

as did Shoven in his (1976) correction to Harberger. The approach is still

used in recent general equilibrium estimates by Fullerton, King, Shoven, and

Whalley (1981).

         A new approach is now emerging, based on the pioneering work of Hall

and Jorgenson (1967). Their cost of cajiital formulas have long been used

to analyze investment and the incentive effects of tax policy changes.     More

recently, the formulas have been used to estimate effective marginal tax

rates, as in Hall (1981) and Jorgenson and Sullivan (J—S, 1981). Tax rates

based on the cost of capital approach have been used to recalculate Harberger—

 type efficiency costs, as in Gravelle (1981), and to recompute general

equilibrium effects, as in Fullerton and Gordon (1981).
                                 —2—

       This newer approach considers a "hypothetical project" of a dollar

invested in a particular asset to be used in a particular industry.

(Some versions of the approach also assume that the investment is main-

tained in real or nominal tens by subsequent reinvestment.) The view of

taxes is prospective in the sense that the cost of capital formula looks

at the expected change in future tax liabilities, usually discounted to

the time that the original investment takes place. The method can simul-

taneously incorporate actual depreciation rates, type of finance, eligibility

for investment tax credit, accelerated depreciation rules, and depreciation

at historical cost. It is greatly facilitated by the availability of

estimates for depreciation rates of different assets, such as those in

Hulten and Wycoff (1981).

       The prospective nature of the cost of capital (hypothetical project)

approach implies that it is probably more useful for investigating incentive

effects. It measures the expected tax consequences if a given investment

is undertaken. It also concentrates on marginal effects by considering a

particular unit of investment. Though we see many potential benefits of

using this approach, the purpose of this paper is to investigate some of its

dangers. In particular,we thall illustrate three points that should be consid-

ered by any study which uses the cost of capital approach.

       First, as mentioned above, the cost of capital method considers the

expected future tax liabilities associated with a hypothetical project,

discounted to the time that the original investment takes place. Though

the investment tax credit has immediate consequences, other features of

tax systems do not. Accelerated depreciation, for example, has the effect

of delaying some tax liability. As a result, effective tax rate estimates
                                    —3—


will necessarily depend upon the after—tax interest rate or other rate

used for discounting. We shall show this sensitivity below by plotting

a tax rate estimate against the interest rate used to obtain it.

     Second, the tax law allows some assets to be depreciated at rates faster

than their values decline. With Investment tax credits and with the deduc-

tibility of nominal Interest payments, the asset need not earn a positive

marginal product for the investor to receive a normal return. Though the

implied subsidy might be measured In a meaningful way, the rate of subsidy

might not be. When the investment's return in the denominator of an ef-

fective tax rate formula approaches zero, the rate of subsidy can be arbitrarily

high. Similarly, on an asset with a low real return, a positive tax can

be an arbitrarily high portion of it. This problem can be dealt

with by using the numerators of these tax rate estimates alone to

describe the effective tax wedge on a particular asset in a particular
                                               -
industry.

     Third,   effective tax rate estimates depend on assumptions about how

inflation affects nominal interest rates. Hall (1981) and J—S (1981) ef-

fectively assume that nominal interest rates increase by the inflation rate

over one minus the corporate tax rate. This increase is just enough to keep

the real after—tax interest rate constant for corporations.   If all tax-

payers faced the same tax rate as corporations, and if the rules for measur-

ing the income from real investments were perfectly indexed for inflation,

then a strong a priori case could be made for this behaviOr of interest

rates. The real consequences of given decisions to borrow, lend, and in-

vest would then be independent of inflation rates. However, historical

 cost depreciation, nonuniform tax rates, and other tax features tend to
                                     —4—


weaken this a priori case. Indeed, Feldstein (1980) has argued that the

monetary authorities have acted so as to impose Fisher's Law, keeping the

real before—tax interest rate invariant with respect to inflation.       We

show below how tax rate estimates differ according to whether nominal

interest rates increase by just the rate of inflation, or by enough to

keep real after—tax rates constant.

      This paper does not seek to estimate new or better effective tax

rates. It only seeks to investigate the sensitivity of existing estimates

to some of the issues just described. These can be clarified adequately

within the context of fairly simple and straightforward cost of capital

formulas such as those used by Hall (1981) and 3—S (1981). In order to be

particularly careful about the assumptions used in this procedure, we rederive

the cost of capital in Section 11.1. In order to be particularly careful about

what is being estimated, we describe an array of possible tax rate definitions

in Section 11.2. Then in Section 11.3, we state the parameters of the invest-

ment and tax systems, chosen for comparability with Hall (1981).       We also dis-

play the possible outcomes for savers and investment returns.        These consti-

tute the components of effective tax rates.

       In the three parts of Section III, we elaborate on each of the three is-

sues raised above. Tax rate estimates are shown to be sensitive to the interest

rate in Section 111.1. The fact that tax rate definitions are very nonlinear

relationships is illustrated in Section 111.2. The effect of inflation on

nominal interest rates also significantly affects the estimates, as shown

in Section 111.3. It should be clear by the end of this      paper   that the

sensitivity of tax rate estimates implies that one can obtain a wide variety

 of   tax   rate estimates with different choices of parameter values and other

 assumptions.
                                     —5—


      The   problems emphasized in this paper involve primarily mechanical features
of   the analysis. That is, they   concern potential. misunderstanding of the   tax

rate formulas and of the assumptions often encountered. We also touch on some

underlying modelling problems through the course of the paper. Foremost among

these is the question of the true relationship between inflation and the inter-

est rate. There are, however, several additional aspects of the use of ef-

fective tax rate estimates which deserve attention. In the concluding remarks

of Section IV, we allude to further work we are doing on these problems.

II. Analytical Framework

      Because we feel that previous studies have not been explicit enough

about what they were estimating, we devote considerable attention at the

outset to deriving and defining different sorts of tax rates. Any of these

might be estimated by a particular study.


11.1. The Cost of Capital

       We begin with a simple expression for the cost of capital, that is,

the anmial market rental price of a unit of capital, predicted to obtain in

a competitive market equilibrium. Although a similar derivation has been

exposited many times, it will be helpful to have a restatement of the

underlying assumptions and the interpretations of different variables.

       Define p    to be the expected real rate of return to the hypothetical

project, net of economic depreciation at the exponential rate             In


 light   of our introductory coimnents, we require a model incorporating the

dependence of p on the nominal interest rate i and on the rate of infla-

 tion ir.    However, many complexities can be safely ignored. Hall (1981), for

 example, considers (but does not really use) the possibility that a proportion

 of accrued capital gains are taxable at the statutory corporate tax rate u.
                                   —6—

3—S (1981), on the other hand, allow for (but then abstract from) the possi-

bility that the acquisitiox cost q and the rental price c of the asset

are arbitrary functions of time, rather than assuming only that they increase

with inflation. 3—S also consider the possibility that the rate of economic

depreciation is an arbitrary function of time, rather than using our simpler

assumption that true depreciation is at constant exponential rate   6. They

allow depreciation deductions as an arbitrary function of time, while we

assume the tax law allows deprec4tion deductions on a historical cost

basis at constant exponential rate 6'.

     An investment tax credit at rate k completes the description of our

hypothetical real investment project and its tax consequences. A corpor-

ate purchaser of a unit of real capital incurs an immediate after—tax—credit

expense of (1—k)q, and subsequently obtains a cash inflow, expressed as

a function of t, the time since acquisition of the asset. This cash inflow

includes rental at a rate that starts at c and grows at the rate of infla-

tion iT.   The quantity of capital embodied in the investment declines at

the depreciation rate 6. At time t the rental receipts thus equal

(1_u)ce)t after the corporate income tax. The cash inf low also

includes tax reductions due to depreciation allowances, which at time t

equal uq6te_6t (depreciation at rate 6' is allowed on the remaining

basis qe6t). By changing k u and 6', the tax authorities change

the attractiveness of these net—of—tax cash flows, given q, c and iT.

Since (at least) q and c are endogenous to the system, changes in the

tax rules will ultimately be reflected in changes in the values of q, C,

or both.

     The power of the analysis is based upon the valuation of such cash flows.

More specifically, it is based on valuation relative to available alternatives.
                                     —7—


Prominent among these alternatives is the purchase or sale of debt. The

analogue of buying a machine is buying debt, or lending. If the market interest

rate i is constant, for an intial outlay of $1, a corporation can accummulate

         dollars by time t,     where the factor (1—u) in the exponent re-

flects the taxation of interest receipts. Of course, most nonfinancial cor-

porations are sellers of debt, not buyers. The emphasis therefore is usually

on the deduction of interest outlays and not the taxation of interest receipts.

Note that this deduction is a logical extension of the taxation of interest

receipts. It is not, as sometimes made to appear, an explicit subsidy of

corporate borrowing.

     If borrowing and lending are unconstrained, and if real investment is

riskless, it is possible for a corporation to undertake offsetting transactions,

by selling debt and buying an equal amount of real capital. Explicitly or

implicitly, most analyses depend upon the elimination of any possible pure

surpluses from such transactions to determine the equilibrium relationship

among i, q, and c      (given   ii   and the tax rules). More prosaically, most

analyses represent the corporation as discounting nominal cash flows at the

"after tax nominal interest rate," (l—u)i.

     In equilibrium, then, the present value of the nominal cash flow from

a unit of capital, as summarized above, must just equal the initial outlay.

This implies



(l—k)q    J (l_u)ceteiTdT + J uq5Ie Te                       hidi   .     (1)




Explicit integration leads to a relatively simple relationship between the
                                              —8—



gross of depreciation rental rate, clq, and the interest and inflation

rates:




             =   5+(1—u)i—ri   rl_k_
                                         u'                                                  2
         q          1—u        L


This is our basic equation for later computations. Note that this equilibri-
um condition is independent of the actual financing method of the corpora-

tion; it does not matter whether the source of the investment funds is debt

or equity. The option of arbitrage between debt and                  real   capital implies
             3/
equation (2).—

     Since the original Hall and Jorgenson treatment of this subject

(1967), the notation z has been the conventional symbol for the discounted

sum of depreciation deductions on a one dollar investment. Therefore (2)

can also be written as




    —c =     6+(1—u)i—ir
                           (l—k—uz)       ,                                            (3)
                  1—u




where it must be remembered that z depends upon i and u.

     For changes in the tax parameters u, k, and 6', it is conceptu-

ally straightforward to calculate the effect on the equilibrium social rate

of return, p, which equals c/q — 6.                 This can   be   done for different

combinations of i and           TI.   Commonly, though, a further simplification is

adopted, namely, an assumed relationship between i and .                      This   reduces the

number of cases to consider, for the whole system described by (2) then has

a single exogenous parameter, rr.—"             While   a   number of relationships are
                                  —9—


possible, two particular assumptions about inflation and the nominal interest

rate are often encountered. The first is a strict version of Fisher's Law.

If we let i0 represent the interest rate presumed to prevail in the absence

of inflation, Strict Fisher's Law says that



       j=i+,t .                                                      (4a)


The argument for this result is simply that this adjustment leaves all real

borrowing and lending opportunities independent of the rate of inflation.

Implicit is the absence of taxes on interest.   With a tax at a flat rate u

on net interest receipts (which implies a deduction for interest payments),

the same argument predicts what might be called Modified Fisher's Law:'




                                                                      (4b)
       ii+7               .




     Theory does not give us firm predictions about the relationship between i

and ir in a world of imperfect income measurement rules, diverse marginal

tax rates, nonlinearities, noise, and other considerations. Feldstein

and Summers (1978) estimate that i has varied slightly less than point

 for point with it   in the U. S. since World War II. On the other hand, Hall

(1981) explicitly assumes Modified Fisher's Law. J—S (1981) postulate

constancy of the real. rate of return on investment after the corporate tax,

citing empirical work by Fraumeni and Jorgenson (1981).   This procedure is

equivalent to assuming Modified Fisher's Law when arbitrage with corporate

bonds is encompassed by the model.'
                                       — 10 —




      Later    we consider the choice between (4a) and (4b). For our illustra-

tive calculations, we consider three situations: no inflation, 10 percent in-

flation with equation (4a), and 10 percent inflation with equation (4b). The

real interest rate to a bondholder with no tax is the same in the first two

scenarios, but the real interest rate after tax at rate u differs. En the

first and third scenarios, the real after corporate tax interest rate (1—u)i—Tr

is the same, but the real interest rate for a non—profit (nontaxable) insti-

tution differs. There is no real interest rate which is the same in all three

cases, and so we studiously avoid defining any parameter as the real after—tax

interest rate. Instead, we take as a basis of comparison the interest rate

 i    that would prevail with no inflation.

11.2.        Effective Tax Rates

        The concept of an effective tax rate on capital refers to some measure

of the difference between p, the real social rate of return earned on a

real asset, and         s, defined as the rate of return received by the person

or institution financing its purchase. Then we can define the tax "wedge,"
 w
t ,     as


                 p—s.                                                   (5)




This wedge can be thought of as an annual levy on the specified financer

with respect to a dollar's worth of the asset in question. It may be either

positive or negative.

        It is usual to express t' as a ratio to either the social return or

the saver's return. The first is a tax rate on a base that includes the tax:

a "tax inclusive" rate in the language of the Meade Report (1978). Since the
                                  — 11    —




base   is gross—of—tax, we refer to it as a "gross tax rate"         The other tax
rate is on a "tax.exclusive" or net—of—tax basis, and is referred to here as
a   "net tax rate,"      These rates are related to p and s by



                                                                         (6)
               p



                                                                         (7)
         tnt=9.


Notice that these rates are nonlinear functions of $       and   p, and may

behave rather erratically in some circumstances. Particular care must be used

where the denominator of one of these formulas approaches zero, or passes

from positive to negative. In later sections we shall see examples of the

practical relevance of this erratic behavior.

       Different values of p and s can be derived for

            (a) assets with different depreciation rates 6,

            (b) assets with different tax rules (6' and k),

            (c) savers with different tax circumstances (u, in),

            (d) different types of finance (bonds, stock, direct ownership),
                   and

            (e) different i and    it    combinations.

In particular,we shall focus on         "effective corporate tax rate", a "total
effective   rate of tax on bond financed corporate investment", and a "total

effective rate of tax on equity financed investment."

       In performing this analysis however, there is some question as to what

should be taken as constant. Since the interest rate i is a price estab-

lished on a market in which all can trade, it is arguably the natural fixed
                                           — 12 —




point.   Given this interest rate and a single tax rate u for all traders,

the social return p would be determined by the equilibrium condition (2)

for arbitrage between bonds and real capital. In concluding remarks we touch up-

on the possibility of corporate and noncorporate arbitragers with different

tax rates. For now,however, we make the customary assumption that the mar-

ket is dominated by corporations with tax rate u.       Because the corpora-

tion arbitrages between real capital and bonds yielding (l—u)i—ir, it is

either a borrower or lender at that real after—tax interest rate. In this

sense, we can take cJ.—u)i—rr as the net return to savings of the corporation,

S.
 c
     Thus, the corporate tax wedge, the effective gross rate, and the effective

net rate are given by



                = p —    = p—[(l—u)i—lT]
                      Sc


                 ____         p—[(l—u)i—Tr]         ,
                                                                         8
            c      p                p


                  p—s
                        c   = p—[(l—u)i—JT]
                    c          (l—u)i—1T


Note that the model developed in the previous section implies p and i

are functionally related to each other, and I is functionally related to

n. Hence the model implies values for the corporate tax wedge and the

corporate effective tax rates as functions of 71.

     If we imagine a corporation choosing to purchase a dollar's worth of

real assets with some funds it has in the bank, the net of tax real return

must be (l—u)I—7T; otherwise (2) would not be satisfied. This can be thought
                                               — 13 —




of   as income to the stockholders, who are taxed on it at marginal rate rn.

This personal rate is designed to capture the effective personal tax on these

earnings when part. may be paid as dividends and part retained. It should

also account for the low effective personal rate on accrued capital gains

resulting from retentions. The net return to stockholders on equity is thus

     In   two senses, these effective tax rates have nothing to do with

whether the investment is actually financed by issue of debt. First, because

i is a market interest rate, any debtholder with tax rate md will earn

The corporation earns p on a particular investment. The values p and Sd

are all that is required to define the effective tax rates, independently of

any connection between the two. Second, when the corporation makes its

real investment decisions by comparing the returns on capital and debt, there

is a connection between p and i. This relationship depends on potential

and not actual arbitrage, however. Thus the td expressions are not only

defined, but relevant for analysis regardless of whether debt finance is

actually used.
  Two points may be noted from these formulas before we proceed to illustrate

them. First,if the personal rate md happens to equal the corporate rate u,

then the total tax on debt (equation 10) is equivalent to the corporate

rate alone (equation 8). When Hall or J—S report effective corporate tax

rates         we can reinterpret them as total tax rates t on a debt

financed investment where the lender has a tax rate md equal to u.

        Second, if md is zero, then equation (10) implies



             g —   p—(i-ir) = (c/q—ó)—(i—r1)                           (11)
            td —                 (c/q—)
                      p


If we use equations (2) and (4b) to obtain p,     this is exactly the tax rate

on debt calculated by Hall (1981). Thus Hall's tax rates on debt can be
                                                                              For

the other extreme, we can simply look at the effective corporate tax rate

 ferent   real net of tax interest rates and for different assumptions about

how inflation affects nominal interest rates.

      The various eftective tax rate expressions are drawn together and summarized

in Table 1.


 11.3. Parameter Values

      Having specified the mechanisms determining the social rate of return

 and the saver's rate of return, we can explore the behavior of the various

effective tax rates under different assumptions about parameters. Hall

 (1981) has chosen a particular classification of investment types and saver

types; it will facilitate our discussion to adopt the same parameter values.

     First, take u to be .46, the marginal tax rate for corporations where

nearly all corporate investment takes place. For md. Hall uses a value

of zero, on the assumption that all bonds are held by tax—exempt institu-

tions. As we have mentioned, we can also consider the case of     mdu=.4€ with
no extra calculations or table space. Thirdly, let m equal .28, the

value chosen by Hall. He assumes that the typical stockholder is in the

40 percent bracket, receiving one—half of corporate equity income as fully

taxable dividends and the other half as capital gains. Only 40 percent of

the latter are included in the individual income tax base. We regard the

figure of .28 as somewhat high. The value of deferral and of the write—up

of capital gains basis at death probably cut the effective proportion of

accrued gains included in taxable income to something like 20

With this assumption,    me would be .24. For purposes of illustrating the

characteristics of the tax system, however, the difference is not of much

importance.

     Hall identifies three real assets. "Equipment" depreciates at 10 per—

cent   per year, receives a 10 percent investment tax credit, and is allowed

depreciation deductions at 15 percent per year. "Structures" depreciate at

an annual rate of 3 percent, receive no investment tax credit, but are allowed

accelerated depreciation deductions at 6 percent per year. Finally, "in-

tangibles" (e.g. advertising or R&D) are assumed to depreciate at 10 percent,

receive no tax credit, but may be written off immediately.These asset character-

istics are summarized in Table 2. Tax rate estimates will be sensitive to these

assumed parameters, but they do represent plausible examples of real asset charac-

teristics. Notice that equipment and intangibles are technologically

identical (have the same depreciation rate). We can thus attribute their

different results purely to differences in tax treatment.

       It remains to specify the interest rate. Hall chooses as his starting

point an assumed real after—corporate—tax interest rate of .04.      In   the

absence of inflation, this is our (l—u)i. We also consider .02 and .06

as alternative assumed values of (l—u)i. Whereas Hall takes Modified

Fisher's Law (4b) as given, we want to look at the effect of varying this

assumption. We take Strict Fisher's Law (4a) as an alternative. In each

case we display the results for (l—u)i        equal to .02, .04, and .06.

        As mentioned above, we consider ten percent inflation with (4a), ten

percent inflation with (4b), and zero inflation,a rate at which the two ver-

sions of Fisher's Law imply the same interest. We thus consider three inflation

assumptions, three distinct saver types, three asset types, and three values

of (l—u)i0. Any single interest—inflation combination can be used in one

direction to determine the social return on each investment, p, or in the

other direction to determine the return to each saver, s. The values of p

and s for all of these combinations are displayed in Table 3.

        Readers are advised to spend a few minutes absorbing Table 3. Notice,

for example, that because intangibles are expensed, this form of investment

is effectively untaxed at the corporate level (Ps). The column of real

returns on intangibles just shows the behavior of the real after—corporate—

tax interest rate under the various assumptions. With Strict Fisher's Law

and low values of (l—u)i, this interest rate is negative. The column

of real returns to tax—exempt debt holding savers, 5d' shows what happens

to i—it under the various assumptions. With Modified Fisher's Law, the

real rate of return to tax—exempt debt holders rises sharply with infla-

tion.

        Readers can now construct their own effective tax rates. First, choose

a row of Table 3.     Second, subtract from any real social rate of return

p, any saver's real return s in that row. Third, decide whether to divide

by the former, the latter, or not at all. In the remainder of this paper,

we discuss some of the issues to keep in mind during .this exercise.

III.    Three Caveats

111.1. Tax Rates are Sensitive to the Interest Rate

       The first of our three points is very simple, now that the apparatus

of Section II is available: effective tax rate estimates depend on the

assumed interest rate. Given ii,      the interest rate determines p. Thus

each tax rate, such as
                           c    e
                                     or
                                            d
                                                 is    a function of the interest rate.

Different tax estimates will result from different interest rates used as input.

       Later,we shall develop the point that tax rates are also sensitive to

how inflation affects nominal interest rates. To abstract from that point

here, consider the simple case with no inflation. Table 4, Part A, displays

the various gross tax rates under these circumstances.

       Let us pause to study the numbers in Table 4A. Looking across any

row, say for (l—u)i = .04,      we see the expected wide range of effective

rates applicable to different holders of different types of claims on dif-

ferent forms of real capital. The effective corporate tax rate on intangibles

is zero, because this asset receives immediate expensing,which is equivalent

to eliminating the tax. The corporation equates p on this investment

to the after—tn return it can earn on other assets, (l-.u)i. Since i is

the rate of return received by tax—exempt bondholders, their implied effective

tax rate is negative: t        (p—i)/p    = —u/(l—u)     -85 percent. The holder of

equity, on the other hand, pays a tax of 28 percent (the assumed value of

me) on p (l—u)i.

       Still for (l—u)i0 = .04,     the effective corporate rate on structures

is 37 percent, below the statutory rate of 46 percent. This difference re-

flects depreciation allowances in excess of economic depreciation. The
         percent
higher 55 /total tax rate on equity simply reflects the "double taxation"

of   corporate income. Finally for structures, the rate on debt is —16

percent. This subsidy is less than the subsidy for intangibles because

structures do not receive immediate expensing. This asset has a higher

marginal social rate of return while the return to debt—holding savers is

the same.

      The three tax rates for equipment follow a similar pattern. Invest-

ment tax credits and accelerated depreciation imply a near zero corporate

rate, while the rate on equity is higher and debt is lower.

      Now we turn to examination of the columns of Table 4A, that is, to the

effect of varying the assumed interest rate. We note immediately that the

effective taxes on intangibles are unaffected while those on equipment move

rather dramatically. The former result follows from the fact that the various

tax rates are simple multiples of (1—u), independent of 1. Put another

way, there are no delayed taxes or benefits with immediate expensing, so

the discount rate does not matter.

       The behavior of the effective taxes on equipment can be understood by

re—examining three aspects of equation (2). First, the return on the invest-

ment is indeed taxed at rate u. Second, it receives investment tax credit

at rate k. Third, it receives accelerated depreciation since 5' > 6       (we

can ignore historical cost problems here since ii   is   zero). When the dis-

count rate (l—u)i0 is low, the future depreciation advantages are relative-

ly more important. Together with the investment tax credit, they outweigh

the corporate tax, and a net subsidy results. As the discount rate increases,

accelerated depreciation becomes less and less important until the corporate

tax outweighs the credits and deductions,so a net tax results.

       The effective tax rates for structures turn out to be less sensitive to
                                      — 23   —




the interest rates in the range considered here. Because structures do not
qualify for the investment credit, the effective corporate tax rate must be

at least zero.

     The sensitivity to the Interest rate remains even when there Is in-

flation. Let us continue to delay the issue of how inflation affects nominal

interest rates. For now, just consider the case of equation (4b),

where the real after—corporate—tax interest rate (l—u)i—TT is constant.

The nominal Interest rate starts with no inflation at i=I0,          and increases

to ii + /(l—u) with Inflation at rate ir of 10 percent. Resulting

effective tax rate estimates are shown in Table 4B.



     Again the tax rates with (l—u)i = .04           reproduce estimates from Hall's

paper. Again the tax rates on intangibles are insensitive to this interest

rate, except for t.     The insensitive tax rates result from the fact that

the real after—tax interest rate is constant. For tax—exempt bondholders,

however, the real return rises because the equilibrium market interest rate

increases by more than the inflation rate. The higher is the inflation rate

(relative to the rate of return) the larger is this subsidy.

     Tax rates for equipment and structures in Table 4B may appear to be

fairly stable, but only because of the range for I. Hall reports a 44 percent

tax rate at (l—u)i0 =    .04, while the table shows a lower rate (40%)at .06
and a higher rate (54%) at .02. In fact, as (l—u)i            is reduced further,

the tax rate gets even higher. This sensitivity is displayed dramatically

in Figure 1, which plots t for equipment against the real after—tax in-

terest   rate (l—u)i    (l—u)i—ir with ten percent Inflation. With (l—u)i
between zero and   .06, one   obtains tax   rates   anywhere between 40   percent and

100 percent.

 111.2.       The Denominator Can Be Zero

     Our second caveat concerns the manner in which a given tax wedge is

expressed. Even if we agree on an intercst rate (in order to set aside the

problems of the previous section), the resulting tax rate estimate might

Imply that the entire return to investors Is financed by government through

investment tax credits and accelerated depreciation allowances that outweigh

the corporate tax. The required return on the investment, p, may be zero.

In this case the rate of tax            (p—s)/p is not defined. If the saver

obtains a positive rate of return, it is paid entirely by a tax subsidy.

While the gross tax rate is undefined, the net tax rate Is defined and equals

—100 percent. However, there Is no insurance against s going to zero either.

The real net of tax return of savers has even been negative in riskiess terms

with inflation. The remaining alternative is merely to report the total

wedge t"         p—s. This value can be Interpreted as a "property tax" rate, the

percentage of asset—value paid in tax each year.

     To illustrate the relevance of this problem,consider the corporate tax rates

   on equipment without Inflation. These tax rates are reported for selected

interest rates on the left side of Table 4A. They are also reproduced in

Figure 2 for all interest rates between zero and (l—u)i0              .06. With high

interest rates (.06), accelerated depreciation has a low present value, and
                                            =   .04,   as reported in Hall, tax credit
a small net tax results. At (l—u)i0

and depreciation advantages just about balance the tax at rate u, with an

effective corporate tax rate of nearly zero.            With lower interest rates, the

depreciation advantage is more important, p             is always less than (1—u)10,

                                       Is always negative. Near (l—u)i0         .014,
and t (the numerator of            C
          C
the subsidy rate can be as high as desired, since p approaches zero. With

                 is a percent of asset—value paid in tax each year. The other
           tax   rates are expressed as a percent of the capital. income flow.



     Table  5 summarizes the possibilities for this example of the effective
corporate tax on equipment with no inflation. The use of        is not really


acceptable,      because the subsidy at .01          appears as a + 322 percent tax. The
net rate t' seems         to make more sense, since the sign is correct
                                      — 28 —




here.    However, Table 3 reveals that Sc could also be negative in the

denominator of t. In such a case, a subsidy would again appear as a

positive net tax rate. Furthermore1 both gross and net tax rates are sub-

ject to misleadingly wide variation when their denominators are close to

zero.

        These considerations seem to point toward the use of   t' alone; we

do not need a denominator. This effective tax always has the right sign

and is not so sensitive to small changes in the assumption about interest

rates. However, the problem of the assumed interest rate does not vanish.

The tax wedge t' does become larger as the rate of return increases, even

though the rate of tax levels off as seen in Figure 2.

        The moral seems to be that analysts should report the underlying

components p and s, as well as summary figures such as tax wedges, gross

tax rates, or net tax rates. They should also include a discussion of the

sensitivity of these figures to the underlying assumptions. To follow our

own advice, we report tax wedges in Table 6 for each asset and inflation

scenario.     This table has the same format as Table 4.

111.3. The Inflation Assumption Matters
        Fisher's   original law predicted that I would increase by iT   in

a   world with no taxes. Since most investment takes place in corporations

with tax rate u, however, one is tempted to adopt the modified view that

should increase by n/(l—u), keeping constant the real Interest rate after

corporate taxes. This is the basis for Hall's assumption.

        There are, however, influences which weaken the a priori case for

this outcome. First, not all investors have the same marginal rate. If
                                                                  then the

argument behind Fisher's Law would imply that I increase only by n,
to keep their real (riontaxed) interest rate constant. Second, even if all

tax rates   did equal   u, historical cost depreciation and taxation of

nominal capital gains will tend to reduce the real net return on invest-

ments when there is inflation. These features imply that the interest rate

would tend to rise by less than 1T/(l—u) with inflation.

     Feldstein—Surnrners (1978) have estimated that inflation adds approxi-

mately point—for—point to nominal interest rates. This is not the result

of a simple Fisher's Law without taxes. Rather, it is the result of two

countervailing forces within the tax system: taxation of nominal interest

at some average rate, call it m, tends to raise i by 111(1—tn), while

historical cost depreciation and taxation of nominal capital gains tend to

pull the adjustment below this level.

     Jorgenson and Sullivan also use empirical work to support their assumption

of a constant real after—tax rate of return on corporate investment. This

estimated constancy would appear to contradict the results of Feldstein and

Summers. The difference can be reconciled by a limitation on arbitrage be-

tween bonds and real capital, implicitly invoked by i—S. With such a limita-

tion, real after—tax interest rates could fall with inflation (Feldstein and

Summers), while real after—tax rates of return are constant (J—S). In terms

of our analysis, the J—S procedure is equivalent to assuming Modified Fisher's

Law as far as effective corporate and equity tax rates are concerned. Cal-

culating effective tax rates applicable to bondholders would require a

separate model of interest determination.

     The choice between Strict and Modified Fisher's Laws does affect tax

rate estimates. As is clear from Table 3, the required real social returns

on investment, p, and the real net return to savers, s, depend critically

on how inflation affects the nominal interest rate.
                                  — 31 —




     Consider first the Strict Fisher's Law of equation (4a). With ten
percent inflation, Table 3 shows low and even negative required real rates

of return on investment. If the demand for capita]. is inversely related to

this required return, (4a) implies an increased capital stock. At the same

time, Table 3 shows lower real rewards to saving under Strict Fisher's Law.

If the supply of savings is positively related to its real net return,

this would imply a decreased capital stock. The nominal interest rate would

have to increase by more than ir to encourage savers to supply enough capital

to meet investment demand. The figures in Table 3 by themselves cannot repre-

sent an equilibrium.

     Now consider Modified Fisher's Law (4b). The large nominal interest in-

crease associated with inflation implies a higher required real return on two

of the three illustrative asset categories of Table 3. The higher required

p would suggest lower incentives to invest. At the same time, however, most

savers are receiving higher real returns with inflation.   These Table 3 figures

cannot be in equilibrium, either. Only if interest rates increased by some-

thing less than /(l—u) would savers' desired wealth match the producers' de-

sired capital.

     Thus equations (4a) and (4b) represent two logical possibilities for an

unknown relationship: the truth is likely to lie somewhere in between. If

the assumption of Hall and J—S is correct, then gross tax rates   with i.l

will look like Part B of Table 4. If, on the other hand, estimates from

Feldstein—Summers (1978) are correct, gross tax rates with   it=.l will look

like Part C of Table 4.

     Table 4C illustrates some of the difficulties to which effective tax

rates are subject. The corporate rates on equipment and structures are nega—
                                      32 —




  tive   when (1—u)i0 Is .02. As can be confirmed by reference to Table 3

  these are cases of negative social rates of return. Since the return received


 by a 46 percent bondholder is even more negative, these negative numbers in

 4C reflect a positive tax. At higher values of (l—u)I, relatively large

 positive corporate tax rates are shown. If we compare the tax rates here to

 those with no inflation in 4A, we might draw the conclusion that inflation

 effects a disincentive to Invest. Again, a glance at the social rates of

 return in Table 3 will confirm that P is sharply lower with inflation and

 Strict Fisher's Law. This can only be the result of Increased Investment,

 which pushes down the marginal rate of return. Such an outcome Is to be

 expected, since inflation lowers real corporate borrowing costs under this as-

 sumption. The relative Increase In effective tax rates is simply the result

 of much smaller denominators in the gross tax rate formula.

     One last anomaly will complete the catalog of illustrations. Look at

 intangibles in the bottom right-hand corner of Table 4. We now have out-

 rageous t tax rates between —694 percent and +1335 percent. Table 3 or 6

 reveals that the wedge (P_sd) is in fact negative for all three values of

 (l—u)i. For .02 and .04, however, this subsidy is larger than the saver's

 return, and p is negative in the denominator. We thus have negative numbers

 In Table 4 reflecting positive taxes, and positive numbers in the table

 reflecting negative taxes.


IV. Concluding Remarks

     Table 4 exemplifies three separate conclusions. Tax rates are sensitive

to the interest rate (.02, .04, .06), tax rates are sensitive to the assumed

effect of inflation on nominal interest (part B vs. part C), and tax rates

are not best expressed as a percent of gross capital income p

     Beyond the three major caveats discussed in this paper, there exist

other more subtle problems. We are forced by the limits of this paper to

abstract from them, as have other studies. However, we might take a few

paragraphs to outline these problems for the sequel.

     Different effective tax rates are useful for different purposes. First,

one may want an average tax rate or "flow of funds" rate to capture income

effects, as described in our introduction. Second, there are different types

of marginal tax rates. Capital income can increase because of higher rates

of return or because of more investment. Since only the latter induces an

investment credit, for example, the effect on taxes is not the same.

Feldstein and Summers (1979) are not interested in the additional tax

associated with another unit of investment. Instead, they seek to measure

the effects of inflation on taxes. They need to specify the effect of

inflation on nominal interest rates as well as the effect of nominal inter-

est rates on real taxes paid.

     Third, even if we agreed on marginal tax rates for additional investment,

we might want an effective corporate rate, an effective personal rate, or

the total effective wedge between the marginal product and the saver's rate

of time preference. Consider for a moment the use of each such rate. The

assumptions of our investment model rely heavily on a single market interest

rate. Given this baseline for all corporate investment, the "effective

corporate tax rates" can be used to measure the misallocations of capital

among assets in the corporate sector. They cannot be used, for example,

to capture misallocations between the corporate and noncorporate sectors.

Given the same market interest rate as a baseline, different savers earn

different net of tax returns. Thus "personal effective tax rates" can be
                                  — 34 —




used to measure a "misallocation" of savings in the personal sector: not

all marginal rates of time preference are identical. Finally, only the

total effective wedge between the marginal social rate of return p (aver-

aged over different assets), and the marginal rate of time preference s

(averaged over different savers), can be used to measure the misallocation

of consumption between present and future periods, as caused by capital

income taxation.

     Analyses of allocative and distributive effects are hampered by the

questionable consistency of the tax rates estimated with the assumption of

overall equilibrium in capital markets.2lCondition (2) expresses the

requirement that the corporation should have maximized its profits in

equilibrium. There can then be no potential for the corporation to gain

by arbitrage between bonds and real capital. There are, however, other

conditions one might wish to hold. For example, it might be required that

profits of noncorporate investors from the same sort of arbitrage be elimina-

ted. Equilibrium would then call for the analogue of condition (2), but with

the proprietor's marginal rate in replacing the corporate marginal rate u.

But (2) cannot hold for both in   and   u .   (unless   they are equal).

     For the model to tell a consistent story about the effect of taxes,

it is necessary to find a way for corporations, individuals, and tax—

exempt institutions to be in equilibrium simultaneously. There are

two basic ways such a reconciliation might be accomplished. The first

is to adopt assumptions that constrain the agents of the model. For

example, it seems natural to impose borrowing limits on individuals,

and to limit negative positions in (short sales of) real capital. One
                                    —35


might simultaneously assume that corporate and noncorporate technologies

are distinct, so that investment opportunities available to corporations

are not available to other firms.

     By a careful combination of such restrictions, a consistent model

should be feasible. At this stage, the point to emphasize is that the

particular constraints imposed are likely to have a significant bearing

on the distorting consequences attributable to taxes.   Take as an example

the constraint that tax—exempt savings by individuals are subject to

fixed ceilings. This assumption Is likely to eliminate any allocative

effects of the sort of subsidy to zero bracket bondholders that is

apparent from Table 4 or Table 6.

     The method of imposing constraints is likely to imply extreme

specialization of portfolios. Individuals will hold only stock or bonds,

for example, not both. The rates of return in the analysis above are

treated as certain, and hence no one would hold assets generating dif-

ferent yields. Actual assets, however, are risky. Thus a second

approach to resolving the problem of inconsistency is to attempt an

explicit treatment of risk.

     This undertaking would clearly be difficult, but it is important to

explore. The effect of taxing the return to saving may be quite different

from the effects of taxing risk premia. As shown in Gordon (1981), and

as estimated in Fullerton—Gordon (1981), a tax on risk premia may con-

stitute a simple risk sharing by government, with no distorting effect

at all.

     Pending modelling advances along the lines described here, we would

urge those who construct and use effective tax rates to exercise appro-

priate caution.

1. By the real rate of return P we mean the internal rate of return

    of the project's real cash flow, gross of taxes and subsidies. Be-

    cause we confine our attention to simple cases, this rate is always

    well defined.

2. Note we have assumed that the corporation will actually manage to use

    its investment credit and that it will benefit from the subsequent de-

    preciation allowances. This assumption is far from innocuous because

    the actual income tax is nonlinear. This nonlinearity is obvious for

    the case of most individuals, but also holds for corporations risking

    low or negative taxable income. We have also assumed that depreciation

    allowances are based on the historical cost of the asset gross of the

    investment credit. Finally, note that the cash flow to an individual

    asset owner with marginal tax rate m is obtained by substituting m

    for u in these expressions.

3. One way of modelling the imperfect substitutability of debt and real

    capital is to regard the corporatipn as subject to constraints on this

    arbitrage, e.g., the outstanding debt cannot exceed some fraction of

    the value of real assets owned. In this case the relationship (1) will

   not generally hold for firms where the constraint binds. Other re-

    lationships must then determine c/q. See, for example, King (1977).

   However, the assumption (if only implicit) of unconstrained debt—real

   capital arbitrage is frequently encountered.
