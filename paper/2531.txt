                  The Line Item Veto and Public Sector Budgets:
                            Evidence from the States




                                    ABSTRACT



     Recent proposals assume that endowing the U.S. President
with a line item veto will reduce spending. Analysis of a rich
set of state budget data indicates that long run budgets are not
altered by an item veto. In the short run, the item veto's
potency is contingent upon the political setting. Governors with
political incentives to use an item veto alter spending and
revenues in a statistically significant and quantitatively
important fashion. These results suggest that adoption of the
line item veto, in general, is unlikely to reduce the size of the
federal government.

1.   Introduction

          "We ask the Congress, once again: Give us the
          same tool that 43 Governors have, a line-item
          veto so we can carve out the boondoggles and
          pork -- those items that would never survive
          on their own."

                       Ronald Reagan, January 27, 19871

     Ronald Reagan is the latest U.S. President to tout the

virtues of a line item veto.2'3       His quote above captures the
conventional wisdom concerning the effects of a line item veto:
the ability to veto individual spending lines will reduce

undesirable, "pork barrel" spending and, thus, reduce overall

spending.4   Due to recent interest in reducing federal spending,

some commentators have proposed a line item veto for the U.S.

President. (See, e.g. Ross and Schwengel [19821.)

     Does the line item veto reduce spending?         The purpose of
this paper is an empirical assessment of the impact of the line

item veto using evidence from state governments.        The states have
a long time span    of experience   with   the line item veto.

Moreover, there is substantial variation across states in the

precise nature of the item veto, the political environment, and
economic constraints that may permit isolation of the effect of
the line item veto.    Thus, examination of the states provides an

insight into the effects of this fiscal institution and gives a
guide to its likely impact at the federal level.
     An important feature of the line item veto is that it is not

an exogenous constraint on the agents in the government.         Rather,
the line item veto alters the relative power of the governor

                                    -1—
versus the legislature.    Analyses which ignore this are will

result in incorrect inferences.    A key feature   of the analysis

below is the incorporation of this relative bargaining power

into the estimation of the impact of the line item veto on the
state budget.

       To preview the results, evidence from cross-state averages

suggests that long run budgetary behavior is not significantly
affected by the power of an item veto.    This holds for

specifications that incorporate the political composition of the
state legislature and governorship and specifications that do

not.    In the short run, however, the presence of item veto power

significantly alters the budgetary package and the size and
direction of the effect hinges critically upon the political

makeup of the governorship and the legislature.      In particular,

the impact of the item veto is most pronounced when a governor

faces a legislature controlled by the opposing political party,

but has the capability    of preventing an override of the item

veto.

        In these circumstances, the power of an item veto serves to

reduce deficits, but the mechanics differ by party.      Under

Democratic governors, current spending is most affected, while

under Republican governors capital outlays are reduced.      On the

revenue side, non-tax revenues are reduced in both instances.

Perhaps surprisingly, under both parties the effect of the item
veto is to increase both grants-in-aid to local governments and

tax revenues.

                                  —2—
     The paper is organized   as follows.   The next section reviews
previous research on the effects of the line item veto.      Section
3 discusses the role of   a line item veto in budget determination.
The data used in this study and econometric issues are discussed

in Section 4.   Section 5 contains .the empirical results.   The
final section is a summary and conclusions.



2.   Previous Research

     While there is often a presumption that the line item veto
will reduce spending, there is little empirical evidence to

either support or refute this proposition.    For example, Ross and

Schwengel [1982) claim that the item veto has controlled spending
in the states, but provide no evidence.     In a similar fashion,

Zycher [1985) argues that a federal line item veto 'will not

work', but supports this stance by simply comparing levels of
spending (in 1984) between states with and without the veto;

ignoring other potentially important determinants of the state
(and local) government budget.
     In a multiple regression study, ACIR [1986b) concludes that

the total number of gubernatorial vetoes significantly reduces

spending and regulation.   Unfortunately, the study cannot
distinguish between line item and other vetoes.    Abrams and

Dougan [1986] find a negative correlation between spending and
the existence of an item veto, but treat the item veto as an

exogenous constraint on state governments.    While suggestive,
these latter two studies employ a single year of cross section


                                 —3—
data and cannot distinguish between the effects of a line item

veto and unobserved state characteristics which are correlated

with the existence of an item veto e.g, fiscal "thriftiness").
In addition, the results may hinge upon the particular year

chosen for study.

     In the other direction, some narrow evidence suggests that

the primary   use of item vetoes   is not to control spending at all.

                                                        conclude
Abney and Lauth (1985) survey state budget officers and
that item vetoes are primarily employed to obtain "partisan"

political objectives.    Similarly, Gosling (1986] examines the use

of the   item veto in Wisconsin and concludes that   it has been used

                                                          These
primarily for partisan and non-spending policy purposes.
studies, in turn, suggest that a Presidential line item veto
would largely serve to shift additional partisan power to support
the White House policy agenda.
     Given the paucity of evidence, the time seems ripe for a

careful empirical look at the effects of the item veto on state
revenues and expenditures.



3.   The Line Item Veto and State Budgets


      3.1   Models of Budgetary Determination

     How does the line item veto affect the level and composition
of state budgets? To begin, one must specify a model of the

determination of the public   sector activities.     Unfortunately,

no consensus exists concerning the appropriate specification of

                                   —4—
such a model.       Inong the (not necessarily disjoint) candidates
are the median voter model (Black               (1948]), models in the

"Leviathan" tradition (see, e.g., Oates [1985]), models of

interest group activity (see, e.g., Mueller and Murrell [1986]),
or general models of the political economy of budgeting (e.g.

Craig and Inman [l985J).
         In order to motivate the empirical work below, consider the

following example.         Assume that the government produces two

goods.     The first is      a capital intensive good which requires

investment in the present in order to raise future provision.

The second     is produced directly from current spending.             In each

of two time periods (t=l,2), agents have Cobb-Douglas utility

functions over the per capita value of the two government
activities and a single, composite private good:


(3.1)      Uj(St,Ct,Xjt) =       cLjllfl(St) + aj2ln(Ct) +   (l-ajl-a2)ln(Xt)
where i indexes agents, St is the capital intensive good per

capita,    C   is the per capita current expenditure on the second

good, and      Xj   is   per capita after-tax income available for the
purchase of private goods.            For simplicity, assume that the flow

of   S    is proportional to the existing capital stock and that the

constant of proportionality is set equal to one.               Then:


(3.1')     Ui(Kt,Ct,Xit)
                             =   i1ln(Kt)   +   a21n(Ct) +   (l-1-j2)ln(X1)
Taxes per capita, T1 and T2, are levied in each time period so
that:


                                         —5—
(3.2)                          —   Tt,            t=l,2

The capital        stockevolves according          toe:



(3,3)
              K1
                    = K   +    Ii
              K2 = K1 + 12

where K is the initial capital stock and                  I is   the level of

investment spending in period t.                 The chosen tax/expenditure

program must satisfy the present value government budget
constraint:


(3.4)         T1+DT211+C1+D12+DC2
where Dsl/(1+r) and r is the constant real rate of interest,

     It is straightforward to verify that the optimal first

period current spending (Cii), capital spending 'jl' total

spending (El), and taxes (Tjt) chosen by agent i are given by:

                                                                      -   K

                               -                               + Y1 + DY2)
(3.5c)        Ti          Y1

                                                               for
where    3sl/(l+ô) and .Sj is the pure rate of time preference

     Clearly, agents will differ in their preferred levels
                                                       the
public sector spending (E1) and taxes {T1), as well as

                                            —6—
composition (C1 or   1i   of any given level of spending.      These

differences are due to differences in the parameters of their

utility functions (ail,    j)    and their parameter of time

preference,
     What budgetary package will prevail?        The simplest approach

is to appeal to the median voter model of public provision.

Under the appropriate assumptions, the budget adopted is the

preferred budget of the median voter.     As such, it will be a

function of the determinants of demand (income, the relative

price of public goods, prices of related goods, etc.) for a

single individual: the median voter.
     What is the role of a line item veto?        If observed budget

decisions are the outcome of a single agent's private utility

maximization, there is no rationale for institutional mechanisms
to control spending.      The private sector   gets,   by definition,
what it wants from the public sector.

     Suppose, instead, that individual jurisdictions elect

representatives and that the median voter model is an accurate

description of the outcomes of elections both within each
jurisdiction and in the statewide election of the governor.

Further, assume that the governor has a line item veto such that
he may unilaterally veto any particular line in the budget.8

     Each representative in the state legislature will reflect

the preferences of the median voter of his or her district.             The

state legislative process will consist of the "votes" (by proxy)
of each local median voter.      If the legislature votes as a single

                                   -7—
body on spending proposals,9the bill which passes will be that
favored by the median point in the distribution of median voters

across the jurisdictions.

     The governor, in contrast, will reflect    the tastes of the

median   voterin the statewide distribution   of all voters.   For an

arbitrary distribution of tastes in the population, the desired

budget of the legislature and the desired budget of the governor
will not necessarily coincide.    Here there is a rationale for a

line item veto: to restrict the influence of jurisdictions with

either unusually high or unusually low tastes.1-°,--     Thus, the
desire to endow the governorship with a line item veto authority

is possible even when politicians passively reflect the

preferences of their constituents.
     What are the implications of this scenario for budget
determination?   In this instance, the observed budget   will be
determined by the governor's preferences.     By assumption these
coincide with those of the statewide median voter.     However,

across states spending will differ depending upon the presence of
a line item veto power, even after controlling for differences in

tastes, incomes, etc. of the median voters)-2

     Finally, consider a bicameral legislature.    Following the

reasoning above, the proposal by each house of the legislature
will be the median preferred budget among the median voters

represented.   Here, however, the final legislative proposal will

be the outcome of a bargaining process between the two houses.
As such, it will reflect the relative bargaining powers of the


                                 —8—
two legislative bodies.     That is, the legislative proposal to the

governor will be a weighted average of the preferred amounts in
the upper and lower houses, where the weights are determined by

the relative strength of the two houses.      Again, however, the

governor will exercise an item veto the bill if the budget
exceeds the median voters tastes and the observed budget will

coincide with that desired by the statewide median voter.

     Thus far, the discussion has been devoted to the level of

total spending in the budget.     An important feature of line item

veto power is the power to alter the composition of spending and

revenue.    In terms of the example above, the governor and

legislature may differ in their preferred mix of spending for

present (C1) and future     1i) public goods, but have similar
tastes for the mix between public (E1) and private (X1)

spending.    Use   of the line item veto permits the governor to

alter the mix of budgetary activitiesj3 Thus, it is possible

that empirical research may find no effect on the total level of

spending or revenues, but a substantial impact on the composition
of the budget.



     3.2    Econometric Specification

     This discussion suggests that empirical research should

examine the budget at less than the aggregate level of spending

or revenues, employ    a specification which includes the
determinants of private demand for public goods, and captures the

political incentives of the governor and legislature in both the

                                  —9—
determination of the budget and exercise of veto power.

     With regard to the first of these, this study examines three

categories of state expenditure: current expenditure, capital
expenditure and transfers of grants in aid to local governments.
For completeness, two categories of revenues are also

investigated: total tax revenue and total non tax revenue.
     For each of these variables, two types             of   models are

estimated.    The first, "basic", model is a straightforward

extension of a conventional expenditure model to include a dummy

variable   for line item veto power.             The second, "political",
model more carefully specifies the political circumstances in

which a line item veto might be expected to influence outcomes.


     A.    Basic Model
     In this investigation,           I choose    a relatively small set of
economic variables to proxy private demand and focus on the

effects of veto power.           The demand curve in the analysis is

assumed to be a function of state per capita income, population,

grant receipts, and beginning of year state financial assets and
liabilities.       To test for the impact         of the line item veto, each

equation is augmented with a dichotomous variable which takes a
value of one if the governor has line item veto power and is zero

otherwise.    Thus, for each of the five dependent variables, the

equation estimated is of the form:


(3.6)        "it     XitI3   +   Vj   +   it
                                          —10—
where        is the dependent variable (e.g. current expenditure)

in state i during year t,           Xj   is the vector of demand

determinants,    V     is   the indicator variable for line item veto
power, and    uj   is a random error.


        B.   Political Model

        In this section, I modify the analysis to incorporate

aspects of the political bargaining which determines the observed

budget.      As in the basic model, the demand curve is assumed to be

a function of state per capita income, population, grant

receipts, and beginning of year state financial assets and
liabilities.       However,     I   assume that the parameters of the demand

function differ across political parties.            More precisely, I

assume that parties are monolithic (i.e. members vote strictly

along party lines) and that each political party (Democrat or
Republican) has a well defined demand function.
        What budget will the legislature propose?         If   a party has   a

majority of seats in any house of the legislature, then the

budget preferred by that house is assumed to be the preferred
budget of the majority party.
        If different parties control each house, legislative budgets

demand will be a weighted average of the party demands.              Should

the same party control both houses, the preferred legislative

budget is simply the budget of that controlling party.              Put

formally, the legislative demand is given by:


                     Xj3    +   (DL.XitD) + (RL'XjtR)
                                         -11—
where      is parameter vector of the weighted average of party

demands,    D is   the parameters of Democratic party demand,          is

the parameters of Republican party demand,      DL1    if Democrats

control both houses of the       legislature, RL1 if   Republicans

control both houses, and both are zero otherwise.

        Observed budgets reflect the tastes of the governor as well.

In the event that the governor is of the same party as that

controlling the legislature, no modification of (3.7) is

necessary.14       In the event of a "minority governor" --   a
governor who is of the opposite party from that controlling the

legislature --     the   governor can use his political standing, power
to veto entire bills, etc. to alter the observed budget.          To

capture this, equation (3.7) is augmented by a dummy variable to
indicate the presence of a minority governor.

        Finally, what is the correct empirical measure of the
influence exerted on the budget by line item veto power?          The

simple approach in the basic model is to use a dummy variable

equal to one if the governor has a line item veto power and equal
to zero otherwise.

        But it may be possible to do better than this.     First, not

all line item vetoes are created equal.       Table 1 summarizes the

variety of institutions.15        As shown in column 1, 43 of the state

governors have some type of line item veto power.1-6        Of these,

nearly a quarter (10) have the further ability to reduce the

proposed expenditure in lieu of an outright veto.         In addition,


                                    —12—
the governor of Alabama may submit an entirely new measure for

consideration.   Finally, 14 governors (column   4)   may veto not

just an entire line item, but also may strike out languag in

bills, while retaining the spending amount)-7
     Thus, one might wish to differentiate among these
alternative forms of line item veto power.    However, preliminary

research (Iioltz-Eakin [19873) indicated no significant

econometric differences among these alternative forms.

Accordingly, below I focus simply upon the presence or absence of
some form of line item veto power.

     There is a second, political, aspect to the measure of line

item veto power.   As stressed by lthney and Lauth [19853, item

vetoes may be influenced by partisan desires.      In the same

fashion, they may be restricted by political feasibility.

Consider, the extreme case of, say, a Republican governor
contemplating the veto of an item in a bill produced by a

legislature composed entirely of Democrats.      Given the assurance

of a legislative override of the veto, in what sense does the

governor have a veto "power"? The correct measure of veto power
is one in which ability to sustain the veto is considered.

     To accommodate this, I detail two degrees of veto power.          In

the first, the party of governor has sufficient seats in either

the upper or lower house of the legislature to prevent an
override of the veto; i.e. to sustain the veto.       Still, this is

not entirely satisfactory.   It includes the case in which the

same party controls the upper house, the lower house, and the

                                —13—
governorship.     In this instance, presumably the executive and the
                                           and there will be no
legislature will have the same preferences
incentive to veto. Thus, I create a second measure in which the
                                                         but the
opposing party controls both the upper and lower house,
                                                       to sustain
governor's party has sufficient votes in either house
the veto.    This will be referred to as the ability of a minority

governor to sustain the veto.
        To summarize, the specification of budget determination in

the political model is:


(3.8)        it   =           + (DL.Xit)3D) (RL.XitR) +
                                    + a2D + a3(DxVjt) +         a4(DxVt)      -

4.   Data and Econometric Issues



      4.1   Data

      Three types of data are needed for the analysis budgetary

data for the states, population characteristics of the states,

and political make-up of the state governments. Budgetary data
are taken from the Bureau of the Census Governmental Finances,

for the years 1965 to 1983.   All variables are measured as

logarithms of real 1972 dollars per capita.    Expenditures are
deflated using the Gross National Product implicit price deflator

for state-local government purchases.   Revenues are deflated

using the implicit price deflator for personal consumption

expenditures.
      Grant receipts are the sum of transfers from the federal and
all local governments to the state government.    Assets is the per

capita real value of state holdings of cash and financial assets
at the start of the fiscal year.   Similarly, Debts is the real

per capita value of outstanding short and long term debt.     These

variables are converted to constant dollars using the deflator

for personal consumption expenditures and are entered as

logarithms.

      The population characteristics used   are the logarithm of

total population and the logarithm of real 1972 personal income

per capita.
      Political data are taken from the Inter-University

Consortium for Political and Social Research's data set Partisan

                               —15—
Division of State Governments.    This provides the total number of

seats in both the upper and lower house of the state legislature,

the fraction held by each political party, and the party of the

governor.
        Means and standard deviations of the data are presented in

Table 2.     The sample covers the years 1966 to   1983 and includes

48 states.     Alaska is excluded due to its unique budgetary

patterns and Nebraska is excluded because its unicameral

legislature is not consistent with the specification used herein.
        The bottom two panels of the table show the interaction of

explanatory variables with either Democratic or Republican
control of the governorship or both houses of the legislature.

Thus,    55% of the observations are for Democratic governors and

38% are for Republicans.     Interestingly, in 36% of the cases
Democrats controlled both houses of the legislature, while in 12%

Republicans had the same power.    Thus, fully 48% of the time a

single party controls both houses.      Further in 29% of the cases,

control of the legislature and governorship rested in opposing

parties and in nearly all of these instances, the governor had
line item veto power.     Importantly, however, in only half of
these cases (14% of the total sample) did the governor have
sufficient party votes in the legislature to sustain a veto.



        4.2 Econometric Issues

        Perhaps the most convincing evidence that the line item
veto per se affects either the level or composition of the public

                                 -16-
sector budget would be long run evidence, evidence not dependent

on variations in politics, economic setting, or other short run

behavior.

        To explore this possibility,   I   use a specification for both

the basic and political model in which each variable is expressed

the mean value over time for each state.        Accordingly, the
                                                           veto
parameters are estimated, and the effects of the line item
are evaluated, using only cross-state variation in the data.

        This procedure is subject to a potentially important bias,

however.     To the extent that there exist state-specific
attributes which both affect spending and revenues and are

correlated with the right hand side variables, the parameter

estimates will be biased and inconsistentJ8 It is possible to

control for both state-specific and year-specific effects by

using a fixed effects estimator.       In practice, this requires

entering the variables as deviations from state and year means.

Thus,    the parameters are estimated using a different source of

variation: the intra-state variation over time.

        Unfortunately, use of deviations from means precludes

estimation of the coefficient of any variable which does not vary
over time; particularly the coefficient of the dummy variable for

a line item veto in the basic model.         For this reason, I estimate

only the political model using the fixed effects technique.


5.   Results

        In this section I present the results of estimating the

                                  —17—
models discussed in Section 3.     A full report      of the parameter

estimates is contained in Tables    3    through 5.   Before turning to

a discussion the estimated effects of       the line item veto, it is

worth noting that the estimated models perform quite well in

general.    The estimated population and income elasticities are

consistent with previous research on the demand for public

spending.
     As a check of the plausibility of the results, one can

compute the reaction of the entire budget to an increase in per

capita income.   Using the income coefficients reported in line 2
of Table 5, one finds that a $100 increase in income        per capita
results in a $2.87 increase in current spending, a $1.41 increase

in capital outlays,   and   a $0.69 increase in grants-in-aid.      Total

spending per capita rises by $4.97.        On the revenue side, the

increased income raises tax revenues by $3.96 and non-tax
revenues by $0.22, for a total rise of $4.18.

     Another interesting comparison is the spending effects of

federal aid versus that of income.        Using the estimated
coefficients in line 3 of Table 5, an increase of $100 in outside

aid per capita increases current spending by $46.11 and capital

spending by $16.73.    Clearly, increases aid per capita are far

more stimulative than equivalent increases in income per capita,

a result suggestive of the "flypaper effect".          (See Gramlich

t1977)   for a discussion of the flypaper effect.)        This is

somewhat misleading, however, as the flypaper effect refers to a
differential spending impact resulting from identical increases

                                  —18—
in the resources of the decisive voter.        In this instance, the

results are entirely consistent with the absence of a flypaper

effect if the decisive voter's share of taxes in the state is

larger than his share of income in the state.19

     Finally, while not the main focus of this research, the
tables do indicate that legislatures controlled by Democrats

(lines 7 to 12 of Tables   4   and   5) and Republicans (lines 17 to

22) differ significantly from legislatures which are coalitions

of the   two parties. The estimated differential propensities to

spend and tax out of income, assets, and debts are often
significantly different from zero in these circumstances.
     I leave examination of individual coefficient estimates to

the reader and turn to discussing the estimated effects of the

line item veto on the observed budgets.


     5.1    Cross-State Means

     The results of estimating the basic model using cross-state

means are presented in Table 3.         The conclusion which emerges
from an examination of Table     3 is    that the line item veto has no

significant impact on long run behavior.         More specifically, only

in the equation for capital expenditure is the coefficient

indicating dummy veto power different from zero at conventional
levels of significance.    Neither is there a consistent pattern to

the sign of the impact of the line item veto.          Based on this

evidence, one would not expect that adding item veto power at the
federal level would affect long run budgetary behavior.

                                     —19—
        Is this the result of ignoring the political setting in

which the item veto is embedded?         Table 4 presents the results of

estimating the political model using cross state averages.            The

same general result is found the line item veto is not

correlated with variations in average, observed budgets.            The

only statistically significant coefficient is found in the

equation for non-tax revenues in panel        (b)   of the table.   There

one finds that minority governors tend to reduce the amount of

non-tax revenues.         However, minority governors with an item veto

tend to raise these revenue sources.         The net effect is close to

zero.

        In sum,   the   evidence from variations in long run behavior by

the states does not lead one to conclude that the line item veto

is a potent force in budget determination.          At that same time, it

sheds doubt on the conjecture that a line item veto for the U.S.

president will tend to either reduce the level or alter the mix
of spending and revenues.

        Still, there are reasons to be cautious about these results.
Use of means greatly restricts the number of observations and the

estimates may be subject to the biases as discussed above.            The

next section looks at the results from the fixed effects

estimation procedure, which uses many more observations and

controls for state-specific attributes.

        5.2) Fixed Effects

        The results of estimating the political model, equation

                                     —20-
(3.8), controlling for state-effects are presented in Table 5.

Panel    (a)   contains the results for expenditures and panel (b)

for revenues.

        How does the line item veto affect spending? States with
Democratic governors having a line item veto exhibit lower

current and grants expenditures, but greater capital expenditure

(line 12).       Note, however, that only the latter coefficient is

statistically significant.       In contrast, states with Republicans

governors holding a veto power produce significantly more of both
current and capital expenditure, but less grants in aid (line

22).

        The discussion in Section   3   suggests that the party

composition of both the governorship and the legislature will
determine the impact of the line item veto on budgets.            For

Democratic governors, these effects are shown in lines 13 to 15.
Democratic governors facing Republican controlled legislatures

sign budgets with significantly more current expenditures and

significantly less grants in aid (line 13).         Importantly, line 14
indicates that in the same situations a governor with a line item

veto results in a budget with significantly lower current and

capital expenditure and significantly higher grants in aid --

precisely the      opposite sign pattern to a governor without the
veto power.       Line 15 indicates that these budgetary patterns are

not significantly altered by the numerical ability of the

Democrats in the legislature to sustain a veto.

        Lines 22 to 25 of panel   (a)   contain a similar set of results


                                    -21—
for Republican governors.     States with Republican minority

governors have higher capital and current expenditure, but lower

grants in aid.   As above, those states in which there is

additionally a line item veto result in lower capital

expenditure.   Unlike the Democratic case, there is no additional

statistically significant effect of the line item veto on current

expenditure and grants in aid.       The final line   line   25)

indicates, however, that in those cases where a minority

Republican governor can sustain his veto, current expenditure is
lower and grants in aid are increased.

    Thus, the item veto has a significant effect in the hands of

minority governors of either party and this effect serves to
reverse the budgetary pattern of states with minority governors

lacking veto power.   Current and capital spending are reduced and

grants in aid increased.    Lastly, there is evidence suggesting
that in this sample the power of Republican governors is more

dependent upon the ability of the governor to sustain the veto in
the legislature.
    The final panel of Table     5   contains the results for the

revenue side of the budget.    The most prominent feature is that

veto power has far fewer significant effects on the composition

and level of revenues than on the composition and level of

expenditures. Moreover, unlike the expenditure equations, the
effects differ by party.

     For Democrats, minority governors in states with a

sustainable veto produce budgets with significantly more tax

                                 —22—
revenues than in those states without a veto power.          (See lines

13 and 15 of panel (b).)      In contrast, the effect of a

sustainable veto in states with Republican minority governors is

to reduce non-tax revenues raised by the state (line 25).



        5.3 Implications

        The parameter estimates in Table   5   imply a complicated

pattern of spending and revenue raising effects arising from item
veto power and the political setting.          To simplify the

presentation, Table 6 summarizes the total impact of the item
veto,    on average, under various political circumstances.2°

        The major lesson   of Table 6 is that there are no simple

truths concerning the impact of the line item veto.          In only

three of the six possible cases shown does the line item veto

result in a reduced budget deficit.       Similarly, in only one half

the cases does total direct (current plus capital) spending fall
due to the presence    of the item veto.

        At the same time, it does appear that there are differences

across parties in the effects of minority governors with a line

item veto, sustainable or otherwise.       In these cases, Democratic

governors tend to have budgets with reduced current spending,
while the budgets of Republican governors contain reduced capital

spending.
        There are similarities across parties as well.       Governors of

both parties administer budgets with lower levels of non-tax

revenues than would otherwise prevail,          Perhaps surprisingly,

                                   —23—
under there are circumstances in which the item veto in the hands

of either party increases both grants-in-aid to local governments

and tax revenues.

     Finally, the calculations in Table 6 do suggest that the
item veto has, at times, a quantitatively important role in the

determination of state budgets.    For example,   a   $22.25 reduction
in current spending amounts to a fall on the order of 10% in

spending, although not all the results are this large.


6)   S
     There have been several proposals to endow the U.S.

President with the power of a line item veto.     Some commentators
have suggested that the ability to veto individual spending

lines will reduce undesirable, "pork barrel" spending; which will

result in lower spending, increased cost-efficiency, or both.
     This paper uses a rich set of state budget data to assess
the empirical foundations of this conjecture.     Examination of the
states behavior indicates that long run budgetary behavior is not

significantly affected by the power of an item veto.       This
conclusion is not altered by expanding the analysis to

incorporate the political composition of the state legislature
and governorship. Thus, in general, the line item veto has        rio


significant   impact on the budgetary process.

     However, in the short run, the potency of the line item veto
as a method of budgetary control is contingent upon the political

setting.   In those settings in which there are political


                                —24—
incentives to exercise such a veto, i.e. governors facing a

legislature controlled by the opposition party, existence of the
veto power significantly alters the budgetary package.

In particular, the effect is most pronounced when a governor

faces a legislature controlled by the opposing political party,

but has the numerical capability of sustaining the item veto.

     In these circumstances, the effect of the item veto is to

reduce deficits, but the mechanisms differ by party.   Under

Democratic governors, current spending is most affected, while

under Republican governors capital outlays are reduced.    On the

revenue side, non-tax revenues are reduced in both instances.

Lastly, under both parties the effect of the item veto may be to
increase both grants-in-aid to local governments and tax

revenues.

     Lastly, the short run results are both statistically
significant and, in some cases, quantitatively important.      To the

extent that the experience of that states is a good guide to

federal government behavior, these results suggest that in

particular political circumstances the item veto may permit
increased control over the budget.   The desirability of this

control is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.

                              Notes


1.  This quote is taken from the State of the Union Address as
reported by the New York Times, January 28, 1987, p. A16.
President Reagan repeated his call for a line item veto in his
Address the following year.
2.  See Ross and Schwengel [1982] for an review of Presidents'
attitudes toward the item veto.

3.  The Reagan Administration requested an authority quite
similar to the line item veto, an "enhanced rescission
authority". Under this system, Congress would be compelled to
vote on Presidential requests to delete items from the budget.    A
simple majority would be necessary to retain the budget line.
(See Newsweek, January 12, 1987, pp. 22.)

4.  This is not the only possibility. It may be that resources
will be used in a more cost-efficient fashion and spending is
unchanged.
5.  For an excellent survey of the alternative models, see Inman
[forthcoming].
6.  This ignores depreciation, but this simplification does not
affect the substance of the results.

7.  Notice that agents may also have differing expectations
concerning incomes and interest rates. These are assumed to be
identical here in order to focus on the role of preferences.
8.   The possibility of veto override is considered below.

9.   Only Nebraska has a unicameral legislature.
10. Consider the following simple example. The state consists
of 3 districts of 3 voters each. In the "high taste" district
the voters prefer, respectively, spending in the amounts $300,
$200, $100 per capita. Their elected representative will reflect
the median voter and "prefer" $200. In the "medium taste"
district the voters preferences are for $200, $150, and $100 per
capita and their representative will prefer $150. Finally, in
the "low taste" district the preferred amounts are $100, $50, and
$25.  In the legislative "vote" the outcome will pit spending
amounts of $200, $150, and $50; with the outcome being a proposal
of $150. On the other hand, the governor will reflect the median
voter of the entire distribution and prefer $100. Thus, there is
an incentive for the governor to reduce spending by a method such
as the line item veto.

                               —41—
11.  The usual assumption is that the line item veto will be used
to reduce spending; i.e. that it is the influence of high taste
districts which must be controlled. Notice that if spending is
too low, the governor may simply reject the entire bill.

12.  Notice, however, that there is no prediction concerning the
sign of the item veto effect.
13. This points out a more general legislative strategy in the
face of an effective line item veto: reduce the number of "lines"
by bundling together objectionable (from the governor's that this
viewpoint) and desirable spending items. To the extent
is possible even when the governor can sustain a veto, the
methods used below will not reveal the influence of a line item
veto.  Of course, this suggests another empirical test: is the
number of budget lines inversely correlated with the ability of
the governor to successfully employ a line item veto?

14.   This follows from the assumption that parties are monolithic
and have well-defined demands.
15. The data in Table 1 are as of 1985.   In general,
gubernatorial item veto power is quite old. The President of the
Confederacy had (but did not exercise) item veto power during the
Civil War and 28 states (of a total of 45) adopted a line item
veto between 1860 and 1900. By 1930, 41 of the 48 states had a
provision for line item veto power. The governors of Iowa and
West Virginia acquired line item veto power in 1969. See
Benjamin [1982] for a discussion of the growth of veto power.
16.  Of the remainder, only six can veto a bill at all.    The
governor of North Carolina has no veto powers.
17.  Differences exist even within these categories.    See ACIR
t1986a] for details.
18. An instrumental variables procedure will yield consistent
parameter estimates, but it is difficult to find satisfactory
instrumental variables.

19.  To see this, consider the budget constraint of the decisive
voter in a simplified model:

(19.1)      d   =   xd +
Y is income, X is private consumption, T is taxes paid, and the
superscript "d" identifies the decisive voter. Using lower case
letters to denote per capita terms, the government budget is:

 (19.2)     e=t+a
where e is expenditures, t is taxes, and a is aid.     Define

                                 —42—
.t=Td/t, solve (19.2>   for Td, substitute into (19.1)     and re-
arrange.   The result is:

(19.3)     yd÷caxd+-ce
Finally, define syd/y,      where y   is income   per capita; yielding:
(19.4>     y÷taxd+te
Suppose that a $1 increase in resources to the decisive voter
induces    $
           in additional spending. Notice that a $1 increase in
                                             $
                                        increase in income to the
income per capita translates into a
decisive voter, resulting in $ct' in spending. In contrast, a $1
increase in aid per capita is equivalent to a $t increase in
resources to the decisive voter and produces $at in additional
spending. In these estimates $at > $cv, which may simply reflect
    and not the presence of a flypaper effect.

20.  The entries in Table 6 are calculate using the estimated
parameters in Table S without regard to their statistical
significance.
