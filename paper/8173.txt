I. Introduction

       In the present market environment, no investors are more respected – and feared – than those

who manage hedge funds. TASS, a major source of data on hedge fund performance, estimates the

industry size as of March 1, 2000 at $150 billion. However this number gives but a poor indication

of the influence of these funds. Some of the funds are very large; George Soros’ funds had a

combined capitalization of over $4.6 billion dollars on that date. In addition, funds’ influence is

leveraged many times over through the use of extensive margin account activity. There is a

widespread perception that these managers have the ability to move markets.

       As a result, certain hedge fund managers like George Soros have achieved almost popular

icon status, celebrated as much for their great wealth and public philanthropy as for their trading

prowess. However, there are dissenters. Dr. Mahathir Bin Mohamad, the Prime Minister of Malaysia,

in an editorial piece that appeared in the September 23, 1997 issue of the Wall Street Journal, said

“Whole regions can be bankrupted by just a few people whose only objective is to enrich themselves

and their rich clients...We welcome foreign investments. We even welcome speculators. But we don't

have to welcome share -- and financial-market manipulators. We need these manipulators as much

as travelers in the good old days needed highwaymen.”

       Despite their public acclaim and despite their profound influence, surprisingly little is

understood about hedge funds and what it is they do. The term “hedge fund” seems to imply market

neutral, low risk trading strategies, whereas the extensive use of leverage in these funds appears to

suggest a high level of risk. In fact, associating the term “hedge” with the name George Soros

suggests in the popular mind that this term can be associated with any kind of high risk trading

strategy.


                                                                                                   1
       The term “hedge fund” was actually coined by Carol Loomis in a 1966 Fortune magazine

article to describe the investment philosophy of one Alfred Winslow Jones. His fund had two general

characteristics. It was “market neutral” to the extent that long positions in securities he determined

were undervalued were funded in part by taking short positions in overvalued securities. This was

the “hedge”, and the net effect was to leverage the investment so as to make very large bets with

limited investment resources. His second innovation was the introduction of a substantial incentive

fee initially set at 20% of realized profit without any fixed management fee.

       Today, the term “hedge fund” encompasses investment philosophies that range far from the

original “market neutral” strategy of Jones to include the global macro styles of people like Soros

and Julian Robertson. In addition, many investment firms are simply renaming their trading desks

as “hedge funds” and many traditional equity managers are rushing to get into what appears to be

a very lucrative business. As a practical matter, hedge funds are best defined by their freedom from

regulatory controls stipulated by the Investment Company Act of 1940. These controls limit fund

leverage, short selling, holding shares of other investment companies, and holding more than 10%

of the shares of any single company. Compensation terms typically include a minimum investment,

an annual fee of 1% - 2%, and an incentive fee of 5% to 25% of annual profits. The incentive fee is

usually benchmarked at 0% return each year, or against an index such as the U.S. or U.K. treasury

rate. This compensation structure usually includes a “high water mark” provision that adds past

unmet thresholds to current ones.

       Hedge funds are typically set up as limited partnerships or limited liability companies

providing specialized investment vehicles for high net worth individuals and institutions. The

National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 limits participation to at most 500 “qualified


                                                                                                    2
investors”, individuals who have at least $5 Million to invest and institutions with capital of at least

$25 Million. Exemption from regulatory oversight and investment restrictions faced by other

investment companies comes at the cost of restrictions on public advertising and solicitation of

investors. Absence of regulatory oversight means that reliable information on hedge funds is hard

to come by. In addition the same regulations imply that the funds cannot disseminate information

about their activities even if it were in their interest to do so. This may be one reason so little is

known about this sector of the financial market.

        Despite the relative lack of information about hedge funds, institutional investors have taken

an increasingly active interest in hedge funds as an asset class. What evidence we have about the

historical risk and return characteristics of hedge funds suggests they may be attractive as a portfolio

asset. Yet, as we show in this paper, hedge funds are anything but a monolithic asset class in the

traditional sense of the word. The hedge fund universe encompasses a range of different strategies

and approaches and specialities. Some managers add value through knowledge of special asset

markets, others through trading skills, and others through superior asset pricing models. It is this

very variety that poses both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is comprehending and

bench marking managers whose operations are essentially opaque, whose instruments vary widely,

and who in many cases eschew predictable passive factor exposures. The opportunity lies in the

diversification that the varieties of hedge funds present. A substantial sub-industry of fund-of-funds

has emerged to allow investors to hold a diversified portfolio of shares in hedge fund vehicles,

spreading their exposure to the class across a range of strategies.

        The purpose of this paper is to shed some light on the stylistic differences across hedge

funds. We ask a few simple questions. First, in light of the extraordinary variety of hedge fund


                                                                                                      3
strategies, are there a few basic styles that they pursue? Second, are these styles meaningful to

investors – that is, do they explain differences in performance? Third, are there any significant

trends in these styles that investors and analysts should know about?

       To address these questions, we study the monthly return history of a large database of hedge

funds over the period 1989 through to January 2000 and find that there are in fact a number of

distinct styles of management. We use a systematic, quantitative approach to using both the return

history and the self-reported style information to understand and characterize the major categories

of hedge fund styles during the sample period. We find that differences in investment style contribute

about 20 per cent of the cross sectional variability in hedge fund performance. This result is

consistent across the years of our sample and is robust to the way in which we determine investment

style. Furthermore, differences in style account for significant differences in risk taking by fund

managers. We conclude that appropriate style analysis and style management are crucial to success

for investors looking to invest in this market.

       This paper is structured as follows. The next Section describes the data and methodology

of our work. Section three reports the results of our empirical analysis, and Section four concludes.



II. Data and Methodology

II.1 Data

       TASS is a New York-based advisory and information service that maintains a large database

of hedge fund managers that we used in this analysis. The fund return data provided by TASS is

used in recent research by Fung and Hsieh (1997). A competitor to TASS, Managed Account

Reports (MAR) has data on the hedge fund population as well, and this is the data used by


                                                                                                    4
Ackerman, McEnally and Ravenscraft (1999)1. Neither of these two sources is a “follow-forward”

database of the kind used in Brown Goetzmann and Ibbotson (1999). Consequently we could not

verify the extent to which defunct funds have been dropped from the sample until very recently.

TASS has recognized the importance of maintaining defunct funds in their data, and since 1994 they

have kept records of hedge funds that cease to operate. Because of the limited coverage of the

database before 1988, we use TASS data for the period 1989-1999 in our study.

        In addition to rate of return data, TASS also provides extensive descriptive material each one

of the hedge funds they cover as of January 2000. Based on available information from survey

responses and fund disclosure documents they attempt to define the principal focus of the hedge fund

in an effort to classify hedge funds into one of 17 different types. The TASS hedge fund

classifications are presented in Table 1. While the TASS database covers a range of investment

categories it is evidently under-represents several important classifications, most notably the fund-of-

funds category. There are several important caveats to this classification. These categories are not

very precise nor are the terms used well defined2. To the extent that they are based on manager

survey responses they are also subject to strategic self-misclassification. In Brown and Goetzmann

(1997) we study the way in which mutual funds report themselves to Weisenberger, which publishes

an annual survey of mutual funds. In virtually every case, changes in self-classification had the net

effect of increasing returns relative to the new defined benchmark. Given that such strategic behavior


        1
       Ackerman, McEnally and Ravenscraft (1999) also includes data from another vendor,
Hedge Fund Research.
        2
         Many hedge funds report multiple specializations. For example most international focus
hedge funds are invested in both equity and fixed income securities (72% by value of Asian
equity hedge funds also report a fixed income focus as of January 2000). The numbers in Table 1
are the principal focus investment interest as determined by TASS.

                                                                                                      5
can occur in the heavily regulated mutual fund environment, we should expect it to be a more severe

problem in the far less regulated world of hedge funds.



II.2 Generalized Style Classification [GSC] methodology

II.2.1 Estimation

       There is a long tradition of characterizing investment funds according to parameters

estimated via a linear model of returns. The technology of asset pricing was first applied by Jensen

(1968) to grouping mutual funds according to their systematic risk characteristics. Conner and

Korajczyk (1986), Lehmann and Modest (1987), Grinblatt and Titman (1989) and Elton, Gruber, Das

and Hlavka (1993) all apply linear asset pricing methods to differentiate mutual funds on the basis

of systematic risk characteristics. Sharpe(1992) observed that since mutual fund returns are highly

correlated with broad asset class returns, this linear model can be used to characterize the portfolio

policies of mutual fund managers and provide a reliable basis for determining investment style. As

a result, the model is widely used in practice to manage exposure to investment management style.

       However, this simple linear model does not appear to work very well for hedge funds. Fung

and Hsieh (1997) report that while mutual fund returns have high and positive correlation with asset

class returns, hedge fund returns have low and sometimes negative correlation with the same asset

class returns. They attribute this failure to the dynamic use of leverage and changes in asset exposure

by hedge funds. This kind of active portfolio management affects performance measurement in non-

trivial ways. Dybvig and Ross (1985), for instance, show how linear risk models fail to properly

rank fund managers when they change their asset weights through time. Fung and Hsieh (1997)

observe that this attribute also causes problems for a style based interpretation of the asset class


                                                                                                     6
loadings. The way in which fund managers change asset weights in response to economic

circumstances can itself be legitimately characterized as part of their asset management style.

        In Brown and Goetzmann (1997) we suggest a simple but quite general procedure to identify

asset management styles where asset weights vary through time. The objective of this procedure is

to use past returns to determine a natural grouping of funds that has some predictive power in

explaining the future cross-sectional dispersion in fund returns. Such groupings are referred to as

styles. If there are K such styles the ex post total return in period t for any fund can be represented

as:


                                                                                        (1)


where fund j belongs to style J. There are several ways of interpreting this equation. In a traditional

financial economics framework, this equation refers to a multifactor or a multibeta model. The

factor loadings on factors It are given by $Jt. These loadings are allowed to change through time. As

Sharpe (1992) points out, if we regard the factors It as returns on index portfolios, the factor

loadings can be thought of as equivalent portfolio weights associated with a dynamic portfolio

strategy that might be associated with the style in question. In an interpretation closer to that of

financial practitioners $Jt refers to a characteristic of a typical stock in the Jth style classification

(size, market to book, price earnings multiple, etc.) and It is the return to that attribute (c.f.

Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny, 1994).

        Regardless of how we interpret the equation, the style classifications will explain the cross-

sectional dispersion of fund returns. Writing the equation as :




                                                                                                       7
                                                                                                       (2)



where :Jt is the expected return for style J conditional upon the factor realization It. If the

idiosyncratic return component gjt has zero mean ex ante and is uncorrelated across securities, the

classification into styles will suffice to explain the cross-sectional dispersion of fund returns to the

extent that :Jt differs across styles. It is important to note that Equation (2) justifies the common

industry practice of using style benchmarks to evaluate performance of money managers within a

given style3

       The task of assigning funds to style categories can be thought of as a problem in

endogenously defining regimes (see for instance Quandt 1959 and 1960). In this way, it bears a

"family" resemblance to switching regression, although, unlike the switching regression, an exact

solution to the stylistic classification problem is only obtained through exhaustive combinatorics.

The approach we use finds a local optimum via the minimization of a "within-group" sum of squares

criterion, over a specific time period, t=1...T. The inputs to the procedure is a T by N matrix of

monthly returns for a set of N mutual funds. We group the N funds together into K styles by

minimizing the within-style mean returns for each period t=1..T. Thus, we are jointly estimating the

time-series of mean returns for the styles J=1..K (:Jt) for t=1..T, and the membership to each style.

The benefit of the resulting classification is that groups could result from either fixed portfolio

strategies, such as similar asset compositions, or from dynamic portfolio strategies, such as portfolio


       3
        To see this, note that the style benchmark       given as the value-weighted average return

within each style category,                   , is an unbiased estimator of the true expected return

conditional on the factor realizations as of date t:                                      .

                                                                                                       8
insurance rebalancing.

        The classification procedure assumes that we know the number of styles. Conditional upon

restrictions upon the exact number of groups, Equation (2) is perfectly well-specified and can be

used to estimate the style groupings. Equation (1) gives further insight into the nature of time-

varying portfolio strategies, however, the parameters in this equation are not identified without

further restrictions4. In order to implement our style classification [SC] algorithm, we pre-specify

the number of styles.

        A modification of the basic algorithm is a generalized least squares procedure [GSC] which

allows time-varying and fund-specific residual return variance. By scaling observations by the

inverse of the estimated standard deviation, we decrease the influence of extreme observations in the

classification process. In addition, GSC corrects for differences among managers that occur solely

because of differences in scale or degree of diversification. The details of the GSC algorithm are

fully described in Brown and Goetzmann (1997).

        It is important to note that the SC and GSC procedures makes minimal demands on the

available data. We can estimate Equation (2) without needing to know factor loadings or style

attributes represented by the vector $Jt which may well change from period to period. We only need

to know ex post returns on individual funds.

II.2.2 Identification

        One of the difficulties with estimating styles strictly from returns is that it is difficult to map

the returns-based styles back to the self reported styles. Fund and Hsieh (1997), for example, get



        4
         A restriction sufficient for identification purposes is to assume that the portfolio strategy
is constant over a number of months greater than the number of factors.

                                                                                                         9
some sense of what styles managers use by looking at the reported activities of the funds that exhibit

similar loadings on dynamic factors extracted from the hedge fund universe. Brown and Goetzmann

(1997) cross-tabulate membership in a returns-based style with membership in a self-reported style,

and then normalize each GSC style to understand differences in style composition. We follow the

same procedure in this paper. Scaled cross-tabulation allows us to represent each style in terms of

a mixture across the range of self-represented manager activities. This in turn, helps us label the

estimated styles according to the preponderance of managers in each group.



III Results

III.1 GSC Style Classifications

        It is interesting to note that the self-classifications, sometimes ambiguous and difficult to

interpret, are indeed reasonably descriptive of hedge fund styles. The TASS classifications that we

have applied are dated January 1, 2000. There is no guarantee that these hedge fund characteristics

are constant over the period of our sample. Indeed, as we mentioned before, there is every reason

to believe that these self-reported classifications vary as managers define themselves relative to

favorable benchmarks. Yet, when we determine GSC classifications for the three year period up to

December 1999, there is a remarkable agreement between these return-based classifications and the

classifications that TASS has determined on the basis of fund disclosures and questionnaires. Figure

1 gives the scaled cross-tabulation breakdown of each GSC style relative to the estimated assets

under management in each TASS category as of January 1, 2000. Whether we consider eight styles

or five styles, there are some clearly defined categories. In the case of eight styles, we find that GSC3

is a property investment style, GSC3 is a US equity focus, GSC7 is emerging markets, and GSC1


                                                                                                      10
and GSC8 are aggressive international styles, the first as a directional equity style and the second as

a global macro style. GSC 4 and GSC 5 both have a significant representation of non-

directional/relative value funds. This is the “classical” hedge fund style. We find that it spreads

primarily between two of our returns-based categories. “Event-driven” managers spread across four

of our GSC styles – GSC 1 is largely foreign investment and GSC 5 is largely domestic. Thus,

presumably GSC 5 captures the U.S. focused M&A arbitrage funds in the sample.

        With five styles the results are similar, although certain of the categories appear to have

merged. This suggests that five stylistic classifications may not be sufficient to describe the breadth

of investment management philosophies adopted by hedge fund managers5



III.2 Comparative Performance

        How well does the returns-based procedure perform relative to stated investment objectives?

The answer will clearly depend on the use to which we intend to put the resulting style

classifications. The ability to interpret the styles is clearly important. However, if the style

classifications are ambiguous or if they bear no relationship to returns, then they have limited utility

in an investment management context. In Brown and Goetzmann (1997) suggest that an appropriate

criterion for evaluating style classifications is the extent to which these classifications can explain

cross sectional differences in future year returns.

        To implement this, we classify funds into styles using three years of data, and then regress

the cross section of fourth year fund returns against these classifications. We repeat this exercise for


        5
         Fung and Hsieh (1997) find at least five stylistic categories using their returns-based
procedure for identifying styles. A Chi-square test (Brown and Goetzmann 1997) indicates that
there are at least eight distinct styles. This result is consistent with what we observe in Figure 1.

                                                                                                     11
each three year period of the data, reporting the adjusted R2 generated by regressing subsequent

period returns against a matrix of dummy variables that indicate whether each fund belongs to a

particular style. If the style classification contains information about future differences in returns,

we would expect these regressions to explain a significant amount of cross-sectional variance. This

same procedure is performed for the industry classifications. A comparison of adjusted R2 indicates

which has the superior predictive ability6.

       The results of this procedure are presented in Table 2. Style differences account for

approximately 20 percent of the cross-sectional dispersion in hedge fund returns. On average, the

returns-based procedure with eight style classifications explains a greater percentage of the

variability of subsequent returns than does the 17 category TASS classification. This is true whether

we consider R2 or adjusted R2.7 However, this was true only for the 8 style GSC analysis. Assuming

only 5 styles, the 17 TASS classifications did somewhat better than the returns-based procedure. This

is further evidence that 5 styles may not be sufficient to explain the heterogeneity of hedge fund

investment philosophies.



III.3 Predicting Fund Performance with Style

       An important activity of fund-of-funds is forecasting which managers will out-perform their

peers. In this section we show that it is essential to establish the correct peer group before looking

at performance persistence. Figures 2 through 7 provide a graphical representation of the extent to


       6
         This test is actually biased against the returns-based procedure, as the industry
classifications are determined as of January 1, 2000, a date subsequent to all of our data.
       7
         The average unadjusted R2 was 24.15% for the 8 factor GSC classification, and 22.68%
for the 17 classifications published by TASS.

                                                                                                    12
which style membership explains returns. Each scatter plot gives the fund returns in each year as a

function of the annual fund return in the previous period. Each point is colored according to the style

membership of the fund determined on the basis of the prior three years of data. It is important to

note that the second year return data depicted on the y axis was not used for the determination of

fund style. The vertical line gives the median hedge fund return for the first year in each two year

comparison, while the horizontal line gives the median fund return for the second year (y axis). If

there were persistence in hedge fund returns, there would be a preponderance of funds in the upper

right quadrant (Winner-Winner). The red line gives the regression of fund returns in the second year

against annual returns in the first year. Again, with persistence of fund returns the slope of this line

should be significantly positive.

        Consistent with findings in our earlier study of off-shore hedge funds (Brown, Goetzmann

and Ibbotson 1999) we find very little evidence of persistence in annual hedge fund returns8. With

the exception of comparison years 1995-96 and 1996-97 the winner-winner quadrant is noticeably

sparse and the slope of the regression line is negative or insignificantly positive. While the data may

suggest limited evidence of persistence for the period 1995-97, one has to be very careful interpreting

the results. Note that the preponderance of the funds appearing in the top right Winner-Winner

quadrant are marked with crosses. These crosses signify that the fund in question did not survive in

the dataset the following year. Ackerman, McEnally and Ravenscraft (1999) suggest that the funds

that leave the database are often successful managers that see no need to continue reporting to the

hedge fund data service. Brown Goetzmann and Park (2001) and others show on the contrary that


        8
         Agarwal and Naik (2000) also find that there is little evidence of persistence in annual
returns. However, they indicate that there is indeed evidence of persistence of quarterly and to a
lesser extent semi-annual returns.

                                                                                                     13
these fund managers are the ones that took considerable risk and lost substantially immediately prior

to leaving the database.

        Inspecting the figures more carefully we see immediately the reason for the apparent

persistence and reversals. Following Agarwal and Naik (2000), we consider the influence style has

in determining the persistence of hedge fund performance. Each of the style categories tend to cluster

together in terms of their returns. Since the styles were determined on the basis of returns prior to

the second comparison year, this result cannot be an artefact of the way styles were determined.

Some years certain styles do well. In other years they do not do so well. The fact that in any given

year a particular style or hedge fund strategy does well is by itself evidence that the strategy will earn

high returns in future years. Thus, our evidence is bad news for analysts hoping to use historical data

to forecast future winners, but very good news for fund-of-fund investors.                We find that

diversification across GSC styles is an effective way to reduce exposure to holding a losing set of

managers in any given year.



III.4 Value-at-Risk and Styles

        Many analysts see styles as a surrogate for risk exposure. Is there any evidence which

suggests that hedge fund styles separate managers out in terms of the risk they are willing to bear?

We examined the value-at-risk of all of the hedge fund managers in the TASS universe. The median

value-at-risk for each of eight GSC styles was calculated for the period 1993 through 1999, and

plotted in Figure 8. To guarantee that the value-at-risk was determined independently of the returns-

based style, the month in which value-at-risk is determined was excluded from the data used to

allocate funds to styles. We see that the styles of management group together into three distinct risk


                                                                                                       14
classes. The global equity hedge, US equity hedge and global macro styles (GSC1, GSC2 and GSC8)

cluster together. Managers in these style categories typically take more risk than other managers.

Note particularly the spike in value at risk in September 1998 coincident with the problems at Long

Term Capital Management (which is not part of our database). This sudden increase in value-at-risk

also was evident in the relative value styles GSC4 and GSC5, and GSC6 which like GSC1 has a

significant fraction of funds identifying themselves as non-US equity fund managers.

        What might explain this jump in the VAR for this group. It is tempting to interpret this as

evidence of either increasing asset market volatility or alternately increasing leverage of the funds

in the sample. The increase in volatility is consistent with the increase in the volatility of U.S. equity

indices over this period, as well as an increase in the idiosyncratic component of U.S. equity risk.

On the other hand, the fund volatility level is a variable set jointly by the manager and creditors.

It is somewhat surprising that in the wake of the LTCM collapse, creditors have been willing to

tolerate an increase in hedge fund volatility. One could infer that leverage has increased, despite

credit constraints, because arbitrage opportunities have become relatively scarce.



III.3 Comparison with other returns-based style procedures

        The GSC approach we describe in this paper is certainly not the only returns-based style

procedure. It is useful to compare how our methodology performs when benchmarked against

alternatives. In the mutual fund area, the constrained linear regression approach of Sharpe (1992)

is very commonly applied. The Sharpe procedure is typically applied with passive benchmarks –

that is, standard asset classes are used as the regressors in an equation in which the dependent

variable is the fund of interest and the independent variables are passive asset class returns. The


                                                                                                       15
estimated coefficients are the interpretable as portfolio weights.

        In fact, this approach corresponds to estimating Equation (1) where the factors     are proxied

by asset class returns and the factor loadings   are assumed constant over the estimation period and

are interpreted as the average portfolio weight invested in each of the reference assets over this

period. Fung and Hsieh (1997) argue persuasively that the Sharpe (1992) approach ignores the

dynamic component of asset management style that is characteristic of hedge fund management. In

an attempt to capture dynamic styles that are useful for asset allocation decisions and bench marking,

Fung and Hsieh (1997) form K reference assets that maximally correlated with the first K principal

components, using a portfolio of hedge funds for each reference assets that has a high “loading” on

the principal component. In this context, while is is not an explicit procedure for fund classification,

membership in the “style” is determined by whether a fund loads mostly on one of reference assets.

In like manner, once could classify funds by their loadings on one of the pre-specified styles.

        In Table 3 we report results from cross sectional regressions in which we explain differences

in three-year performance according to the GSC classification, the classification based on the Fung

and Hsieh (1997) approach, and classification based on the Sharpe (1992) approach. In particular,

we estimate the first five principal components using hedge fund returns for which we have three

years of continuous data and define a set of reference assets maximally correlated with these

principal components. We then apply the Sharpe (1992) procedure to these reference assets. The

returns-based style is then given as the reference asset on which the fund has the highest possible

loading. In the same way, we use pre-specified asset classes as reference assets and then classify

according to which factor the fund loads most highly upon.

        In Table 3, we find that principal components-based styles explain only about eight percent


                                                                                                     16
of the cross sectional variability of post-sample returns. This result follows whether we base the style

analysis on five principal components (as in Fung and Hsieh (1997) or eight principal components.

The use of pre-specified factors, rather than principal component-based reference assets is an

improvement. Classifications based on loadings on eight standard predetermined performance

benchmarks9, which actually explain 11.75 percent of the cross-sectional variation in returns. Both

are apparently less powerful than the GSC methodology.

        The horse race in Table 3 is not entirely fair, however. Neither the Fung and Hsieh (1997)

or the Sharpe (1992) procedures were intentionally designed to classify funds, rather they were

designed to explain fund performance relative to appropriate benchmarks. For this reason it is not

difficult to understand why it is that the principal components procedure performs so poorly. The

problem does not relate to the use of hedge fund return benchmarks. After all, the GSC approach also

uses such benchmarks. The problem relates to principal components and the difficulty of estimating

them. In an asset return context, all securities tend to load positively on the first principal component

which then by construction is highly correlated with an equally weighted average of the component

securities, while the remaining components capture elements of returns uncorrelated with the first

(Brown, 1989). As a consequence the first component is estimated with precision and second and

remaining components are estimated with considerably less precision. This suggests that while

principal components may provide an excellent set of benchmarks for hedge fund performance they

may be less successful in a returns-based style management context. We investigate this possibility

in Table 4.


        9
        These predetermined benchmarks include Fama-French Large Growth, Large Value,
Small Growth and Small Value index returns, as well as Ibbotson Long Term Government and
30 day returns and MSCI Europe and Asia/Pacific total return indices.

                                                                                                      17
       In Table 4 we consider the correlation of post-sample returns with loadings on alternative

hedge fund benchmarks – GSC, Principal Components and Pre-Specified Factors. We now find that

the performance of the principal components-based benchmarks is extremely close to the

performance of the GSC based benchmarks in the five styles case, and only a little worse than the

GSC approach in the eight styles case. In addition, consistent with the findings of Fung and Hsieh,

we also find that the predetermined factor loadings explain less of the cross-sectional variability in

returns than do any of the returns-based benchmark loadings. However, the most interesting finding

from Table 4 is the fact that the principal components based procedure (with eight factors) now

performs almost as well as the TASS 17 descriptors in explaining the cross section dispersion of

annual returns. Whether we determine styles on the basis of careful returns-based analysis, or simply

rely on self-reported characterizations of investment style, the result is the same. Differences in

investment style contribute about 20 per cent of the cross sectional variability in hedge fund

performance.

       The implications of Table 3 and Table 4 together is that, when analysts need to estimate

factor exposures and report continuous variables about hedge funds such as how they might load on

a dynamic strategy, then the “beta” models do a fair job. When identification or classification is

needed, then the GSC algorithm is a very useful tool. It not only differentiates funds in a way that

spreads future performance, but it also provides reasonable factors which can be used in the context

of factor exposure estimation. Finally, with the scaled cross-tabs, the identity of the groups can be

generally ascertained.



IV Conclusion


                                                                                                   18
       Despite the public interest in hedge funds and their important role in the financial markets,

surprisingly little is known about their similarities and differences. In part, this is because they are

not obliged to make public reports of their asset holdings or performance, but also in part it is

because they perceive it is in their business interest to appear enigmatic players in the global capital

markets. As a result there is much confusion about who they are and what they do.

       The popular perception is that there is a well defined market-neutral hedge fund style of

investing. By a close analysis of the returns history over the last ten years we have discovered that

this perception is false. There are at least eight distinct styles or philosophies of asset management

currently employed by hedge funds, and risk exposure depends very much on style affiliation.

Furthermore, we find that the persistence (or reversal) of fund returns from year to year has a lot to

do with the particular style of fund management. In fact, 20 percent of the cross sectional variability

of fund returns can be explained solely by the style of management. This result is robust to the way

in which we choose to define styles, and is similar for most of the years of our sample.

       One interesting finding is that self-reported characterizations of asset management style do

almost as well as some of the latest return-based procedures. However, this result should be treated

with some considerable care. The fact that hedge funds are for the most part unregulated entities and

the fact that there are no generally accepted standards for hedge fund style classification means that

there are almost unlimited opportunities for individual funds to engage in strategic self-

misclassification. Given the absolute importance of style affiliation in determining risk exposure and

return outcome, we conclude that appropriate style analysis and style management are crucial to

success for investors looking to invest in this market.

This table compares the adjusted R2 regressing annual fund returns against several alternative fund classifications. The GSC procedure
uses a 36 month estimation period prior to and including December of the year given in the left hand column. GSC classifications
were determined both for an 8 style classification as well as a 5 style classification. The third classification considered is the 17 fund
descriptors given in the TASS database for funds in the sample as of January 2000. The out of sample test period corresponds to the
annual return period subsequent to the year given in the left hand column. The cross section of test period returns on funds are
regressed against (K - 1) dummy variables, where *ki = 1 for fund I in category k, zero otherwise.

This table compares the adjusted R2 regressing annual fund returns against several alternative returns-based fund classifications. Each
procedure uses a 36 month estimation period prior to and including December of the year given in the left hand column. The GSC
procedure is described in Brown and Goetzmann (1997) while the Principal Components procedure is described in Fung and Hsieh
(1997). In the latter procedure the loadings on K factors are estimated by regressing individual fund returns on portfolios maximally
correlated with the first K principal components of fund returns, with coefficients constrained to be positive and to sum to one
(Sharpe (1992)) The fund classification was determined by the benchmark on which the fund loaded most heavily. Each returns-based
procedure was applied assuming both 8 and 5 styles. The predetermined benchmark refers to a classification based on standard
performance benchmarks, Fama-French Large Growth, Large Value, Small Growth and Small Value, as well as Ibbotson Long Term
Government and 30 day returns and MSCI Europe and Asia/Pacific total return indices. The out of sample test period corresponds
to the annual return period subsequent to the year given in the left hand column. The cross section of test period returns on funds are
regressed against (K - 1) dummy variables, where *ki = 1 for fund I in category k, zero otherwise.

This table compares the adjusted R2 regressing annual fund returns against several alternative returns-based factor loadings. These
loadings were determined on the basis of a prior 36 month estimation period up to and including December of the year given in the
left hand column. The GSC loadings were obtained by regressing fund returns on GSC benchmarks (see Brown and Goetzmann
(1997)) constraining the coefficients to be positive and to sum to one (Sharpe (1992)). The principal components benchmarks were
obtained by a similar regression procedure using principal component-based benchmarks. This benchmark procedure is described
in Fung and Hsieh (1997). The predetermined benchmark refers to a classification based on standard performance benchmarks, Fama -
French Large Growth, Large Value, Small Growth and Small Value, as well as Ibbotson Long Term Government and 30 day returns
and MSCI Europe and Asia/Pacific total return indices. The out of sample test period corresponds to the annual return period
subsequent to the year given in the left hand column
