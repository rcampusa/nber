                                              ABSTRACT

        This paper analyzes individual decisions to participate in an activity and the aggregation of those
decisions when individuals gather information about the outcomes and choices of (a few) others in their
social network. In this environment, aggregate participation rates are generally inefficient. Increasing
the size of social networks does not necessarily increase efficiency and can lead to less efficient long-run
outcomes. Both subsidies for participation and penalties for non-participation can increase participation
rates, though not necessarily by the same amount. Punishing non-participation has much greater effects
on participation rates than rewarding participation when current rates are very low. A program that
provides youth with mentors who have participated themselves can increase participation rates, especially
when those rates are low. Finally, communities plagued by the flight of successful participants will
experience lower short- and long-run participation rates.

              This paper analyzes individual decisions to participate in an activity and the aggregation of
          those decisions when individuals gather information about the outcomes and choices of (a few)
          others in their social network. In this environment, aggregate participation rates are generally
          inefficient. Increasing the size of social networks does not necessarily increase efficiency and
          can lead to less efficient long-run outcomes. Both subsidies for participation and penalties for
          non-participation can increase participation rates, though not necessarily by the same amount.
          Punishing non-participation has much greater effects on participation rates than rewarding
          participation when current rates are very low. A program that provides youth with mentors
          who have participated themselves can increase participation rates, especially when those rates
          are low. Finally, communities plagued by the flight of successful participants will experience
          lower short- and long-run participation rates.


1        Introduction

Economic models typically assume that decision makers are fully informed, rationally process all
information, and generally make the ‘right’ economic decision. Yet, for many decisions like finishing
high school, attending college, joining a gang, taking drugs, or engaging in premarital sex, youth
possess limited information about the potential outcomes of their choices. Furthermore, much of
that information seems to come from older friends, neighbors, acquaintances, and parents who have
already made this decision and can offer their advice. In short, youth look to role models and their
social networks for advice.
        To the extent that social networks are drawn from the neighborhoods in which youth live, the
information and choices of youth will depend critically on the choices made by and outcomes of
others in their neighborhood. This does not bode well for youth growing up in impoverished ghetto
neighborhoods, as one such youth explains

         Our neighborhoods will only show us so much...See, I’m twenty-one years old and already
         an OG [original gangster – someone who has been in a gang for a number of years]...The
         OG’s is getting a little bit younger, and I helped contribute to that because the younger
         ones were looking up to me just as I was looking up to older people. All I saw for a long
         time was people trying to get over and hustle, just hustle, hustle. I never seen no doctor
         get up at three in the morning, wash off his car, take his briefcase and his stethoscope,
         and go straight to the hospital. I didn’t see no lawyers, no rocket scientists. All I seen
         was just somebody trying to get over. (Marshall and Wheeler, 1996)

       Attempting to better understand these issues, this paper examines the evolution of community
outcomes and the role of government policy when information is transmitted imperfectly through
social networks. While standard economic models emphasize how heterogeneous tastes and abilities
can lead to different choices across individuals, our model focuses on the role of heterogeneity in
information received by decision makers. Many of our model’s implications differ markedly from
the predictions of models with fully informed decision makers.
       A number of recent theoretical papers have studied the aggregation of decisions when individ-
uals are not fully informed about their choices. The information cascade literature has examined
decision-making when individuals sequentially choose whether or not to take some action based on
their own private signals and the history of actions taken by their predecessors (e.g. Banerjee, 1992,
and Bikchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch, 1992).1 In related work, Ellison and Fudenberg (1993,
1995) and Banerjee and Fudenberg (1999) consider the aggregation of decisions and information
when a large number of decision makers receive signals about the payoffs to different choices and
know the choices made by individuals during the previous period (but they do not observe the entire
history of choices), which they refer to as word-of-mouth learning. This literature has primarily
focused on understanding when economies characterized by limited information transmission con-
verge to an equilibrium of decision making conformity in which decision makers ignore their own
private signals.
       Following the theoretical interest in social networks, a number of recent empirical papers have
empirically examined the role of social information transmission in a variety of contexts. Most have
concluded that learning from others is an important determinant of individual decisions, although
little is known about the actual decision rules used by agents.2 Contrary to the predictions of

    Empirical findings suggest that social learning may play an important role in the decision to use contracep-
tion (Munshi and Myaux, 2000), criminal activity (Glaeser, Sacerdote, and Scheinkman, 1996), welfare participation

the information cascade and word-of-mouth learning literatures; however, it is rare to observe
any (interesting) choice for which all individuals, even within homogenous groups, make the same
decision. In order to analyze the effects of policy intervention and network size on aggregate
outcomes, we, therefore, develop a model in which information is imperfectly transmitted through
interactions with others and in which identical individuals sometimes make different choices even
in the long-run steady state. The policies we examine are either ill-suited for study in models with
full information or produce very different effects when information is transmitted through social
networks.
    We model the decision to participate in an activity when decision makers learn about the
participation choices and receive signals about the payoffs associated with those choices from a small
sample of individuals from the previous generation. Our framework differs from the information
cascade literature and Banerjee and Fudenberg (1999) in that we assume that each generation
uses the same decision rule for participation. This assumption is appropriate when individuals
from different generations have similar prior beliefs about the state of the current regime or when
individuals are limited in their abilities to compute complex Bayesian decision rules and, instead,
use simple rules of thumb (as assumed in Ellison and Fudenberg, 1993, 1995). Our decision process
is also general enough to account for individual tastes for conformity or the fact that “...a person’s
patterns and norms of behavior tend to be shaped by those with which he or she has the most
frequent or sustained contact and interaction.” (Wilson, 1986, p. 61) Because we impose very few
assumptions on the form of the decision rule, our results apply to a wide class of social learning
models.
    We find that the economy will only converge to an equilibrium in which all individuals make
the same choice if the ‘must-see’ to choose assumption (i.e. individuals never choose an option that
they do not observe in their sample) of Ellison and Fudenberg (1993, 1995) is imposed. Because
full conformity is an unrealistic prediction for most interesting social and economic problems, we
relax this assumption in our analysis. Our main results focus on understanding how various policies
effect both short- and long-run aggregate outcomes.
    Our model generates many interesting predictions that contrast with the predictions of tradi-
tional economic models with fully informed decision makers. The imperfect transmission of in-
formation through social networks generally causes some individuals not to participate even when
(Bertrand, Luttmer, and Mullainathan, 2000), decisions about employment retirement plans (Duflo and Saez, 2000)
and health insurance plans (Sorensen, 2001), stock market participation (Hong, Kubik, and Stein, 2001), and techno-
logical adoption in agriculture (Foster and Rosenzweig, 1995, and Conley and Udry, 2001, 2002). See Manski (1993)
for an analysis of identification and estimation of actual social learning decision rules.



                                                        3
participation is ex ante optimal. This implies that there may be a positive role for government
intervention. For example, subsidizing the best choice or punishing an inferior one can induce more
individuals to make the right decision.
       Contrary to conventional wisdom based on models with fully informed decision makers, aggre-
gate choices need not respond symmetrically to changes in the payoffs of different alternatives when
information is transmitted through social networks. For example, an increase in the earnings of
high school graduates need not have the same impact on graduation rates as a similar decrease
in earnings among drop outs – observing the net change in the graduate - drop out earnings dif-
ferential is not sufficient to determine the aggregate response. The key to this asymmetry lies in
the information (or, more appropriately, lack of information) people obtain from their observation
sample. When aggregate graduation rates are low, most decision makers observe samples with very
few graduates. As a result, only limited information about an increase in the earnings of gradu-
ates will reach them. On the other hand, information about a reduction in the earnings of drop
outs will be conveyed clearly. The same reasoning shows that communities with high graduation
rates will respond more to improvements in the earnings of graduates and less to reductions in the
earnings of drop outs. Therefore, policies that improve the outcomes of graduates may successfully
reduce drop out rates in middle and upper class communities while failing to do so in disadvantaged
communities.
       The problems associated with imperfect information transmission are not necessarily improved
by blindly increasing the size of social networks (the number of people agents receive signals from).
But, selectively augmenting social networks with individuals who have made good decisions, as
a mentor program might do, offers promise. Empirically, mentor programs have been introduced
to disadvantaged communities where high school drop out and crime rates are high. Tierney and
Grossman (1995) find that the well-known Big Brothers/Big Sisters program reduces drug/alcohol
use and violence while increasing school attendance and average grade levels. 3 We model mentor
programs by adding a randomly drawn participant to each decision maker’s observation sample.
In communities with low aggregate participation rates, this can substantially improve information
about the benefits of participation and induce many more to choose participation. The effects are
substantially weaker in areas with already high participation rates.
       Wilson (1987) has identified the outflow of successful blacks from ghetto neighborhoods as
   3
     Johnson (1998) reports that the probability of a successful mentoring relationship is positively related to simi-
larities between the mentor and youth, which suggests that youth rely more on information from others with similar
attributes.

an important cause for the continued problems faced by these communities. We study how this
phenomenon affects short- and long-term participation rates and find that both are reduced. In
contrast, communities in which participants are particularly active in the social networks of youth
will experience higher short- and long-term participation rates. In contrast to the previously defined
mentor programs, a policy that encourages active involvement of participants in their communities
will improve the outcomes most in neighborhoods with intermediate aggregate participation rates.
        The next section describes a general model of social networks and identifies some important
properties of the economy. Section 3 applies the model to analyze the decision to graduate from
high school using a decision rule based on that of Ellison and Fudenberg (1993). We explore the
affects of network size, mentors, an outflow of participants, and changes in the returns to different
choices on short- and long-term aggregate outcomes. We offer some concluding remarks in the final
section.


2        A General Model of Social Networks

We consider an environment in which individuals must choose whether or not to participate in an
activity, focusing on situations in which: (i) accurate aggregate statistics either do not exist or
individual heterogeneity makes nationwide statistics uninformative for individual decision makers;
and (ii) individuals cannot acquire information from their own previous experiences. 4 It seems best
to consider each local community as a separate economy, since in this case, individuals are likely
to be similar to and rely on the information provided by other individuals within that commu-
nity.5 While national statistics about education, crime, teen pregnancy, etc. are publicly available,
community-level statistics on these types of activities are more difficult to come by.
        We recognize that decision makers infer information from observed payoffs as well as from ob-
served participation rates. Observed outcomes of individuals from an earlier generation provide
direct information about one’s own expected outcomes, and observed participation rates give the
fraction of previous decision makers that expected participation to be optimal. Intuitively, ob-
served participation rates contain information about historical returns from participating, since
individuals in the observed sample based their participation decisions on earlier observed payoffs
and participation rates. The relative popularity of a choice in one’s own sample serves as a proxy
for that option’s historical performance.
    4
     In a context with repeated decisions, Lochner (2001) shows that individuals learn about the probability of arrest
from their own experiences with crime and whether or not they are arrested.
   5
     For example, national measures of the earnings of high school and college graduates may be only weakly related
to the potential earnings opportunities for youth growing up in inner city ghettos.


                                                          5
       To focus on the effects of limited information transmission, we study individuals that are ho-
mogeneous in tastes and abilities. We also abstract from the decision to acquire information by
assuming that each decision maker randomly samples n independent members of the previous gen-
eration. (We emphasize observation samples that are small but greater than one.) A decision maker
learns the participation choices and the payoffs associated with each individual he samples. We
follow Banerjee and Fudenberg (1999) and Ellison and Fudenberg (1993, 1995) in assuming that
decision makers cannot access the information used by previous decision makers. 6
       Let x denote the number of observed sample members who participated. Participating individ-
ual i conveys the payoff signal πpi = θp + εip , and non-participating individual j conveys the payoff
        j
signal πnp = θnp + εjnp where the εa are independent and identically distributed in the population
as N (0, σa2 ) for a ∈ {p, np}. The εa terms represent a combination of randomness in returns and
noise in the payoff signals.7 Let θ ≡ θp − θnp represent the expected gain from participating, which
is common across all individuals. As a normalization, assume that θ > 0, so that participation is
always the ex ante optimal choice. In a world with full information, everyone would choose to par-
ticipate and the economy would always be efficient (i.e. everyone would make the ex ante optimal
choice).
       Consider the following individual decision rule for participation:

                                              π̄p ≥ γ p (n)
                                             
                                                                    when x = n
                  participate if and only if   π̄p ≥ γ(π̄np , x, n) when x ∈ [1, n − 1]
                                               π̄np < γ np (n)      when x = 0,
                                             

where γ p (n), γ np (n), and γ(π̄np , x, n) are exogenously given threshold functions. We assume that γ
is weakly increasing in π̄np and would generally expect that it is weakly decreasing in x. We make
no assumptions about the effects of network size (n) on the decision rule. Individuals who observe
only participants will choose to participate themselves as long as the average outcome signal for
participants, π̄p , is high enough, while those who only observe non-participants will choose to par-
ticipate if the average outcome signal for observed non-participants, π̄ np , is low enough. Individuals
observing a sample consisting of both participants and non-participants will choose to participate
when the average participant signal is sufficiently high, where higher signaled payoffs from non-
participants and a lower observed participation rate increase the minimum average participant
   6
     This assumption is most reasonable when (i) decision makers have little incentive to record such information
after making their decision and (ii) information acquisition is too costly (relative to its rewards) for an organization
to profit from recording and communicating such information.
   7
     The source of variation is irrelevant for the individual decision process and the dynamics of the aggregate system
as long as it does not affect individual decision rules. Variation may also be due to unknown ex ante heterogeneity,
which should not affect decisions as long as it is not recognized by decision makers.


                                                           6
payoff signal that will induce participation.
       This decision rule may reflect a simple rule-of-thumb decision process due to bounded rationality
as in Ellison and Fudenberg (1993, 1995). Or, it may represent an underlying Bayesian decision
process where individuals from all generations have the same set of prior beliefs over (θ a , εa ) for
a ∈ {p, np} and over the number of generations that have passed since the current (θ, ε) regime
began.8 Finally, it may simply represent individual tastes for conformity or the social transmission
of norms and values across people.
       Given the decision rule described above and the independence of outcome signals across in-
dividuals, the probability that an individual observing x participants will choose to participate
themselves is given by µx where

Aggregate Participation Rates

Assuming that individual samples are randomly drawn from a large population, we can determine
the evolution of the aggregate participation rate using the law of large numbers. If y is the current
population participation rate, then the probability an individual observes j participants in his
sample is
                                                      µ ¶

     For example, suppose individuals know the joint distribution of (εp , εnp ) and that this distribution is time
invariant. If regimes characterized by (θp , θnp ) can change at any time with some probability q, each regime is
independent of the entire history, individuals do not know when a regime change occurs, and all individuals have the
same prior beliefs about q and the distribution from which (θp , θnp ) is drawn, then individuals from each generation
will face the same decision problem and will follow the same Bayesian decision rule. It is important that individuals
are unaware of the date when regimes begin; otherwise Bayesian decision rules will differ across generations – later
generations will place more importance on observed participation rates (e.g. Banerjee and Fudenberg, 1999). While
we do not explicitly analyze a stochastic economy, one can think of the steady states in our model applying within
any given regime.

     The economy will be in steady state if ∆(y) ≡ y 0 − y = 0. The following proposition establishes
that neither full participation nor zero participation will be steady states when γ p (n) > −∞ and
γ np (n) > −∞.

Proposition 1. (i) If γ p (n) > −∞, then y = 1 is not a steady state. (ii) If γ np (n) > −∞, then
y = 0 is not a steady state. (iii) If γ p (n) > −∞ and γ np (n) > −∞, then there must exist at least
one interior steady state, y ∗ , satisfying y ∗ ∈ (0, 1).

Proof: (i) ∆(0) = µ0 > 0 when γ np (n) > −∞, and (ii) ∆(1) = µn − 1 < 0 when γ p (n) > −∞. (iii)
By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be some y ∈ (0, 1) for which ∆(y) = 0. 2

     Thus, the economy will be inefficient (i.e. some individuals will not participate even though
participation is ex ante optimal) unless individuals use a ‘must see’ to choose decision rule in which
case they never choose an option they do not observe in their sample (i.e. γ p (n) = γ np (n) = −∞).
If individuals do use a ‘must see’ decision rule, then both zero and full participation are possible
steady states; although they are unlikely to be stable unless the sample participation rate plays a
strong role in the decision process.9
     When individuals may choose an option they do not observe, there will be at least one interior
steady state with partial participation, and there may be as many as n steady states (no more than
n
2   + 1 can be stable). Consequently, there will be few stable steady states when networks are small.
     Since θ > 0, a higher participation rate represents a more efficient economy. Proposition
2 shows that by increasing θ, either by subsidizing participants or by taxing non-participants,
the government can increase aggregate participation rates and improve efficiency of the economy
(ignoring any deadweight losses associated with such policies). Of course, these policies will also
increase ex post inequality between participants and non-participants.

                                                      ∂θnp . (iv) An increase (decrease) in θ need
not increase (decrease) changes in the participation rate.

Proof: See Appendix A.

     In our context, a steady state is stable if the system returns to the same steady state after small perturbations.
The zero participation steady state will be stable if and only if µ1 < 1/n and full participation will be a stable steady
state if and only if µn−1 > (n − 1)/n. An interior steady state will only be stable if ∂∆(y)
                                                                                          ∂y

         As one would expect, increases in the payoffs to participants and reductions in the payoffs to non-
participants both weakly increase aggregate participation rates. However, in contrast to standard
models with fully informed decision makers, increases in participation payoffs and reductions in non-
participation payoffs of the same magnitude will have differential effects on aggregate participation
rates. Thus, it matters if the return to participation increases because participants have become
better off or if it is because non-participants have become worse off. Put another way, net changes
in payoffs are not enough to determine whether aggregate participation rates increase or decrease.
         The key to this asymmetric response lies in the information decision makers obtain from their
social networks and not necessarily in any asymmetry of individual decision rules. The differential
effects of changes in θp and θnp are most clear at very high and low participation rates. For
example, when the participation rate is very high, an increase in the payoff to participation will be
immediately recognized by most decision makers, since they will primarily observe participants in
their network sample. However, a reduction in non-participant payoffs will go largely unnoticed,
since few individuals will observe any non-participants in their sample. Consequently, an equal
increase in participant and non-participant payoffs (leaving θ unchanged) will increase changes in
participation rates when current participation rates are high and will reduce those changes when
current participation rates are low. A steady state participation rate that is high will increase,
while a low steady state participation rate will decline in response to increases in payoffs to both
participation and non-participation.


3         An Example

In this section, we study the affect of changes in the payoffs to different choices, mentors, network
size, and an outflow of participants on aggregate participation rates using a simple rule-of-thumb
decision rule for participation based on Ellison and Fudenberg (1993). Specifically, assume that
γ(π̄np , x, n) = π̄np + m(1 − 2 nx ), where m is a non-negative constant determining how much weight
decision makers place on the information contained in the observed participation rate. Individuals
observing mixed samples of participants and non-participants, therefore, choose to participate if
the difference in average observed payoffs (π̄p − π̄np ) exceeds the cutoff m(1 − 2 nx ). We assume that
γ np and γ p are equal, finite constants, and independent of n.10
         This decision rule provides a simple way to incorporate the information contained in observed
returns and observed participation rates (it may also incorporate tastes for conformity). The
    10
         See Appendix B for a more detailed discussion.



                                                          9
parameter m determines the importance of the sample participation rate in determining individual
decisions when decision makers observe a mixed sample of participants and non-participants. For m
very large, individuals will simply follow the choice made by the majority of their sample regardless
of the payoff signals they receive. For m = 0, individuals only compare the payoff signals they
observe for participants and non-participants, ignoring the sample participation rate altogether.
Even though the decision rule treats π̄p and π̄np symmetrically, we will observe asymmetric responses
to changes in θp and θnp as described earlier in Proposition 2.
       Any number of patterns for ∆(y) can be generated by this model depending on the parame-
terization. While the broad issues we discuss are not sensitive to the parameters we choose, it is
instructive to present a specific example. We apply the model to the high school graduation deci-
sion, noting that evidence presented in Betts (1996) and Dominitz and Manski (1996) suggests that
youth are not fully informed about the earnings associated with different education levels. Betts
(1996) also demonstrates that the errors in student earnings expectations are positively correlated
with parental earnings levels, suggesting that parents are in their children’s social networks. We
choose parameter values for our model that produce a pattern consistent with the 1970-80 changes
in high school graduation rates (among young white men) across metropolitan areas in the U.S. and
the average earnings of high school graduates and drop outs in 1970. As Figure 1 shows, high school
graduation rates increased much more from 1970 to 1980 among young men living in metropolitan
areas with lower initial graduation rates than those living in areas with high graduation rates.
While we recognize that many models might explain this pattern, we focus exclusively on the role
of social networks in what follows.11
       Linking the model to our example, let participation represent the decision to finish high school
and non-participation represent the decision to drop out. Then, we set θ p = 8.595 and θnp = 8.352
based on average log earnings among young graduates and drop outs. We also assume a network
size of n = 6 along with m = σ p = σ np = 1 for our base case. (See Appendix B for further details
on the base case parameterization.) As seen in Figure 2, our base case parameter values produce
a pattern for ∆(y) like that of Figure 1 (note that Figure 1 only shows ∆(y) for a limited range of
y values for which data are available). The only steady state participation rate is approximately
y ∗ = 0.85, and it is stable. Changes in the participation rate, ∆(y), are initially increasing for very
  11
     We note that two obvious explanations are not supported by the data. First, measurement error in graduation
rates across metropolitan areas cannot fully explain the negative correlation between changes in graduation rates and
initial rates. Second, the pattern in Figure 1 is not generated by differential changes in the rate of return to high
school completion across metropolitan areas. See Appendix B for a more detailed discussion of these empirical issues
and the Census data used to generate Figure 1.

low y, then declining thereafter. Thus, convergence to the steady state from a very low participation
rate will be slow at first, increasing until y = 0.2, then slowing down again until y settles at y ∗ .
   To demonstrate the asymmetric response of ∆(y) and y ∗ to changes in θp and θnp , Figure 2
also shows the effects of increasing the net payoff to graduation by 0.2 either by raising θ p or
lowering θnp . While both changes increase ∆(y), the magnitude of the response depends on which
payoff has been changed and the current participation rate. An increase in θ p has very small effects
when participation rates are low, while the largest effects of a decline in θ np occur for y < 0.5.
For y ∈ (0.3, 0.9), a change in either payoff produces a similar increase in ∆(y). Because the
initial steady state is very high, an increase in the payoff to participation increases the steady state
participation rate more than a decline in the payoff to non-participants.
   Empirically, the wages of high school graduates and drop outs have changed considerably since
the 1960s (e.g. see Katz and Murphy, 1992). From 1963-71, wages increased substantially across all
education groups with very similar increases for both high school graduates and drop outs (around
17%). Despite a negligible change in relative wages over that period, the model predicts that
schooling should have declined (or increased at a slower rate) in communities with low graduation
rates while it should have increased in communities with very high graduation rates. In contrast,
the 1980s were characterized by falling wages among both graduates and drop outs (with slightly


                                                                 12
larger declines among drop outs), which should have produced gains in schooling for the most
disadvantaged communities while producing little change in graduation rates for the most educated
communities. More generally, declines in wages for both drop outs and graduates should lead to
faster convergence in graduation rates across communities, while increases in their wages should
slow convergence.
       A policy that increases the earnings of graduates or punishes drop outs will not only increase
the steady state graduation rate, but it will also increase the rate at which graduation rates move
toward that steady state for most values of y.12 Interestingly, among communities with very low
graduation rates, punishing drop outs should generate greater increases in schooling early on than
a subsidy to graduates, so the quickest way to raise the graduation rates in such a community may
be to raise compulsory schooling ages or the severity of fines associated with violating them.

The Size of Networks

Can we ensure full participation by simply increasing the size of networks, n? As Figure 3 shows,
over a large range of n, y ∗ is, indeed, increasing in n. However, as n grows, so does the possibility
that other (lower) steady states emerge.13 For n = 50, two stable steady states exist, one with a
participation rate of 0.12 and a second with a participation rate of 0.95 (a third, unstable, steady
state also exists at a participation rate of 0.28). In this example, an economy that begins at
a low initial participation rate may settle at a low participation steady state when networks are
large.14 Thus, larger networks do not necessarily guarantee that the economy will be more efficient.
Intuitively, when networks are very large and participation rates are very small, the ‘herding’ effect
of observing mostly non-participants, which will be the case for most individuals when y is low,
can overwhelm the effect of observing better average payoff measures. On the other hand, when
participation rates are high, the ‘herding’ effects work in favor of participation. (Similar tendencies
emerge when m is large.)
  12
     Note that these results implicitly assume that individuals do not adjust their decision rules in response to the
policy. This assumption is appropriate when policies are unannounced or have indirect effects on the payoffs to
different choices that are not easily recognized by decision makers. Examples might include the establishment of
empowerment zones in disadvantaged communities, increased enforcement of truancy laws, changes in school quality,
etc.
  13
     For very large n, a full information model is likely to be more appropriate for studying individual decisions.
  14
     With other parameterizations, multiple steady states may also exist for smaller network sizes.

Mentors

We next explore the potential for mentor programs to encourage youth to finish high school. Figure
4 shows ∆(y) for the base case with n = 6 and a case where individuals observe an additional
person randomly selected from the population. Both ∆(y) and y ∗ are quite similar for the two
cases, suggesting that a program which randomly selects mentors for youth should have little effect
on the economy.
   We next analyze a program that provides youth with a mentor who is randomly drawn from
the population of participants, so all youth observe at least one participant in their network. We
explore two cases. Consider first the case in which individuals continue to use the same decision rule
as before. In this case (the dotted line), ∆(y) increases for all values of y, especially for lower values.
The steady state participation rate rises to about 0.9. Here, a mentor program not only increases the
number of participant payoff signals observed for decision makers, which improves each individual’s
estimate of the payoff to participation, but it also increases the fraction of participants each decision
maker observes, which lowers the bar for participation. The former effect is particularly important
for those who would otherwise observe few participants, which explains why the effects are so large
when aggregate participation rates are low. In a sense, the latter effect assumes that youth are
unaware (or ignore) that mentors are drawn exclusively from the participant sample. Instead, youth

may disregard the information provided by their mentor’s participation decision and only use his
additional payoff signal. In other words, individuals may adjust their decision rule so that they
only consider non-mentors in computing their sample participation rate.15 In this case (the dashed
line), ∆(y) still increases substantially when aggregate participation rates are low, but there is little
effect when participation rates are above 20%.
    The way mentors are chosen and the response of decision makers to that selection mechanism is
important. A program that randomly assigns a mentor from the population at large is equivalent
to an increase in the size of social networks and offers little additional information about the payoffs
to high school graduation when aggregate graduation rates are low, since few of the mentors will
actually be participants. However, a program that draws mentors from the pool of graduates can
have large effects in areas with very low graduation rates, since it provides information about the
payoffs to a choice most decision makers are likely to be uninformed about.16 Mentor programs
offer a powerful way to improve outcomes in areas where graduation rates are quite low.
  15
     Let π̄pm represent the average payoff among all observed participants including the mentor, and x represent the
number of observed participants (excluding the mentor). Then, an individual observing a sample with x ∈ [0, n − 1]
participants chooses to participate if and only if π̄pm − π̄np ≥ m(1 − 2 nx ) (individuals with x = 0 observe a single
participant signal from their mentor).
  16
     Note that if prior beliefs are such that youth believe the payoffs to graduation are quite high (much higher than
they actually are), then a program that provides high school graduates as mentors may actually reduce the likelihood
that youth choose to graduate. With unbiased prior beliefs (or a symmetric decision rule), this is unlikely.


                                                                 15
Active and Inactive Participants

Wilson (1987) forcefully argues that the flight of middle- and working-class blacks from inner city
neighborhoods has negatively impacted those communities by reducing the number of positive role
models for youth. This can be studied within our framework by assuming that some fraction of
participants become inactive or detached from the community. Specifically, assume that only a
fraction ξ of participants remain in the population from which youth draw their network samples. 17
As shown in Figure 5, which assumes that 10% of participants become inactive (ξ = 0.9), both short-
and long-term participation rates are negatively affected by the flight of participants. The largest
impacts on short-term participation changes occur for intermediate values of y. If the participants
experiencing the highest payoffs are most likely to become inactive or leave the community, then the
negative impacts of their inactivity would be even greater. Disadvantaged communities plagued by
‘brain drain’ or an outflow of successful adults will tend to improve at a slower rate and settle at a
worse long-run steady state than otherwise similar communities. On the other hand, communities
in which successful adults are more active will face better short- and long-run prospects as shown in
Figure 5 (represented by ξ = 1.1). In contrast to the mentor programs already discussed, however,
policies that generally encourage successful adults to become more active in their communities will
have their greatest impacts when participation rates are neither very high nor very low.


4          Conclusions

The way in which individuals gather information and make decisions has important implications
for policies designed to influence decisions to finish high school, attend college, engage in crime,
etc. However, most existing economic research ignores the process of information acquisition by
assuming that individuals are fully informed about the potential outcomes of their choices. This
research cannot explain how mentor programs achieve their effects or why ghetto neighborhoods
plagued by the flight of successful adults fail to improve. To address these shortcomings, we study
individual decisions when information is acquired from social networks. A number of our findings
can be useful for guiding policy in a variety of social contexts.
         Our model of social networks suggests that steady state participation rates will generally be
inefficient. When participation in an activity is optimal, subsidies to participants or penalties on
non-participants can improve the efficiency of the economy. It is important to note, however, that

the choice between these two policies matters, especially when participation rates are either very
low or very high. A subsidy for participants will have little effect on the economy when current
participation rates are low, while a penalty on non-participants will have its greatest impact in these
cases. The relative effectiveness of these policies is reversed when participation rates are high.
This asymmetry has important practical implications. For example, in areas where high school
graduation rates are low, a policy that punishes high school drop may increase graduation rates
more than a policy that rewards graduates. On the other hand, such a policy may have little effect
in communities with high graduation rates. Strict enforcement of compulsory schooling laws should,
therefore, boost graduation rates in disadvantaged communities while having little effect in middle
and upper class areas. Similarly, a policy that imposes stronger punishments on gang members is
likely to reduce gang membership more than programs that improve legitimate opportunities in
gang-infested neighborhoods. However, in areas with few gang problems, encouraging legitimate
opportunities can be more effective at slowing or preventing the growth of gangs. Finally, programs
that indirectly aid teenage mothers are unlikely to increase teen pregnancy in most communities
where few teenagers choose to have children, but they may substantially increase teen motherhood
in impoverished communities where teen pregnancy is already a problem.
   We also find that efficiency is not necessarily improved when networks are expanded. However,


                                                                 17
efforts to supplement networks with mentors can be effective at raising participation rates if men-
tors are drawn from the pool of participants rather than the population at large. When aggregate
participation rates are low, the additional information about the payoffs to participation provided
by mentors who participated themselves can substantially increase participation rates. A mentor
program will be most effective in communities where youth are generally drawing their information
from a previous generation that was making suboptimal choices. So, providing youth in disadvan-
taged communities with mentors that finished high school, attended college, and avoided drugs,
crime, and gangs is likely to improve aggregate outcomes in all of these dimensions. On the other
hand, disadvantaged communities plagued by the flight of successful adults will improve at a slower
rate and settle at worse long-run outcomes than otherwise similar communities.

increase both θp and θnp such that θ increases and ∆(y) decreases for some values of y. For other
values of y, a decrease in both θp and θnp such that θ increases can cause ∆(y) to decline. A
symmetric argument applies to reductions in θ. 2

Appendix B

This appendix discusses the data used in generating Figure 1 and in determining the parameter
values used in the base case model of Section 3.

Census Data

Data on earnings, age, and education for white men are taken from the 1970 and 1980 Decennial
Censuses. In calculating high school graduation rates for Figure 1, we use white men ages 20-25.
Graduation rates (and their changes) for fifty-seven Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) with
250 or more observations are shown in the figure, though the same pattern emerges when the entire
sample is used.
    We first note that this pattern is not generated by differential changes in the rate of return
to high school completion across MSAs. A regression of 1970-80 changes in MSA high school
graduation rates on 1970-80 changes in the rate of return to high school 18 and the 1970 graduation
rate produces an estimated effect of -0.035 (standard error of 0.035) for changes in returns and
-0.367 (standard error of 0.084) for the initial graduation rate.
    While measurement error in graduation rates across MSAs will generate a negative relationship
between 1970-80 changes in graduation rates and 1970 graduation rates, we now show that this
can only explain a fraction of the negative correlation. In particular, we study the bias induced
when using sample graduation rates rather than true graduation rates to estimate the relationship
between ∆(y) and y. Let yj denote the true graduation rate in community j and ȳj = yj + ηj
the sample graduation rate taken from N random persons in that community; η j represents iid
measurement error. If dij is an indicator variable that equals one if individual i in community j
graduates and zero otherwise, then dij will have a mean of yj and variance of yj (1 − yj ). Since
      N
        dij , the variance of ηj is given by
      P
ȳj =
      i=1

                                                       yj (1 − yj )    1
                                         V ar(ηj ) =                ≤    .                                       (1)
                                                            N         4N

    Suppose we are interested in estimating the relationship

                                             ∆(yj ) = α + βyj + ωj ,
  18
     The returns to high school are estimated from MSA-level regressions of log wage earnings for white men ages
18-65 on indicators for education < 10 years, education = 10 or 11 years, education = 12 years, education = 13-15
years, and education ≥ 16 years, as well as experience (age - education - 6) and experience-squared. The coefficients
on the indicator for 12 years of school for each MSA are used as measures of the return to high school.



                                                         22
but we instead use OLS to estimate

                                              ∆(ȳj ) = α + β ȳj + νj .

Assuming ωj and νj are iid errors independent of each other as well as yj , the OLS estimate of β
(β̂) converges to
                                                          µ                           ¶
                                 Cov(y¯j , ∆(ȳj ))                V ar(yj )
                                                    =β                                    .                         (2)
                                   V ar(y¯j )                 V ar(yj ) + V ar(ηj )

Assuming β is negative, the OLS estimate provides an upper bound for the true β.
                                                                                                                     1
       Given the upper bound on V ar(ηj ) from equation (1), we know that V ar(yj ) ≥ V (ȳj ) −                    4N
and, therefore,
                                                   µ                         ¶
                                                       4N · V ar(ȳj ) − 1
                                       plim β̂ ≤                                 β.                                 (3)
                                                        4N · V ar(ȳj )
                                                                                               1
Combining equations (2) and (3), we see that for β < 0 and V ar(ȳj ) >                       4N ,
                          µ                     ¶
                              4N · V ar(ȳj )
                                                  plim β̂ ≤ β ≤ plim β̂.
                            4N · V ar(ȳj ) − 1

       Since we only use MSAs with N ≥ 250 and V ar(ȳ) = .002, any bias in estimating β or in the
slope of ∆(y) in Figure 1 should be no greater than a factor of two. The empirical bias in the paper
is likely to be substantially smaller for two reasons: (1) N is much larger than 250 for most MSAs
in the sample and (2) V ar(ηj ) is likely to be considerably smaller than 0.25, since graduation rates
are much greater than 0.5.

Base Case Parameterization

In determining θp and θnp , we use the 1970 Census, regressing log wage earnings on indicators for
education < 10 years, education = 10 or 11 years, education = 12 years, education = 13-15 years,
and education ≥ 16 years, as well as experience (age - education - 6) and experience-squared. The
values θp = 8.595 and θnp = 8.352 are given by the coefficients on the indicators for 10 or 11 years
of school and 12 years of school, respectively.
       We then set n = 6, m = σp2 = σnp
                                     2 = 1, and γ np (n) = γ p (n) = 7.8068 to produce a pattern for

∆(y) matching that of Figure 1.19


  19
    Other parameterizations can also produce similar   ¡ patterns over the limited range for y that is observed. The
                                                                      θ +θ
base values for γ np (n) and γ p (n) are derived from m 1 − 2 n−1
                                                             ¡    ¢¢
                                                               n
                                                                     − p 2 np . These thresholds are held fixed at their
base values when network sizes are adjusted in our policy experiments.
