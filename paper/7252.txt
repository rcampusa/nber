        This paper studies the extent to which the impact of tax policy on consumer spending differs
between temporary and permanent, as well as anticipated and unanticipated tax changes. To discriminate
between them, we use institutional information such as legal distinction between temporary and permanent
tax changes, as well as timing of policy announcement and implementation. We find that the impact of
temporary changes is significantly smaller than the impact of permanent changes. We also find that more
than 80 per cent of Japanese consumers, including those who distinguish between temporary and permanent
tax changes, respond to tax changes at the time of their implementation and not at the time of a policy
announcement. We suggest an interpretation that these consumers follow a near-rational decision rule.

1. Introduction The Japanese government has been regarding reductions in individual income

tax as one of the major policy tools to stimulate the economy. The government implemented an

income tax reduction of 5.5 trillion yen in 1994 and continued tax reductions of the same size until

the end of 1996 (see Table 1). In early 1997, the focus of economic policy temporarily shifted to

the rapid accumulation of public debt. However, it was not long before the Hashimoto

administration was forced to announce a temporary tax reduction of 2 trillion yen for CY1998 to

stimulate consumer spending, which had been deteriorating since April 1997. Moreover, on April

24, 1998, the Hashimoto administration announced a policy package, “Comprehensive Economic

Measures,” which included another tax reduction of 2 trillion yen.

       The total tax reductions during 1993 to 1998 amounted to 28 trillion yen. Even taking into

account the additional tax revenue from the consumption tax increase in April 1997, the tax policy

in these six years increased public debt by 21 trillion yen. These large-scale tax reductions can be

viewed as unprecedented fiscal experiments. The purpose of this paper is to investigate Japanese

consumers’ responses to these changes in taxes.

       The focus of the paper is on the effectiveness of tax policy. First, we are interested in the

difference between temporary and permanent tax reductions in their effects on consumer spending.

According to the permanent income hypothesis (PIH), the impact of a temporary tax cut on

permanent income, and therefore on consumer spending, is limited. The prediction of the PIH

seems to be consistent with the Japanese experience: the impacts of temporary tax cuts in 1994–

1998 were said to be limited, in spite of their large size. Based on such experience, many

politicians and researchers, both inside and outside the country, have been arguing that the tax

reduction that is to commence in the spring of 1999, should be a permanent one.




                                                  2
          Second, we are interested in the impact of tax cuts on consumer spending at the time of a

policy announcement. The PIH again provides a clear prediction: consumers increase their

spending at the time of a policy announcement, but there is no effect at the time of its

implementation. The fiscal experiments in 1993–1998, however, provide evidence against the

prediction. A typical example is the consumption tax increase in April 1997, which was announced

in September 1994, 30 months before the enforcement. If the PIH holds, we should have observed

a decrease in consumer spending in September 1994, and no change in April 1997. Contrary to the

prediction, however, consumer spending decreased significantly in April 1997.1 Many researchers

insist that the implementation of the consumption tax increase in April 1997 triggered further

deterioration of the Japanese economy in 1997 and 1998. Does this episode mean that most of the

Japanese are rule-of-thumb consumers who decide the level of spending according to current

income rather than permanent income?

          To address the two issues above, we need a data set that allows us to discriminate between

temporary and permanent, as well as unanticipated and anticipated, changes in taxes. Such a data

set permits us to estimate what types of tax changes took place and when.

          The core of our empirical strategy is to use institutional information about the tax systems in

identifying various types of shock. For example, tax reductions in Japan can be classified into two

categories: “institutional tax reductions” and “special tax reductions.” The former is a tax reform in

which the laws concerning income tax rates, as well as various allowances, are amended; the latter


1
    The consumption tax increase has not only the income effect, which we focus on here, but also the
substitution effect. For instance, researchers often point out that the decrease in consumption in April 1997




                                                       3
is a change in tax credit that is effective only for a specific year. This institutional information

allows researchers to distinguish between temporary and permanent tax reductions. More

importantly, it is probably safe to assume that consumers had the same belief about the distinction

between temporary and permanent tax reductions.2

          The distinction between unanticipated and anticipated changes in taxes is more subtle than

that between temporary and permanent ones. Given that policy decisions are made over time in the

process of political negotiation, it is not easy to pinpoint an exact date on which a consumer’s belief

about the future course of tax policy is revised.3 However, it is still possible to estimate it by

looking carefully at the sequence of the events involved. To be more concrete, it is probably

natural to assume that consumers revise their beliefs about a change in taxes at the timing of major

events such as: (1) the tax advisory commission of the Prime Minister making a policy

recommendation; (2) the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) tax committee submitting, to the

government, a proposal for the reform; (3) the Cabinet approving the proposal; and (4) the Diet

approving the bill.


was at least partially due to the reversal in the stepped-up demand in and before March 1997. We will
consider this substitution effect in the section of empirical analysis.
2
    Of course, not all consumers have enough time to read the laws carefully. In addition, ‘intelligent’
consumers, who observe the economy is getting worse, might have an expectation that a special tax
reduction will be rolled over in the next year or even longer. As shown later in the section of empirical
analysis, however, the data suggest that most Japanese consumers distinguish between temporary and
permanent tax changes as written in the laws.
3
    An exception is Prime Minister Hashimoto’s sudden announcement in December 1997 about the special
tax reduction for 1998. This was ‘news’ to almost all consumers, because the Prime Minister made the
decision without consulting many politicians and bureaucrats, but such top-down decision-making is rare in
Japan.



                                                         4
         Our “institutional information” approach differs from the time-series approach, which is

adopted in many empirical studies on consumer behaviour (see, for example, Flavin 1981). For

example, the time-series approach extracts unanticipated fluctuations in disposable income as the

residuals of the time-series model. Although the residuals represent the unanticipated part of

fluctuations in disposable income for those researchers who make a forecast using the time-series

model, there is no guarantee that the same thing is true for consumers; they might have more

information than is expressed by the time-series model. Moreover, if one wants to decompose

fluctuations in disposable income into temporary and permanent changes using the time-series

method, one has to impose some strong assumptions.4 The “institutional information” approach,

which requires relatively weak assumptions to discriminate between anticipated and unanticipated,

as well as permanent and temporary, changes in taxes and social security contributions, is suitable

to the study of the impacts of those changes.

         Our institutional information approach is similar to that adopted by Poterba (1988), who

carefully picks out two episodes of temporary income tax shocks in the U.S. (1968 surtax and 1975

income tax rebate) to study consumers’ response to them at the time of their implementation. He

finds that consumers’ response to temporary tax shocks was much larger than predicted by the PIH,

interpreting this as an evidence of consumers’ myopic behaviour. In addition, he looks at

consumption response at the time of policy announcement, which is defined as the month of

congressional passage of tax bill, but fails to detect any statistically significant impacts of policy



4
    Many ways to decompose fluctuations in disposable income into temporary and permanent changes exist,
so it is impossible to choose one among them without imposing some restrictions (see, for example, Quah
1990).



                                                     5
announcement.5 Japanese data set that contains more than forty episodes of tax shock allows us to

conduct Poterba’s exercise in way that is more efficient.

          The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the institutional information

and our empirical approach; and Section 3 presents regression results. Through a careful

examination of the contemporaneous relationship between various types of tax innovations and

monthly changes in aggregate consumption, we find that the impact of temporary tax changes is

significantly smaller than the impact of permanent tax changes. We also find that more than 80 per

cent of Japanese consumers, including forward-looking consumers who distinguish between

temporary and permanent tax changes, respond to tax changes not at the timing of the policy

announcement, but at the timing of its implementation. We suggest an interpretation that forward-

looking consumers who ignore policy announcements follow a near-rational decision rule. To

reinforce this interpretation, the consumers’ utility cost of ignoring policy announcements is

estimated in Section 4. The estimated utility cost is less than 0.1 per cent of the PIH consumption.

Section 5 concludes the paper.



2. Empirical strategy

2.1. Institutional information              Our data set contains 43 episodes of changes in national

income tax, local income tax, consumption tax, and social security contribution.6 The sample


5
    Our approach is also similar, at least in spirit, to Wilcox (1989) , who uses the institutional information that
the statutory changes in social security benefits are announced at least six weeks in advance of the payable
date.
6
    There are two kinds of individual income tax in Japan: “Individual income tax” and “individual
inhabitant’s tax.” The former taxes are collected by the central government, whereas the latter taxes are



                                                          6
period is 1975 to 1998. For each of these episodes, the data set contains institutional information

on: (1) the date of announcement; (2) the date of implementation; (3) the size of changes; and (4)

the distinction between temporary and permanent changes.

          Table A1 gives the details of the data set. The first column, labelled “Date of

implementation”, shows the date on which changes in the disposable income occurred, reflecting

changes in taxes and social security contributions.

          The column labelled “Date of announcement” presents the date on which the LDP tax

committee submitted a proposal report to the government, “Outline of tax reform,” describing the

details of the reform. Consumers are thought to revise their beliefs about a tax reform at the timing

of the major events, such as: (1) the tax advisory commission of the Prime Minister making a

policy recommendation; (2) the LDP tax committee submitting the “Outline of tax reform” to the

government; (3) the Cabinet approving the proposal; and (4) the Diet approving the bill. We regard

the second event as “announcement” because it provides consumers with a significant amount of

information about future tax reform.7


collected by the local governments. In this paper, “individual income tax” is referred as national income tax,
and “individual inhabitant’s tax” is referred as local income tax. See Appendix A for a description of the
major tax reforms in Japan during the post-war period, and see Appendix B for an outline of the Japanese
social insurance system.
7
    The second event is more informative than the other three events. The report made by the tax advisory
commission of the Prime Minister provides the grand design of the reform, not the details of the reform.
Therefore, it is impossible for consumers to know from the report how much their tax burden will change.
The third event almost always takes place within two weeks after the second event, which implies that the
third event is a ‘ceremony’ that provides no additional information to consumers. The fourth event seems to
be a strong competitor to the second event. In reality, however, there is no example in the 1990s in which
the bills reflecting the proposal contained in “Outline of tax reform” were rejected by the Diet and thus it is



                                                       7
         The column labelled “Estimated size” reports the size of the changes in taxes and social

security contributions for the average “worker household” in the Family Income and Expenditure

Survey (FIES),8 which is the source of the monthly consumption data used in the empirical analysis

of Section 3. A “worker household” is defined in the FIES as a household whose head is on a

payroll. The size of a change in income taxes for the average worker household is primarily

determined by its annual labour income and family size. We take both of them from the FIES and

estimate the size of changes in income taxes, following the formulae described in the laws. The

size of a change in consumption tax is estimated by multiplying the total of expenditures on taxable

items, which are taken from the FIES, by the percentage change in the consumption tax rate. The

size of a change in social security contributions, which is primarily determined by the annual labour

income of the average worker household, is estimated following the formulae described in the

corresponding laws.

         The fourth column indicates the type of institutional change: 21 episodes of changes in

national income tax; 15 episodes of changes in local income tax; two episodes of changes in

consumption tax; and five episodes of changes in social security contribution.

         The fifth column indicates the legal distinction between temporary and permanent changes.

There are 18 episodes of temporary changes and 25 episodes of permanent changes. All of the

changes in social security contributions and consumption taxes are permanent ones. As to national


safe to assume that the fourth event does not provide any significant amount of additional information to
consumers.

    This survey is a monthly diary survey conducted by the Management and Coordination Agency of the
Japanese government. It covers about 8000 households, one-sixth of which are replaced by new households
every month.



                                                      8
and local income taxes, permanent large-scale tax reductions were implemented in 1975, 1977,

1984, 1989 and 1995. Most of the temporary tax reductions (13 episodes out of 18) were

implemented in the post-bubble period.

          We construct four time-series variables that summarize the institutional information

described in Table A1. For episode i, the month of implementation is denoted by t i; the month of

announcement by t i-τi; and the size of change, which is deflated by the Consumer Price Index and

divided by the average household’s real labour income in the previous month, is denoted by x i.

Denote the total number of episodes by n (n = 43), and rearrange the order of the episodes so that i

= 1 to m represent the episodes of permanent changes and i = m+1 to n represent those of temporary

changes. Denoting the discount factor by β0 , the four variables, vIP, vIT, v AP, and vAT are defined as:

vtIP = ∑ xi                    where IPt ≡ { j ∈ [1, m] t j = t }                             (1.1)
          i ∈IPt



vtIT = ∑ xi                    where ITt ≡ { j ∈ [ m + 1, n] t j = t }                        (1.2)
          i ∈ITt



 AP
vt    =   ∑β     0
                     τi
                          xi   where APt ≡ { j ∈[1, m] t j − τ j = t }                        (1.3)
            i ∈APt



v tAT =   ∑β     0
                     τi
                          xi   where ATt ≡ { j ∈[ m + 1, n ] t j − τ j = t }                  (1.4)
            i ∈ATt



The superscripts I and A represent ‘implementation’ and ‘announcement’, respectively, and the

superscripts P and T represent ‘permanent’ and ‘temporary’, respectively. The variable vIP (v IT)

represents when and how much permanent (temporary) changes are implemented. Similarly, the

variable vAP (v AT) represents when and how much permanent (temporary) changes are announced.

Note that the size of change, x i, is transformed into the value evaluated at the month of




                                                          9
announcement, t i-τi, by multiplying by β0 τi, as shown on the right-hand side of equations (1.3) and

(1.4).



2.2. Four types of consumers          The institutional information in our data set tells us when and

how much changes in taxes and social security contributions are announced and implemented, as

well as whether those changes are temporary or permanent. It allows us to identify four types of

consumers. The first type consists of consumers who adjust their consumption according to current

disposable income and, therefore, are labelled “current income consumers.” They do not

distinguish between temporary and permanent changes and respond not at the timing of

announcement but at the timing of implementation. Consumers of the second type, labelled

“permanent income consumers,” distinguish between temporary and permanent changes and adjust

their responses depending on the persistence of shock. They respond to changes in taxes only at the

timing of announcement. The third type, called “near-rational consumers,” distinguishes between

temporary and permanent changes and responds not at the timing of announcement but at the

timing of implementation. Finally, the fourth type, labelled “Ricardian consumers,” does not

respond at all to changes in taxes.

         We make two remarks about the above classification of consumers. First, why do

permanent-income consumers and near-rational consumers respond to changes in taxes? One

explanation is that they simply fail to recognize government’s intertemporal budget constraint. An

alternative explanation is that, although they recognize the government’s intertemporal budget

constraint, they have a belief that the government will finance tax reductions by cutting future




                                                  10
expenditures. Unless otherwise indicated, the arguments in the rest of the paper will be based on

the second interpretation.

         As long as we interpret the behaviour of the second and third type in this way, both are

forward-looking consumers. In this respect, there is no distinction between these two types and the

fourth type. However, they differ in their expectations about how tax reduction today will be

financed in the future. The second and third types expect that the government will cut future

expenditures to finance today’s tax reduction, while the fourth type expects that the government

will increase tax burdens in the future without changing government expenditures.

         Second, why do near-rational consumers ignore policy announcements, although they take

into consideration the persistence of shocks in deciding their responses? An explanation is that

they follow a near-rational decision rule, as suggested by Cochrane (1989),9 in which the utility

gained by using policy announcements to better adjust consumption does not outweigh the costs of

obtaining and processing the information. Therefore, they choose not to respond at the timing of

the policy announcement. On the other hand, the utility gained by distinguishing between

temporary and permanent tax changes is large relative to the costs.


9
    The idea of near-rationality was proposed by Akerlof and Yellen (1985a, b) and applied to the consumer
behaviour by Cochrane (1989) and Caballero (1995). Cochrane (1989) interprets the excess sensitivity of
consumption as a near-rational decision rule in an environment where the costs of obtaining and processing
information are not negligible. In Caballero’s (1995) model, consumers do not adjust their consumption
until the deviation from the theoretical level, computed from the permanent income, reaches a pre-specified
trigger point, because the cost of such inaction is small in utility terms. His model is supported by U.S. data.
Shea (1995), in an empirical analysis using panel data, finds that consumption is more sensitive to large
absolute expected wage changes than to small expected wage changes and concludes that this is inconsistent
with near-rationality.



                                                      11
          For example, suppose that the LDP tax committee releases a report recommending a special

tax reduction to be implemented in six months. In our definition, this is regarded as a policy

announcement. The announcement provides detailed information about how much money will be

refunded to a worker depending upon his/her annual income, family size, etc. The worker has the

ability to calculate the amount of special tax reduction he/she will receive, but the costs in time and

effort are not negligible. On the other hand, what would be obtained from the calculation? The

worker could revise his/her permanent disposable income based on the calculation and adjust

his/her spending six months earlier, thereby succeeding in consumption smoothing. If he/she were

very smart, like the second type of consumer, the costs of the calculation would be smaller than the

utility gained by the prompt adjustment. Otherwise, the best strategy would be to wait for the next

six months to see what information becomes available on the exact amount of special tax

reductions.10

          It is important to note that the behaviour of near-rational consumers is consistent with two

regularities repeatedly observed in empirical studies on consumer behaviour: excess smoothness

and excess sensitivity of consumption. Their behaviour is excessively smooth in the sense that they

ignore policy announcements,11 and, at the same time, it is excessively sensitive, in the sense that

they respond to predictable, or already announced, changes in taxes and social security


10
     An alternative explanation of the behaviour of the third type of consumers is that the policy announcement
lacks credibility for some reason, so that the consumers do not respond to it. The theoretical possibility of
this cannot be denied, but it is not realistic in our setting. Given that the LDP releases a report after a series
of hard political negotiations, the probability of failure would be quite small.
11
     Note that this definition of excess smoothness is stronger than that of Campbell and Deaton (1989). See
Deaton (1992) for more on the difference between the two definitions.

contributions. Also, note that it is consistent with the response of the Japanese consumers to the

pre-announced increase in the consumption tax rate in April 1997.



2.3. Derivation of an estimating equation                   The empirical analysis of the paper aims to

estimate the fractions of each type of consumer, as well as the discount factor. Estimating them

leads to answering the questions raised in Section 1: (1) how much difference there is between

temporary and permanent changes; and (2) whether consumers respond to policy announcements.

        Let Cit (i=1, 2, 3, 4), Yt, Dt denote, respectively, the per-household real consumption of type

i consumer, the per-household real labour income, and the per-household real disposable income.

Here we assume that the consumer type is unrelated to income, so that the variables Y and D are not

a function of i. The variables ∆Cit, ∆Yt, and ∆Dt, represent monthly changes. We divide ∆Cit, ∆Yt,

and ∆Dt by Yt-1 for scaling, and express the corresponding variables by ∆cit, ∆yt, and ∆dt.

        Under the assumption that the subjective discount rate is equal to the real interest rate and

that the instantaneous utility function is quadratic, monthly changes in consumption of each type is

expressed by

∆c1t = ∆d t = ∆yt − v tIP − ∆v tIT                                                                         (2.1)

represents the annuity value of revisions in the expected labour income stream.

         To illustrate the implications of equations (2.1) to (2.4), we compare the responses of each

type of consumer to a permanent/temporary tax reduction of one thousand yen. According to

equation (2.1), current income consumers increase their consumption by one thousand yen,

irrespective of whether it is a permanent or a temporary tax reduction. Equation (2.2), combined

with equations (1.3) and (1.4), states that permanent income consumers increase their consumption

by β0 τ thousand yen in response to a permanent tax reduction, but they increase consumption by (1-

β0)β0τ thousand yen in response to a temporary one ( τ represents the interval between an

announcement and its implementation). Note that, since β0 is less than but close to one, β0 τ is close

to one while (1-β0)β0 τ is close to zero. This means that the impact of a temporary tax reduction is

limited relative to a permanent one.12 Equation (2.3) says that near-rational consumers increase

their consumption by one thousand yen in response to a permanent tax reduction, but they increase

their consumption by (1-β0) thousand yen in response to a temporary reduction. Finally, equation

(2.4) says that Ricardian consumers have no response to changes in taxes.

         Let λ denote the fraction of the aggregate income that accrues to current income consumers.

The amounts of the remainder, 1-λ, that accrue to permanent income consumers, near-rational

consumers and Ricardian consumers are (1-λ)φ1 , (1-λ)φ2 and (1-λ)(1−φ1 -φ2 ), respectively. The

monthly change in the real consumption of the average household, denoted by ∆ct, is expressed as:




                                                                          14
∆ct = λ∆c1t + (1 − λ)φ1 ∆c2 t + (1 − λ)φ 2 ∆c3 t + (1 − λ)(1 − φ 1 − φ 2 ) ∆c4 t + ε t                     (3)

       = λ∆d t − (1 − λ)( φ1 vt A + φ 2 vtI ) + (1 − λ)ut + ε t

where v tA = v tAP + (1 − β 0 )vtAT and v tI = vtIP + (1 − β 0 )vtIT and εt is the error term. The second equality

follows from equations (2.2), (2.3) and (2.4). The equation to be estimated in Section 3 is a less

restrictive version of equation (3):

∆ct = λ∆d t − (1 − λ ){φ 1 [vtAP + (1 − β 1 ) vtAT ] + φ 2 [vtIP + (1 − β 2 )vtIT ] − ut } + ε t .         (4)

Note that β1 and β2 could be different from β0 , which is used in the construction of v ts in equations

(1.3) and (1.4). Also, note that equation (4) reduces to equation (3) when β0=β1=β2 .



2.4. Econometric issue                 Before we estimate the model, we need to consider the

contemporaneous correlation between ∆dt and ut.

          Since changes in current disposable income contain information about the total lifetime

income, the two variables ∆dt and ut are almost certainly correlated. When ∆dt takes a positive

value, ut is expected to have a positive value. In this case, estimating equation (4) by ordinary

least-squares (OLS) regression, which regards λ2 ut+εt as the error term, leads to biased estimators

for the parameters. One way to deal with this problem is to construct a proxy for ut and add it to

the list of independent variables. To be more specific, we first estimate a univariate time-series

model for the growth rate of real labour income, ∆yt, and use the series of residuals as a proxy




12
     Note that both β0τ and (1-β0 )β0τ are smaller for larger τ. Thus, the announcement effect of a tax reduction
to be implemented in the distant future is very small.



                                                                  15

variable.13 Expressing the estimated time-series model by ∆y t =                           ∑ a j ut − j = A( L)ut and denoting
                                                                                            j =0


the series of residuals by u$t , equation (4) becomes:

∆ct = λ∆d t − (1 − λ ){φ 1 [vtAP + (1 − β 1 ) vtAT ] + φ 2 [ vtIP + (1 − β 2 )vtIT ] − θu$t } + ε t                 (5)

where a new parameter, θ , is defined by

                 ∞
θ = A ( β) ≡    ∑a jβ j ,
                 j =0


which represents the degree of persistence of innovations in the growth rate of real labour income.14

We use this estimation method in the regression analysis of Section 3.

          The above two-step procedure might fail if u$t is not a good proxy for ut.15 An alternative

way to estimate equation (4), without constructing a proxy variable, is to regard λ2 ut+εt of equation

(4) as the error term and estimate equation (4) using an instrumental variable for ∆dt involving

lagged variables, as proposed by Campbell and Mankiw (1989, 1990, 1991). In Section 3, we also

use this method to check that the regression results do not depend crucially on the estimation

method.

13
     Since changes in the consumption tax are already included in vAP and vIP, we must make sure that the same
innovations are not contained in u$t . We do this by: (1) removing the effects of changes in the consumption

tax from the series of the CPI; (2) constructing the adjusted series of the real income by deflating the
nominal income by the CPI constructed in (1); and (3) estimating a time-series model for the log of the
adjusted real income.
14
     See, for example, Quah (1990) for more details on this point.
15
     More generally, it is known that in the two-step procedure such as this (i.e. imputing unobserved
regressors from an auxiliary econometric model), the second-step estimated standard errors and related test
statistics are incorrect. See Murphy and Topel (1985) for more on this issue.



                                                                   16
3. Empirical results

3.1. Preliminary analysis        Table 2 presents the mean of monthly changes in propensity to

consume out of labour income. The sample period, 1975:01 to 1998:06, is divided into sub-

samples according to the sign of vtI or vtA . The row labelled “ vtI <0” shows the mean of monthly

changes in propensity to consume in months when tax reductions are implemented. For example,

the mean value for “all items” is +0.00288, which is significantly larger than the no-implementation

mean value at the five per cent level. On the other hand, in months whenvtI is positive, that is, a tax

(or social security contributions) increase is implemented, the mean of monthly changes in

propensity to consume for all items is significantly smaller than that for the no-implementation

mean value at the five per cent level. The tendency that the propensity to consume is higher in

months when tax reductions are implemented, and lower in months when tax increases are

implemented, is observed not only for “all items” but also for the subcategories “non-durables and

services” and “durables.”

       The row labelled “ vtA <0” shows the mean of monthly changes in propensity to consume in

months when tax reductions are announced. The figure for all items is significantly smaller than

that for the no-announcement mean value at the 10 per cent level, which contradicts the hypothesis

that the announcements of tax reductions stimulate consumer spending. It is important to note that

consumer spending on durables increases in response to the announcements of tax reductions, while

spending on non-durables and services decreases. In months when vtA is positive, the figure for all




                                                  17
items is significantly smaller than that for the no-announcement mean value at the five per cent

level.

          In summary, the above simple analyses seem to indicate that the implementation of tax

changes has a significant impact on consumer spending, but the policy announcement does not. In

particular, the data indicate that the announcement of tax reductions is not effective in stimulating

consumer spending.



3.2. Baseline regression results              Table 3 presents estimates for the parameters of equations

(5) and (4). We use the monthly data from 1975:01 to 1998:06. The variables v t and u$t are

constructed as described in Section 2; and the variables ∆ct and ∆dt are constructed using the

monthly series of per-household total expenditure and the corresponding series of disposable

income, both being taken from the FIES.16 The FIES provides monthly per-household expenditures

by item, but we use total expenditure as the dependent variable, unless otherwise indicated, because

our main interest is in the effect of tax changes on total spending, rather than that on expenditure on

specific items.

          Estimation method used is non-linear least squares (NLLS) or two-stage least squares

(2SLS). In addition to the independent variables listed on the right-hand side of equations (5) and

(4), we include intercepts and the two dummy variables associated with changes in the


16
     The variables ∆ct and ∆dt are constructed as follows: (1) deflate the original (i.e., non-seasonally-adjusted)
series of consumption and disposable income by the CPI; (2) estimate a univariate seasonal ARIMA model
for the log of the real consumption and for the log of the real disposable income; (3) construct a seasonally-
adjusted series by the signal extraction method; (4) transform the two seasonally-adjusted series into original
units; (5) take the first difference and divide by the real income in the previous month for scaling.



                                                         18
consumption tax rate. One of the two dummies represents the stepped-up demand before the

introduction of the consumption tax in April 1989, as well as its reversal effects. It takes the value

of +1 in 1989:03 and -1 in 1989:04. The other dummy, which is associated with the increase in the

consumption tax rate in April 1997, takes the value of +1 in 1997:03 and -1 in 1997:04. The

discount factor used in the construction of the v ts in equations (1.3) and (1.4) is set at β0=0.99,

unless otherwise indicated.

          The first column of Table 3 shows the result for the specification in which no parameter

restriction is imposed. All of the six coefficients are positive and less than one, which is consistent

with theoretical expectations. The estimate of λ is 0.24, which means that 24 per cent of Japanese

households are current income consumers.17

          The coefficient φ1 represents the fraction of permanent income consumers who respond

appropriately to policy announcements. The estimate of φ1 was 0.59, with standard error of 0.62,

so the hypothesis that φ1 is equal to zero cannot be rejected. The Japanese aggregate consumption

is excessively smooth in this sense. 18 On the other hand, the coefficient φ2 represents the fraction

of near-rational consumers who respond to the pre-announced changes in taxes and social security

17
     Campbell and Mankiw (1989, 1990, 1991) estimates λ, the fraction of current income consumers, by
regressing ∆ct on ∆d t , by using an instrumental variable for ∆d t , involving lagged variables. We estimate λ
following their method to find that the estimate of λ is 0.2887, with the standard error of 0.1149. This is
close to the estimates shown in Table 3.
18
     In interpreting the result that φ1 is close to zero, we should note the possibility that our definition of the
time of announcement might be imprecise. Our regression is based on the assumption that consumers revise
their beliefs on the day when the LDP tax committee submits the “outline of tax reform,” but they might




                                                           19
contributions, so that φ2 can be interpreted as the measure of the excess sensitivity of consumption.

The estimate of φ2 is close to one and nearly twice its standard error. Japanese consumption is

excessively sensitive in this sense. The sum of φ1 and φ2 is well above one ( φ1+φ2=1.57), and the

Wald test fails to reject the null hypothesis that φ1+φ2=1 (p-value=0.4693). In other words, we

cannot reject the null hypothesis that the fraction of Ricardian consumers, 1-φ1-φ2 , is equal to zero.

        The discount factors, β1 and β2 , are both close to one, and significantly different from zero.

Thus, both permanent income consumers and near-rational consumers distinguish temporary and

permanent changes, and respond differently depending on whether it is temporary or permanent.

According to the estimates of β1 , for example, permanent income consumers increase their

spending by about 180 yen to a temporary tax reduction of 10,000 yen, while they increase it by

about 10,000 yen for a permanent tax reduction of the same size. The finding that the estimates of

the discount factor are close to one is consistent with the anecdotal evidence concerning the

responses of Japanese consumers to special tax reductions. For example, according to a survey

conducted by the Nikkei, the fraction of the consumers who spent the tax refund of 1997 was 43

per cent, while the remaining 57 per cent saved it, recognizing that it was a temporary tax

reduction.

        The second and third columns of Table 3 show the regression results when additional

restrictions on coefficients are imposed: β1=β2 for the second column; β1=β2 and φ1+φ2=1 for the

third column. We observe in both cases that (1) λ is about 0.24; (2) φ1 is close to zero (excess



revise their beliefs at a different stage in the legislative process. If this is the case, the estimate of φ1 is
biased to zero.



                                                          20
smoothness) while φ2 is close to one (excess sensitivity); (3) βs are between 0.9 and 1.0. The basic

findings are unchanged if we impose a further restriction that β0 , the discount factor used in the

construction of v ts, coincides with β1 and β2 . (Regression results corresponding to this case are not

reported in the table.19 )

          According to the estimates reported in the third column of Table 3, a permanent tax

reduction of 10,000 yen per month would increase the monthly spending of the average household

by about 1500 yen after the time of announcement of a policy change, and by an additional 8500

yen after the month of implementation. By comparison, a one-time tax reduction of the same size

would increase the monthly spending by 150 yen during the months between the announcement and

its implementation, 3200 yen in the month of implementation, and 800 yen in or after the next

month. The estimated impact of a temporary tax reduction is quite close to that reported in Poterba

(1988) and Blinder (1981): Poterba (1988) reports that a $1 temporary tax reduction increases

consumer spending by 12–24 cents, while Blinder (1981) gives the estimate of 16 cents per dollar

of temporary tax rebate.

          The fourth to the sixth columns of Table 3 repeat the same set of regressions as the first

three columns, but the 2SLS method is used instead of NLLS, to rule out the possibility that u$t

might not be a good proxy for ut, so that the regression results might be distorted. The fourth

column re-estimates the specification [1], dropping u$t from the list of independent variables and

using instrumental variables for ∆dt, being the lags, ∆dt-2,...,∆dt-6, ∆ct-2,...,∆ct-6. The estimated

coefficients, λ and φ2 , are slightly larger than those before, but otherwise the results are similar to


19
     We set β0 at a particular value, calculate the vt s, and conduct a NLLS to obtain the estimates of β1 and β2.




                                                         21
those reported in the first column. The fifth and sixth columns of the table also corroborate the

regression results reported in the second and third columns.



3.3. Sensitivity analysis        To check the robustness of the estimates obtained in the baseline

regression, we re-estimated the equations in several different ways. The first column of Table 4

addresses the possibility that the estimates might be distorted by measurement errors contained in

the four variables representing changes in taxes and social security contributions: v AP, v AT, vIP, and

v IT. We re-estimated the specification [2] of Table 3, using instrumental variables for the four

independent variables. The instrumental variable corresponding to vAP takes the value of +1 in

months when vAP>0, -1 when v AP<0 and zero otherwise, and the other three instrumental variables

were constructed in the same way. The estimated results, which are presented in the first column of

Table 4, are similar to those reported in the second column of Table 3. The estimate of φ2 is

slightly smaller than before, but the Wald test does not reject the null hypothesis that the sum of φ1

and φ1 equals one. The estimate of β1 is smaller than before, but still significantly different from

zero. Other estimates are almost the same as before.

       Next, we checked the possibility that the two dummy variables associated with changes in

the consumption tax rate might not capture the stepped-up demand before the tax-rate increases, as

well as its reversal effects. We re-estimated the specification [2] of Table 3, deleting the

observations related to changes in the consumption tax rate: 1989:03, 1989:04, 1997:03, and




We repeat this procedure until the value of β0 coincides with the estimates of β1 and β2 .




                                                      22
1997:04. The results were similar to those reported in Table 3, except that the estimate of φ1 was

slightly smaller than before.

          We conducted the diagnostic test proposed by Belsley, Kuh and Welsch (1980) to test if the

estimated coefficients were affected by outliers. We calculated DFBETASij, a scaled measure of

the change in the jth estimated coefficients that would occur if the ith observation were deleted.

This statistic is compared with the critical value, 2 / N , where N is the sample size. The result of

the test (which is not shown on the table) indicated that the estimated coefficients were nearly

always stable, but a large change in the estimated coefficient of vtAT occurred when we deleted the

observation for December 1997. 20 The third column of Table 4 presents the regression results

when we deleted this observation. The estimate of β1 showed a large change from 0.9418 to

0.8890, which is comparable with the standard error of the estimated coefficient. Nevertheless, the

estimate of β1 was still significantly different from zero, so that it is reasonable to assert, even in

this case, that temporary changes in taxes have smaller impacts on consumer spending relative to

permanent changes.

          The fourth and fifth columns of Table 4 address the possibility that the dependent variable in

the regression, the total expenditure, might not be an appropriate variable to represent ct in equation

(5), because it includes expenditures on durables. To be more specific, the variable ct in equation


20
     December 1997 is the month when people showed serious concern about the stability of the Japanese
financial system after observing two big failures: Hokkaido-Takushoku Bank and Yamaichi Securities. On
the other hand, this is the month when the Prime Minister Hashimoto announced special tax reduction for
CY 1998 in an unusual way (see footnote 3). The first event predicts a negative residual in this month while
the second events predicts a positive residual. We consistently observe unusually large negative residual in
this month, which suggests that the financial disorder had a dominantly large impact.



                                                     23
(5) should be consumption rather than expenditure, and the timing of consumption does not

necessarily coincide with that of expenditure for commodities with durability. To deal with this

problem, we first re-estimate the specification [2] of Table 3, replacing the total expenditure by the

expenditure on “on-durables and services,” a sub-category available in the FIES. According to the

regression results reported in the fourth column of Table 4, both φ1 and φ1 are smaller than before,

but the sum of the two is still above one and the Wald test rejects the null-hypothesis that φ1+φ1=1.

          As pointed out by Mankiw (1982) and Hayashi (1985), however, even commodities labelled

as non-durables or services might have some durability, in the sense that the timing of expenditure

does not coincide with that of consumption.21 To take this point into consideration explicitly,

following Mankiw (1982) and Hayashi (1985), we assume that current consumption on all

commodities, denoted by ct , is a Koyck-type distributed lag function of current and past

expenditures on all commodities:

         ∞
ct =     ∑ ρ k ct− k   = (1 − ρL) −1 c t
        k =0


where L is the lag operator, and ρ is the coefficient representing the durability of consumption,

where 0 ≤ρ≤1. Under this assumption, the equation (5) to be estimated changes to:

∆ct = λ∆d t + (1 − λ )(1 − ρL){θu$t − φ 1 [vtAP + (1 − β 1 )vtAT ] − φ 2 [vtIP + (1 − β 2 )vtIT ]} + (1 − ρL) ε t   (6)




21
     For example, a special dinner at a restaurant is physically perishable and thus labelled “services” in the
FIES. However, people may derive utility from the memory of the dinner, and, if so, expenditure on the
special dinner at a restaurant should be treated as if it were durable. See Hayashi (1985) for more on this
issue.



                                                                24
          Equation (6) differs from (5) in that consumers overreact to changes in taxes in period t and

correct it in period t+1. For example, equation (6) implies that permanent income consumers

would increase their expenditure by one yen in period t in response to the announcement of a

permanent tax reduction of one yen, and decrease them in period t+1 by ρ yen.22 We estimate

equation (6) by NLLS using total expenditure as the dependent variable. The regression results are

presented in the fifth column of Table 4, where standard errors are Newey-West estimators that are

robust to serial correlation in the error term. Again we found no significant changes in the

estimated coefficients: both φ1 and φ1 were smaller than before but the Wald test still rejected the

null hypothesis that φ1+φ1=1. The estimated value of ρ, 0.158, was fairly close to that obtained by

Hayashi (1985) using Japanese panel data, although we cannot reject the null hypothesis that ρ

equals zero because of the low precision of the estimator (standard error equal to 0.243).23

          Table 5 continues the sensitivity analysis. We checked to see whether the estimates of φ1

were biased toward zero, due to the contemporaneous correlation between vA and ε, through the so-

called “non-Keynesian effects of fiscal expansion.”

          According to Giavazzi and Pagano (1990, 1995), fiscal expansions are sometimes

accompanied by decreases in private demand, particularly private consumption, because consumers


22
     That is, ∆c t = 1, ∆ct+1 = − ρ , and ∆ct + j = 0 for j>1. It is easy to see that, given this stream of expenditure,

∆ct = ∆c t+1 = ∆ct +2 =...=1.
23
     An alternative way to deal with the problem of consumption durability is to estimate equation (4) by 2SLS
using more than twice-lagged instruments, ∆d t-2,...,∆dt-6, ∆ct-2,...,∆ct-6. Note that twice-lagged instruments
are uncorrelated with the error term, even if the error term was an AR(1) process. Thus, the regression
results [4] to [6] of Table 3 are still valid even in the presence of consumption durability, as long as we use
the Newey-West estimator for standard errors.



                                                           25
who observe fiscal expansions expect that their tax burden will be increased in the future to finance

additional government spending.24 Incorporating this effect into our model, equation (5) changes

to:

∆ct = λ∆d t − (1 − λ)φ1 [ vtAP + (1 − β1 ) v tAT ] − (1 − λ)φ2 [ vtIP + (1 − β2 ) v tIT ] + (1 − λ)θ u$ t + κg t + ηt


where gt represents the amount of additional government spending announced at t. If the non-

Keynesian effect exists, the coefficient on gt, κ, should be negative.

          If gt is not correlated with other explanatory variables, we can safely ignore this variable in

estimating equation (5). The variable gt is a part of the error term εt of equation (5), which is

uncorrelated with other explanatory variables. But, we have at least one reason to believe that v A

and g might be negatively correlated in our sample period; that is, reductions in taxes and increases

in government expenditures, both of which are important components of fiscal stimulus packages,

have often been announced simultaneously during the post-bubble period.25

          The variable, gt, is defined as announced additional issue of “construction bonds,” a type of

government bond that is issued specifically for financing public investments, divided by the

     Giavazzi and Pagano (1995) found a large negative error in the consumption function during the Swedish
fiscal expansion of the early 1990s, and suggested that this was due to a downward revision in the permanent
disposable income that was triggered by the fiscal expansion.

     Tax reductions and increases in government spending are announced on the same month in nine episodes
out of the 43 in our data set.



                                                                  26
1998.26 The first column of Table 5 presents the results of the regression analysis, in which gt is

added to the specification [2] of Table 3. Contrary to the implications of the hypothesis of non-

Keynesian effects, the coefficient on gt, κ, was positive (p-value=0.076), which means that

announcements about additional government spending have a positive impact on the private

consumption, rather than a negative one. In this sense, we fail to find evidence in Japanese data for

the non-Keynesian effects of fiscal expansion.27 Reflecting the positive estimate of κ, the estimate

of φ1 is much smaller than before, which is also contrary to our ex-ante expectation. The second

column of Table 5, which adds gt into the specification [3] of Table 3, reports similar results.

            Finally, we address the possibility that the effect of a tax reduction and that of a tax increase

might be asymmetric. To do so, we disaggregate each of vIP, vIT, v AP, and vAT into two variables.

For example, we define new variables, vIP+ and v IP-, by

v tIP + =    ∑x       i     and v tIP − =    ∑x       i     where IPt ≡ { j ∈ [1, m] t j = t } .
            i ∈IPt xi > 0                   i ∈IPt xi < 0



            The variable vIP+ represents when and how much permanent increases in taxes and social

security contributions are implemented. Likewise, the variable v IP- represents permanent reductions

     The Japanese government announced policy packages, which included additional government spending,
on the following dates: 09/17/75, 09/03/77, 09/02/78, 10/08/82, 10/21/83, 10/15/85, 09/19/86, 07/24/87,
08/28/92, 04/13/93, 09/16/93, 02/08/94, 04/14/95, 09/20/95, 04/24/98.
27
     Note that the government spending shock that we pick up here is a temporary one. That is, when the
Japanese government increases spending as a part of stimulus package, it tends to increase spending for
short-life projects (typically, less than one year) to make undesirable impacts on public debt as small as
possible. This is in sharp contrast with Giavazzi and Pagano (1990, 1995) where the argument was focused
on changes in consumers’ expectations in response to permanent changes in government expenditures. In




                                                                            27
in taxes and social security contributions. The variables vIT+, vIT-, vAP+, v AP-, vAT+, and vAT- are

defined in the same way.28 Using these disaggregated tax variables, equation (5) can be expressed

as:

∆c t = λ∆d t + (1 − λ)θu$t

             −2 (1 − λ)φ 1 {[(1 − µ1 ) vtAP + + µ1 vtAP − ] + (1 − β1 )[(1 − µ1 ) vtAT + + µ1 vtAT − ]}

             −2 (1 − λ)φ 2 {[(1 − µ 2 ) vtIP+ + µ 2 v tIP − ] + (1 − β 2 )[(1 − µ 2 ) vtIT + + µ 2 vtIT − ]} + ε t   (7)

where µ1 and µ2 are parameters measuring the degree of asymmetry concerning the impacts of tax

changes. Note that, if µ1=µ2=1/2, the effects of tax changes are symmetric and equation (7) reduces

to equation (5).

          We estimate equation (7) under two different parameter restrictions. The first column of

Table 6 uses the same specification as the second column of Table 3, except that asymmetric

effects of tax changes are allowed. The coefficients of interest, µ1 and µ2 , are both positive and less

than one. However, the estimate of µ1 was 0.0105, which is close to zero, while that of µ2 was

0.3376, which is fairly close to 1/2. Using the Wald test, the null hypothesis that µ1 equals 1/2 is

rejected at the one per cent significance level, but the hypothesis that µ2 equals to 1/2 is not

rejected. Thus, the announcement effects of tax changes on consumer spending are asymmetric:

the impact of tax increases on consumer spending is significantly larger than that of tax

reductions.29 On the other hand, the impact of tax changes at the timing of implementation, i.e., the


this sense, it might not be appropriate to interpret our results as evidence against the argument of Giavazzi
and Pagano.
28
     During the sample period, temporary tax increases never occurred, so that the variables vIT+ and vAT+ are
empty.
29
     An interpretation of this result is that tax cut promises are less credible than tax increase promises.



                                                                  28
impact of tax changes through the spending behaviour of near-rational consumers, is symmetric.

These findings are consistent with those obtained through the preliminary analysis in Section 3.1.

The second column of Table 6, which is an asymmetric version of the specification [3] of Table 3,

reports a similar result.



3.4. Effects of the tax policy in 1993–98               Table 7 presents the effects of the tax policy in

1993–98, which are estimated using the regression results of the specification [3], in Table 3. The

figures of the table represent the contributions of changes in taxes to the annual growth rate of

consumption. For example, the first column of the table represents the contributions of permanent

income-tax reductions through the spending behaviour of current income consumers.

          From Table 7, it is evident that the contributions through the spending behaviour of near-

rational consumers are dominantly large. For example, the third column indicates that the

permanent tax reduction of 1995 contributes about 0.6 per cent to the growth rate of consumption

in 1995. Also, the sixth column indicates that the temporary tax reductions contribute between 0.3

and 0.8 per cent every year through the spending behaviour of those consumers.30


30
     Note that the estimated impacts of tax changes shown in Table 7 might contain nonnegligible errors,
which come from the errors of the estimated parameters. In particular, since the discount factor β is
imprecisely estimated, the impacts of temporary tax changes might be imprecise. The discount factor is
estimated to be 0.9053 with the standard error of 0.1059 in [3] of Table 3, which means that the per-month
discount rate is 9.47 per cent. This figure is, admittedly, too large. Although the main arguments of the
paper depends solely on the result that the estimated discount factor is significantly different from zero
(therefore, temporary tax changes have weaker effects relative to permanent changes) and not on how close
it is to the unity, it is true that the estimated discount factor that is far from the unity makes the impacts of
temporary tax changes extremely large. For example, if we change the value of β from 0.9053 to 0.9900,




                                                        29
       The consumption-tax increase of 1997 had a large negative impact on the growth rate of

consumption in 1997, through the weakening of the spending behaviour of near-rational consumers,

as well as current income consumers, as shown on the seventh and ninth columns of Table 7. The

contribution through near-rational consumers is -0.8 per cent, which is more than twice as large as

that through current income consumers. A larger contribution through near-rational consumers

implies that a temporary tax reduction will not be effective enough to compensate deterioration in

consumer spending due to the permanent increase in the consumption tax rate.

       The announcement effects of tax policy were quite limited, as indicated by the near-zero

estimates of φ1 in Table 7. For example, the announcement effect of the permanent tax-reduction

of 1995 was less than 0.2 per cent and that of the consumption-tax increase was about -0.2 per cent.



4. Near-rationality of the Japanese consumers?                The regression analyses in the previous

section indicate that a fairly large fraction of forward-looking consumers, who distinguish between

temporary and permanent tax changes, respond to tax changes, not at the time of the policy

announcement but at the time of implementation. They deviate from the optimal path of

consumption in the sense that they ignore policy announcements, and thus are labelled near-rational

consumers in Section 2. To reinforce this interpretation, we calculate in this section how much

utility these near-rational consumers lose by deviating from the optimal path of consumption,

following the methodology of Cochrane (1989).

       Consider the optimization problem:


which is within one standard error of the estimate, the estimated impact of temporary tax reduction in 1995
through the behaviour of near-rational consumers decreases from +0.79 to +0.08.

the actual path by Ct. The utility gained from the optimal path is U*, and that gained from the

Note that the first sum of the right-hand side of equation (9) is zero for any feasible deviation from

the optimal path of consumption. The utility costs can be approximated by the second sum of the

right-hand side of equation (9). We divide the second sum by the corresponding marginal utility,

evaluated at the optimal consumption level. This transforms the utility value expression into a yen-

equivalent expression. Dividing the second sum by the optimal consumption level, we express the

loss in terms of a percentage of the optimal consumption level. That is,

where the second equality follows from equations (2.1) and (2.2).

          Table 8 reports the utility losses corresponding to the estimates obtained in the specification

[3] of Table 3. The table expresses utility losses in percentage points, relative to the optimal

consumption. The second column of the table shows L3 for various values of the coefficient of

relative risk aversion. The utility losses are 0.003 per cent for γ=1, and 0.033 per cent for γ=10.

Even when γ is as high as 30, the loss is 0.098 per cent. We conclude from these figures that the

welfare losses, which the forward-looking consumers who ignore policy announcements have to

pay, are quite small. In this sense, they are qualified to be called near-rational consumers. On the

other hand, the utility losses of current income consumers, which are shown on the first column of

the table, range from 0.009 per cent to 0.282 per cent for γ between 1 and 30.31 The figures are

third column of the table presents the average utility losses across different types of consumer,

which range from 0.004 per cent to 0.130 per cent for γ between 1 and 30.32



5. Conclusion          Do the impacts of tax reductions on consumer spending depend on whether they

are permanent or temporary? If so, what would be the difference? Do the announcements of tax

reductions affect consumer spending? To prepare an empirical answer to these questions, we

would need a data set that distinguishes between temporary and permanent reductions in spending,

as well as anticipated and unanticipated changes in taxes. One method that provides these

distinctions is the use of institutional information, such as the legal distinction between temporary

and permanent changes, as well as the timing of policy announcements and their implementations.

          Using a data set including this institutional information for 43 episodes of changes in taxes

and social security contributions in Japan during the period of 1975–98, we found that more than

three-quarters of Japanese consumers are forward-looking consumers who distinguish between

temporary and permanent tax changes. The fraction of rule-of-thumb consumers, or Keynesian-

type consumers, whose spending depends on current income rather than permanent income, is less

than a quarter. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that the fraction of Ricardian consumers is

zero.


addition, Caballero (1995) calculates the welfare losses of those who are characterized by infrequent actions
to shocks. The estimate is about one per cent for the case of γ=30.
32
     These calculations assume that (1) consumers face no idiosyncratic risk with respect to disposable income;
and (2) consumers respond optimally to shocks other than tax changes. The welfare losses could be much
larger if these assumptions are not satisfied.



                                                       33
       The response of forward-looking consumers to temporary changes in taxes is significantly

smaller than that for permanent tax changes. The regression results, reported in this paper, show

that a permanent tax reduction of 10,000 yen per month would increase the monthly spending of a

forward-looking consumer by about 10,000 yen. However, a one-time tax reduction of the same

size would increase the spending of the forward-looking consumer by less than 1000 yen.

       We have also found that more than 80 per cent of Japanese consumers respond to changes in

taxes not at the timing of policy announcements but at the timing of their implementations. This is

consistent with two regularities repeatedly observed in the empirical studies on consumer

behaviour: excess smoothness and excess sensitivity of consumption. However, our findings are

new in that, not only rule-of-thumb consumers, but also a part of forward-looking consumers, who

distinguish between temporary and permanent tax changes, ignore policy announcements. We

suggest an explanation that forward-looking consumers who ignore policy announcements follow a

near-rational decision rule. For those consumers, the utility gained by using policy announcements

to better adjust consumption, does not outweigh the costs of obtaining and processing the

information, while that gained by distinguishing between temporary and permanent tax changes is

large relative to the costs. The estimated utility cost of ignoring policy announcements is less than

0.1 per cent of the PIH consumption.

Appendix A: Major tax reforms in Japan

This appendix gives a brief description of the major tax reforms in Japan during the post-war

period: The Nakasone Tax Reform in 1987, the Takeshita Tax Reform in 1988, and the 1994 Tax

Reform.



The Nakasone Tax Reform The Nakasone Tax Reform in 1987 aimed at achieving equality,

fairness and simplicity of taxation by changing the basic structure of the existing tax system that

had been untouched since the tax reform in 1949, based on the recommendation by the Shoup

mission. The existing tax system was considered unequal not only vertically but also

horizontally.33 It was also criticized for unfair treatment of investment income: interest was exempt

from income taxation up to a certain level, and capital gains from selling stocks were not taxed in

principle.34 In September 1987, the Nakasone administration solved these problems, at least

partially, by: (1) reducing the income tax burden, especially for the middle-income salaried

workers, by two trillion yen; (2) simplifying the rate structure for income tax from 15 brackets with

the top marginal rate of 70 per cent to 12 brackets with the top marginal rate of 60 per cent; and (3)

taxing interest by a withholding tax at the rate of 20 per cent.




33
     It was considered horizontally unequal because of the “10:5:3:1 problem”: labour income of salaried
workers is reported in full to the tax authority, while the self-employed can declare only 50 per cent of what
they earn, farmers 30 per cent, and politicians a mere 10 per cent.
34
     Another complaint about the existing tax system was the excessively high corporate income tax burden.
The effective corporate income tax rate was 53 per cent in 1984, significantly higher than those in the major
industrial countries.



                                                      35
The Takeshita Tax Reform            Inheriting the key concepts of the Nakasone Tax Reform, the

Takeshita administration emphasized the importance of introducing VAT as an alternative revenue

source in reducing the income-tax burden substantially.35 In July 1988, the Takeshita

administration succeeded in introducing the so-called consumption tax, a Japanese version of VAT,

with the tax rate of three per cent, as well as flattening the schedule of the income tax rate by

reducing the number of brackets to five, with the top marginal rate of 50 per cent. The income tax

reduction amounted to three trillion yen, while additional revenue from the introduction of the

consumption tax was 3.3 trillion yen in FY1989, 5.7 per cent of the national tax revenue.



The 1994 Tax Reform On January 1, 1994, Prime Minister Hosokawa proposed to abandon the

consumption tax and introduce a new tax, named “welfare tax,” a kind of VAT, the revenue of

which would be used specifically for government expenditure necessary to make the transition to

the ageing society easier. Although the ruling parties rejected the Prime Minister’s initial idea,

discussion lead to a consensus that the consumption tax rate should be increased in anticipation of

the expected social security outlays in the 21st century, and that income tax rates should be

decreased to give incentives to middle-income workers. In September 1994, the Diet passed the

tax-reform bills, in which the consumption tax rate was raised from three to five per cent, and the

progressiveness of the income tax was relaxed, especially for the range of seven to 15 million yen

annual income. The tax mix of consumption-tax increase and income tax reduction was designed



35
     The Nakasone administration tried to introduce VAT, but failed because of opposition from small- and
medium-sized businesses in the wholesale and retail trades, as well as taxpayers who showed a strong
resentment against the regressive structure of the VAT.

to be revenue neutral: the consumption tax increase to create additional revenue of four trillion yen,

while the income-tax cut to reduce revenue by 3.7 trillion yen.36



Appendix B: An outline of the Japanese social insurance system

The social insurance programme in Japan consists of three major components: public pensions,

medical care insurance, and labour insurance. This appendix gives a brief summary of each

insurance system, with a special focus on contributions/premiums the insured persons need to pay.



Public pensions       The public pension system in Japan is a two-tier system: the flat-rate basic

benefit and the earnings-related benefits. The first tier, the Basic Benefits (Kiso-Nenkin), covers all

residents, irrespective of whether they are employed or not. The second tier consists of two types

of funds: the Employees’ Pension Fund ( Kosei-Nenkin) for private-sector employees; and the

Cooperative Pension Funds ( Kyosai-Nenkin) for government employees, private school teachers,

etc. Independent workers, the self-employed and jobless persons are covered only by the Basic

Benefits, but employees are also covered by the Employees’ Pension Fund or the Cooperative

Pension Funds.

     At the beginning of 1994, it was a political consensus that the government should stimulate the economy
by income tax reductions as soon as possible. However, the income tax reduction, in the bills passed in
September 1994, was scheduled to start in January 1995. To fill the gap, the government implemented a
temporary tax reduction of 5.5 trillion yen in 1994. In 1995, the income tax reductions, in the 1994 tax
reform package, were 3.7 trillion yen, plus a temporary tax reduction of 2.0 trillion yen, to keep the total
amount of tax reductions as large as that implemented in 1994.

          The major programme in the Basic Benefits is the old-age pensions.37 The full old age

pension, 65,000 yen per month, is payable from age 65, provided that 40 years of contributions

were made. The monthly contribution, which is independent of the income of the insured, is

currently 13,000 yen. Those who are covered only by the Basic Benefits are required to pay this

amount individually to social security offices, while those who are covered by the Employees’

Pension Fund or the Cooperative Pension Fund are not required to do so because they pay

contributions indirectly through those funds.

          The full old age pension of the Employees’ Pension Fund is 30 per cent of his/her career

average monthly real earnings, and payable from age 60, provided that 40 years of contributions

were made. The average benefit for those who started to receive benefits in April 1997 is about

202,000 yen per month. Under the Employees’ Pension Fund, equal percentage contributions are

required of employees and their employers. The monthly contributions are calculated by

multiplying the “monthly standard remuneration” by the contribution rate. The “monthly standard

remuneration”, which consists of wages, salaries, allowances, and all other cash income paid to an

employee for services rendered, is revised once a year, in August, based on the average income of

the insured in May through June of the year. The contribution rate, currently 17.35 per cent, is

revised every four or five years38 based on the government’s reassessment of the future path of

benefits and contributions. The employers are obliged to pay the total contributions (both from



37
     The Basic Benefits include not only old-age pensions, but also disability and survivors’ pensions, etc.
38
     During our sample period, changes in the contribution rate based on the reassessments were implemented
in 1976, 1980, 1985, 1989, 1990, and 1994. See Table A1 for the exact dates of implementation as well as
announcement.

employers and employees) for a given month to the social insurance office by the end of the next

month, and, to do so, they collect contributions from the employees in the next month.



Medical care insurance Medical care insurance consists of Health Insurance for employees and

National Health Insurance for the self-employed. Both are systems of paying medical care benefits

and allowances to the employees of business firms and their families when they are taken ill or

injured. Premiums of the Health Insurance are determined by multiplying the monthly standard

remuneration of the insured person by the prescribed premium rate. The premium rate for Health

Insurance, which is now 8.5 per cent of the monthly standard remuneration, is revised every five

years.



Labour insurance Labour insurance consists of two kinds of insurance: Workers’ Accident

Compensation Insurance, a protection against injury, disease, disability or death resulting from an

employment, and Employment Insurance, or unemployment compensation. Premiums for the two

insurances are calculated by multiplying the total amount of wages paid to workers by the

corresponding premium rates. Premiums for the Workers’ Accident Compensation Insurance are

paid by the employers. Premiums for the Employment Insurance are paid by both the employers

and the employees. At present, the premium rate is 1.45 per cent, of which 0.9 per cent is borne by

the employers and 0.55 per cent by the employees.

Notes :
1) Standard errors are in parentheses. Intercept and the coefficients on the two dummy variables associated with changes
   in consumption tax rate are not reported. β0 = 0.99 .
2) The first column reestimates the specification [2] of table 3, instrumenting for the change in tax and social security
   contribution with the four dummy variables corresponding to vAP , vAT, vIP and vIT. The dummy variable corresponding
   to vAP takes the value of +1 in months when vAP >0, -1 when vAP <0 and zero otherwise. The other three dummy
   variables are defined in the same way.
3) The second column reestimates the specification [2] of table 3, deleting the observations related with changes in
   consumption tax rate: 1989:03, 1989:04, 1997:03, and 1997:04.
4) The third column reestimates the specification [2] of table 3, deleting the observation of December 1997.
5) The fourth column reestimates the specification [2] of table 3, using expenditures on nondurables and services as
   dependent variable.
6) The fifth column estimates equation (6) in text. Standard errors shown on the fifth column are Newey-West estimator.

Notes :

1) Contributions of the tax reduction/increase are calculated using the estimated result shown in [3] of table 3.
2) The growth rate of consumption in a year is defined as the annual average of the consumption divided by the level of consumption in December of the previous year. The percentage
   contribution of changes in taxes is defined in the same way.

Notes :
1) For changes in income tax and consumption tax, the announcement date is defined as the date
   on which the LDP tax committee submits “Outline of tax reform,” a proposal describing the
   details of the tax reform, to the government. For changes in social security contribution, the
   announcement date is defined as the date on which the advisory committee for social security
   system submits a report to the minister of health and welfare.
2) Percent. For permanent changes, figures indicate a per-month change divided by the
   monthly income. For temporary changes, figures indicate the amount of change multiplied
   by the discount rate, 0.01 per-month, and divided by the monthly income.
3) N, L, C and S represent, respectively, national income tax, local income tax, consumption
   tax, and social security contribution.
4) T and P represent, respectively, temporary and permanent changes in taxes and social
   security contributions.
