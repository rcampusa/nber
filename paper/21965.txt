Wage Inequality and Cognitive Skills: Re-Opening the Debate

                                            ABSTRACT

Inequality in the United States is high by international standards, and keeps rising. This is likely to
bring significant social as well as economic costs, including lower growth. In this paper, we use the
Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) to revisit the debate on the relative importance of skills in explaining
international differences in wage inequality. While simple decomposition exercises suggest that skills
only play a very minor role, demand and supply analysis indicates that the relative net supply of skills
could explain 29% of the higher top-end wage inequality in the United States. Our analysis also suggests
that skills could explain a substantial portion of the racial wage gap, as well as between individuals
from different socio-economic backgrounds. Finally, we find little support for the argument that higher
wage inequality in the United States may be compensated for by better relative employment outcomes
of the low-skilled.

Wage inequality and cognitive skills: Re-opening the debate
Stijn Broecke (OECD), Glenda Quintini (OECD) and Marieke Vandeweyer (KU Leuven) 1

1. Background and objectives

In the late 1990s / early 2000s, a brief debate raged on the importance of cognitive skills in explaining
international differences in wage inequality – a debate which was never really settled. On the one hand,
Blau and Kahn (1996), Devroye and Freeman (2001) and Blau and Kahn (2005) argued that differences in
cognitive skills played a relatively minor role in explaining differences in wage inequality between the
United States and other advanced economies while, on the other hand, Leuven, Oosterbeek and van
Ophem (2004) (LOV, 2004 henceforth) claimed that around one third of the variation in relative wages
between skill groups across countries could be explained by differences in the net supply of skills.

While these papers used different methodologies and, in fact, addressed slightly different issues (wage
inequality versus skills wage premia), what was really at stake was the role of the market (demand and
supply) as an explanation for differences in the returns to skill versus a more institutional explanation that
attributes skill prices to differences in institutional set-ups, like the minimum wage and unionization. This
mirrors a wider debate in the economic literature that has pitched the market (including the role of
technological change and international trade) against institutions in explaining wage dispersion. As argued
by Salverda and Checchi (2014), this literature really consists of two separate strands that, despite not
being mutually exclusive, have developed in parallel with very little interaction between the two.

Since the publication of these papers, the debate on the importance of cognitive skills in explaining
international differences in wage inequality had been left untouched. During this period, however,
inequality continued to rise. In the United States, the P90/P10 earnings ratio rose from 3.75 in 1975 to
4.59 in 1995 and to 5.22 in 2012.2 At the same time, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that
inequality has high social costs (Krueger, 2012; Pickett and Wilkinson, 2011; Stiglitz, 2012), and there also
appears to be a growing consensus that inequality may be bad for economic growth (Ostry, Berg and
Tsangarides, 2014; Cingano, 2014).

Recently, with the availability of new data (the Survey of Adult Skills – PIAAC 3), researchers have started
looking again at the relationship between cognitive skills and wage inequality. Using decomposition
methods identical or similar to Blau and Kahn (2005), Paccagnella (2015) and Pena (2015) also conclude
that skills contribute very little to international differences in wage inequality and, therefore, that
institutions are likely to play a far more important role – a view echoed by another recent paper (Jovicic,
2015). However, neither of these studies considers the early criticisms made by LOV (2004) of the Blau
and Kahn (2005) work. In particular, LOV (2004) argued that the decomposition approach taken by Blau
and Kahn (2005) ignores important dynamic aspects of the relationship between skills supply and
demand, on the one hand, and the returns to skill and inequality, on the other.

In this paper, we re-consider both sides of the argument, and conclude that the new wave of studies
based on the PIAAC data (Jovecic, 2015; Paccagnella, 2015; Pena, 2015) may have been too quick in
dismissing the importance of cognitive skills in explaining international differences in wage inequality.

First, we simulate alternative wage distributions for the United States using the methods proposed by
DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996) and Lemieux (2002, 2010) to see what would happen to wage
inequality in the United States if it had: (i) the skills endowments; and (ii) the skills prices of other PIAAC
countries. Consistent with the aforementioned studies, this exercise leads us to conclude that differences
in skills endowments cannot explain much of the higher wage inequality observed in the United States. In
fact, the contribution of skills endowments is negative, meaning that wage inequality in the United States
would be 10% higher if it had the skills distribution of the other PIAAC countries. By contrast, higher
skills prices in the United States account for nearly one third on average of the higher wage inequality
observed in the United States.

As argued by LOV (2004), however, this price effect will not just reflect differences in institutions.
Indeed, the higher price of skill in the United States will reflect at least two factors: (i) differences in
institutions; but also (ii) differences in the relative supply of, and demand for, skills. To evaluate the
importance of the latter, we follow LOV (2004) and use Katz and Murphy’s (1992) demand and supply
model to study the relationship between the net supply of skills, on the one hand, and wage inequality, on
the other. While tentative, this analysis shows that differences in the relative net supply of high- versus
medium-skilled workers can account for 29% of the higher P90/P50 wage ratio in the United States
(although the net supply of skills explains little of the higher wage inequality at the bottom of the wage
distribution). We show that these findings are robust to the inclusion of labor market institutions in the
set of control variables of the regression.

Having shown that skills appear to matter at the country-level, we also provide evidence that skills can
explain a substantial portion of the wage gaps between certain socio-demographic groups. In the United
States, for example, 38% of the gender wage gap can be explained by skills, compared to 79% of the wage
gap between individuals with high and low parental education, and 56% of the racial wage gap (white
versus black and Hispanic).

Finally, we explore the extent to which higher wage inequality in the United States might be compensated
for by relatively higher employment rates among the low-skilled. Contrary to this “wage compression”
hypothesis, and consistent with findings from Freeman and Schettkat (2001) and Jovicic (2015), we find
that the employment (unemployment) rates of the low-skilled are not much higher (lower) in the United
States relative to those of the high-skilled than they are in other countries. We also find that the ratio
between the average skills levels of the employed and the unemployed is quite high in the United States
which, once again, is inconsistent with the idea that higher wage inequality is the price paid for better
employment outcomes for the low-skilled.

The next section of this paper briefly describes the PIAAC data we use in our analysis, and provides a
descriptive overview of wage inequality, skills endowments and prices in the 22 OECD countries included
in our sample. Section 3 introduces the method we employ for analyzing international differences in wage
inequality and presents the results obtained. Section 4 covers the demand and supply analysis and Section
5 tests the robustness of these findings to the inclusion of labor market institutions. Section 6 analyzes
the contribution of skills to wage gaps between socio-demographic groups, while Section 7 explores the
wage compression hypothesis. Finally, Section 8 concludes and offers some pointers for future research.

2. Data

The data collected by the OECD’s 2012 Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) offers an unparalleled
opportunity to investigate the relationship between cognitive skills and wage inequality. The survey
directly assessed the proficiency of around 166 000 adults (aged 16-65) from 24 countries 4 in literacy,
numeracy 5 and problem solving in technology-rich environments. In addition, the survey collected
information on individuals’ skills use in the workplace, as well as on their labor market status, wages,
education, experience, and a range of demographic characteristics. The achieved samples range from
around 4 500 in Sweden to nearly 27 300 in Canada. In this paper, the focus is on the 22 OECD
countries in the sample (i.e. excluding the Russian Federation and Cyprus).

A significant strength of the present paper is its ability to draw on detailed (and continuous) wage data for
the 22 OECD countries/regions that are covered by PIAAC. In contrast, LOV (2004) could use only 15
(out of 20) countries that participated in IALS, because wage information was only available in quintiles
for the other 5 countries. Similarly, Blau and Kahn (2005) cite wage data restrictions as a primary reason
for focusing on just 9 of the advanced countries included in IALS, while Devroye and Freeman (2001)
use 11. Even among the 15 countries covered by LOV (2004), wage data were only available in 20
intervals for 3 of them (Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland), while it was impossible to calculate
hourly wages in the case of Sweden. Finally, in the case of the more recent research using PIAAC data,
the public use files generally available to researchers contain important restrictions on the wage variables.
In the data used by Pena (2015), for example, continuous wage data is missing for five of the countries
(including the United States), while Jovecic (2015) does not have access to continuous wage data for
Austria, Canada and Sweden.

Table 1 offers some basic descriptive statistics on the number of observations in PIAAC with valid wage
observations, as well as on the level and dispersion of both skills and wages. The table shows that the
United States combines one of the lowest levels of skill (only Spain and Italy do worse) with the highest
skill dispersion (both at the top and at the bottom of the distribution). Hourly wages (which are expressed
in PPP corrected USD) are among the highest in the United States (although they are higher still in
Ireland, Flanders, Denmark and Norway). Wage inequality in the United States (as measured by the
P90/P10 wage ratio) is second only to Korea, and is particularly high at the top of the distribution. In
contrast, Canada, Estonia, Korea and Germany all have P50/P10 wage ratios higher than that observed in
the United States. Figure 1 shows the full skill and wage distributions of the United States in comparison
to the PIAAC average. The shapes and positions of these curves confirm the higher skills and wage
inequality in the United States, as well as the lower average skill level of the employed population.

To conclude this section, Figure 2 shows the results of a simple Mincer-type regression of log wages on
skills, experience and experience squared, and confirms that the higher return to skill in the United States
might be one of the key reasons why wage inequality is so much higher. Indeed, among the 22 countries
shown in Figure 2, the United States is the country with the highest return to skill (more than twice as
high as in Sweden and Denmark). As will be argued throughout this paper, this higher return to skill in
the United States will reflect a combination of differences in: (i) the demand for and supply of skill; and
(ii) labor market institutions, policies and practices.


4 22 OECD countries/regions: Australia, Austria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Flanders
(Belgium), France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, the Slovak Republic,
Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom (England and Northern Ireland), and the United States; one
region; as well as two non-OECD countries: Cyprus and the Russian Federation.
5 This paper will use numeracy as the measure of skill. Because of the close correlation between the three cognitive

skills, this makes no substantial difference to the overall conclusions reached in this paper.

3. The importance of skills: Evidence from wage simulations

In this section, we estimate the extent to which higher wage inequality in the United States is associated
with differences in: (i) skills endowments; and (ii) skills prices. Our method differs from those used in the
previous research on wage inequality and cognitive skills, and brings a number of improvements. Both
Devroye and Freeman (2001) and Jovecic (2015) use a simple variance decomposition method, which
cannot account for the full distributional aspects of both wages and skills. Blau and Kahn (2005) and
Pena (2015) use the Juhn, Murphy and Pierce (1993) decomposition – but this method has become the
subject of a number of criticisms over time (Yun, 2009; Suen, 1997; Fortin, Lemieux and Firpo, 2010).6
Finally, Paccagnella (2015) resorts to unconditional quantile regressions (Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux,
2009), but his application of the method only allows an analysis of the effect of overall, average skill levels
(and not the entire skills distribution) on wage inequality. Instead, we draw on DiNardo, Fortin and
Lemieux (1996) and Lemieux (2002, 2010) and simulate counterfactual wage distributions using
reweighting techniques. As will be shown below, an important attraction of this method lies in its
simplicity and the visual inspection of alternative wage distributions that it permits. We begin by
explaining our methodology in some more detail, and then present the results we obtain.




6 One of the main criticisms of the Juhn, Murphy and Pierce decomposition concerns the “residual imputation”
step. In this step, the residuals of the base country are replaced with the similarly ranked residuals of the comparator
country. However, a key assumption behind this approach is that these residuals (from a regression of wages on
skills) are independent of skills, which is clearly unrealistic. For further detail, see Fortin, Lemieux and Firpo (2010).

                                                                5
Simulating counterfactual wage distributions

To estimate the contributions of skills prices and skills endowments to higher wage inequality in the
United States, we will estimate two sets of alternative wage distributions. In the first, we impose the skills
distributions of the other PIAAC countries onto the United States (holding skills prices constant). In the
second, we impose the skills prices of the other PIAAC countries onto the United States (holding skills
endowments constant).

The effect of skill endowments

To see what would happen to wage inequality in the United States if it had the same skills distribution as
the other PIAAC countries, we reweight the United States data to make the skills profile of its workforce
resemble that of the comparator country. We then estimate the difference this makes to wage inequality.
Intuitively, if the comparator country has more skilled workers, then the reweighting method will give
more weight to skilled workers in the United States, while reducing the weight given to less-skilled ones.
Because the other characteristics of the individuals are left unchanged (including their wages), this results
in an alternative wage distribution. This alternative wage distribution can then be used to calculate
standard measures of wage inequality that can be compared to those estimated on the original wage
distribution. The difference between the two measures of wage inequality can be attributed to the
difference in skills endowments.

More formally, assume one is interested in seeing what would happen to the wage distribution of the
United States (US) if it had the same skills distribution as country x. Then, taking an individual i in the
United States, the original sample weights ωi,US for that individual are replaced by a counterfactual weight
ω’i,US = ωi,USΨi where Ψi represents the reweighting factor. While DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996)
suggest regression methods to compute the reweighting factor Ψi, the latter may be obtained more simply
and non-parametrically if the data can be divided up in a finite number of cells (Lemieux, 2002). In the
case of skills, this is indeed possible.

In practice, the procedure is implemented as follows. The data for the United States and the comparator
country are divided into skill cells/intervals s of 5 points each, 7 and the shares of the total workforce
employed in each cell, θs,US and θs,x, are calculated. One can then reweight the United States data to
approximate the skills distribution of the comparator country by simply using the following reweighting
factor:
                                                           𝜃𝑠,𝑥
                                                    Ψ𝑖 =
                                                           𝜃𝑠,𝑈𝑆

The effect of skill prices

The price effect simulations are inspired by a method proposed by Lemieux (2002). Intuitively, we give
individuals with a certain skill level in the United States the same return to skill as individuals with that
skill level would obtain in country x. More formally: assuming that the data can be divided up in a finite
number of cells (e.g. intervals s of 5 numeracy points each), then changes in skill prices can be simulated
by comparing the conditional mean of (log) wages of skill group s in the United States, ys,US, with the
conditional mean of (log) wages in skill group s in country x, ys,x. The new (log) wage for each individual i

These are put into two separate groups.

                                                         6
in the United States, y’i,US, can then be calculated by adding the difference between country x’s average
(log) wage for skill group s and the average (log) wage for skill group s in the United States:
                                             ′
                                            𝑦𝑖,𝑈𝑆 = 𝑦𝑖,𝑈𝑆 + �𝑦𝑠,𝑥 − 𝑦𝑠,𝑈𝑆 �

Price and quantity effects may of course be applied simultaneously to obtain a joint effect on the wage
distribution. The order in which these effects are calculated does not affect the outcome, since both are
calculated within the same skill cell.

Figure 3 below illustrates the effect on the United States wage distribution of: (i) adopting the skills
distribution of the average PIAAC country; 8 (ii) adopting the skills prices of the average PIAAC country;
and (iii) adopting both the skills distribution and prices of the average PIAAC country simultaneously. As
the figure shows, imposing the skills distribution of the average PIAAC country onto the United States
would change the wage distribution somewhat, but would have relatively little effect on wage inequality
(as indicated by the height of the distribution). Imposing skills prices of the average PIAAC country
would, however, have a more important compressing effect on the wage distribution. Similarly, imposing
both the skills distribution and prices of the average PIAAC country onto the United States would lead to
a fall in wage inequality.

endowments and prices




Table 2 contains the full set of results from our analysis.9 The first set of columns shows the impact on
wage inequality in the United States if it adopted the skills distribution of the comparator country. While
earlier papers (e.g. Blau and Kahn, 2005) had found that the contribution of cognitive skills to explaining
higher wage inequality in the United States was small (ranging from 3% to 13% on average), Table 2
shows that, in most cases, the contribution is actually negative – i.e. the P90/P10 wage ratio in the United
States would be even greater if it had the skills distribution of the comparator country (ranging from a

8 The average PIAAC country is constructed on the basis of all PIAAC observations. However, because countries
with larger populations would have a greater weight and, therefore, a disproportionate influence on the distribution,
the survey weights are rescaled so that the sum of each country’s weights is equal to one. In essence, this is
equivalent to taking an unweighted average across countries. In addition, because wage levels differ significantly
across countries, they need to be adjusted before being combined into a single PIAAC distribution (which would
otherwise be too wide). Wages are therefore demeaned by country, and all the analysis is carried out on these
country-specific deviations from the mean.
9 The full set of figures associated with these simulations can be found in Annex A.

1.5% increase in the case of the Czech Republic to a 50% rise in the case of Japan). Only if the United
States had the skills distribution of France, Poland, Ireland, Italy and Spain would wage inequality fall. On
average, wage inequality in the United States would be 10% higher if it had the skills distribution of the
other PIAAC countries. While surprising, this result is consistent with the recent findings of Paccagnella
(2015), for example, who finds that average skills levels in the United States can account for -4%, on
average, of the higher P90/P10 wage ratio in the United States (although the author controls for
educational attainment in addition to skills, which will is likely to explain the lower estimate). Again,
similar to Paccagnella (2015), Table 2 suggests that these negative effects are driven primarily by the
P50/P10 wage ratio (i.e. the bottom of the wage distribution). 10 These counterintuitive results can be
explained by the skills profile of wages in the United States, which is significantly steeper in the top half
of the skills distribution. Because skills prices are held constant in the analysis, increasing the number of
skilled workers in the United States mechanically results in higher wage inequality as the wages of those at
the P50 of the wage distribution would increase faster than the wages of those at the P10.

Notes: The table shows the proportion of higher wage inequality in the United States that can be attributed to differences in: (i)
the skills distribution; (ii) skills prices; and (iii) the skills distribution and skills prices together. For example, 4.9% of the
difference in the P90/P50 ratio between the United States and Australia can be explained by differences in the skills distribution
between the two countries. Negative values indicate that the difference in wage inequality between the United States and the
comparator country would increase if the United States had the characteristics of the comparator country.

Again consistent with both Blau and Kahn (2005) and Paccagnella (2015), Table 2 shows that skills prices
can account for a significantly larger share of higher wage inequality in the United States than can skills
endowments. The contribution of skills prices ranges from 18% in the Czech Republic to nearly 64% in
Germany, and can explain nearly one third on average of the higher wage inequality in the United States
(excluding both Estonia and Korea, two clear outliers). Skills prices also tend to play a slightly more
important role in explaining wage inequality at the top than at the bottom of the wage distribution: this is
the case in 18 of the 21 country comparisons shows in Table 2.


10Blau and Kahn (2005) also find some negative effects, but these are at the top of the wage distribution (p90/P50),
and for males.

                                                                     8
While Blau and Kahn (2005) at least acknowledged the possibility that higher skills prices could reflect
market forces as well as differences in institutions, the more recent research using PIAAC simply ignores
this argument. Paccagnella (2015) concludes that the greater contribution of skills prices to wage
inequality “suggests that economic institutions […] are the main determinants of wage inequality”, but
without actually proving this point. Similarly, Pena (2015) somewhat hastily concludes that institutional
factors are more important than market forces, but she only “controls” for the latter by including
additional demographic factors in her model. Finally, Jovecic (2015) presents a few simple correlations
between labour market institutions and measures of wage inequality (all of which are significant and have
the right sign), and concludes from this that “institutions have more power” in explaining international
differences in wage inequality than skills do.

We will return to the importance of market forces in explaining higher inequality in the next section of
this paper. Before we do so, the final three columns in Table 2 show the combined effect of skills and
skills prices in explaining higher wage inequality in the United States. Only in the cases of Korea and
Japan do these explain a negative part of the difference in wage inequality with the United States. In the
other countries, the joint contribution of skills and skills prices ranges from 11.4% in the case of
England/Northern Ireland to 49% in the case of Italy (excluding Estonia, which is a clear outlier). These
results are not surprising given that they combine the modest, negative effects of skills endowments with
the larger, positive effects of skills prices.

4. The importance of skills: Evidence from demand and supply analysis

One weakness of the wage simulation method used above (but which applies equally to the methods used
by Devroye and Freeman, 2001; Blau and Kahn, 2005; Jovecic, 2015; Paccagnella, 2015; and Pena, 2015)
is that it analyzes the role of skills from a static perspective. However, as pointed out by LOV (2004), this
is not realistic and the price of skill should be seen as reflecting at least in part the outcome of the
dynamic interaction between demand and supply: if the supply of skills increases relative to demand, then
one would expect both the price of skills and inequality to fall.

The idea that the returns to skill (and therefore inequality) depend on demand and supply factors was first
introduced by Tinbergen (1975), who famously described inequality as a “race between education and
technology”. Technological change was argued to be skills-biased – i.e. it increases the demand for more
skilled workers and therefore their wage premium in the labor market. To keep inequality in check, the
supply of skills needs to increase to meet that demand. It is now widely accepted that the increase in
inequality in the United States over the past few decades can be partly blamed on the fact that the supply
of educated workers has not kept pace with the rise in demand for them (Juhn, Murphy and Pierce, 1993;
Juhn, 1999; Goldin and Katz, 2008; Autor, 2014). While more recent theories of routine-biased
technological change have refined this argument somewhat, they still maintain a central role for skills in
explaining rising wage inequality in the United States (Autor, Levy, and Murnane, 2003; Autor, Katz, and
Kearney, 2006, 2008; Autor and Dorn, 2013; Autor, 2015).

The findings from the previous section, and the results obtained by Blau and Kahn (2005) and
Paccagnella (2015), among others, therefore appear at odds with the story that rising wage inequality in
the United States was to a large extent related to changes in the demand for, and the supply of, skills. One
possible explanation for this inconsistency is that the decomposition methods used in the literature fail to
account for the dynamic interaction between the demand and supply of skills. To gain a better
understanding of how the supply of skills interacts with the demand for skills and what effect this may
have on wage inequality (through its effect on the price of skills), this section applies a different
methodology developed by Katz and Murphy (1992) and used by a number of researchers since to


                                                     9
investigate the relationship between the net supply of cognitive skills and wage differentials between skill
groups (Blau and Kahn, 1996; LOV, 2004). The only difference is that, instead of looking at wage
differentials between skill groups, the analysis that follows focuses on standard, interdecile measures of
wage inequality.

To implement the Katz and Murphy (1992) methodology, we follow an approach similar to both Blau
and Kahn (1996) and LOV (2004). In a first step, the workforce of the average PIAAC country is divided
into three skills groups of equal size corresponding to the low-, medium- and high-skilled, respectively.
The thresholds defined by these groups (in numeracy points) are then applied to each of the 22 countries
included in the sample to classify workers as either low-, medium- or high-skilled. Because the
distribution of skills varies from country to country, applying these PIAAC average thresholds will result
in different-sized groups of low-, medium- and high-skilled workers in each one of these countries. For
example, Table 3 shows that in Japan, 47.4% of the working age population is high-skilled according to
this definition, but that in both Italy and Spain more than 50% is low-skilled.

The next step is to construct indices which measure how the demand and supply for each skill group in
the United States compare to those in the other PIAAC countries. More specifically, we build the supply
index Supplys,x so that it measures the relative supply of skills group s in the United States compared to
country x:
                                                              𝜀𝑠,𝑈𝑆
                                           𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑦𝑠,𝑥 = ln (         )
                                                               𝜀𝑠,𝑥

Where 𝜀𝑠,𝑥 and 𝜀𝑠,𝑈𝑆 are the shares of the labor force accounted for by skill group s in country x and the
United States, respectively (as reported in Table 3). We then build a demand index Demands,x which

                                                    10
measures the degree to which the occupation-industry structure 11 in the United States favors skill group s
in comparison to country x:
                                                               𝜃𝑠,𝑜,𝑥
                                    𝐷𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑠,𝑥 = ln (1 + �             (𝜃  − 𝜃𝑜,𝑥 ))
                                                                𝜀𝑠,𝑥 𝑜,𝑈𝑆
                                                           𝑜


Where 𝜃𝑠,𝑜,𝑥 is skill group s’s share of employment in occupation-industry cell o in country x; 𝜃𝑜,𝑥 and
𝜃𝑜,𝑈𝑆 are the total shares of employment in cell o in country x and the United States, respectively; and 𝜀𝑠,𝑥
is the share of skill group s in the total workforce of country x. Net supply is then calculated by
subtracting the demand index from the supply index:
                                              ���������𝑠,𝑥 = 𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑦𝑠.𝑥 − 𝐷𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑠.𝑥
                                              𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑦

The hypothesis we want to test is whether differences across countries in the relative net supply of skills
 ���������𝑠,𝑥 − 𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑦
(𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑦         ���������𝑠′,𝑥 ,) can explain cross-country differences in wage inequality (as measured by
inderdecile wage ratios). The relationship between these two sets of variables is shown in graphical form
in Figure 4. The first graph plots the relationship between the relative net supply of high- versus low-
skilled workers, on the one hand, and the P90/P10 wage ratio, on the other. Each observation shows the
extent to which the United States differs with respect to that particular country. Taking Sweden as an
example, the graph shows that the United States has a much lower relative net supply of high- versus low-
skilled workers, as well as a significantly higher P90/P10 wage ratio. While the relationship is negative
overall, it is not particularly strong: only 5% of higher wage inequality in the United States can be
explained by the higher net supply of skilled workers in other countries.

The second graph in Figure 4 shows that the relationship is much stronger at the top of the wage
distribution: the higher relative net supply of high- versus medium-skilled workers in other countries
accounts for 29% of the higher P90/P50 ratio in the United States. The effect size is also quite large: a
1% increase in the relative net supply of high-skilled workers in the United States would reduce the top-
half wage inequality by 0.27%. By contrast, the third graph shows that the net supply of skills explains
nothing of the higher wage inequality at the bottom of the wage distribution (P50/P10). Finally, the
fourth graph combines all the observations of the previous three graphs and shows that, overall,
differences in the relative net supply of skills can explain 9% of differences in wage inequality between the
United States and other countries. 12,13


11 Industry-occupation cells are defined in the same way as in Blau and Kahn (1996) and LOV (2004).
12 LOV (2004) found that differences in the relative net supply of skills could account for 58% of the cross-country
variance in skills premia between medium- and low-skilled workers; and 44% in the case of high- versus low-skilled
workers. There are some important differences between our analysis and that of LOV (2014). The first of these is
that we focus on wage inequality while they look at relative skills premia. The second difference lies in the fact that
we define our skills groups using “absolute” thresholds based on the PIAAC average, while they define them relative
to one specific country. Because their approach means that the results are sensitive to the choice of reference
country, they repeat the analysis as many times as there are countries in their sample. This boosts their sample size
which, in turn, increases their R-squared. When we repeat our analysis to replicate exactly the methodology used by
LOV (2004), we find that the relative net supply of skills can explain 19% of the cross-country variance between
medium-and low-skilled workers; and 22% in the case of high- versis low-skilled workers. These estimates are
considerably lower than those found by LOV (2014). It is difficult to say whether the difference represents a real
change over time in the relationship between net skills supplies and relative wages of skills groups, or whether it can
be explained by the difference in samples. Countries included in their sample but not in ours are: Chile, Hungary,
Slovenia and Switzerland. Conversely, countries included in our sample, but not in theirs, are: Australia, Austria,
England/Northern Ireland, Estonia, Flanders, France, Ireland, Japan, Korea, the Slovak Republic and Spain.
13 Blau and Kahn (1996) also carry out a demand and supply analysis to quantify the extent to which higher wage

inequality in the United States could be explained by differences in the relative supply of, and demand for, educated
workers – but they conclude that market forces appear to have little explanatory power. However, Blau and Kahn

5. The importance of skills: Controlling for institutions

In the previous section, we showed that the demand and supply of skills appears to be correlated with
wage inequality. However, one may argue that this correlation is, in fact, driven by differences in labor
market institutions which happen to be correlated with differences in skills demand and supply. To test
for the robustness of the findings obtained in the previous section, we therefore run a series of
regressions identical to those reported in Figure 4, but add controls for labor market institutions, policies
and practices as well. The results from this analysis are reported in Table 4. The first column of each
panel simply reproduces the regressions from Figure 4, which shows that a significant portion of the
difference in top-half wage inequality between the United States and other countries can be explained by
differences in the net supply of high- versus medium-level skills, but that skills do not appear to explain
the higher inequality in the United States in the bottom half of the wage distribution.




(1996) derive workers’ skill levels simply from the number of years of schooling and work experience, and LOV
(2004) show that the Blau and Kahn (1996) results change substantially once more direct measures of skill are used.

share permanent and part-time (2012); OECD Government at a Glance, 2013 (2011, 2010 for Germany, Ireland, Norway,
Sweden, and the United Kingdom); OECD Tax-Benefit Model for unemployment benefits (2012).

In subsequent columns, we include a series of controls for labor market institutions, policies and
practices 14: the level at which statutory minimum wages are set (with a dummy to control for countries
that do not have a statutory minimum wage); the strictness of employment protection legislation; the
union coverage rate; the size of the public sector; and the generosity of unemployment benefits. In the
final column, all controls are added simultaneously.

All the aforementioned institutions could be argued to reduce wage inequality, either directly or indirectly.
The impact of statutory minimum wages is perhaps the most obvious one, as they directly boost the
wages of workers at the bottom of the distribution. 15 Even in countries with no statutory minimum
wages, a large part of the workforce is covered by wage floors specified in sector- and/or occupation-


14 These institutional controls are added one at the time to avoid issues of collinearity. Indeed, institutions within a
country do not evolve in isolation, and one would expect a high degree of interdependence between them. Also, the
estimation treats policies as exogenous factors affecting inequality, but there may be reason to be concerned by
endogeneity: institutions may be introduced or adjusted in response to changes in inequality. Given that data are
only available for one point in time we cannot include country fixed effects and country level institutions at the same
in the regression model. The results from these regressions should therefore not be interpreted as causal links, but
rather as interesting statistical correlations.
15 See DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996), Lee (1999) and Autor, Manning and Smith (2014) for evidence of the

link between minimum wages and inequality in the United States.

                                                              14
level collective agreements which, in combination with high collective bargaining coverage, are a
functional equivalent of a binding minimum wage (Garnero, Kampelmann and Rycx, forthcoming).
Related to this previous point, therefore, wage inequality could be expected to be lower in countries with
higher union coverage.16 Strict employment protection legislation might have a more indirect effect by
reducing employment overall, and of low-skilled, low-wage workers in particular. Because wages paid to
low-skilled workers in the public sector may be higher than those that would be dictated by the market,
the size of the public sector may also be inversely related with wage inequality. Finally, generous
unemployment benefits may raise the reservation wages of the unemployed to the extent that low-skilled
workers decide not to work for low wages, indirectly compressing the wage distribution. Further details
about the construction of the variables can be found in the notes to Table 4.

The results show that the relative net supply of high- versus medium-level skills (panel (ii)) always remains
significant in explaining higher wage inequality in the United States, regardless of which institutional
control is included in the regression. By contrast, the relative net supply of medium- versus low-skilled
workers is never statistically significant (Panel (iii)). In panel (i), which reports the results for the P90/P10
wage ratio, the coefficient of the skills variable is insignificant in the regression without institutional
controls, but it turns statistically significant in most of the regressions with institutional controls. This
suggests that differences in the net supply of skills can explain differences in the 90-10 gap within
countries with similar institutional setups.

Overall, this robustness check therefore corroborates the previous conclusion that the supply of skills
seems to matter for wage inequality, particularly at the top of the wage distribution. A final remark is that
all the institutional controls have the expected, negative impact on inequality.

6. The importance of skills: Explaining wage gaps between socio-demographic
groups

The focus so far has been on overall wage inequality, and the extent to which differences in skills and
skills prices with other countries could account for the higher wage inequality observed in the United
States. In this section, we look at wage inequality within the United States, and the extent to which
differences in wages between different socio-demographic groups might be explained by differences in
skills and skills prices.

Table 5 contains the wage ratios for: men versus women; older workers (50-65) versus younger ones (16-
29); those with at least one parent with tertiary education versus those whose parents have no more than
lower secondary education; those whose first language is native versus those whose first language is a
foreign one; and whites versus blacks and Hispanics. The ratios are estimated using average wages
(columns i to iii), as well as wages at the P90 (columns iv to vi) and at the P10 (columns vii to ix) of the
wage distribution, and they are shown each time for the United States as well as for the average PIAAC
country (with the exception of the racial breakdown, which is not available for other PIAAC countries).

On average, men in the United States earn wages 18% higher than those of women – a gap identical to
that observed in the average PIAAC country. The gender wage gap also tends to be higher at the top of
the wage distribution (26% in the United States) than at the bottom (7%). Older workers earn more in the
United States compared to younger workers (73%) than they do in the average PIAAC country (41%),
and the same is true for workers who have at least one parent with tertiary education compared to those
whose parents only have lower secondary education (48% v. 18%). In both cases, the gaps are also larger

16See Blau and Kahn (1996), DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996) and Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2011) for the
impact of falling union coverage on wage inequality in the United States.

                                                       15
at the top of the distribution than at the bottom. The wage ratio of those who speak the native language
as their first language compared to those who speak a foreign language is about the same in the United
States as it is in the average PIAAC country (15% and 13%, respectively). In this case, however, the wage
gap is larger at the bottom of the distribution (but only in the United States). Comparisons between
different racial groups are possible only for the United States, and the data show that whites earn, on
average, 43% more than blacks and Hispanics, and that this gap is higher at the top of the distribution
(56%) than at the bottom (10%).

We now proceed to estimate the extent to which these wage gaps are related to differences in skills
endowments and prices using the same reweighting method used in the previous sections. In the case of
gender, for example, we want to know what would happen to the wage gap if: (i) women had the same
skills endowments as men; and (ii) the skills of women were rewarded in the same way as for men. We
estimate the impact on the wage gaps at the average wage, as well as at the 10th and 90th percentiles of the
wage distribution. This exercise is repeated for each of the other socio-demographic groups.

The results in Table 5 show that differences in skills endowments play a larger part in explaining the
gender wage gap in the United States than they do in the average PIAAC country (38% v. 20%). This
could have two possible explanations (which are not necessarily mutually exclusive). First, that the United
States could make larger gains than the average PIAAC country in reducing the gender wage gap by
investing more in the skills of women. Indeed, the numeracy gap between men and women is slightly
larger in the United States than it is in the other PIAAC countries. 17 Second, that factors unaccounted for
(including, possibly, discrimination) are more important determinants of female wages in the other
PIAAC countries. Table 5 also shows that the share of the gender wage gap in the United States explained
by skills is similar at the top and at the bottom of the wage distribution, while differences in how skills are
rewarded are far more important at the bottom of the distribution. This could be explained by differences
in wage setting mechanisms across countries (like minimum wages and collective bargaining agreements)
which affect wages at the bottom of the distribution much more than those at the top.

While differences in the distributions of skill could explain a substantial portion of the gender wage gap,
they contribute virtually nothing to the difference in wages between older and younger workers. This is
true both at the top and at the bottom of the distribution, as well as in the United States and in the other
PIAAC countries. The entire gap appears to be down to differences in how skills are rewarded between
the two groups. Of course, one counter-argument might be that we only have a very narrow definition of
skills, and that different skills, uncorrelated to numeracy proficiency, start becoming more important
determinants of wages as workers age. The price effect could therefore be picking up the effect of these
other skills which are not controlled for in the analysis. However, even when we include skills in the
model that develop more strongly with age (like task discretion), the bulk of the wage gap between older
and younger worker remains unexplained.18

The wage gap between workers of different socio-economic backgrounds (as measured by parental
education) can be explained primarily by differences in skills, both in the United States and in the other
PIAAC countries. Further analysis suggests that, across the PIAAC sample, 60% of those whose parents
have attained tertiary education have a tertiary qualification themselves (57.5% in the United States). This




17 Although the findings in this paper are generally not affected by our choice of numeracy as the measure of skill,
the gender wage gap results are one exception. Indeed, contrary to literacy, numeracy is higher for men than for
women in all of the 22 countries analysed in this paper.
18 In practice, we re-run the decomposition using five numeracy x five task discretion (i.e. 25) skills groups.


                                                          16
suggests that educational attainment is a key channel through which skills might be transferred from one
generation to another. 19

The fourth panel looks at workers by whether their first language is the country’s native language or not.
In the United States, there is a wage gap between these groups only at the bottom of the distribution and,
contrary to what seems to be the case in the other PIAAC countries, this wage gap can be attributed
primarily to differences in skills.20

Similarly, racial wage gaps at the top of the distribution in the United States are primarily explained by
differences in skills. This is in line with previous research for the United States which has argued that
much of the black-white wage differential is due to differences in basic skills measured by the AFQT
(O’Neill, 1990; Maxwell, 1994; Neal and Johnson, 1996; Fryer, 2010). At the bottom of the distribution,
where the racial wage gap is smaller, there appears to be little difference between the importance of skills
prices and skills endowments in explaining the difference in wages between the two groups.

Notes: PIAAC is the unweighted average of the country-level estimates. Japan is excluded from the estimates for first language
learned because of an insufficient number of observations. Ethnicity data are only available for the United States.

19 Of course, this says nothing about causality, and it is perfectly possible that ability is passed down genetically and
that higher-ability individuals pursue more education.
20 Because the PIAAC tests are run in the native language, those whose first language is not native may be at a

disadvantage and their numeracy score not a true reflection of their actual numeracy skills.

7. Wage compression and employment effects

In this paper, we have shown that wage inequality is significantly higher in the United States than it is in
other OECD countries. We have also argued that differences in skills are likely to play some role in
explaining this higher wage inequality. However, skills could only explain part of the gap and, as seen in
Section 4, labor market policies and institutions also have a compressing effect on the wage distribution.
One key mechanism through which they achieve this is by artificially raising the wages of those at the
bottom of the distribution, possibly above the level that would arise under free market conditions. By
looking at wages alone, we may therefore be ignoring another, important aspect of inequality, which is
inequality in employment outcomes. Indeed, in countries with stronger labor market institutions, wage
inequality might be lower, but so might the employment rates of the least skilled. If unemployment and
other out-of-work benefits are lower than what individuals would earn in the labor market, more
compressed wage distributions could result in more unequal earnings distributions if a large portion of
low-skilled workers are forced out of a job.

In this section, we explore to what extent higher wage inequality in the United States might be
compensated for by a higher employment rates among the low-skilled. To shine light on this issue, we
once again split the workforce of each country into high-, medium- and low-skilled groups using the same
skill group definitions derived in Section 4. Table 6 shows the employment and unemployment rates of
each of these skills groups, by country. Employment rates are generally higher in the United States than
they are in other countries. However, the differences in employment rates between the various skill
groups in the United States are comparable to those observed on average across the PIAAC countries. In
the United States, the low-skilled (medium-skilled) are 26% (9%) less likely to be employed than the high-
skilled, while the equivalent PIAAC averages are 26% and 10%, respectively. The least-skilled in the
United States are therefore not more likely to be in employment relative to the more skilled – which
contradicts the wage compression hypothesis. Overall, there is a slight negative relationship between wage
inequality (as measured by the P90/P10) and the percentage difference in employment rates between
high- and low-skilled groups. Countries like Japan and Korea have relatively high wage inequality but
small differences in the employment rate of different skills groups; while Scandinavian countries tend to
have low wage inequality, but relatively large differences in the unemployment rates of different skills
groups.

Turning to unemployment rates, there is even less support for the wage compression hypothesis in the
United States: the low-skilled (medium-skilled) are 3.6 (2.1) times more likely to be unemployed than the
high-skilled. The equivalent PIAAC average ratios are 2.5 and 1.6, respectively. Again, there is very little
evidence of a relationship between wage inequality and the relative unemployment rates of skills groups
across countries. Some countries with much lower wage inequality than the United States have similar
unemployment ratios between skills groups (e.g. Sweden), while others have much higher unemployment
gaps (e.g. Flanders). Overall, the results presented so far do not suggest that higher wage inequality in the
United States results in better relative employment outcomes for the low-skilled - which is consistent with
earlier findings from Nickell and Bell (1996), Freeman and Schettkat (2001) and Howell and Huebler
(2005), as well as with more recent analysis by Jovecic (2015).

Notes: PIAAC average is the unweighted average of the country employment and unemployment rates.

An alternative way of assessing the employment effects of wage compression is to look at whether the
skills of the unemployed differ from the skills of the employed. If wage compression were pushing the
least skilled into unemployment, one would expect the unemployed to be significantly less skilled than the
employed. Table 7 reports the average numeracy scores for the unemployed and employed, by country.
While the average skill level of the unemployed is (nearly) always lower than that of the employed, the
employed-to-unemployed average skills ratio ranges from 1 in Korea to 1.14 in England/Northern
Ireland. In the United States, this ratio (1.10) tends to be quite high as well (i.e. the unemployed are
relatively less skilled compared to the employed than they are in other countries). Once again this is
inconsistent with the idea that higher wage inequality might be the price paid for higher employment rates
among the low-skilled.

While Table 7 looked at the average skills of the employed and unemployed in each country, Figure 5
sheds some light on how these skills are distributed. It shows the proportion of the employed and
unemployed who are low-, medium- and high-skilled, respectively. Compared to the PIAAC average, the
unemployed in the United States are disproportionately low-skilled, but this will partly reflect the fact that
skills are generally lower in the United States. More importantly, the proportion of unemployed among
the low-skilled is 1.63 times the proportion of employed among the low-skilled, while this ratio is 1.54
across PIAAC on average.

8. Conclusion

The collection and publication of new data from internationally comparable assessments of cognitive
skills has sparked renewed interest in the relationship between skills and wage inequality (e.g. jovecic,
2015; Paccagnella, 2015; Pena, 2015). While the earlier literature on this topic had been divisive and did
not come to any definite conclusions about the role of skills, the more recent literature has tended to
ignore an entire side of the earlier argument and claims that skills matter very little to explaining
international differences in wage inequality. This assertion seem counterintuitive, however, given: (i) that
skills play an important role at the individual level in terms of determining wages (Hanushek et al. 2015);
and (ii) that skills/routine-biased technological change have played a crucial role in labor market
polarization and rising inequality (Juhn, 1999; Goldin and Katz, 2008; Autor and Dorn, 2013; Auto, Katz
and Kearney, 2006). The primary purpose of this paper was therefore to fully revive the earlier literature
on cognitive skills and wage inequality and to show that, despite the availability of new data, this earlier
polemic remains unsettled. Indeed, as the results in this paper have shown, there does appear to be a role
for skills in explaining international differences in wage inequality. What has been missing to date,
however, is the methodology to make comparable assessments of the importance of skills and labor
market institutions in determining wage inequality. This would require a unified framework for analysis,
and should be a priority for future research.
