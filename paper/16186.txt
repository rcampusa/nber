1     Overview.

I noted in a paper published in the Journal of Political Economy in 1983 that at that time,

7 out of the 8 postwar U.S. recessions had been preceded by a sharp increase in the price of

crude petroleum. Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 led to a doubling in the price

of oil in the fall of 1990 and was followed by the ninth postwar recession in 1990-91. The

price of oil more than doubled again in 1999-2000, with the tenth postwar recession coming

in 2001. Yet another doubling in the price of oil in 2007-2008 accompanied the beginning

of recession number 11, the most recent and frightening of the postwar economic downturns.

So the count today stands at 10 out of 11, the sole exception being the mild recession of

1960-61 for which there was no preceding rise in oil prices.

    Oil shocks could aﬀect the economy through their consequences for both supply and

demand. On the supply side, consider a firm whose output Y depends on inputs of capital

K, labor N , and energy E:

                                      Y = F (K, N, E).

Suppose that the capital stock is fixed in the short run and that wages adjust instantly to

ensure that labor demand equals a fixed supply N. Then if X denotes the price of energy

relative to the price of output,
                                       ∂Y   ∂F ∂E
                                          =       .                                      (1)
                                       ∂X   ∂E ∂X

Multiplying (1) by X/Y results in

                                    ∂ ln Y   ∂F E ∂ ln E
                                           =             .                               (2)
                                    ∂ ln X   ∂E Y ∂ ln X

                                              1
If the marginal product of energy equals its relative price (∂F/∂E = X), then the first terms

on the right side of (2) will be recognized as the energy expenditure share

                                      ∂F E   EX
                                           =    =γ
                                      ∂E Y    Y

where γ denotes the firm’s spending on energy relative to the value of its total output.

Letting lower-case letters denote natural logarithms, (2) can be written

                                         ∂y   ∂e
                                            =γ .                                          (3)
                                         ∂x   ∂x

In other words, the elasticity of output with respect to the relative price of energy would be

the energy expenditure share γ times the price-elasticity of energy demand.

   The energy expenditure share is a small number. In 2009, the U.S. consumed about 7.1

billion barrels of petroleum products, which at the current $80/barrel price of crude corre-

sponds to a value around $570 billion. This would represent only 4% of U.S. GDP. Moreover,

the short-run price-elasticity of petroleum demand is extremely small (Dahl, 1993), so that

expression (3) implies an output response substantially below 4%. For this reason, mod-

els built around this kind of mechanism, such as Kim and Loungani (1992), imply that oil

shocks could only have made a small contribution to historical downturns. Note also that

(3) implies a linear relation between y and x; an oil price decrease should increase output by

exactly the same amount that an oil price increase of the same magnitude would decrease

output.

   To account for larger eﬀects, it would have to be the case that either K or N also adjust

in response to the oil price shock. Finn (2000) analyzed the multiplier eﬀects that result if

                                              2
firms adjust capital utilization rates in order to minimize depreciation expenses. Leduc and

Sill (2004) incorporated this utilization eﬀect along with labor adjustments resulting from

sticky wages. Again these models imply a linear relation between y and x, though Atkeson

and Kehoe’s (1999) treatment of putty-clay investment technology produces some nonlinear

eﬀects.

   Davis (1987a, 1987b) stressed the role of specialized labor and capital in the transmission

mechanism. If the marginal product of labor falls in a particular sector, it can take time

before workers relocate to something more productive, during which transition the economy

will have some unemployed resources. In my 1988 paper, unemployment could result not

just from workers who are in transition between sectors but also from workers who are simply

waiting until conditions in their sector once again improve. In such models, idle labor and

capital rather than decreased energy use as in (1) account for the lost output. Moreover,

these eﬀects are clearly nonlinear.     For example when energy prices fell in 1985, some

workers in the oil-producing sector were forced to find other jobs. As a result, it is possible

in principle for aggregate output to fall temporarily in response to an oil price decrease just

as it does for an oil price increase.

   An alternative mechanism operates through the demand side.          An increase in energy

prices leaves consumers with less money to spend on non-energy items and leaves an oil-

importing country with less income overall.       If a consumer tries to purchase the same

quantity of energy E in response to an increase in the relative price given by ∆X, then

saving or expenditures on other items must fall by E · ∆X, with a proportionate eﬀect on



                                              3
demand given by
                                          ∆Y d  E
                                               = ∆X.
                                           Y    Y

If as in a fixed-price Keynesian model demand Y d is the limiting determinant of total output,

we would have
                                              ∂y
                                                 = γ,
                                              ∂x

so that by this mechanism the eﬀect once again is linear and bounded1 by the expenditure

share γ.

      Specialization of labor and capital could also be important for the transmission of de-

mand eﬀects as well. Demand for less fuel-eﬃcient cars would be influenced not just by the

consequences of an oil price increase for current disposable income but also by consideration

of future gasoline prices over the lifetime of the car. Bernanke (1983) noted that uncertainty

per se could lead to a postponement of purchases for capital and durable goods. A shift

in demand away from larger cars seems to have been a key feature of the macroeconomic

response to historical oil shocks (Bresnahan and Ramey, 1993; Edelstein and Kilian, 2009;

Hamilton, 2009; Ramey and Vine, 2010), and Bresnahan and Ramey (1993) and Ramey and

Vine (2010) map out in detail exactly how specialization of labor and capital in the U.S.

automobile industry amplified the eﬀects of historical oil price shocks and introduced nonlin-

earities of the sort anticipated by the sectoral-shifts hypothesis. In the model of Hamilton

(1988), shifts in the advantages between sectors resulting from supply eﬀects (greater pro-

duction costs for sector 1 as a result of higher energy prices) or demand eﬀects (less demand

  1
    Price adjustment would make this eﬀect smaller whereas the traditional Keynesian multiplier could
make it bigger.

                                                 4
for the output of sector 1 as a result of higher energy prices) have identical macroeconomic

consequences, operating in either case through idled labor in the disadvantaged sector.

   In terms of empirical evidence on nonlinearity, Loungani (1986) demonstrated that oil-

induced sectoral imbalances contributed to fluctuations in U.S. unemployment rates. Mork

(1989) found that oil price increases have diﬀerent predictive implications for subsequent

U.S. GDP growth than oil price decreases.          Other studies also reporting evidence that

nonlinear forecasting equations do better include Lee, Ni and Ratti (1995), Balke, Brown,

and Yücel (2002), and Hamilton (1996, 2003).         Both Carlton (2010) and Ravazzolo and

Rothman (2010) confirmed these predictive improvements using real-time data.         Ferderer

(1996) and Elder and Serletis (2010) demonstrated that oil-price volatility predicts slower

GDP growth, implying that oil price decreases include some contractionary implications.

Davis and Haltiwanger (2001) found nonlinearities in the eﬀects of oil prices on employment

at the individual plant level for U.S. data.       Herrera, Lagalo, and Wada (2010) found a

strong nonlinear response of U.S. industrial production to oil prices, with the biggest eﬀects

in industries the use of whose products by consumers is energy intensive.        A nonlinear

relation between oil prices and subsequent real GDP growth has also been reported for a

number of OECD countries by Cuñado and Pérez de Gracia (2003), Jiménez-Rodrígueza

and Sánchez (2005), Kim (2009), and Engemann, Kliesen and Owyang (2010).

   By contrast, a prominent recent study by Kilian and Vigfusson (2009) found little evi-

dence of nonlinearity in the relation between oil prices and U.S. GDP growth. In the next

section I explore why they seem to have reached a diﬀerent conclusion from many of the



                                               5
previous researchers mentioned above. Sections 3 and 4 note some of the further implications

of their results for inference about nonlinear dynamic relations.


2    Testing for nonlinearity.

Let yt denote the rate of growth of real GDP, xt the change in the price of oil, and x̃t a

proposed known nonlinear function of oil prices. The null hypothesis that the optimal one-

period-ahead forecast of yt is linear in past values of xt−i is quite straightforward to state

and test: we just use OLS to estimate the forecasting regression

                                 p                 p                  p
                                 X                 X                  X
                      yt = α +         φi yt−i +         β i xt−i +         γ i x̃t−i + εt        (4)
                                 i=1               i=1                i=1


and test whether γ 1 = · · · = γ p = 0. As noted above, a large number of papers have tested

such a hypothesis and rejected it. Kilian and Vigfusson’s paper might leave the impression

that these earlier tests were somehow misspecified or insuﬃciently powerful, and that the

reason Kilian and Vigfusson reach a diﬀerent conclusion from previous researchers is that

they are proposing superior tests. Such a result would be surprising if true. For Gaussian εt

in (4), OLS produces maximum likelihood estimates which are asymptotically eﬃcient, and

the OLS F test is the likelihood ratio test with well-known desirable properties. That some

new test could be more powerful than the standard OLS test seems unlikely, and certainly

if the OLS test rejects and the new test does not, the reconciliation cannot be based on the

assertion that the new test is more powerful.              Kilian and Vigfusson also include in their

analysis some standard OLS tests, which oﬀer further support for their conclusion that the

relation appears to be linear. But insofar as these are the same OLS tests that have already

                                                    6
produced rejections of the null hypothesis in previous studies, the diﬀerence in conclusions

must come from a diﬀerent data set or diﬀerences in the specification of the basic forecasting

regression (4), and not from any superior properties of the new tests proposed in their paper.

   Most of their paper explores the case in which x̃t is given by x+
                                                                   t = max{0, xt }, the


alternative hypothesis of interest taken to be that oil price increases have diﬀerent economic

eﬀects from oil price decreases. This particular specification is one that previous researchers

have found to be unstable over earlier data sets (e.g., Hooker, 1996; Hamilton, 2003), so

it is unsurprising that Kilian and Vigfusson find that such a relation does not perform

well on their sample either. My earlier investigation (Hamilton, 2003) concluded that the

nonlinearities can be captured with a specification in which what matters is whether oil

prices make a new 3-year high:


                            x#
                             t = max{0, Xt − max{Xt−1 , ..., Xt−12 }}



for Xt the log level of the oil price. Below I reproduce the coeﬃcients as reported in equation

(3.8) of Hamilton (2003):


                 yt =     0.98 + 0.22 yt−1 + 0.10 yt−2 − 0.08yt−3 − 0.15 yt−4
                          (0.13)       (0.07)        (0.07)      (0.07)     (0.07)

                         − 0.024x#           #           #           #
                                 t−1 − 0.021xt−2 − 0.018xt−3 − 0.042xt−4 .                     (5)
                             (0.014)            (0.014)       (0.014)     (0.014)



If one adds the linear terms {xt−1 , xt−2 , xt−3 , xt−4 } to this regression and calculates the OLS

χ2 test of the hypothesis that the coeﬃcients on {x#      #      #      #
                                                   t−1 , xt−2 , xt−3 , xt−4 } are zero using the


original data set, the result is a χ2 (4) statistic of 16.93, with a p-value of 0.002. The last

entry of Kilian and Vigfusson’s Table 4 reports the OLS χ2 test on a similar specification

                                                          7
for their data set which results in a p-value of 0.046. Clearly it must be diﬀerences in the

specification and data set between the two papers, rather than diﬀerences in the testing

methodology, that accounts for the diﬀerent findings.    There are a number of diﬀerences

that could explain the higher p-value obtained by Kilian and Vigfusson.

   Diﬀerent data sets. In my earlier analysis, t in (5) ran from 1949:Q2 to 2001:Q3 (or

210 total observations), whereas in Kilian and Vigfusson’s analysis, t runs from 1974:Q4 to

2007:Q4 (or 133 total observations). One would expect to see a higher p-value in a shorter

sample, since fewer observations make it harder to reject any hypothesis.    In addition, it

is possible that there has been a structural change since 2001, so that the earlier proposed

nonlinear relation (5) does a poorer job with more recent data.

   Diﬀerent measure of oil prices. In my original analysis, xt was based on the producer

price index for crude petroleum, whereas Kilian and Vigfusson use the refiner acquisition

cost for imported oil.     The values of these two measures are compared in the top two

panels of Figure 1.      The RAC is not available prior to 1974, and Kilian and Vigfusson

imputed values back to 1971. The two oil price measures are very similar after 1983, but

are somewhat diﬀerent in the 1970s. Most notably, according to RAC, the first oil shock of

1974:Q1 was three times the size of that seen in any other quarter of the 1970s, and there

was very little change in oil prices in 1981:Q1. By contrast, the PPI registers the shocks

of 1974:Q1, 1979:Q2-Q3, and 1981:Q1 as similar events. If one thought that a key factor

in the transmission mechanism to the U.S. economy involved the price consumers paid for

gasoline, the PPI may provide a better measure, since the CPI also represents these three



                                              8
shocks as having similar magnitude (see the bottom panel of Figure 1). In any case, it is

certainly possible that for such diﬀerent measures of oil prices, the functional form of the

optimal forecast could diﬀer.

   Diﬀerent price adjustment.               Another diﬀerence is that (5) used for xt the nominal

change in the price of oil, whereas Kilian and Vigfusson subtract the percentage change in

the consumer price index in their definition of xt . They argue correctly that most economic

theories would involve the real rather than the nominal price of oil. On the other hand, if the

nonlinearity represents threshold responses based on consumer sentiment, it is possible that

these thresholds are defined in nominal terms. I would also note that empirical measurement

of “the” aggregate price level is problematic, and deflating by a particular number such as

the CPI introduces a new source of measurement error, which could lead to a deterioration in

the forecasting performance. In any case, it is again quite possible that there are diﬀerences

in the functional form of forecasts based on nominal instead of real prices.

   Inclusion of contemporaneous regressors.                         The χ2 statistics in Kilian and Vig-

fusson’s Table 4 are in fact not based on the forecasting regression (4), but instead come

from testing γ 0 = γ 1 = · · · = γ p in
                                   p
                                   X                 p
                                                     X                  p
                                                                        X
                        yt = α +         φi yt−i +         β i xt−i +         γ i x̃t−i + εt .       (6)
                                   i=1               i=0                i=0


Kilian and Vigfusson suggest that this second test would have more power than the first,

though again I find that an odd claim, since the two regressions are asking diﬀerent questions.

Equation (4) is asking a forecasting question: can GDP growth in quarter t be predicted

on the basis of variables known at the end of quarter t − 1? Equation (6) is estimating

                                                       9
something else, which perhaps has a structural interpretation for some proposed model of

the economy. If the conditional expectation of yt given current and past oil prices in fact

does not involve the current oil price (so that β 0 = γ 0 = 0), then the two regressions would

be asking the same question.         In that case, a test based on (4) would have to be more

powerful since it does not require the estimation and testing of auxiliary parameters whose

true value is in fact zero.

   Number of lags.            My original regression (5) used p = 4 lags, whereas Kilian and

Vigfusson have used p = 6 lags throughout. If the truth is p = 4, estimating and testing the

additional lags will result in a reduction in power. On the other hand, it might be argued

that an optimal linear forecast of yt requires more than 4 lags of yt−i and xt−i , and that

omitting the extra lags accounts for the apparent success of a nonlinear specification (since

x#
 t−4 incorporates some additional information about xt−i for i > 4).


   The contribution of each factor. Table 1 identifies the role of each of these diﬀerences

in turn, by changing one element of the specification at a time and seeing what eﬀect it

has on the results.    The first row gives the p-value for the last entry reported in Kilian

and Vigfusson’s Table 4, while the second row gives the p-value for my specification on

the original data set.        The third row isolates the eﬀect of the choice of sample period

alone, by estimating my original specification using the sample period adopted by Kilian

and Vigfusson. Instead of a p-value of 0.002 obtained for the original sample, the p-value is

only 0.013 on the new data set. Is this because the sample is shorter, or because the relation

has changed? One can test for the latter possibility by using data for 1949:Q2-2007:Q4 to re-

                                                                       t−1 , xt−2 , xt−3 , xt−4 }


were diﬀerent subsequent to 2001:Q4 compared with those prior to 2001:Q4. One fails to

reject the null hypothesis of no change in these coeﬃcients (χ2 (4) = 5.03, p = 0.284). Thus

a key explanation for why Kilian and Vigfusson find weaker evidence of nonlinearity is that

they have used a shorter sample.

   Subsequent rows of Table 1 use Kilian and Vigfusson’s 1974:Q4-2007:Q4 sample, but

change other elements of their specification one at a time.       Row 4 uses the real change

in the producer price index of crude petroleum in place of the real change in the refiner

acquisition cost of imported oil, but otherwise follows Kilian and Vigfusson in all the other

details. Using the PPI instead of the RAC would reduce Kilian and Vigfusson’s reported

p-value from 0.046 to 0.024. Row 5 keeps the RAC, but uses the nominal price rather than

the real.   This change alone would again have reduced the p-value from 0.046 to 0.028.

Row 6 simply omits the contemporaneous term, basing the test on (4) rather than (6), and

would be another way to reduce the p-value to 0.027. Finally, row 7 shows that using p = 4

instead of p = 6 would also increase the evidence of nonlinearity. Furthermore, a test of the

null hypothesis that β 5 = β 6 = γ 5 = γ 6 = 0 in Kilian-Vigfusson’s original (6) fails to reject

(χ2 (4) = 3.90, p = 0.420), suggesting that this again is another factor in reducing the power

of their tests.

   To summarize, Kilian and Vigfusson make a number of changes from previous research,

including a shorter sample, diﬀerent oil price measure, diﬀerent price adjustment, inclusion

of contemporaneous terms, and longer lags. Each of these changes, taken by itself, would



                                               11
lead them to find weaker evidence of nonlinearity than previous research. Taken together,

they explain why the overall conclusions of their study diﬀer from most earlier investigations.

    Post-sample performance. The nonlinear terms in (4) seem to improve the in-sample

fit, but how helpful are they out of sample?          If one estimates a purely linear forecasting

equation from the Kilian-Vigfusson 1974:Q3 to 2007:Q4 data set and specification,

                                       6
                                       X                 6
                                                         X
                            yt = α +         φi yt−i +         β i xt−i + εt ,
                                       i=1               i=1


and uses these estimated coeﬃcients to predict the one-quarter-ahead GDP growth over

the data we’ve subsequently received for 2008:Q1 to 2009:Q3, the out-of-sample root-mean-

squared-error is 1.09. On the other hand, when the estimated relation is allowed to include

the Kilian-Vigfusson real RAC net measure x#
                                           t as in (4), the out-of-sample RMSE is 0.80, a


27% improvement. Interestingly, if one uses the coeﬃcients from (5) as estimated 1949:Q2

to 2001:Q3 to form a post-sample forecast over the period 2008:Q1 to 2009:Q3, the RMSE

is 0.62. These results confirm the impression that nonlinear terms, particularly of the form

I proposed in my 2003 paper, are helpful for forecasting U.S. real GDP growth.


3     Censoring bias.

In Section 2 of their paper, Kilian and Vigfusson (2009) demonstrate that if the true relation

is linear and one mistakenly estimates a nonlinear specification, the resulting estimates are

asymptotically biased.   These results parallel the demonstration in Hamilton (2003) that

if the true relation is nonlinear and one mistakenly estimates a linear specification, the

resulting estimates are asymptotically biased. Both statements are of course true, and are

                                                 12
illustrations of the broader theme that one runs into problems whenever one tries to estimate

a misspecified model.

    Kilian and Vigfusson suggest one should take the high road of including both linear and

nonlinear terms as a general strategy to avoid either problem.       While that would indeed

work if one had an infinite sample, in practice it is not always better to add more parameters,

particularly in a sample as small as that used by Kilian and Vigfusson. After all, the same

principle would suggest we include both the RAC and PPI as the oil price measure on the

right-hand side, since there is disagreement as to which is the better measure, and nonlinear

transformations of both the real and nominal magnitudes.         Nobody would do that, and

nobody should. All empirical research necessarily faces a trade-oﬀ between parsimony and

generality, and one is forced to choose some point on that trade-oﬀ in literally every empirical

study that has ever been done. My personal belief is that there are very strong arguments

for trying to keep the estimated relations parsimonious. I note for example that equation

(5), with 9 estimated parameters, provides a 22% improvement in terms of the out-of-sample

RMSE compared with the 19 parameters required for Kilian and Vigfusson’s (4).


4     On calculating impulse-response functions.

A separate question raised by Kilian and Vigfusson (2009), and one for which I am in full

agreement with their analysis, is how one should calculate impulse-response functions. An

expression like (5) is perfectly appropriate for the purpose of forming a one-quarter-ahead




                                              13
forecast. The conditional expectation function,


                               E(yt |yt−1 , xt−1 , yt−2 , xt−2 , ...),


is what it is, and if the functional form of this expectation is indeed as proposed in (5),

then OLS should give optimal parameter estimates. However, if one’s goal is to calculate

multi-period-ahead forecasts, such as required by an impulse-response function, Kilian and

Vigfusson are quite correct that there is a problem with the standard approach of simply

adding to (5) a second equation of the form

                                       p                 p
                                       X                 X
                           x#
                            t = c+           bi x#
                                                 t−i +         di yt−i + ut ,             (7)
                                       i=1               i=1


and iterating the one-period-ahead forecasts of the two equations forward assuming iterated

linear projections. The problem comes from the fact that while (5) in such a system would

be correctly specified, the fitted values of (7) cannot possibly represent the conditional

expectation

                               E(x#
                                  t |xt−1 , yt−1 , xt−2 , yt−2 , ...),                    (8)

since (7) could generate a negative predicted value for x#
                                                         t , which an optimal forecast (8)


would never allow. This point was first noted by Balke, Brown and Yücel (2002), though

most researchers have ignored the concern.

   Not only is there a problem with applying mechanically the standard linear impulse-

response tools in such a setting as a result of the diﬀerence between (7) and (8), but at a

more fundamental level, researchers need to reflect on the underlying question which they are

intending such calculations to answer. A variable such as x#
                                                           t is nonnegative by definition,


                                                 14
and therefore the conditional expectation (8) must always be a positive number. Thus if

one defines an “oil shock” as a deviation from the conditional expectation,


                           ut = x#      #
                                 t − E(xt |xt−1 , yt−1 , xt−2 , yt−2 , ...),                    (9)


then there is a range of positive realizations of x#
                                                   t that are defined to be a “negative oil


shock”. More generally, insofar as an impulse-response function is intended to summarize

the revision in expectations of future variables associated with a particular realization of

(9), as Gallant, Rossi, and Tauchen (1993), Koop, Pesaran and Potter (1996), and Potter

(2000) emphasized, such an object is potentially diﬀerent for every diﬀerent information set

{xt−1 , yt−1 , xt−2 , yt−2 , ...} and size of the shock ut . For small shocks, one would expect from

Taylor’s Theorem that a linear representation of the function would be a good approximation

around the point of linearization.        Kilian and Vigfusson assume that the researcher is

interested in calculating the consequences of a one-standard-deviation shock averaged over

the history of diﬀerent dates t. For purposes of answering this question, and particularly

given the underlying weak evidence of nonlinearity for their data set and specification, they

find limited evidence of nonlinearity in the impulse-response function.          Notwithstanding,

one could imagine wanting to know the answer to dynamic questions other than this, such

as measuring the implications of a big change in the price of oil occurring at some particular

date of interest. By construction, certain questions of this form would be much more poorly

approximated with a linear function than might be suggested by the summary statistics

reported in their paper.



                                                  15
5    Conclusion.

To me, the evidence is convincing that the relation between GDP growth and oil prices

is nonlinear.   The recent paper by Kilian and Vigfusson (2009) does not challenge that

conclusion, but does oﬀer a useful reminder that we need to think carefully about what

question we want to ask with an impulse-response function in such a system and cannot rely

on oﬀ-the-shelf linear methods for an answer.
