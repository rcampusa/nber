                THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT ON THE ECONOMIC STATUS
                              OF BLACK AMERICANS


                                    ABSTRACT


    This paper reviews recent evidence on black economic progress.        It

notes   that while relative status increased over the period 1965-1981,
absolute   differentials in real earnings between blacks and whites widened

over this period. The paper goes out to summarize recent studies of the

impact of government on the economic status of black Americans. Educational

policy has a strong effect. The evidence on affirmative action programs is

mixed. There is an intrinsic bias in the methods used toward finding no

effect of affirmative action programs. Selection bias effects do not

account for more than 10-12% of measured wage growth of black males.

      This paper discusses the status of black Americans and the role of

government in determining that status. The prevailing attitude of society

toward this issue- ..assuming that the Reagan administration represents the

prevailing view--is very different from the attitude of the Johnson

administration that was in office in 1965 when much civil rights legislation as

enacted.

       In 1965, there was a genuine enthusiasm--widely held--about the   wiLlingness
and   capacity of America to solve its domestic problems using government prog:a.ms

of various kinds. Poverty and the unequal economic status of minorities--in

particular black Americans- -were perceived to be pressing but solvable social

problems.

       In 1965, faith in the lessons of social science and the possibilities of

social intervention was widespread. This faith had an apparent factual basis.

Economists took credit for the successful Kennedy tax cut of 1962 which

stimulated the sluggish economy. They proclaimed that this success gave

tangible evidence of a new era in which they could "fthe-tune" the economy and

was viewed as the social science counterpart of the critical experiment in

science.

     Subsequent events have shown how false this view was but in 1965 there was

real optimism. Society could solve its problems-- in particular it could solve

the problem of the inferiority of blacks in the American economy.

     The Kennedy-Johnson administration launched a War on Poverty. Many civil

rights bills were passed and executive orders issued. The main features of the

civil rights activity were:

     (1) The 1964 Civil Rights Bill and related bills banning discrimination in

           employment, housing and voting. "Equal treatment of equals" became

           embodied in the law and voting rights were assured.

     (2) "Affirmative action" programs for employment of minorities were

            begun--initially among larger firms and federal contractors. These

            programs encouraged firms to employ minority workers. This policy was

            instituted in recognition of the difficulty in overcoming historical

            discrimination patterns.

     Coincident with this activity was a coitment to a War on Poverty which

had two main thrusts:

     (1) Efforts were made to improve the skills of poor blacks (and other poor

            people) through (a) expansion of manpower training programs and (b)

            direct intervention in ghetto schools via bussing, through head start

            programs and the like.

     (2) Many transfer programs were introduced or expanded. These programs

            were designed to transfer income to the less fortunate. By virtue of

            their more lowly position in the distribution of income, blacks were

            disproportionately represented in these programs. The mix of social


                                         2
          sp.nding shifted from training to transfers after initial dissatis-

          faction with the results of training programs.

    Just as many economists took credit for the post-1962 improvement in the

American economy, many social scientists proclaimed success for the Kennedy-

Johnson policies aimed at elevating the economic status of blacks. At first

glance, the evidence seemed clear. Although aggregate parity had riot been

achieved, at least for black males, the social statistics seemed to indicate the

initial success of the new programs.

     The first indications suggested that these programs "worked." Consider,

for example, Figure 1. This figure shows three curves placed on the same

diagram. These three curves trace out the ratio of the median income of black

males, white females and black females, respectively to white male median income

for full-time workers. Median income is the income that a person in the middle

of an income distribution earns.

     These figures tell an interesting story. The uppermost curve reveals a

near stability in the black male income/white male income ratio pre-1965- -1965

was the date that much of the Civil Rights legislation became operative- -and a

sharp upward jump after 1965. The lowest curve in that figure- -for black

females--tells a similar story for that group.

     Table 1 demonstrates the significant breakthrough that occurred in the

occupational position of employed blacks. The proportion of the black workforce

in the professional category expanded greatly. Measures of occupational

similarity between blacks and whites show substantial unprecedented improvement

in the period 1960-1970.

     Even more dramatic was the breakthrough in black employment in traditional

segregated industries.

     Figure 3 displays the share of total employment held by white males white

females, black males and black females in the South Carolina textile industry


                                       3
eve: tzie per.O   j-iQ.       Fne textile industry is the largest industrial

employer in the state. Total employment itt the industry continued to expand

until the mid 70's. Its racial employment pattern is typical of that of many

"traditional" southern industries. Skill requirements are low in the industry.

There is a large black population in the state- -both relatively and absolutely--

throughout this   period.
     The topmost curve or line in Figure 3 displays the share of total

employment held by white males. The curve or line second from the top displays

the share of total employment held by white females. The bottom curve presents

the share of black females and the curve just above it presents the share of

black males.

     It is evident from this char: that the share of white males is roughly

constant at 60%. It declines during World War II but is offset by an expansion

of white female employment.

     Through two World Wars, the Korean War, the 1920's boom and the Great

Depression the proportion of blacks itt the industry is low and stable. The

black female share is virtually zero. For black men the share is less than 10%

despite the fact that the black share in the total population is closer to 40%.

     In the post 1965 Vietnam era, textile plants were natural targets of

federal contract compliance programs. Sales to the federal government in the

form of materials for uniforms and the like were sizable. (The total volume of

sales to the government by South Carolina firms increased from $20,000,000 in

1965 to roughly $120,000,000 in 1966 as the Vietnam build up began). In many

counties of the state, textile employment was the principal industrial

employment and was a visible target for federal civil rights activity. The share

of black employment--and the level--increased dramatically after 1965. By 1970,

the industry was roughly 30% black whereas before 1965 it was less than 10%

black. While especially dramatic, the story of the textile industry is fairly


                                        4
cypLcaJ. o ocrier "traditional" southern industries. Penetration rates for

blacks rose. Moreover, as black political power rose as measured by

registration in the South, so did black employment in government (Table 2). It

is this and other evidence that led many scholars of American racial relations

to declare the success of the Kennedy-Johnson policies. Richard Freeman of

Harvard wrote in 1973 that

           While black-white differences have not disappeared, the convergence
           in economic position (of blacks) . . . suggests a virtual collapse in
           traditional discriminatory patterns" (Freeman 1973, page 67).


     He continues on in the same article to write

           Much of the improvement in black economic position that took place
           in the late 60s appears to be the result of governmental and related
           antidisciminatory activity associated with the 1964 Civil Rights
           Act.. .More education for blacks and the general boom of the period
           cannot account for the sharp increase in relative incomes and
           occupational position of blacks after 1964. (bc. c.t. , page 119)

     Writing   in Commentary magazine in the same year- -1973- -Benjamin Waccenberg

and Richard Sca=on described the success of the Kennedy-Johnson social program

in the following terms:

             .A better deal has been given to the poor and black to the point
           where many of them are now in the middle class just as the Presi-
           dential pledges and legislation promised. ... To be sure, we
           cannot say absolutely that the legislation was totally respor.sible
           for the progress made but we can say absolutely that it was crucial.
           Liberalism worked. (ac:enberg and Scammon, 1973)

     From the perspective of 1985 these claims seem exaggerated to some and

absurd to others. Writing in 1984 in an influential book that has been

described as the "Bible of the Second Reagan Administration" conservative author

Charles Murray writes in his influential book Losing Crour.d that




                                          5
             As tne Sturm und Drang of the 1960's faded and we settled into
             the 1970s, the realization gradually spread things were getting
             worse, not batter, for blacks and poor people in this country...
             the inner cities were more violent and ravaged than ever
             before.. .it was difficult to take much satisfaction in the legal
             edifice of black rights when teenage unemployment was approaching
             40 per cent. (page 145, Losthz Ground)

Elsewhere in his monograph he writes

             If an impartial observer from another country were shown the
             statistics on the black lower class from 1950 to 1980 but given
             no information about the contemporaneous changes in society or
             public policy, the observer would infer that racial discrim-
             ination against the black poor increased dramatically during
             the late 1960s and 1970s (Losinz Ground, page 221)
             The consequences of (affirmative action] were disastrous...
             for poor blacks especially. (Losing Ground, page 223).

Summarizing his study, he recoends

             My proposal. . . is to repeal every bit of legislation and
             reverse every court decision.. . (so that] we are back on
             the track left in 1965. (Losing Ground, page 223)


In his work, Murray cites evidence of the failure of schooling and training

programs and warns of the incentives to fail built into many social programs

that require a person to be poor in order to qualify for their benefits.

     Murray's assessment of the position of poor blacks--if not his policy

conclusions- - is shared by such liberal black scholars as W. Wilson of the

University of Chicago, who writes

             Since 1970, both poor whites and nonwhites have evidenced
             very little progress in their elevation from the ranks of
             the underclass. (Wilson, Declining Significance of Race,
             page 154)

     He writes of a polarization in the black community with a prospering upper

class and an i.mmiserated lower class. Wilson's view is widely held in the black

community.

     There is some evidence that supports this less optimistic view of black
status. Co back to Figure 1. The lower right hand side of that figure shows
that the absolute difference in income for all minority groups taken with

                                          6
espec: o n.ce ma4.es an measured n inflation constant dollars widened in the

60s. The gap remains sizable today. Figure 2 presents this evidence in a

different way and reveals that while black incomes rose, so did white incocies

and absolute gaps did not converge between racial groups.

     Figure 8 is a key exhibit in this article. It charts the growth over tiie

in the labor force dropout rate- -those not looking for work or at work- -among

prime age males 25-54. This age group has traditionally had a near zero rate of

dropping out of the work force. For both race groups, the dropout rate has

grown but the rate of growth has been much more rapid for blacks. By 1982,

fully 12% of prime age black males in the civilian population were not attached

to the work force.

     A complete accounting of the status of blacks must reckon with this

phenomenon. A recent history of black progress that focuses only on the

improvement of demand conditions in the labor market for blacks cannot account

for the growth in black dropout rates. These figures are mirrored in high and

growing unemployment rates for blacks of all ages.

     Not only is this dropout phenomenon a potential sign of distress in the

black community   but   it   also signals the possibility of an important problem cha:
arises in comparing the earnings and occupational positions of blacks with

whites. Earnings and occupation data are only collected for labor force

participants. More precisely, the published wage and salary data count only

those persons employed in one year who were also employed in March of the

following year. As the fraction of blacks in the labor force declines and as

more blacks enter the unstable marginal worker category and are excluded from

the standard statistics, the available evidence on black status becomes

increasingly unreliable since more blacks than whites are entering marginal

status. One theme of this paper is that a substantial portion of the measured

relative wage growth of black males is due to their differential rate of


                                            7
om.ss1.on trom cne pubi.snec stac.sCi.cs.       flie omitted worers are the Low wage

workers and the growing rate of omission of blacks relative to whites has led to

an artifical acceleration in the measured rate of black progress. Iii short, the

"evidence" cited by Freeman and Watcenberg and Scammon is flawed.

     There are ocher signs that all is not well in the black community. Table 6

gives statistics on the real income gap between black and white families. It

has grown in absolute terms since 1959 and the ratio has barely changed. This

phenomenon arises in part from the growth of female headship among black

families coupled with the near constancy of real incomes in black female

households.

     Although the percentage of blacks living in poverty has greatly decreased

since 1959, a substantial portion of this decline is due to increased cash

transfers and not the growth of employment income. As transfer programs began

to be cut back in the Carter administration in 1977, the proportion of blacks
                                                                             -
living in poverty began to increase.

     Different   scholars looking at different measurements of black economic

status currently hold widely divergent views on the efficacy of policy. As

recently as March, 1985 in an issue of Public Interest, Freeman continues to

argue chat affirmative action plans have "worked." Other scholars, such as

Finis Welch of UCLA   argue   just as vehemently that they have not.

     This lack of agreement in the research community inspires little confidence

in the public at large. It is disappointingly coon to observe disagreements

among social scientists over issues of public policy. The confidence of the

citizen in social science has diminished greatly since 1965. To empirical

social scientists who believe that data can be used to settle rather inflame

controversies, the apparent divergence between conflicting views on the role of

government is very disturbing.

     Overstatement and oversimplification ar. well rewarded activities both


                                            8
inside and outside of academic life. Simple monolithic stories in which

government does good or evil are easily grasped and attract political and

financial support from partisan groups. The incentives for telling such stories

are strong and the public has difficulty in assessing their merit because of the

lack of access to data and the complexity of the statistical methods required to

analyze it.

     The rejection of social science knowledge on this issue is premature.

There is real knowledge about the impact of government on black status but   the
correct story does not accord with the simplistic ones told in the popular press

or by the "think tanks" of the right or left whose commissioned authors

selectively read the data to suit their purposes.

     There is also real ignorance, however, that remains to be filled by better

studies. Separattng out fact from fiction is an essential, if tedious, aspect

of making studies of the impact of government on the status of blacks an

intellectually respectable activity.

     When we confine ourselves to the available data and recognize how it is

generated and what it really measures and when empirical realities are separated

from theoretical possibilities a richer, more ambiguous, picture of the role of

government on the status of blacks emerges than is portrayed •in the popular

literature.

     In the rest of this paper I want to separate out hard knowledge from

circumstantial knowledge and no knowledge at all.   I want to stick to the facts

and attempt to separate out hard empirical evidence from a rioristic reasoning

that dominates many popular social science discussions.

     I hope to convince you that contrary to the popular view there is a valid

empirically based social science. In addition, I want to demonstrate the

importance of understanding how the data used in recent discussions are

generated.


                                       9
     In making comparisons between black and white incomes and black and white

occupational status of the sort presented in Figures 1 and 2, and Tables 1 and

2, it is important to notice that these are derived for workers in the labor

force.

         An important but neglected feature of the social statistics of the sort

used in the recent debate over the effects of policy is that since the mid-60s,

black participation in the civilian labor force has been declining. Figure 8

documents that the dropout rate for blacks has been increasing at a more rapid

rate than for whites. By 1982, more than 12% of prime age black males are not

in the work force and do not contribute to the earnings statistics used to

measure black progress. The difficulty with the published statistics cited by

Freeman and others is that they exclude such individuals.

     This exclusion is in addition to the now widely acknowledged urtdercount of

blacks- -especially poor blacks- -which has attracted considerable attention in

the literature and is the basis for the recent city of Detroit suit against the

U.S. Census. (See the discussion in the Journal of the American Statistical

Assocatiott, vol. 80, *398, pp, 98-132, March, 1985). There is growing evidence

of an undercount of blacks, especially economically marginal blacks.

     As previously noted, this decline in black prime age male labor force

activity taken in isolation appears to be anomalous- -especially in view of

monolithic stories that speak of the decline in the U.S. discriminatory system

engineered by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. If market

opportunities were expanded for blacks they surely should have expanded their

labor force activity--yet black labor force activity declined, even for prime

age males.

     One explanation of this decline that receives strong theoretical but mixed

empirical support in the literature is that the decline in black male labor

force activity is linked to the growth in the benefits from a variety of social


                                        10
ez ogras :a: ac.e no: or.ng a sore a:::ac:i.ve a.:erna:.ve :nan

working, especially for low wage individuals.

       The War on Poverty stressed Job training but it   also   offered enhanced

income transfers. Benefits for all sorts of social programs exanded

dramatically as Figures 9 and 10 and tables 3 and 6 reveal. Some of these

programs discouraged labor force activity. Participation in disability payments

programs- -given to individuals who suffer from work related disabilities- -

expanded greatly as benefit levels rose and eligibility standards were lowered.

(See   Table   3). Participation in these programs was proportionately higher for

blacks than whites given the position of blacks in the income diszrbution.

These programs probably have had some effect on dIscouraging labor arke:

activity, but the precise magnitude of their effect is not known. Reinforcing

this effect (but on much shakIer empirical grounds) is the hypothesized effect

of the minimum wage on disemployment. The real minimum wage grew in magnitude
                                                                              -
through the late 60's and early 70's.

       However achieved, the removal of poor blacks from the statistical base car.

and does lead to an easily misinterpreted narrowing of measured black-white

income differences. The remaining working blacks ay appear to grow in ecor,orni

status relatIve to whites not because any single black s doing better but

because low wage black males are removed from the statistics.

       This account of recent history does not deny that there has been real

growth in black status relative to white status but it does argue that

measurements of the growth may be exaggerated. Reinforcing this story from the

other side is recent evidence of growing nonreporting of income by higher income

people in the statistics which constitute the base of our knowledge. Only 2% of

interviewees failed to report income in 1947 but 28% failed to report in 1982

and nonreporting rates are highest in the high income occupations. (See

Lillard, Smith and Welch, 1986) Standard imputation procedures have been shown


                                         11
to produce a downward      bias in   estimated income for such people. Because

proportionately more whites are in such occupations, this factor leads to

"convergence" that may well be spurious.

        How serious is this issue? Like so much in social science, the issue is an

empirical one. I:     is   a hard problem that has not received adequate attention.

In some eariLer work with Richard Butler of Brigham Young University (Butler and

Heckinan, 1978) I estimated a sizeable role for such statistical phenomena. The

most recent published study of this problem is one by Charles Brown of the

University of Michigan. (Quarterly Journal of Economics, 1984). Brown uses now

conventional statistical methods to correct the wage data for the effect

ofundercountirtg low wage black dropouts. Without going into the details of his

study, I direct you to Table 5. Brown reports both published black-white median

earnings for male workers over 16 and corrected estimates. His nunbers are

given in columns 1 and 2 in Table 5. In 1965. the ratio of black median

earnings to white median earnings is .576--corrected for selective removal of

low wage blacks the ratio is .558--little different.

        Now go on in that table to 1975. In that year measured black-white median

earnings is .734--a growth of .734- .576 — .158 points--a 25% gain. How much is

the real relative standing of blacks, correcting for labor market dropouts?

Turn to column two. Brown estimates this figure at .614. Correcting for labor

market dropouts, the growth in black/white median income is only .614- .558 —

.056.     Two-thirds of the measured gain is due to an underaccouncing of poor

blacks . Brown's research suggests that the evidence of Table 1 may not be due

to the decline of discrimination as much as to the elimination of the poor from

the statistics of wage earners.2



2
    The main point of Brown's paper is to demonstrate that 100% of the black wage
    growth is not due to the labor force withdrawal of blacks. His estimate of
    66% seems a bit high but even at half that figure the effect of black


                                            12
      Vi.wing th. data in this light suggests that there         may be   scope for both
the   polarization hypothesis for the lower       tail of the   black income distribution

and the affirmative action hypothesis at the upper tail. In fact, this story is

consistent with the view that scholars like William Wilson have put forth.

(Wilson, 1980) This point has relevance for the most recent analyses of black-

white status such as the one presented by Reynolds Parley in his recent book

entitled Blacks and hices. (Farley, 1985) Virtually all of his analysis of

black-white differences is conducted for samples of workers. Fancy tests and

rejects Wilson's polarization hypothesis.

      His   claim   is premature. By failing to account for the substantial missing

lower tail of the black poor, he fails to find any evidence of a worsening in

the status of poor blacks and he overstates the rate of improvement of the

economic status of black Americans.

      I do not want to exaggerate the importance of the labor market dropout

hypothesis by claiming that this phenomenon constitutes the entire explanacon

for the measured convergence in black-white status.

      The South Carolina data previously cited (Figure 3) surely indicate a

positive effect of federal policy on black employment and there are numerous

other examples. Richard Freeman's research on black professionals and the work

of his students document both the prevalence of affirmative action programs and

their impact in publicly sensitive large corporations (Leonard, 1983).

Tonetheless it      is   very easy to overstate the evidence in support of any

quantitatively significant impact of such programs on the mass of black

Americans. Indeed, many competent scholars--such as Finis Welch of UCLA and

James Smith of the Rand Corporation- -claim that there are           measured effects of

such programs on black wages although there are documented instances of some



  withdrawals on estimated wage growth would be substantial.


                                            13
z-ms :esponc1g ;o .-ecera. pressure. SmL;r an ieicn, 1978).

     The difficulty with interpreting the available evidence on the impact of

affirmative action is the inherent ambiguity of the data. There have been many

recent analyses of the impact of federal contract compliartce programs which

monitor the performance of required affirmative action programs for federal

contractors. For example, analyses of the effect of federal contracting on

black status typically consist of a comparison at a point in time between firms

with government contracts and those without. Small positive effects of firm

contract status on minority employment and occupational upgrading have been

found but it is difficult to evaluate this evidence and translate it into

measured aggregate wage or employment gains. This is so for three reasons.

     First, one theoretical reason for suggesting an upward bias in such

estimates is that firms are connected through a common labor market. If a

contractor firm bids for black labor in an attempt to meet a federally mandated

target, its actions may simply reshuffle blacks between contractors and

noncontractors. If all the gains in contractor firms are at the expense of non-

contractor firms, comparisons at a point in time will overstate true gains. In

the limit, if no black workers are attracted into the workforce as a consequence

of these programs, a comparison between contractor firms and noncontractor firms

may show a big contrast in the employment of blacks in the two sectors when

nothing but a rearrangement of a fixed workforce has occurred. This argument

suggests that comparisons between contractor and noncontractor firms at a point

in time may drastically overstate the true effect of such programs on

employment.

     Second, if all firms are bidding for contracts and the receipt of a

contract is partly a matter of luck and there are many opportunities to bid for

such contracts, and if it is costly to hire and fire workers--as much evidence

suggests it is (see Holt, Modigliani, Muth and Simon, 1960)--all firms--


                                      14
contractor or not- -would look pretty much alike at any point in time even though

all were hiring more blacks in response to affirmative action programs.

Comparisons across firms at a point in time would understate true affirmative

action effects. Given the costs of hiring and firing, the second story appears

to be more plausible than the first.

     Following firms over time might provide a better answer- -but this is easier

said than done. The problem in social statistics is that a lot of things are

going on in any socioeconomic time series and it is difficult to isolate the

impacts of a few programs.

     Third, and more cogently, there are few good measures of affirmative

action. Many time series studies following firms, states, or the country as a

whole over time, use a post-1964 time trend to measure affirmative action. The

time trend is a possible stand in for a variety of factors; the evidence on the

impact of affirmative action is largely anecdotal. The best summary of our

knowledge- -despite all of the claims pro and con- -is that we still do not know

the aggregate effect of these programs.

     Unfortunately, the incentives to take a position on such a controversial

subject are so great that the popular literature provides numerous conflicting

stories. The truth of the matter, however boring it may be, is that there is no

solid empirical evidence of harm from affirmative action- -as Murray contends- -or

of great benefit either, as Scammon and 'at:enberg or Freeman contend. The most

accurate si.umary of our knowledge is that we do not yet know.

     Neither the affirmacve action hypothesis of government impact nor the

transfer program induced labor force dropout hypothesis can account for the

regional income data displayed in Figures 4-7. Examination of these data

illustrates a danger of using highly aggregated data and the benefit of

considering more closely the constituent portions of an aggregated series.

     The pattern of relative income growth for males that emerges from these


                                       15
figures is as   follows.
     (1) In the Northwest and West regions of the United States as defined by

          the Census, there is no clear pattern of growth in relative incomes

          (Figure 4. and Figure 6).

     (2) In the North Central region there is a blip upward in the 1965 period

          that vanishes by the lace 70s.

     (3) The only steady upward trend for blacks in any region is in the South.

The uzregate 1965 blio is a consecuence of a North Central blip suverimosed

on Southern trend. The story for the South is particularly important because

more than 50% of the black population lives there. The regional pattern for

women is similar, except that for women, the ratios are above I- -suggesting

superiority for black women- -in all regions but the South long before 1964.

     The "transparent" post-1965 shift in aggregate earnings so obvious in

Figure 1 that has been the focus of so much of the discussion on relative black

status vanishes in the regional d.ata. The Southern growth of black status

begins before any 1ennedy.Johnson era legislation was        passed- -certainly   before

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.

     A main finding of recent scholarship is that the story of black wage growth

is predominately a    Southern    story. Migration per se   has   played a small role.

We are just   beginning    to understand the sources of the improvement of black

economic position in the South. The sources appear to be three in number:

     (1) A decline in agriculture and a monetization of normarket activity

          (people buying eggs rather than       raising   their own   chickens    etc.) as

          the Southern black population moved from the farm to urban and small

              town   labor   markets at a disproportionately faster rate than whites.

          Some of the decline in agriculture caused workers to drop out of the

          work force as agriculture in the South mechanized (partly in response

          to labor saving technical change).


                                           16
    (2) Growth in industry in the South. A surprising statistic to many is

         that in 1980, South Carolina is the state with the highest proportton

         of its work force in manufacturing. In joint work (}iec1an and

         Payner, 1985) we have documented that newer firms and industries

         entering the South in the 1950s in response to tax   incentives   and

         cheap labor were color blind in their hiring practices. However, the

         quantitative importance of this growth on wages and employment has not

         yet been determined.

    (3) Better investigated is the role of governmentally supplied education.

         (See Smith, 1984, Welch, 1974) The recent convergence of black-white

         education ratios is phenomenal by historical standards. Look at Table

         7 .   The left hand stde of the table records the years of birth of

         various cohorts of individuals and the mean schooling levels of each

         cohort. For example, white men born between 1906-1910 received 9.72

         years of schooling on average- -black men received almost 3½ years less

         schooling on average. The differences in years of schooling- -white

         minus black--are recorded for each sex group in Table 8. The

         narrowing of these schooling differences is monotone until the pertod

         of Jim Crow legislation in the South (1886-1915). Then the difference

         stays constant until we reach the cohorts born in late 1910s or early

         1920s. Afterward convergence in the black-white educational

         distributions is rapid.

    The story of the educational disparity between blacks and whites is a

fascinating one. beginning in the late 1880s and culminating in the early

1910s, blacks (89% of whom lived in the South) were effectively eliminated from

the political system. With their elimination from political life came a

reduction in access to governmental services. In the South at that time these

services were primarily schooling services. (See J.M. Kousser 1974)


                                      17
     This period of exclusion was precisely the period in which Southern public

schooling was being developed. The Plessy . Ferguson              decision   of 1896

sanctioned "separate but equal" schools. In reality the schooling was not equal

and ironically only became so at the time of the 1954 Brown vs. Topeka Board of

Education   decision. Tables 9 and 10        document this inequality. Blacks          schools

met for fewer days   per    year (panel A, Table 9, 97 days for blacks vs. 143 days

for whites in 1929-1930). Classroom size was bigger, teacher salaries lower,

and pupil expenditures were lower in black schools--look at panel C.

     Particularly eye-opening is Table 10 which documents the discrepancy

between black and   white   per pupil schooling expenditure in school year 1908-1909

in Mississippi.    Cohorts born during the peak of the Jim         Crow era   (1886-1915)

did not experience any convergence in years of schooling completed. In

addition, each year of schooling was less valuable for blacks because there was

less teacher input and fewer schooling days in more crowded schools.

     These cohorts of black workers dominate the aggregate statistics on

earnings until recently. James Smith (1984) argues that part of the post 1964

convergence of black/white status is due to the retirement of these cohortsof

poorly educated workers from the labor force. These cohorts dominate the data

until the   l960s. This retirement phenomenon was particularly pronounced in the

South and helps explain the Southern time series growth.3

     Part of the Southern story     of   wage convergence then, is a story      of
foverrmental discrimination by states with long lasting consequences. Although

this hypothesis cannot explain the "jump"         in   the aggregate data that has been

the object of so much analysis,      it is   important to recall that the "jump"        goes
away in the regional   data except     in the North Central region.




  This is my interpretation      and   not Smith's. Smith does    not   perform an analysis
  of regional aggregates.


                                             18
     Although the history of exclusion of blacks from schooling is a sorry one,

the evidence assembled by Smith is fundamentally optimistic. His evidence

contradicts- -albeit by a negative example- -   the claims of Freeman and Murray that
government educational policies have had little effect on black status. Over

the longer run, they have an important effect.

     Let me conclude by summarizing the main points of this paper.

     (1) Government has had an impact on the status of blacks and its impact

          has not always been negative. The evidence clearly shows that

          educational policies toward blacks have played an important role in

          elevating the economic status of blacks over time. The evidence on

           the importance of training and education on black status is not as

           inconsequential as many would have it.

     (2) Some policies have had unintended negative effects. The available

           fraentary evidence suggests that some transfer programs may have had

           the negative effect of removing labor force incentives and stimulating

          the formation of female headed families.

     (3) Very little reliable information is available about negative or

          positive effects of affirmative action programs on the status of

          blacks. Our evidence on this issue is at best anecdotal.

     (4) A major theme of this paper is the importance of looking closely at

           the d.ata introduced into popular discussions and examining how they

          have been generated. The aggregate statistics on the time series of

          black status mask important regional differences and obscure

          developments in the South which have played and continue Co play an

           .mportanc role in elevating the status of blacks. The evidence from

           the South indicates that naive claims of the importance of the 1964

          Civil Rights Acts do not receive support in the data since wages began

           to systematically increase in the region long before passage of this


                                        19
           law. We have also seen that       the   system of social statistIcs frcm

           which we draw our data on black status do not properly account for

           lower wage blacks. Part of the measured convergence of black status

           to white status (in relative terms) is simply due to the face ch:

           poor blacks have been eliminated from the social accounti.ig system.

           This evidence casts a very different light on the recent measured

           convergence.

Finally,

     (5) There exists no satisfactory monolithic overriding explanation of the

           recent economic history of black Americans. Current claims in the

           popular literature   about the net       good or evil of government programs

           are   not based on firm   empirical     evidence.

                    Government activity has played an important, but not       exclusl;e,
           role   in shaping black economic status. By no means has it always been

           harmful.   And 'when it has been harmful- -as in the case of the

           exclusion of black from Southern schooling- -the       policy   lessons to   be

           drawn   indicate a real potential for interventions with positive

           effects.
