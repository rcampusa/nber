Calculating Disease-Based Medical Care Expenditure Indexes for Medicare Beneficiaries:
A Comparison of Method and Data Choices

NBER Working Paper No. 19720
December 2013, Revised August 2014
JEL No. I1

                                            ABSTRACT

Diseasebased medical care expenditure indexes are currently of interest to measurement economists
and have been the subject of several recent papers. These papers, however, produced widely different
results for medical care inflation and also varied in the datasets and methods used, making comparison
difficult. In this paper, using two data sources and two different methods for calculating expenditure
indexes for the Medicare population, we compare the indexes produced and establish some results
that will help guide policymakers in choosing indexes for this population. We compare two methods:
the primary diagnosis method and a regressionbased method. The former is preferable because of
its transparency but makes stringent demands of the data. We find that when the methods are applied
to the same datasets, the primary diagnosis method produces higher average annual aggregate growth
rates. The difference implies that the regressionbased method should therefore be employed with caution
and only when necessary. We also compare medical care expenditure indexes produced from the Medicare
Current Beneficiary Survey and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The MEPS is the only dataset
with diagnoses attached to drug events, which significantly affects the resulting indexes. On balance,
however, the MCBS is probably the preferable dataset for Medicare beneficiaries because of its greater
sample size and its inclusion of nursing home residents. The optimal index may be a hybrid of the
primary diagnosis method applied to Medicare claims and a regressionbased index for pharmaceutical
spending. We discuss further avenues for research, such as comparing our results with indexes created
with commercial groupers, and what data to use for Medicare private plan enrollees.

1 Introduction
Inflation in the health‐care sector is usually measured by tracking the costs of patient goods and
services and how these costs change over time. Indexes to measure the cost of services are the
indexes used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Consumer and Producer Price Indexes for
services such as doctor visits and goods such as prescription drugs. The Committee on National
Statistics of the National Research Council, however, has recommended that government
statistical agencies investigate methods and data for measuring inflation in health care by
measuring the costs of treating medical conditions on the grounds that measurement in this
way will better capture changes in productivity in the health‐care sector. Papers such as
Aizcorbe and Nestoriak (2011), Dunn et al. (2012), and our previous work (Hall and Highfill
2013) followed these recommendations and found average annual growth rates for health‐care
inflation that ranged from 2.9 percent to 6.9 percent. However, the papers used different
datasets on different populations and employed different methods for splitting up health‐care
expenditure by condition, making it difficult to analyze why the results varied so much.

In this paper, we are following up on our previous work by comparing medical expenditure
indexes for the Medicare population calculated from different datasets and using different
methods. The Medicare program plays a very large role in the US healthcare system, in the
federal budget, and in the US economy. In calendar year 2012, the program covered 50.8
million people (42.2 million aged and 8.6 million disabled). Medicare spending comprised about
one‐fifth of national health care spending in the 2012 National Health Expenditure Accounts
(Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services). According to the Congressional Budget Office
(CBO), outlays on Medicare were 17% of total federal outlays in 2013 and the CBO expects the
aging of the population and rising health‐care costs, through their effect on Medicare spending,
to be major factors in the projected increase in the deficit later this decade (CBO 2014, CBO
2013). Finally, outlays on Medicare were 3.5% of US gross domestic product in 2013 (CBO
2014). Accurately measuring inflation in the spending of Medicare beneficiaries is therefore
important both for more precise measurement of the economy and for better understanding of
the value of a large fraction of public spending.



                                                    2
Several Medicare program datasets are available, each with unique characteristics that present
measurement challenges. In this paper, we compare two major data sources on Medicare
beneficiaries: the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) and the Household Component
of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Both surveys are conducted by the
Department of Health and Human Services. The MCBS surveys Medicare beneficiaries
exclusively while the MEPS Household Component surveys US residents living in the community
(that is, not in institutions such as nursing homes) about their health care and spending.

By necessity, our comparison focuses on the potential indexes for Medicare beneficiaries
enrolled in fee‐for‐service (FFS) Medicare, for whom the most complete data exists. Medicare
private‐plan enrollees are, however, making up an increasing share of Medicare enrollment but
the data for them is much less comprehensive. In the MCBS, the only source for their spending,
diagnoses and medical events is the in‐person survey but as we shall see, the survey asks about
a limited set of diagnoses and some important ones would be omitted if we based their
expenditure index on the MCBS survey. However, the Medicare private plan sample in the
MEPS is quite small, only about 300 to 400 beneficiaries per year.

Using the MCBS and MEPS, we compare two methods for calculating medical expenditure
indexes: the primary diagnosis method and a regression‐based approach. The primary diagnosis
method simply assigns spending to the illness associated with the diagnosis code (or first
diagnosis code in the case of multiple diagnosis codes) of each claim or survey‐collected
medical event. The regression‐based approach regresses individual annual health‐care spending
on dummy variables for a beneficiary’s diagnosed medical conditions, and divides up each
beneficiary’s health‐care spending on that basis.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives background on the concept of a disease‐
based medical care expenditure index. Section 3 introduces the various methods available for
producing medical care expenditure indexes. Section 4 introduces the datasets available for
Medicare beneficiaries. Section 5 introduces our full matrix of comparisons, compares the
methods, and draws some conclusions about the methods. Section 6 compares the datasets
and draws some conclusions about the datasets. Section 7 concludes.

2 Medical Care Expenditure Indexes

Medical care expenditure indexes (MCE indexes) measure inflation in health‐care spending by
measuring the changes in the costs of treating individual illnesses. This approach contrasts with
that of the official health‐care price indexes, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the
Producer Price Index (PPI), which measure the change in price over time of specific health‐care
services, such as doctor’s visits. Early papers that used MCE indexes such as Cutler et al. (1998),
Shapiro et al. (2001), and Berndt et al. (2002) argued that measuring health‐care inflation with
MCE indexes was more meaningful since it took into account shifts in utilization from one
service category to another as the technology of treating a particular disease improves and
becomes more efficient. Examples include shifting from psychotherapy to prescription drugs in
the treatment of psychiatric illnesses and shifting surgeries from inpatient to outpatient
procedures. Health‐care inflation, when measured in this way, often turns out to be lower than
inflation as measured by service price indexes (SPI) such as the CPI or PPI. For example, Cutler
et al. found that the measured price change of treating a heart attack was lower than an SPI by
three percentage points annually. For more on these issues, see Berndt et al. (2000) and
National Research Council (2002).

Cutler et al. and Berndt et al. constructed quality‐adjusted expenditure indexes for individual
conditions (heart attacks and major depression respectively). Quality adjustment of
expenditure indexes in the health‐care context entails connecting shifts in treatments with
changes in health outcomes. This adjustment requires high‐quality data on individual
treatments and outcomes and papers such as Aizcorbe and Nestoriak (2010) and Dunn et al.
(2012) that constructed expenditure indexes for a broad set of illnesses did not adjust for
changes in health outcomes when comparing MCE indexes to SPIs like the CPI. Both papers
found that health‐care inflation was lower when measured by MCE indexes than by SPIs even
though the MCE indexes were not quality‐adjusted. In this paper, we will only present MCE
indexes that are not quality‐adjusted.

3 Methods

Individuals seeking medical care are often diagnosed with more than one disease; a central
problem in the creation of MCEs is how to divide expenditures among multiple diagnoses.
Several different methods have been proposed and used in prior papers. It should be noted
that economic theory is no guide on methodology in this area and there is no true way of
validating any of the methods. Brief descriptions of the methods available to us follow here and
the results of the previous papers are summarized in Table 1.

3.1 Regression‐based method: This method models total individual annual health‐care
spending as a function of each individual’s diagnoses during that year and uses the parameter
values to divide the individual’s health‐care spending among his or her diagnoses. Then
individual spending on conditions is averaged to give mean expenditures which are the inputs
to an MCE index. Health‐care spending has certain characteristics that make it challenging to
model econometrically: spending is non‐negative, there are a large number of observations
with zero spending, and the distribution of spending is typically skewed with a long right‐hand
tail. Modeling health‐care spending is the subject of an extensive literature (Duan 1983,
Manning 1998, Jones 2000, Manning and Mullahy 2001, Buntin and Zaslavsky 2004). The
consensus is that health‐care spending should be transformed (with a log or square root
transformation) to accommodate its skewness. Either a one‐part or two‐part model, where the
probability of having spending at all is modeled in a separate step, may be used. The
parameters may be estimated with either ordinary least squares (OLS) or a generalized linear
model (GLM). Buntin and Zaslavsky (2004) investigate the modelling of the spending of
Medicare beneficiaries in particular. Their recommendation is to estimate with GLM with the
mean‐variance relationship established with a Park test (Park 1966). Following the results of a
Park test, we estimate the following equation with a one‐step GLM, with a log link and the
standard deviation proportional to the mean (a gamma distribution):


                                 ln




                                               5
In this equation, i indexes the individual beneficiary, j indexes the conditions, yi is each
beneficiary’s annual health‐care spending, and Dij is an indicator variable for whether individual
i has condition j.

Since we are fitting log spending, we cannot use the resulting coefficients to directly find the
average spending on each condition. Instead, we use a method for using parameter estimates
from a model of the log of health‐care spending to assign spending to conditions originally
proposed by Trogdon et al. (2008). In this method, each individual’s spending is divided up into
their diagnosed conditions in proportion to the regression coefficients. A share of spending is
calculated for each beneficiary‐illness combination as follows:

                                           exp       1 ∗
                                       ∑     exp        1 ∗


The shares are then applied to each individual’s spending to give that individual’s spending on
each condition with which he or she is diagnosed. Then the average expenditure for each
condition is calculated across individuals. These average expenditures are analogous to prices in
a price index and are the inputs to the MCE indexes. We combine them with the diagnosed
prevalences for each condition (which are analogous to quantities in a price index) and
calculate the MCE indexes as Fisher indexes in the usual manner.

The regression‐based method has the advantage that it does not make huge demands of the
data, compared to the other methods discussed here: it only requires individual annual medical
spending and dummy variables for whether or not the individual was diagnosed with a certain
condition that year. The primary disadvantage is that the method of assignment of spending to
particular diagnoses is not based on any theory or model that relates health‐care spending to
conditions diagnosed.

3.2 Primary diagnosis: This method is used in Aizcorbe et al. (2011). With this method, the
spending attached to a claim or medical event is assigned to the diagnosis or the first diagnosis,
if there are multiple diagnoses, attached to that claim or event. In some sense, the primary
diagnosis method is preferable to all others because the connection between spending and


                                                 6
diagnosis is transparent and not dependent on an econometric model of health‐care spending.
This method requires, however, that every claim or event have a diagnosis attached to it. Other
than the MEPS, the datasets being considered for the Medicare population do not have a
diagnosis attached to every claim or event; the survey events collected by the Medicare Current
Beneficiary Survey that are not in the Medicare claims (such as drug events and all medical
events for Medicare private plan enrollees) do not have diagnoses attached to them and the
Medicare Part D claims do not have diagnoses attached to them either.

A further difference between the two methods to keep in mind is that they measure slightly
different costs. The regression‐based method measures the net cost of a condition; that is, the
average difference in spending between a beneficiary with the condition and one without. The
net cost of a condition can be negative and we found in Hall and Highfill (2013) that several
conditions from the MCBS in‐person survey, such as Alzheimer’s disease, had negative
coefficients in the regression and were therefore assigned negative costs. With the primary
diagnosis method, all conditions have positive costs. If there are more beneficiaries with, for
example, Alzheimer’s disease, the per‐patient expenditures of other conditions that are
comorbid with Alzheimer’s disease will be lower in the primary diagnosis while they would, in
theory, be unaffected in the regression‐based method. This is another reason for preferring the
primary diagnosis method since price indexes in other sectors generally do not allow goods or
services with negative prices.

3.3 Commercial grouper: Several private companies have developed commercial software for
grouping medical spending by episode of illness based on clinical knowledge. These packages
are used in Aizcorbe and Nestoriak (2011), Dunn et al. (2012), and Aizcorbe et al. (2011) to
create expenditure indexes for medical care. Aizcorbe and Nestoriak (2011) use one on medical
claims data from private employer‐sponsored health insurance plans collected by Pharmetrics,
Inc., and Dunn et al. (2012) use one on the MarketScan database, a similar dataset of medical
claims collected by Truven Health Analytics. Aizcorbe et al. (2011) use a commercial grouper on
the MEPS data. The main advantage of these packages over the primary diagnosis method is
that they are able to assign spending associated with claims, such as drug claims, that do not



                                              7
have a diagnosis attached directly to them. In addition, unlike the annual regression‐based
method, they are able to separate out multiple episodes of the same illness occurring in one
year. Depending on the package, they are also able to assign a severity level to the illness.
However, their methods are proprietary and therefore completely opaque to the economist
using them. We will not be considering groupers in our comparisons in this paper but may study
them in future work.

4.1.1 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS): The MCBS is a survey of the demographics,
diagnosed conditions, health status, and total medical spending of a representative sample of
Medicare beneficiaries. It is conducted by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the
agency that operates Medicare. As it samples from the universe of Medicare beneficiaries, it
includes both FFS Medicare beneficiaries and those enrolled in Medicare private plans, and


                                                10
both beneficiaries residing in the community and in institutions such as nursing homes. The
medical conditions portion of the survey takes place once a year, towards the end of the year,
and in it, the respondent is asked whether they have been told by a doctor if they have each of
about 30 conditions. Health‐care spending and medical events are also collected directly from
the respondent on a regular basis. For FFS beneficiaries, the Part A and Part B claims with dollar
amounts and diagnosis codes are also attached to the survey so there are two sources of
diagnoses and spending for these beneficiaries. The MCBS reconciles the orally reported events
and the claims so that spending and events are not duplicated in the final version of the
dataset. For private plan enrollees, the only source of information is the spending, events, and
diagnoses reported in the in‐person survey.

4.1.2 Medicare claims: Part A (hospital) and Part B (doctor) claims are available for a 5%
random sample of Medicare beneficiaries from CMS for research purposes. In addition, starting
in 2006, a sample of Part D claims are available for those 50‐60% of FFS beneficiaries in the 5%
who are on Part D. In this paper, rather than showing calculations from the full 5% sample, we
will evaluate Medicare claims data by using the Medicare claims data tied to the MCBS.

4.1.3 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS): The MEPS is a nationally representative
survey of healthcare coverage, utilization, and expenditures for the civilian non‐institutionalized
U.S. population. It is conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The survey sample is drawn from the respondents of
the prior year’s National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and includes both fee‐for‐service and
private plan Medicare beneficiaries living in the community (that is, not in a nursing home or
other institution). Using an overlapping panel design, each household is surveyed over the
course of two years in five rounds of interviews. The family member most knowledgeable
about the entire household’s health and health care use is interviewed. Observations are
collected and reported for every medical event and may contain up to four diagnoses
each. The MEPS also collects data from a sample of respondents' providers to verify use of
services, charges and sources of payments, and diagnoses.




                                                11
Table 3 compares the spending of all Medicare FFS beneficiaries in the MCBS, Medicare FFS
beneficiaries in the MCBS who are living in the community, and Medicare FFS beneficiaries in
the MEPS (who all reside in the community). As it shows, mean spending by Medicare
beneficiaries in the MEPS is quite a bit lower than that of similar Medicare beneficiaries in the
MCBS. Zuvekas and Olin (2009) conduct a detailed comparison of full‐year Medicare
beneficiaries residing in the community in the MEPS, those same beneficiaries’ Medicare
claims, and similar beneficiaries in the MCBS in the years 2002‐2003. They find that the ratio of
mean spending of beneficiaries in the MEPS to that of similar beneficiaries in the MCBS to be
0.81. We find a similar result; as table 3 shows, the ratio of the spending of full‐year Medicare
beneficiaries living in the community in our analytic sample from the MEPS to that of similar
beneficiaries in our sample from the MCBS ranges between 0.69 and 0.80 over the period
studied. Our MCBS sample includes claims by separately billing labs, which that of Zuvekas and
Olin does not, which may explain the slightly lower ratio. Zuvekas and Olin find that about half
of the gap is due to underreporting of spending by respondents to the MEPS, and about half is
due to the absence of higher‐expenditure cases in the MEPS. We also find an absence of higher‐
expenditure cases in the MEPS as compared to the MCBS; as table 3 shows, both the skewness
coefficient for the distribution of spending and the value of the maximum observation are
generally much higher in the MCBS, implying a longer tail in that distribution. Unfortunately, we
have no way of adjusting for underreporting and the absence of more expensive cases in the
MEPS but simply note that they may be factors in any differences we observe between the
MEPS and the MCBS.

4.2 Prevalence

In this section, we discuss issues relating to how treated prevalence of medical conditions is
measured in the datasets we are using since it has important implications for the resulting
expenditure index. To see this, consider that total health‐care spending in a population can be
expressed as a sum over conditions:

where j indexes conditions, Pj is the average amount spent to treat condition j and Nj is the
number of people treated for condition j. Nj divided by the total population is the treated
prevalence for that condition.

Pj is the object of concern when we are calculating an expenditure index; however, the data we
use have total spending and Nj as given and we must infer Pj with one of the various methods
that will be discussed further down. In addition, as is standard in a Fisher index formula, treated
prevalences are used to weight the indexes for the individual conditions when they are
aggregated into an expenditure index for medical care as a whole. Differences in methods for
collecting conditions from respondents will therefore lead to different results in the resulting
expenditure indexes.

4.2.1 Treated prevalence in the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey

The first issue we note is the differences in the MCBS between survey‐based prevalences and
claims‐based prevalences. The survey‐based prevalences in the MCBS are based on the annual
survey administered to all respondents. In this survey, respondents who live in the community
are asked if they have been told by a doctor in the past year if they have each of about 30
conditions. For respondents who are residing in nursing homes, the MCBS has a nursing home
staff member fill out a questionnaire about conditions based on the respondent’s nursing home
and medical records. The claims‐based prevalences are based on the respondent’s Part A
(hospital) and Part B (physician) Medicare claims. The claims are only available for respondents
who are enrolled in fee‐for‐service (FFS) Medicare and not for respondents enrolled in
Medicare private plans.

For the FFS beneficiaries in the MCBS therefore, we have both sets of diagnoses for the same
beneficiaries and can examine the degree of agreement between them. Table 4 reports
prevalences in 2001 from the MCBS survey and from the MCBS claims, as well as the percent of
beneficiaries who are indicated as having an illness in both the survey and the claims.2 First,
note that in general claims‐based prevalence is higher than survey‐based prevalence. There is

with the claims, see Appendix Table 1 in Hall and Highfill 2013.

Notes: 1. Refer to Appendix Table 1 in Hall and Highfill 2013 to see how illnesses from the MCBS survey were translated into
ICD‐9 codes to compare with the claims data.
2. Prevalences are weighted by the MCBS survey weights.
also quite a bit of disagreement between the two sources of diagnoses and the agreement rate
is often less than half of either the survey‐based prevalence or the claims‐based prevalence.
When weighted by prevalence, the overlap rate divided by the claims‐based prevalence
averages about 40 percent and the overlap rate divided by the survey‐based prevalence
averages about 62 percent. One possible cause of disagreement in prevalence between the
survey and the claims may come from the lack of drug‐related diagnoses in the claims data. As
mentioned above, the claims data attached to the MCBS only include doctor and hospital
claims. There are no prescription drug claims, even for beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Part D
after 2006 and, in any case, prescription drug claims generally do not include diagnoses.
Beneficiaries may therefore have chronic illnesses for which they are taking prescription drugs
regularly and which they report on the survey but either they did not have a non‐drug event
related to the condition during the survey year or these conditions are not recorded by their
health‐care providers. However, some of the highest rates of agreement between survey and
claims are in illnesses for which this issue would most be of concern. There are five chronic
illnesses for whom the share of spending on pharmaceuticals is over 50 percent of total
spending on the illness: diabetes, mental/psychiatric disorder, Alzheimers/dementia,
osteoporosis, and hypertension. Agreement rates between survey‐based and claims‐based
prevalence are in fact noticeably higher for this group: the overlap rate divided by the claims‐
based prevalence has a weighted average of 63 percent and the overlap rate divided by the
survey‐based prevalence has a weighted average of 72 percent. It seems possible therefore that
the act of taking a daily drug for an illness may actually improve survey respondents’ knowledge
and memory of what diagnoses they have.

There are multiple other potential causes of the discrepancies between survey‐based and
claims‐based prevalence. The reasons that a condition might be reported in the survey but not
in the claims include beneficiary errors in the existence of illnesses, beneficiary errors in the
timing of illnesses, providers omitting to code a condition, and that the condition was treated
but the treatment was not paid for by Medicare. The reasons that a condition might be
reported in the claims but not in the survey include again beneficiary or provider error and the
provider upcoding a diagnosis. Given that claims‐based prevalence is generally higher than


                                               14
survey‐based prevalence and that the disagreement is noticeably lower for conditions for which
beneficiaries are taking a prescription drug on a regular basis, it seems likely that beneficiary
error is the largest source of disagreement. Claims‐based prevalence may therefore be a more
reliable measure of treated prevalence in the MCBS. However, as noted above, there is a
notable disadvantage to relying solely on claims data as the source data for Medicare
beneficiaries when constructing an MCE index, namely that we do not have claims for the
enrollees in Medicare private plans.

4.2.2 Treated prevalence in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey

The second problem with measuring treated prevalence in the datasets we are examining
relates to a change in the Household Component of the MEPS in 2007 in its method for relating
health care events and spending to medical conditions. In the MEPS, medical conditions are
collected up front from respondents in their initial survey. Before 2007, in the initial interview,
conditions were only reported if the respondent volunteered them in response to a general
question about medical conditions. In 2007, MEPS introduced the Priority Conditions
Enumeration section of the survey, in which respondents were asked whether they had certain
priority conditions. (This method is similar to how conditions are collected in the MCBS
throughout the entire period.) When medical events are later collected, the respondent is
prompted to relate these events to conditions that had been reported in the initial survey.

The treated prevalences from the MEPS that we use to calculate an MCE are calculated from
the medical events files and not from the conditions survey because we are primarily interested
in conditions as they relate directly to health care expenditure. However, the methodology
change in 2007 resulted in a dramatic increase in the event‐based treated prevalences of
certain conditions. Table 5 shows the treated prevalences of the priority conditions in the
Priority Conditions Enumeration file from the MEPS by year from 2001‐2009. The total
prevalence in 2007 is the top number of the three reported for each condition for that year. As
it shows, there are increases in nearly all the conditions between 2006 and 2008. There are
particularly dramatic rises in the prevalences of heart disease, arthritis, heart attacks, and
stroke, which are clearly unrelated to any pre‐existing trend in treated prevalence.


                                                15
The Priority Conditions Enumeration section was phased in with the introduction of Panel 12 of
the MEPS.3 Table 5 also shows treated prevalence by condition in 2007 split out by panel.
Treated prevalence in Panel 11 in 2007 for most conditions is comparable to treated prevalence
in 2006, while treated prevalence of most conditions in Panel 12 in 2007 is more similar to
treated prevalence as measured in 2008, reflecting the methodology change that affected
Panel 12 but not Panel 11. The differences between Panels 11 and 12 in treated prevalence are
especially noticeable for the conditions mentioned above that have the greatest increases in
treated prevalence. For example, the treated prevalence of heart disease is more than four
times higher in Panel 12 than in Panel 11, and that of arthritis is more than five times higher.
Similarly, the treated prevalence of myocardial infarction is more than four times higher in
Panel 12 than Panel 11. The methodology change also helps explain part of the increases in
treated prevalence of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, two conditions with treated
prevalence that are both high and trending up over this period. Panel 12 has a treated
prevalence of hypertension in 2007 that is over five percentage points higher than that of Panel
11, and for hypercholesterolemia the difference is just over ten percentage points.

In our MEPS‐based MCE indexes, in order to have growth rates that are at least measured over
consistent samples, we use the growth rate calculated from Panel 11 alone for the change from
2006 to 2007, and the growth rate calculated from Panel 12 alone for the change from 2007 to
2008. The expenditure indexes based on the MEPS are therefore not strictly comparable before
and after 2007, but this solution is the best we can do with the data available. The effect of
implementing this change on one of the MCE indexes we calculate is shown in Figure 1. This
MCE index is calculated from the MEPS on all Medicare beneficiaries using the primary
diagnosis method. (See below for a discussion of this method for calculating MCE indexes.) As
the figure shows, using the growth rate from Panel 11 for the change from 2006 to 2007 and
the growth rate from Panel 12 for the change from 2007 to 2008 removes an unusual drop in
the MCE index in 2007 that is out of line with the underlying trend.

5 Comparisons of Different Methods for Calculating Medical Care Expenditure
Indexes

As was shown in the previous two sections, we have a choice of methods and datasets available
to us to calculate medical expenditure indexes for the Medicare population, although not every
method will work with every dataset. Table 6 lays out the possible combinations of methods
and datasets and shows the average annual growth rates of Fisher medical care expenditure
indexes calculated from those methods and datasets for the years 2001‐2009. The columns
represent different combinations of samples (FFS and private plan, FFS only), datasets (MCBS or
MEPS) and sets of illnesses, and the rows of the table represent different methods (regression‐
based or primary diagnosis, with or without drug spending). The illnesses used are either the 27
illnesses from the MCBS survey (see Hall and Highfill 2013 for a list and detailed discussion) or
the 260 categories from the Clinical Classifications System (CCS), a system devised by the AHRQ
for classifying the 10,000 or so ICD‐9 diagnosis codes used in claims datasets into medical
conditions. In one column we use 27 CCS diagnoses that correspond to the MCBS survey
diagnoses; see Appendix Table 1 in Hall and Highfill (2013) for a crosswalk that translates survey
diagnoses into claims diagnoses. For ease of comparison across years, when creating the FFS‐
only sample, we restricted the sample to beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare for the full calendar
year. The downside of this approach is that we lose beneficiaries who pass away during the
year and who are responsible for a good part of total Medicare spending.

The cells in the table are labeled with letters for ease of reference. As described above in
section 3, the regression‐based indexes are based on a GLM model of the log of health‐care
spending as a function of diagnoses. For most of the regression‐based indexes, a beneficiary is
coded as having a condition if the associated diagnosis code appears in any diagnosis variable
but for the indexes whose references end in 2 (H2, I2, and M2), the diagnosis codes were only
counted if they appeared as a primary diagnosis in order to make those indexes more
comparable to the primary diagnosis analyses. As described in section 4, the growth rates of the
MEPS indexes from 2006 to 2007 are only calculated from Panel 11 while those of the MEPS




                                               17
indexes from 2007 to 2008 are only calculated from Panel 12, in order to adjust for the
methodology change in collecting conditions from respondents in the MEPS in 2007.

As Table 6 shows, the MCE indexes show a range of average annual growth rates, from 1.4
percent to 6.4 percent per year. In general, average annual growth rates are higher in the
indexes based on the MEPS than in those based on the MCBS, and are higher when calculated
with the primary diagnosis method than with a regression‐based method. The growth rates in
the indexes based on the MCBS are lower when drug spending is omitted, but those in indexes
based on the MEPS are higher when drug spending is omitted; we will discuss this result further
below.

Table 7 shows the growth rates of some selected indexes by year. There is a significant amount
of volatility in the growth rates from year to year. In addition, there is surprisingly little
correlation in yearly movements between the datasets with the exception that all indexes have
strongly positive growth rates in 2003. There is some correlation in yearly movements between
the two indexes constructed from the MCBS claims as the two indexes always move in the same
direction but little correlation among the indexes constructed from the MEPS.

The first step in our comparisons is to compare the price indexes obtained using the regression‐
based method with the primary diagnosis method when we use them on the same samples and
the same illnesses. As noted above, the primary diagnosis method is probably preferable but
can only be used when the data meet its stringent requirements. The main purpose of this
comparison therefore is to see if the regression‐based method gives similar or very different
results from the primary diagnosis method and if it is an adequate substitute for the primary
diagnosis method when the data do not have a diagnosis attached to each event or claim.

There are three pairs of analyses to compare, as summarized in Table 8 which shows their
average annual growth rates from 2001‐2009 as reported in Table 6:

Notes: 1. The growth rates for the expenditure indexes based on the MEPS for 2006‐2007 were calculated solely from Panel 11; those for 2007‐2008 were
calculated solely from Panel 12. 2. In most of the regression‐based indexes, a beneficiary was counted as having a condition if the condition appeared in any
diagnosis variable in the claims. In the indexes ending in 2 (M2, H2 and I2), a diagnosis was only counted if it was the primary diagnosis in order to make the
indexes more comparable to the primary diagnosis analyses.

As the table shows, the primary diagnosis method produces higher growth rates for the MCE
indexes. The difference is over a percentage point for the indexes based on the MEPS and
almost a percentage point for the index based on the MCBS.

Table 9 examines the similarity of the two methods in measuring the per‐patient expenditures
of individual conditions. It shows the correlations in per‐patient expenditure assigned to
conditions by the two methods, both in their level (averaged over 2001 and 2009) and in their
annualized growth rates from 2001 to 2009. As the table shows, the correlations between the
levels of per‐patient expenditures are strongly positive. They are especially high in the two
MEPS comparisons, at over 80%, but slightly lower for the MCBS comparison where the
correlation is about 68%. The correlations between the growth rates in per‐patient
expenditures are much lower. They are still positive in the two MEPS comparisons but are
essentially zero for the MCBS comparison.

Table 10 shows the annualized net growth rates of per‐patient expenditures from 2001 to 2009
for a selection of individual conditions. The conditions shown are the union of the sets of the
top ten conditions by per capita spending in 2001 and 2009 for each dataset and method
combination shown. As suggested by the results in Table 9, there is little similarity in growth
rates across methods applied to the same data. The table shows that, in general, the
regression‐based method produces more extreme growth rates, both positive and negative,
than the primary diagnosis method. The regression‐based method can produce particularly
extreme growth rates when combined with the MCBS claims data, as in the case of “deficiency
and other anemia”, ”aortic and peripheral arterial embolism or thrombosis”, and “other

disorders of stomach and duodenum.” In addition, as we noted above, table 9 shows that the
correlation in results between the two methods is noticeably smaller for the MCBS claims data
than for the MEPS data. These results are probably due to the greater sensitivity of the
regression‐based method to outliers combined with the greater presence of outliers in the
MCBS claims data as shown above in table 3. As we discussed in the introduction to the
methods section, there is no reason to use the regression‐based method with data where it is
possible to use the primary diagnosis method, and the evidence in this table supports that
claim. In situations where it is necessary to use the regression‐based method, the individual and
aggregate growth rates of the MCE indexes should be interpreted with caution.

It is unclear why the primary diagnosis method consistently produces higher growth rates than
the regression‐based method. There is no reason to expect it a priori to do so. The difference is
widespread across conditions; as Table 10 shows, the primary diagnosis method produces
higher growth rates for just over half of the thirty conditions, and the relationship holds for
both chronic and acute conditions. Of the full set of conditions, about half have a higher growth
rate in their MCEs when estimated with the primary diagnosis method.

In conclusion, it seems that the regression‐based method should be employed with caution,
given its sensitivity to outliers and propensity for producing volatile indexes. In addition, as we
discussed above, the regression‐based method has the undesirable feature that it can assign
negative costs to some conditions. However, it may be necessary to use it with data where
events are not assigned diagnoses individually. It should be noted that, while we presented one
regression‐based approach, there is a considerable amount of discretion in how this approach
can be applied, both in the modeling of spending as a function of diagnoses and in how the
coefficients are used to divide up individuals’ health‐care spending. One potential approach
going forward therefore may be to adjust the regression‐based approach until the results
match the primary diagnosis method within a certain level of tolerance in the MEPS data, and
then apply that adjusted approach to the larger sample and larger targeted population of the
MCBS. Another approach may be to combine the two methods: use the primary diagnosis




                                                20
method on the Medicare Part A and B claims in the MCBS but use a regression‐based method
on the drug spending from the survey portion of the MCBS.




6 Comparison of Medical Care Expenditure Indexes Calculated from Different
Datasets

As Table 6 shows, we also calculated price indexes with the same methods and on comparable
populations from the MCBS and the MEPS, for the purposes of comparing the results. In
general, the MCBS or the Medicare claims are preferable datasets for analyzing the Medicare
population to the MEPS since they have larger samples, also include the nursing home
population, and do not seem to have the same underreporting issues as the MEPS. However,
comparing the datasets offers a useful check on the MEPS which has been used on other
populations in the medical‐care expenditure index literature.

Table 11 shows the pairs of cells from Table 6 that directly compare datasets with the same
method and comparable populations. The population in both cases is FFS Medicare
beneficiaries who are enrolled in Medicare for the full calendar year. In the MCBS sample, we
use claims for diagnoses so as to be able to compare on a condition‐by‐condition basis with the
MEPS, in which conditions are coded in ICD‐9 diagnosis codes. As the table shows, when drug
spending is included and we use a regression‐based method, the MCE index based on the MEPS
is slightly higher, by about 0.8 percentage point, than that based on the MCBS. When drug


                                              21
spending is omitted, however, the difference is over three percentage points, whether a
regression‐based method or the primary diagnosis method is used.

Table 12 shows the correlations in per‐patient expenditures across conditions between the
expenditure indexes calculated from the MCBS and the MEPS with the same methods. The first
column shows the correlations in the level of per‐patient expenditure averaged across 2001
and 2009; as they show, the correlations are positive but not overwhelmingly strong. The
correlations are strongest for the two indexes calculated using a primary diagnosis method
without drug spending, which is the pair with the largest difference between their annual
average growth rates. It is important to keep in mind therefore that the same method, similar
data, and similar results can still produce substantively different average annual growth rates
for an MCE index. The next column shows the correlations in the growth rates of the
expenditure indexes for individual conditions from 2001 and 2009 across the two datasets;
these are much lower and often close to zero.

Returning to table 11, we see that omitting spending and events related to pharmaceuticals
from the MCE indexes has the opposite effect on the indexes from the two datasets. The
growth rates of MCE indexes without pharmaceuticals are lower than those with
pharmaceuticals when they are calculated from the MCBS but omitting pharmaceuticals raises
the growth rates of MCE indexes based on the MEPS considerably. The difference arises from
the way pharmaceutical events are recorded in the two surveys. Pharmaceutical events are
recorded together with a diagnosis in the MEPS while in the MCBS, pharmaceutical events are
collected in the oral survey portion and are not associated with a diagnosis. In the MEPS,
dropping the pharmaceutical events can therefore change the treated prevalence of conditions,
since some conditions are only reported in pharmaceutical events. As discussed above in the
section on prevalence, a change in the growth rate of treated prevalence can affect the growth
rate of an MCE index, all other things equal, both because the per‐patient expenditure will
change and because the aggregation weights in the Fisher index will change.

When we compare an unweighted average of treated prevalences across conditions based on
drug events and the same average based on non‐drug events in the MEPS, we find that the

former grows considerably faster over the period studied. Treated prevalence based on drug
events has an average annual growth rate between 2001 and 2009 of 4.8% while that based on
non‐drug events has an average annual growth rate of 2.8%. Omitting drug events would
therefore tend to lower the growth rate of prevalence and raise the growth rate of the MCE
index, all other things equal. The other main factor affecting the difference between MCE
indexes with and without pharmaceutical spending and events is pharmaceutical spending
itself. Omitting pharmaceutical spending but not the associated diagnoses would tend to lower
the growth rate of the MCE index since pharmaceutical spending generally grows more quickly
than other categories of medical spending. In the case of these indexes based on the MEPS,
however, it appears that the changes in prevalence resulting from removing the pharmaceutical
events more than offset the change to the index resulting from removing pharmaceutical
spending.

From these comparisons we may conclude that the inclusion of pharmaceutical events in the
treated prevalence in the data can have a substantive effect on an MCE index based upon that
data; this has repercussions for the use of the MCBS as a data source for Medicare
beneficiaries. As the MCBS lacks diagnoses related to pharmaceutical events, it will omit some
conditions that beneficiaries are diagnosed with entirely and a regression‐based index will
misattribute their pharmaceutical spending to other conditions.



7 Conclusion

We have compared medical care expenditure indexes calculated from different datasets and
using different methods. Our belief going into this research was that the primary diagnosis
method was the best method for dividing up health‐care expenditure by disease but that the
Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey was the best dataset for analyzing Medicare beneficiaries,
as it has the widest coverage and the most information on them. However, the primary
diagnosis method cannot be used with the drug spending and events in the MCBS. We
therefore compared the primary diagnosis method with a regression‐based method for
estimating expenditures by disease and found that, when they are used to calculate MCE


                                              23
indexes on the same datasets, the primary diagnosis method produces higher average annual
aggregate growth rates. The difference is relatively small for the analyses with the MCBS claims
and much larger with the analyses using the MEPS. The annual indexes show some correlation
between methods in yearly movements with the MCBS data but little correlation across the
MEPS analyses, possibly because of the smaller sample size of the MEPS. There is strongly
positive correlation in the levels of per‐patient expenditures across conditions and between the
two methods but almost no correlations in the growth rates of the individual condition indexes.
The regression‐based method produces much more volatile individual indexes when applied to
the MCBS claims data, probably because its results are more sensitive to outliers and there are
more outliers in the MCBS claims data. The regression‐based method should be employed with
caution and only when necessary therefore.

We also compared medical care expenditure indexes for Medicare beneficiaries produced from
the MCBS and the MEPS. As noted above, the MCBS has greater coverage and a larger sample
size and the MEPS appears to have some problems with underreporting and underwent a
methodology change in collecting diagnoses during the time period we are studying. When
drug spending is included, however, the two datasets produce MCE indexes with very similar
average annual growth rates, the one from the MEPS being a bit higher. When drug spending is
omitted, however, the indexes from the MEPS have much higher growth rates, by more than
three percentage points. As we discuss, the difference probably comes from the fact that when
drug events are dropped from the analyses, the measurement of prevalence is affected in the
MEPS but not in the MCBS, since the MCBS lacks diagnoses for its drug events. That the
omission of drug‐related diagnoses affects the MCE indexes for Medicare beneficiaries to such
a degree is an argument in favor of using the MEPS, which attaches diagnoses to individual drug
events. On balance, however, the MCBS is probably the preferable dataset for Medicare
beneficiaries because of its greater sample size and its inclusion of nursing home residents.




                                               24
The best solution for FFS Medicare beneficiaries, in the end, may be a hybrid index: one that
combines the primary diagnosis method applied to the Part A and Part B claims in the MCBS
with a regression‐based index for pharmaceutical spending. For private‐plan beneficiaries,
however, the solution is not as clear. For this population, our choices are between a regression‐
based method run on the MCBS with only the 27 diagnoses included in the MCBS survey, or the
primary diagnosis or regression‐based method run on the small group (about 300‐400 a year) of
Medicare private‐plan enrollees in the MEPS. Exploring these options will probably be the
subject of some of our future work.

While we believe this comparison has covered the most important methods and datasets, it is
not comprehensive. In particular, we did not cover the use of commercial groupers and we did
not explore the larger sample of Medicare claims that are available for research (including the
Part D pharmaceutical claims). We hope to address these gaps in future work.
