The Impact of the Macroeconomy on Health Insurance Coverage: Evidence from the Great
Recession

                                            ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the impact of the macroeconomy on the health insurance coverage of Americans
using panel data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) for 2004-2010, a period
that includes the Great Recession of 2007-09. We find that a one percentage point increase in the
state unemployment rate is associated with a 1.67 percentage point (2.12%) reduction in the probability
that men have health insurance; this effect is strongest among college-educated, white, and older (50-64
year old) men. For women and children, health insurance coverage is not significantly correlated with
the unemployment rate, which may be the result of public health insurance acting as a social safety
net. Compared to the previous recession, the health insurance coverage of men is more sensitive to
the unemployment rate, which may be due to the nature of the Great Recession.

Introduction

          The number of Americans lacking health insurance has long been a concern of

policymakers. The uninsured tend to receive less medical care and thus be in worse health than

the insured (Finkelstein et al., 2012, Card et al., 2009; Doyle, 2005; also see the reviews in

McWilliams, 2009 and Freeman et al., 2008). Moreover, uninsured individuals are at risk of

severe financial loss, including bankruptcy, in the event of illness (Gross and Notowidigdo,

2011; Himmelstein et al., 2009). Concerns about the adverse consequences of uninsurance led

the U.S. Congress, in 2010, to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA),

which expands eligibility for public health insurance and establishes a variety of incentives for

employers to offer health insurance and for employees to take up such plans.

          The high and rising cost of providing public health insurance is a budgetary concern for

the federal and state governments (Chernew et al., 2009). The budgetary strain rises during

macroeconomic downturns, as increasing numbers of people are covered by Medicaid and the

Children’s Health Insurance Program (henceforth referred to collectively as Medicaid).

Between 2005 and 2011, the Medicaid caseload rose by 12.6 million or 33.1% (DeNavas-Walt et

al., 2012, Table C-2); it is not clear to what extent this was due to the recession or longer-run

trends.

          The economic expansion that began in November 2001 ended in December 2007, and the

ensuing recession lasted until June 2009 (NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee, 2011). This

recession, which lasted 18 months, was the longest in the United States since 1933. It was also

the most severe recession in the U.S. since World War II, as employment fell by 6.3% and output

fell by 5.1% (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, 2011).




                                                  2
         This paper estimates the impact of the macroeconomy on the number of Americans with

health insurance coverage, both overall and by source of coverage. By focusing on the recession

of 2007-09, this paper extends and builds on previous work that has examined the impact of the

macroeconomy on uninsurance during the previous (2001) recession (Cawley and Simon, 2005).

It also contributes to the larger economics literature on the consequences of the 2007-09

recession, which has been dubbed the Great Recession (e.g. Farber, 2011; Hurd and Rohwedder,

2010).

         Our primary measure of the macroeconomy is the state unemployment rate. This is the

most common measure used in the substantial literature on the macroeconomy and health (see,

e.g., the review in Ruhm, 2006). Moreover, in our previous work (Cawley and Simon, 2005) we

found that the state unemployment rate was far more predictive of insurance status than other

measures such as the gross state product or indicator variables for recession. As an extension,

we examine how results differ when we use the employment rate rather than the unemployment

rate.

         While there is a large literature on the direct effect of the macroeconomy on health (e.g.

Ruhm, 2003; Ruhm, 2000), there is relatively little published on the impact of the

macroeconomy on health insurance. Cawley and Simon (2005) examined the relationship

between state unemployment rate and the probability of health insurance coverage in the Survey

of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and estimated that 984,000 Americans, nearly all of

whom were adult men, lost health insurance due to macroeconomic conditions during the 2001

recession.    Gilmer and Kronick (2009) use data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) from

1980 to 2008 to project that the Great Recession could increase the number of uninsured

Americans by 6.9 million, but their model (which focuses on the influence of per capita health



                                                  3
spending, income, demographics and time trends) does not take into account the focus of this

paper, the unemployment rate. While there are annual national estimates of the percent and

number of Americans who are uninsured (e.g. DeNavas-Walt et al., 2012; Fronstin, 2011), there

has been no analysis of how health insurance coverage was impacted by increases in the

unemployment rate around the time of the Great Recession. Trends in annual data may reflect

the continuing long term decline in generosity of health insurance (Vistnes et al., 2012). This

paper identifies the impact of worsening macroeconomic conditions (measured by the state

monthly unemployment rate) using longitudinal data that allow us to investigate the

heterogeneity of impact by demographic characteristics.

       The relationship between unemployment rates and the probability of insurance coverage

is likely to change over time in response to changes in health insurance markets and public health

insurance programs; as a result, estimates from earlier papers may be out of date. For example,

there have been declining trends (since the peaks reached in 2000) in both employer offers of

health insurance (Vistnes et al., 2012) and employees covered through employer-sponsored

insurance (Fronstin, 2011); these secular changes may have altered the relationship between the

unemployment rate and health insurance. Moreover, each recession has distinct characteristics

that may imply a different relationship between the unemployment rate and coverage. For

example, the 2007-09 recession was characterized by a drop in home prices, which may have

inhibited unemployed workers from moving to areas with more job opportunities, a phenomenon

that some have called “house lock” (Ferreira et al., 2012). Likewise, extensions of the maximum

duration of unemployment insurance benefits from 26 to up to 99 weeks in some states may have

decreased the incentives for unemployed workers to quickly find new employment. Another

relevant change is that, in 2009, Congress instituted a time-limited 65 percent subsidy for



                                                 4
premiums associated with coverage through the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation

Act of 1985 (COBRA); this legislation gives qualifying workers and their families who would

otherwise lose their health insurance the option to temporarily extend that coverage. The new

subsidy was available for a maximum of 15 months to those who lost jobs between September

2008 and May 2010 (US DOL, 2011). By making it easier for newly unemployed workers to

continue on the health insurance plan of their former employer, these subsidies likely weaken the

correlation between the unemployment rate and the probability of health insurance.

       For these reasons, the relationship between the macroeconomy and health insurance

found in older data may not apply to the Great Recession. In addition, the severity of the Great

Recession resulted in considerable variation in unemployment rates across states and over time,

providing researchers with more power to accurately estimate the effect of the macroeconomy on

health insurance. The purpose of this paper is to exploit that variation to generate accurate and

up-to-date estimates of the impact of unemployment rates on health insurance coverage, both

overall and by source of coverage, and for the entire population as well as for specific subgroups

defined by gender, education, race, and age.



Conceptual framework

       There are several mechanisms by which a high unemployment rate can result in the loss

of employer-provided coverage. A high state unemployment rate is, by definition, associated

with a higher probability that a resident of that state is unemployed. When those who were

previously covered by employer-provided health insurance lose their jobs, they (and any

dependents on the same policy) are likely to lose coverage from the former employer for

themselves and for their dependents. Although COBRA allows eligible unemployed workers to



                                                5
temporarily purchase health insurance through their former employers, take-up rates are low

because of the high cost (Collins et al., 2011; Lambrew, 2001). Some of those losing coverage

may be able to shift to coverage provided by their spouses’ plans.

        High unemployment rates may lower the probability of employer-provided coverage even

among those who remain employed. When labor demand falls because of a poor macroeconomy,

total labor compensation will fall. If wages are costly to renegotiate, employers may reduce

compensation by shifting a greater share of health insurance costs to employees.2 Employers

may also reduce the quality of coverage or cease offering health insurance altogether (Marquis

and Long, 2001).

        Due to decreased labor demand, previously full-time workers may have their hours

reduced to the point that they are no longer eligible for health insurance benefits. The lower

labor income that accompanies higher unemployment rates could also have an income effect,

reducing private purchases of individual health insurance.

        Some individuals may gain health insurance coverage during periods of high

unemployment if their incomes fall to a level that qualifies for Medicaid. Holahan and Garrett

(2009), using CPS data from 1990-2003, estimate that an increase in unemployment of one

percentage point would expand coverage through Medicaid by 0.2 percentage points for non-

elderly adults and by 0.79 percentage points for children.

        Based on this framework and the existing literature, we hypothesize that an increase in

the unemployment rate decreases the probability of coverage through one’s own employer. We

predict that an increase in the unemployment rate increases the probability of coverage through

public health insurance. We hypothesize that, on net, unemployment rate is negatively

2
 Elasticity estimates suggest that this mechanism should result in little decline in coverage; among those offered
employer-sponsored health insurance, take-up falls by less than one-tenth of a percent when premiums increase by
one percent (Chollet and Liu, 2006).

                                                         6
correlated with the probability of health insurance coverage through any source for adults, but

that for children the sign of the net effect on coverage is ambiguous because of the availability of

public sources of coverage as family income falls.



Methods

       We estimate logit models in which the dependent variables are indicator variables for

health insurance coverage as well as for types of coverage. The regressor of interest is state

monthly unemployment rate. Models also control for respondent age, marital status, education,

and family size. All models control for both individual-specific and year-specific fixed effects;

our identification of the effect of the state unemployment rate on the probability of health

insurance coverage comes from variation within people over time in deviations of the state

unemployment rate from the national mean for that year. The research design requires that we

control for year fixed effects because even before the recession, health care costs were rising

(Chernew et al., 2009), employer offers of health insurance were declining (Vistnes et al., 2012),

and the percentage of Americans covered by employer-sponsored insurance was falling

(Fronstin, 2011). Because our data contain multiple observations of the same person over time,

we are also able to control for individual fixed effects so that our estimates are not influenced by

any time invariant unobserved characteristics that affect health insurance status. For example,

those with relatively low human capital may be less likely to be offered health insurance at their

job, and may live in areas hit particularly hard by the Great Recession. We believe

macroeconomic fluctuations to be largely exogenous, so do not think that such factors should




                                                 7
have a large influence, but think it prudent to fully exploit the richness of the longitudinal data to

eliminate the influence of any such time-invariant heterogeneity.3

         In subsequent models we control for individual employment status in order to examine

the pathways by which the macroeconomy acts on insurance status.

         After first estimating a model for men and women pooled, we estimate models separately

by gender because labor force participation and attachment and eligibility for publicly provided

health insurance may differ by gender; for example, low-income pregnant women are eligible for

Medicaid coverage. Men and women also tend to differ in the extent to which they have

dependent coverage available through a spouse. We also examine whether the relationship

between unemployment rate and insurance coverage differs across age, education, and

race/ethnic group.

         In general, when a microeconomic outcome is regressed on an aggregate regressor,

unadjusted standard errors will be biased downwards, perhaps dramatically (Moulton, 1990). To

account for the fact that our models regress individual outcomes on state-level measures of the

macroeconomy, we follow standard practice and cluster standard errors by state.

         To address the possibility of serial correlation in standard errors for observations within

states over time (Bertrand et al., 2004), we bootstrap the standard errors within our logit

specifications, selecting with replacement all observations in a particular state. Following Efron




3
  We have also estimated models without controlling for individual fixed effects and find smaller marginal effects on
the unemployment rate for men, and in some cases larger marginal effects for women. For example, the association
of a one percentage point increase in the state unemployment rate with the probability that men have coverage
through any source is -1.67 percentage points in our fixed effects model and -0.74 percentage points in a model that
does not control for fixed effects (both are statistically significant). For women, the comparable numbers are -0.50
and -0.45 (neither is statistically significant). The pattern of results is thus largely qualitatively similar whether we
control for individual fixed effects or not, and moreover, the two sets of coefficients are not statistically significantly
different from each other for 12 of the 14 cases. The results of models without controlling for individual fixed
effects are available upon request.

and Tibshirani (1993), we conduct 50 replications. As expected, this adjustment considerably

increases the standard errors.



Data: The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)

        The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) is a nationally representative

sample of Americans over the age of 15 that consists of a series of panels that are up to 4 years in

length with sample sizes ranging from approximately 12,000 to 40,000 households. The SIPP,

which started in 1984, interviews households at 4-month intervals; thus, there exist up to 12

interviews for each individual. Although each SIPP interview collects data on the current month

and, retrospectively, each of the 3 months between interviews, we use only the contemporaneous

reports in order to avoid recall error.

        This paper uses data from the 2004 and 2008 panels of the SIPP covering the period

January 2004 through November 2010 (except for January 2008 to July 2008, which are not

covered by either the 2004 or 2008 panel the SIPP), and covering all 50 states plus the District of

Columbia. There are special considerations for each of these panels. The sample for the 2004

panel was cut in half in September 2006 in response to budgetary pressures. The 2008 panel is

still in the field at the time of this writing, so only 7 waves of those data are available.

        Each SIPP wave contains information on the respondent’s insurance coverage and the

source of their coverage, for a particular month. We study the following binary outcomes in the

SIPP: whether one has health insurance coverage through any source, whether one receives

health insurance coverage through one’s own employer (this includes former employees

continuing coverage through COBRA)4, whether one receives employer-provided health


4
 Among children (aged 17 and under), 1.81% of the sample was recorded as having health insurance through their
own employer. This was more common among children aged 15 (3.27%), 16 (4.00%) and 17 (4.47%) but ranged

insurance as a dependent, whether one has individually-purchased coverage, whether one is

covered by government-provided health insurance (e.g. Medicaid or SCHIP), and whether one

has coverage through some other source (not otherwise classified in the SIPP). Individually-

purchased plans are particularly interesting to examine because it is a source of coverage that is

likely to expand under the PPACA.

        The SIPP contains a wide variety of demographic and socioeconomic variables. In each

regression, we control for the following characteristics that may influence insurance status:

highest grade completed, age, number of children in the family, marital status, indicator variables

for each individual, and indicator variables for each year. We exclude income from the set of

regressors because wages and salary are determined simultaneously with fringe benefits such as

health insurance.5

        The SIPP data are better suited to our research question than are data from the CPS,

which is another household survey with state identifiers that is available in the public domain.

CPS data are the basis of the standard annual estimates of health insurance coverage in the U.S.

population (DeNavas-Walt et al., 2012). However, the CPS only records whether the respondent

was covered by health insurance at any point in the past 12 months, making it impossible to

determine whether the CPS respondent had coverage in any specific month. In contrast, the

SIPP records an individual’s insurance status in specific months, which enables one to match

insurance status to the unemployment rate in that month. Another advantage is that the SIPP is

longitudinal (whereas the CPS is cross-sectional); this feature allows us to estimate fixed effects




from 1.15% to 2.45% among those aged 0-14 years. We assume that this is an error in the editing of the SIPP, and
recode all such children as having employer-provided health insurance as a dependent.
5
  In a 2005 survey of health economists, 91% of health economists agreed that “Workers pay for employer-
sponsored health insurance in the form of lower wages or reduced benefits.” Six percent disagreed, and 4% said
they did not know (Morrisey and Cawley, 2008).

                                                       10
models that eliminate the bias that would otherwise be caused by individual-specific, time-

invariant heterogeneity.

       The source for monthly state unemployment rates is the Bureau of Labor Statistics Local

Area Unemployment Statistics Series. These state monthly unemployment rates are merged with

the SIPP data using state identifiers. (Unlike earlier panels of the SIPP, in which less-populous

states were not uniquely identified, the 2004 and 2008 panels identify state of residence for

individuals in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia.) We control for individual and year

fixed effects, so our identifying variation of unemployment on health insurance coverage is

within people over time in deviations from the national mean for that year.

       Our pooled SIPP data cover January 2004 through November 2010, with the exception of

January through July of 2008, which was not covered by either the 2004 or 2008 panel of SIPP.

The pooled data include the following numbers of person-month observations: 467,285 men,

510,334 women, and 416,648 children (aged 17 and younger).



Empirical Results

Summary Statistics

       Table 1 lists summary statistics for the sample. On average during the time of our

sample, the percent of respondents that were insured through any source was 78.6% for men,

83.0% for women, and 85.5% for children. Men and women are roughly equally likely to be

covered by employer-sponsored health insurance (65.2% vs. 64.1%) but men are more likely

than women to have such coverage through their own employer (50.7% vs. 36.8%) as opposed to

as a dependent (14.5% vs. 27.3%). Among children, 51.2% are covered by employer-provided

health insurance as a dependent. Only 5.6% of men, 6.0% of women and 3.8% of children are



                                                11
covered by individually-purchased policies. Government health insurance programs are the

source of coverage for 6.9% of men, 11.8% of women, and 27.6% of children.

Logit Regressions

        We initially estimate the probability that an individual has health insurance coverage as a

function of the unemployment rate and basic demographic characteristics while excluding

employment status. Subsequently, we re-estimate our models controlling for employment status

in order to investigate the extent to which that variable is a mechanism by which the

unemployment rate affects health insurance. Each cell of each of our tables contains, from top to

bottom, the sample size, the logit fixed effects coefficient, the standard error in parentheses, the

marginal effect italicized in brackets, its standard errors italicized in parentheses, and the mean

of the dependent variable.

        The first set of rows in Table 2 presents results for all sample respondents under the age

of 656. The results indicate that a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate has no

significant impact on the probability of being insured either overall or through any specific

source. However, these estimates based on the pooled sample, may obscure differences across

gender and age. We next describe results estimated separately for adult men, adult women, and

children.

        The second set of rows of Table 2 presents results for men, which are consistent with our

hypotheses that higher unemployment rates are associated with a lower probability of health

insurance coverage through any source, the man’s own employer, and individually purchased

coverage. Specifically, a one-percentage-point higher unemployment rate is associated with a

1.67 percentage point (2.12%) reduction in the probability of health insurance coverage through


6
  Children are excluded from the sample for the regressions in which the dependent variable concerns coverage
through one’s own employer.

                                                       12
any source, a 1.00 percentage point (1.97%) reduction in the probability of coverage through the

man’s own employer, and 1.44 percentage point (25.71%) reduction in individually purchased

coverage. The unemployment rate is not significantly associated with the probability of

coverage through an employer as a dependent, government health insurance, or through any

other source.

       The third set of rows in Table 2, which correspond to women, indicate that there is no

significant association between unemployment rate and health insurance coverage, either overall

or through any specific source. This is not simply a result of large standard errors; when one

compares the marginal effects for men and women for coverage through any source or through

an employer, the marginal effects for women are generally smaller.

       The fourth and bottom set of rows in Table 2, which correspond to children, show that the

probability that a child has health insurance coverage through any source is not significantly

correlated with the unemployment rate. However, a one-percentage-point higher unemployment

rate is associated with a 1.52 percentage point (5.51%) higher probability that a child is covered

by government-provided health insurance. Together, these results confirm that government

health insurance programs for children operate counter-cyclically, as intended; when

unemployment rates rise, more children become enrolled in Medicaid and SCHIP, leaving the

overall probability of coverage unaffected.

Robustness Check and Extensions

       In this section, we explain the results of a variety of robustness checks and extensions,

including adding additional controls for state characteristics, exploring whether the

unemployment rate affects the reasons for uninsurance, and subgroup analyses by education,

race, and age.Extension: Role of Employment Status (Own and Spouse’s)



                                                13
       In the main models of this paper, we sought to measure the total effect of unemployment

rate on the probability of insurance (i.e., through all channels). Among the various ways that

unemployment rate can affect coverage, the most important is likely by changing an individual’s

employment status.

       To investigate whether changes in employment status fully explain the impact of the

macroeconomy on insurance coverage, we measure the extent to which macroeconomic

conditions are correlated with insurance status conditional on employment status. Specifically,

we added to the set of regressors indicator variables for employment and unemployment (being

out of the labor force is the reference category). Results are presented in Table 3 for men (top set

of rows) and women (bottom set of rows). For both men and women we find the predictable

result that employment is positively correlated, and unemployment is negatively correlated, with

the probability of coverage. Also predictably, including employment status reduces the point

estimate on unemployment rate. Recall that without controlling for employment status, a one-

percentage point rise in unemployment was associated with a 1.67 percentage point decrease in

the probability of health insurance coverage for men. After controlling for employment status,

the decrease is 1.18 percentage points. When we examine the probability of coverage from

specific sources, we find that adding controls for employment status to the regression for men

having coverage through their own employer results in the point estimate of the coefficient on

the unemployment rate falling by half and no longer being statistically significant. It has little

impact on the association of the unemployment rate with men having individually-purchased

coverage.

       We also estimate models that control for spouse’s employment status as well as the

respondent’s employment status; spouse’s employment is relevant because one could receive



                                                 14
coverage through the spouse’s employer as a dependent. In results that are available upon

request, we find that, for men, a one-percentage point rise in unemployment is associated with a

0.97 percentage point decrease in the probability of health insurance coverage and a 0.48

percentage point decrease in the probability of own employer sponsored coverage (both are

statistically significant). A related question is whether the unemployment rate is associated with

coverage among those who are always employed, change employment status, or are never

employed. In tables available upon request, we find that the unemployment rate is negatively

correlated with the probability of coverage among men who change employment status, and men

who are always employed (a smaller marginal effect), but is not significantly correlated with the

probability of coverage among men who are never employed. For women, unemployment rate is

not significantly correlated with coverage in any of those groups. In summary, these findings

confirm that a change in employment status is an important way in which the state

unemployment rate affects the probability of health insurance coverage for both men and

women, yet the unemployment rate still plays an important independent role for men.

       Extension: Unemployment Rate and the Reason One is Uninsured

       The SIPP questionnaire allows us to explore how the reasons for uninsurance vary with

the macroeconomy. Specifically, the SIPP asks adults who lack health insurance the reasons

that they are uninsured; respondents are allowed to indicate more than one reason. We restrict

our sample to those who lack health insurance, and keep only the first month in which the

individual reports being uninsured. We then estimate a series of logit models in which the

dependent variable equals one if the respondent answers yes to a specific reason for being

uninsured. The set of regressors includes the state monthly unemployment rate and the same




                                                15
regressors used in the earlier models, except that the models control for state fixed effects rather

than individual fixed effects because we now use only one observation per uninsured person.

       Results are presented in Table 4. For men, a one percentage point higher unemployment

rate is associated with a 1.23 percentage point (1.55%) increase in the probability that

uninsurance was due to cost, and decreases in the probabilities that it was due to: insurance not

being offered by an employer, the individual not being at the job long enough to qualify, and that

insurance was not needed. For women, a one percentage point increase in the unemployment

rate is associated with a 0.92 percentage point (1.14%) increase in the probability that

uninsurance is due to cost, and a reduction in the probability that uninsurance is due to not being

at the job long enough to qualify. The fact that, as the unemployment rate rises, both men and

women are less likely to attribute uninsurance to not being at the job long enough to qualify is

consistent with both reduced hiring and the last hired being the first fired in recessions – both

would result in fewer new workers waiting to qualify for health insurance.

       These findings shed additional light on the other results in this paper. Specifically, they

suggest that the earlier finding that men are less likely to have employer-provided health

insurance in times of high unemployment is not due to employers dropping health insurance, but

instead to men declining that offer due to cost.

       Extension: Subgroup Analysis by Education

       Recent economic studies have documented how the Great Recession differentially

affected various groups in the population, and the evidence suggests differential impacts by

education. For example, Elsby et al. (2010) find that unemployment during the Great Recession

was particularly high among the less educated, and Farber (2011) finds that rates of job loss




                                                   16
during the Great Recession were higher among less educated workers, but that unemployment of

the better educated rose more than is typical during a recession.

       As an extension, we conduct subgroup analyses by education. We estimate the main

models (i.e. those from Table 2) for adults separately by education group: high school or less,

some college, and bachelor’s degree or more; the results are shown in Table 5. For men, a one

percentage point rise in the unemployment rate is estimated to reduce the probability of coverage

through any source by 1.73 percentage points (2.56%) for those with a high school education or

less, 1.37 percentage points (1.69%) for those with some college, and 2.14 percentage points

(2.32%) for those with a bachelor’s degree or more education. Each is significantly different

from zero, but they are not significantly different from each other. However, the point estimates

suggest that those with the lowest and highest levels of education were most likely to lose health

insurance during the Great Recession.


       Among women, even when models are estimated separately by educational attainment,

we continue to find that the unemployment rate is not significantly associated with the

probability of insurance coverage; the exception is that a one percentage point rise in

unemployment is associated with a 1.63 percentage point (5.24%) lower probability that women

with a bachelor’s degree or higher education receive employer-sponsored insurance as a

dependent.

       Extension: Role of Spouse Education

       Spouse education is also potentially relevant, as it is likely correlated with the probability

that one can acquire health insurance as a dependent on the spouse’s health insurance. To

investigate this, we added to the set of regressors interaction terms of unemployment rate with

marital status and spouse’s education dummies. We then re-conducted the subgroup analysis by


                                                 17
education to see if the effects of the macroeconomy differ depending on marital status and

spouses’ education.

       In results available upon request, we find that, for men with a high school degree or less,

the impact of the unemployment rate on the probability of health insurance coverage is negative

for those who are single or are married to a low-educated woman, but indistinguishable from

zero for those married to a college-educated woman. Moreover, among men with a high school

degree or less, the probability of having dependent coverage increases during periods of high

unemployment rate, but only if their wife has some college or a college degree.

       Men with a college degree do not exhibit the “protective” effect of a wife’s college

degree on probability of health insurance coverage that is found among men with a high school

education.

       Extension: Subgroup Analyses by Race

       In other subgroup analyses, we estimate models separately by race (Table 6). The impact

of unemployment rate on the probability of coverage is not significantly different for whites

compared to African-Americans and Hispanics, but the pattern of point estimates suggests that

the unemployment rate has a larger impact on health insurance coverage for whites. A one

percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a 1.54 percentage point

(1.84%) lower probability that an adult white male has coverage from any source, and a 0.95

percentage point (1.51%) reduction in the probability that an adult African-American or Hispanic

male has coverage through any source. Among children, results indicate that whites gain health

insurance during periods of high unemployment. Although the correlation is not statistically

significant for African-American and Hispanic children, it is also not significantly different from

the point estimate for white children (1.24 versus 1.38 percentage points).



                                                18
       Extension: Subgroup Analyses by Age

       Results for the average worker may obscure interesting differences across age groups.

For example, younger workers may be hit harder if the last hired is the first fired, and older

workers may have a harder time finding new employment after being laid off. We present

results of models estimated separately by age group in Table 7. Among men, a one percentage

point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a decrease in the probability of

coverage of 1.34 percentage points (1.93%) for men aged 18-34, 1.56 percentage points (1.93%)

for men aged 35-49, and 2.50 percentage points (2.87%) for men aged 50-64. Thus, the effect of

the unemployment rate (in absolute terms) on the oldest group (50-64) is nearly double that on

the youngest group (18-34). The magnitudes of the marginal effects for women also rise

monotonically with age, but are in no case statistically significant.

       Extension: Comparison to Earlier Study

       The most logical comparison for this work is earlier work using the SIPP (Cawley and

Simon, 2005, or CS), which used a similar method to predict the loss of health insurance

coverage during the previous (2001) recession. To facilitate that comparison, we estimate

identical models to those in the previous paper. Appendix Tables A1 – A3 (available as a

supplemental file on the journal website) compare the estimates from the previous paper, which

used SIPP data for 1990-2000 to predict the impact of the 2001 recession, to ones based on SIPP

data for 2004-2010 that indicate the impact of the 2007-09 recession. Appendix Table A1

(comparable to Table 1 in CS), which provides results for men, shows that a percentage point

increase in the unemployment rate was associated with a greater increase in the probability of

uninsurance in the more recent recession: 1.3 percentage points compared to 0.7 percentage

points. For women (Appendix Table A2, comparable to Table 2 in CS), the decrease in the



                                                 19
probability of employer coverage in one’s own name that is associated with a one percentage

point increase in the unemployment rate fell from 0.07 percentage points in the earlier data to a

non-significant 0.01 percentage points. For children (Appendix Table A3, comparable to Table 3

in CS) the increase in the probability of Medicaid coverage associated with a one percentage

point increase in the unemployment rate remained roughly constant: 1.04 percentage points in

the earlier sample and 1.01 percentage points in the current sample.

        Overall, the comparison of the current recession to previous data suggests that the health

insurance coverage of men is now more vulnerable to changes in the unemployment rate. The

increase in the probability of being uninsured associated with a one percentage point increase in

the unemployment rate is almost twice as high in the Great Recession (1.3) than in the previous

data (0.7); however, we caution that this difference is not statistically significant and that this

result is only suggestive. Such a difference could be the result of differences in the

characteristics of recessions; e.g. the 2007-09 recession hit male-dominated sectors such as

finance, banking, construction, and manufacturing particularly hard, leading it to be nicknamed

the “man-cession” (Elsby et al., 2010).7

        A comparison of the results for women yields little evidence that the unemployment rate

has a different impact in this recession compared to prior periods. For example, the difference in

marginal effects of unemployment rate on the probability of coverage through a woman’s own

employer is not statistically significant and also is not economically meaningful in terms of the

difference in its magnitude.

Robustness Check: Employment Rate Instead of Unemployment Rate



7
 Elsby et al. (2010) note that in general recessions tend to lead to greater increases in unemployment for men than
women, in part because the industries in which male workers are concentrated (e.g. construction, manufacturing) are
particularly pro-cyclical.

                                                        20
       The state unemployment rate is the primary measure used in the large literature on the

macroeconomy and health (see e.g. Ruhm, 2006) and thus is the logical measure to use in this

context. However, one might be concerned that some of the variation in unemployment rate is

due to job-seekers becoming discouraged and ceasing to look for work, leading to their removal

from the denominator. Interestingly, Farber (2011) finds no evidence that job losers are more

likely to become discouraged workers during recessions, including the Great Recession.

Nevertheless, to investigate the sensitivity of our results, we re-estimate our models using the

employment rate rather than the unemployment rate; the results are provided in Appendix Table

4. We find that a one percentage point increase in the employment rate is associated with an

increase in the probability of health insurance coverage through any source of 0.09 percentage

points for men and 0.21 percentage points for women. Overall, while the major conclusions

remain the same (the probability of health insurance coverage is correlated with the

macroeconomy), the specific results are somewhat sensitive to which measure of the

macroeconomy is used.

       Robustness Check: Additional Controls for State Characteristics

       In a previous study (Cawley and Simon, 2005) we controlled for three other measures of

state-level heterogeneity: the percent of the workforce that is unionized in that state, the

Medicare hospital wage index, and the generosity of public health insurance programs. None

were found to affect the results, and so were excluded from the models in this paper because they

are not integral to an analysis of the recession itself and could even be mechanisms that are

affected by a worsening economic climate. As a robustness check, however, we included the

three variables in the set of regressors; in results that are available upon request, we find that this

does not change our results in any meaningful way, with the exception that the effect of the



                                                  21
unemployment rate on government provided insurance among children becomes statistically

insignificant.

Discussion

        The Great Recession of 2007-09 is the longest and deepest macroeconomic downturn in

the United States since 1933. This paper documents the impact of higher unemployment rates on

one important outcome: health insurance coverage.

        We find substantial heterogeneity in this relationship across gender, education, race, and

age, as well as source of insurance. For men, a one percentage point rise in the unemployment

rate is associated with a 1.67 (2.12%) percentage point reduction in coverage through any source.

Point estimates suggest that this impact for men is greatest among whites (relative to African-

Americans and Hispanics) and older (50-64) individuals, but differences among subgroups are in

most cases not statistically significant.

        We also find that men’s probability of coverage through individually-purchased plans

declines with the unemployment rate. Thus, the decreased demand due to lower income may

outweigh the increased demand for individual plans among those losing jobs; this could in part

be due to temporary COBRA subsidies that kept newly-separated workers on their previous

employer-provided plans (Moriya and Simon, 2013). Our findings concerning individually-

purchased plans are timely because the PPACA seeks to expand this source of coverage; men

may need subsidies to continue purchasing individual plans during periods of high

unemployment.

        In contrast to the findings for men, among women the unemployment rate is in almost no

case significantly correlated with the probability of coverage, and the point estimates of the

marginal effects are much smaller than those for men. For children, a one percentage point



                                                22
higher unemployment rate is associated with a 1.52 percentage point (5.51%) higher probability

of public health insurance coverage, with the result that there is no statistically significant effect

on the probability of health insurance coverage through any source. These findings confirm that

government health insurance programs work counter-cyclically to protect children from losing

health insurance during macroeconomic downturns.

       As hypothesized, the loss of employment is an important pathway through which a higher

unemployment rate leads to a lower probability of health insurance coverage for men. However,

even controlling for employment status, men still face a 1.18 percentage point lower probability

of coverage when the unemployment rate rises by 1 percentage point. This may be due to

employers dropping coverage, employers cutting hours such that some men no longer qualify for

health insurance, employers raising workers’ share of the overall premium so more male workers

decline coverage, or lower incomes that result in fewer purchases of individual coverage.

       We investigate the reasons for a lack of coverage, and find that when the unemployment

rate is high, the uninsured are more likely to report that their uninsurance is due to the high cost

of coverage, which is consistent with employers shifting more of the premium to workers and

lower family incomes being important mechanisms for the relationship between the

unemployment rate and the probability of coverage. Interestingly, during periods of high

unemployment, men are less likely to attribute uninsurance to employers not offering coverage.

       This paper’s estimates of the correlation between health insurance coverage and

unemployment rate during 2004-2010 can be used to estimate the number of Americans who lost

health insurance during the Great Recession, which lasted from December 2007 until June 2009.

During that period, the national unemployment rate rose from 5.0% to 9.5% (U.S. Department of




                                                  23
Labor, 2011).8 Based on this change, our regression results, and Census estimates of the U.S.

population of men aged 18–64, and women aged 18–64 in the year 2008 (U.S. Census Bureau,

2011), we estimate that roughly 9.3 million adult Americans lost health insurance during the

Great Recession. This is the difference in the number of adult Americans who had health

insurance coverage at the macroeconomic peak in December 2007 compared to the trough in

June 2009; the number who ever lost health insurance during the Great Recession is undoubtedly

higher due to the fact that there is churning in the ranks of the uninsured (Swartz, 1994). This

macroeconomic impact fell much more heavily on men; the 9.3 million total includes 7.1 million

men and 2.2 million women. Thus, the Great Recession lived up to its name; for comparison,

during the 2001 recession, 984,000 adult Americans lost health insurance (Cawley and Simon,

2005). The difference in estimates is driven by both a much greater increase in unemployment

rate (a 4.5 percentage point increase during the Great Recession compared to a 1.3 percentage

point increase during the 2001 recession), and a larger effect on men of each percentage point

rise in unemployment. In contrast to adults, our point estimates imply that 4.2 million children

under the age of 18 gained health insurance during the Great Recession. Combining adults and

children, we estimate that on net 5.1 million Americans lost health insurance coverage.

        We caution that the 95% confidence intervals around our aggregate estimates are very

large; for men it ranges between 11.9 million and 2.4 million losing health insurance, for women

it ranges between 5.2 million losing coverage and 0.9 million gaining it, and for children it

ranges between 73,000 and 8.4 million gaining coverage. The bootstrapped 95% confidence

interval for the effect on adults is between 16.2 million and 2.5 million losing coverage, and the

(peaking at 10.1% in October 2009), but we consider the trough of the economy to be that determined by the NBER.

                                                       24
corresponding confidence interval when including adults and children is between 13.7 million

losing coverage to 3.5 million gaining coverage.

       Our estimate that 9.3 million adult Americans lost health insurance during the Great

Recession is similar to the calculation reported by the Commonwealth Fund (based on

Commonwealth Biennial Health Insurance Surveys) that, between 2008 and 2010, 9 million

adults lost health insurance following the loss of a job (Collins et al., 2011); however, our

estimate also includes those who lost coverage without changing employment status. Our

estimate is also higher than that of Gilmer and Kronick (2009), who estimate, using a model that

does not consider unemployment rate, that 6.9 million Americans lost health insurance during

the Great Recession.

       In the future, the reforms passed by the U.S. Congress in the 2010 PPACA will likely

moderate the impact of the unemployment rate on the probability of insurance coverage. The

PPACA offers incentives for employers to offer, and individuals to take up, coverage; provides

subsidies for coverage of low-income families through public and private policies; and changes

the regulation of health insurance prices in the individual market. Many features of the law are

expected to cushion the impact of future recessions on health insurance coverage, particularly for

adults. For example, the availability of exchanges for individual insurance together with limits

on raising premia with age could reduce the impact of recession on the health insurance status of

older workers. As the various components of the PPACA are implemented, it will become

possible for researchers to more accurately estimate how reforming the current system of health

insurance in the US will affect the association of the unemployment rate with the probability of

uninsurance and the functioning of the social safety net.

Notes: (1) Cells of the table contain: coefficient, bootstrapped standard errors in parentheses, marginal effects italicized in brackets, and bootstrapped standard errors of marginal
effects italicized in parentheses. (2) Superscripted notations next to the coefficients indicate the level of statistical significance from a two-tailed t-test. *** denotes the 1% level,
** denotes the 5% level and * denotes the 10% level. (3) Bootstrapped standard errors are clustered at the state level. (4) Data: pooled 2004-2010 waves of the SIPP. The sample
consists of: row 1: all non-elderly under the age of 65 (except columns 2 and 4: all non-elderly adults between the ages of 18 and 64 regardless of employment status); row 2; all
men between the ages of 18 and 64 regardless of employment status; row 3: all women between the ages of 18 and 64 regardless of employment status, and ; row 4: all children
under the age of 18. (5) Dependent variables—column 1: indicator variable that equals 1 if individual covered by health insurance from any source and 0 otherwise; column 2:
indicator variable that equals 1 if individual is covered by employer health insurance in own name and 0 otherwise; column 3: indicator variable that equals 1 if individual is
covered by employer health insurance as a dependent and 0 otherwise; column 4: indicator variable that equals 1 if individual is covered by individually purchased health insurance
and 0 otherwise; column 5: indicator variable for any type of government-provided health insurance; column 6: indicator variable that equals 1 if individual is covered by health
insurance but do not report the kind of insurance. (6) Other regressors are individual fixed effects, year-specific fixed effects, highest grade completed, marital status, presence of
children in the family, and age.
