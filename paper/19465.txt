Demography and Low Frequency Capital Flows

                                              ABSTRACT

We consider the causes of international capital flows. Since capital flows are extremely persistent,
we argue that their drivers must be persistent, too. We think the most compelling candidates are demographic
trends, tfp differences and financial frictions. In this paper we focus primarily on the role of demography
in a multi-country overlapping generations model in which saving decisions are tied to agents' life
expectancy. Capital flows reflect differences between saving and investment across countries. Demographic
changes affect the aggregate accumulation of assets in two ways: by changing life expectancy which
changes individual household saving behavior, and by changing the age distribution of the population
by which individual household decisions are aggregated. The most important drivers turn out to be
increases in life expectancy caused by decreases in adult mortality.We use a quantitative version of
the model to illustrate the impact of demography on capital flows and net foreign assets in China, Germany,
Japan, and the United States.

1    Introduction

The movement of capital from less productive to more productive uses is a story repeated
over and over again throughout history and around the world. Whether capital moves
within a country — say from Massachusetts to North Carolina — or between countries —
say from the US to Mexico — its flow addresses imbalances between local sources of funds
(savings) and uses (investment). Certainly capital could flow for other reasons, but it’s not
hard to believe that market forces could account for substantial flows on their own. The
period from 1880 to 1913 is often described as the golden era of capital mobility. Michael
Bordo (2002) describes this earlier period: “The fifty years before World War I saw massive
flows of capital from Western Europe to (mainly) the Americas and Australasia. At its peak,
the outflow from Britain reached nine percent of GNP and was almost as high in France,
Germany, and the Netherlands.” Over this period, Great Britain accumulated claims on
the rest of the world equal to about one year’s GDP. Among the recipients were Australia,
Canada, Sweden, and the United States.

    Through much of history, the major capital flows were from rich countries to poorer
ones. A narrow view of these flows is that capital should flow from rich countries to poor
countries because the returns to capital should be higher in the latter. But, this view is
challenged by the evidence. Ohanian and Wright (2010) have shown that the direction of
capital flows was not always consistent with the pursuit of higher returns as they measured
them.

    The recent history of capital flows also challenges the traditional view. The most no-
table importer of capital has been the richest country, the United States. Australia, and
the UK have also been importers of capital. Germany, Japan, and China, have been sig-
nificant exporters of capital. Moreover, these capital flows have been persistent - countries
experiencing capital flows, in or out, are likely to be do so for long periods of time. These
low frequency net capital flows are collectively referred to as “global imbalances.”

    If capital flows are persistent, the question is why. One possibility is that market in-
stitutions, which evolve slowly, might be expected to lead to similarly slow-moving flows
of capital. Another is tax rates, which change infrequently. In this paper we highlight the
role of demography, and in particular increases in life expectancy and the associated aging
of populations. Demographic trends are persistent are changes in demography areevident
worldwide. What is important, however, is that countries exhibit enough heterogeneity in
these changes to make capital flows a plausible consequence. We will show that differences
in the rate at which life expectancy is changing have a big impact on capital flows.

       To study the connection between demography and capital flows we use a calibrated
general equilibrium model with a rich set of demographics. We ask to what extent can net
foreign asset positions be explained over time (and hence capital flows) by demography,
and productivity differences. Differential demographic trends drive savings and investment
differences as workers adapt to increased life expectancy and decreased fertility. In such a
world capital flows to countries with more favorable demographics and these demographics
explain well the differences in net foreign asset positions observed in the data. Differences
in productivity explain some but not a lot of the movements in net foreign asset positions
over time.

       The idea of using an OG model to study the impact of demography on international
capital flows isn’t new. Attanasio, Kitao, and Violante (2007), Boersch-Supan, Ludwig, and
Winter (2006), Brooks (2003), Domeij and Floden (2006), Feroli (2003), Ferrero (2010),
Henriksen (2003), and Krueger and Ludwig (2007) all took this approach. Others before
them expressed similar ideas without the formal structure of a model. A large literature
also explores the impact of demography on aggregate saving rates.1

       We begin by relating some important facts about capital flows, demography, and capital
output ratios for the subset of economies that we are focusing on. We then describe a one-
good model and some equilibrium concepts that we use to explore the role of demography.
In each country, households have power utility and firms have identical constant elasticity
aggregate production functions. Countries differ only in their demography: the mortality
rates and life expectancies faced by households and the age distribution of their populations.
The question is how much variation in capital flows we can generate across countries and
over time from these differences alone.2 We show, using steady state calculations, that
   1
     The challenge with this kind of model are the dozens of decisions we must make about details, far more
than we would have in a representative agent model. Did households foresee the large drop in mortality we’ve
seen around the world? How do they deal with uncertain lifetimes? Bequests? Are pensions substitutes for
private saving or something more?
   2
     One thing we think is important is the time interval. Most of the data, and most of the work based
on it, uses five-year intervals. We use an interval of one year to get more precise control over the effects
of mortality on life expectancy. This also brings the model closer to other work in macroeconomics, where
annual or even quarterly frequencies are typical.



                                                     2
changes in life expectancy can, in principle, have large effects on capital outflows or inflows
and thus on net foreign asset positions. We go on to simulate paths for capital flows for
China, Germany, Japan, and the United States, countries with large capital flows, both in
or out.



2        Facts

We start with some facts about international capital flows and stocks, facts about demog-
raphy, and facts about capital-output ratios. In describing these facts, we look at four
countries: China (ISO country code CHN), Germany (DEU), Japan (JPN), and the United
States (USA). These countries account for a substantial fraction of net capital flows in the
world, and they have striking, and different, demographics. We show — for these countries
anyway — that capital flows are persistent. If the ratio of the current account balance
to GDP has a tendency to revert to zero, as it does in most multi-country business cycle
models, it’s well hidden in the data. The same holds for net foreign assets. Demogra-
phy, of course, is inherently persistent. We describe changes in the age distribution of the
population, in life expectancy, in old-age dependency, and in retirement ages. All but the
retirement age have changed dramatically over the last few decades. Finally, we look at
capital-output ratios, a central component of the modeling exercise that follows.


2.1       Capital flows and stocks


Global capital flows are most often depicted by plotting the current account — aggregate
investment minus aggregate savings — as a fraction of GDP. Figure 1 is a plot of current
account balances for a number of countries.3

        What is striking about this picture is the persistence of current account flows. Countries
like the US that tend to have current account deficits, have them for a long time as do
countries that have current account surpluses - e.g. Germany, Japan and China. Although
countries do reverse from surplus to deficit and vice versa they seem to do so infrequently.
    3
    Current accounts are from the IMF’s World Economic Outlook database for April 2013. Net foreign
asset positions were computed by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007).




                                                  3
   The net foreign asset positions of these countries are shown in Figure 2 below. In
principal these should represent the same phenomena and the Current Account should
simply represent the change in Net Foreign Assets. In practice they don’t line up and
the difference is the subject of exploration. Ricardo Hausmann and Federico Sturzenegger
(2006) have described this difference is ”dark matter” that is explained by unmeasured
flows of liquidity services, knowledge capital and insurance. They have argued that when
this is taken into account the current account flows look very different. McGrattan and
Prescott (2009) have argued that technology capital and plant specific intangible capital
explain much of the difference between current account flows and net foreign asset positions
and accounts for much of the measured differences in asset returns between countries. For
our purposes the precise nature of “dark matter” is a secondary issue and we will focus
primarily on Net Foreign Assets and will treat changes in Net Foreign Asset positions as
the capital flows of interest.

   Although much attention has been directed at the flows of capital as represented by the
current account statistics, not enough has been directed at the question of why these data
display the characteristics that they do. The features of the data belie the frequently voiced
worry about sudden reversal of capital flows.

   We see, for a start, that Japan has had persistent current account surpluses since the
1980s. These correspond to capital outflows and amounted to 50 percent of GDP in 2007,
the last date in the available data. The US has had the opposite experience and now has
a negative net foreign asset position. In both cases, the direction of net capital flows has
been the same for almost three decades. Germany and China have had more variation, but
there is a great deal of persistence in their capital flows as well. China, for example, has had
capital inflows for almost twenty years. Germany has had the same for ten. Although there
is a clear cyclical component in the current account, the bulk of current account fluctuations
operate at a lower frequency. Henriksen and Lambert (2009) make the same argument more
formally for a broader range of countries.


2.2   Demographics


Could demography play a role in these capital flows? The current account for a country is
simply the difference between domestic savings and domestic investment. It is natural to


                                               4
look at life-cycle considerations as primary drivers of domestic savings. For a given country
the key drivers are fertility and mortality. The former determines how many workers there
are over time while the latter determines how many years of post-employment consumption
they have to save for. As fertility declines as it has in many of the most important economies,
there are fewer workers saving over time. As mortality declines the number of years of
retirement for each worker is likely to increase relative to the number of years of work.
Certainly demography evolves slowly enough to produce persistent effects on the economy.
It also differs across countries, a requirement for it to affect international capital flows.

   Consider the evidence reported in the UN’s World Population Prospects, the 2010 re-
vision. We see in Figure 3 that UN data and projections for the future show significant
aging of the populations of China, Germany, Japan, and the US. Japan’s aging is the most
pronounced in this group, with more than a third of the population expected to be over 70
by 2040. Germany is also aging quickly while the US, in this group, is aging the most slowly.
This aging refects, in part, a continuing increase in life expectancy; see Figure 4. The levels
of life expectancy differ, but we see the same pattern of increase in all four countries. In
each of them, life expectancy has increased almost a decade since 1970 and is projected to
increase another decade by the end of the century.

   The increase in life expectancy reflects a significant drop in mortality at all ages. We
document this with data from the WHO’s Global Health Observatory. Figure 5 shows how
mortality has changed in the US: we plot the log of age-specific mortality rates for the years
1990, 2000, and 2011. We see a consistent drop at all ages. The drop at higher ages is larger
in absolute terms, because the underlying rates are larger. In Figure 6 we see mortality
rates for all four countries for the year 2011. The differences reflect those in life expectancy:
Japan has the lowest mortality rates and China the highest.

   The aging of the population and rise in life expectancy are projected to produce sharp
increases in the old-age dependency ratio, measured here as the ratio of the population aged
65 and above to the population with ages between 20 and 64. See Figure 7. In Japan, the
ratio was about 20% in 1990, is now about 40%, and is projected to be over 70% in 2050.
Germany is only slightly less extreme. China exhibits a similar pattern somewhat latter,
with a current dependency ratio of about 10% projected to increase to 60% by 2060. Aging
in the US looks modest by comparison, with a projected dependency ratio of about 40% in
2050.

                                               5
   The other side of population dynamics is fertility, which we summarize in Figure 8. The
numbers come from the UN’s World Population Prospects and refer to the period 2005-2010.
We see that fertility rates in Germany and Japan have been low, lower even than in China
with its one-child policy. The lower input of young people into the population reinforces
the impact of reduced mortality on the aging of their populations. The US has the highest
fertility of the four countries, with 414 births per thousand women. The same number for
China is 328, for Germany 271, and for Japan 264. [NB: Numbers are labeled as in the
source, but the units seem to be off by ten.]

   We see, in short, gradual but significant aging of the populations of all four countries, but
also significant differences among them. We conclude with one last fact about demographic
trends. We show in Figure 9 how the retirement age has changed with time. The retirement
age comes from the OECD’s Statistics on average effective age of retirement and is computed
from labor market participation rates of older workers. We see in the figure that retirement
ages differ across countries but show little variation over time over the period 1980-2011.
Evidently, increases in life expectancy are leading to longer periods of retirement.

   None of these facts are new. Bongaarts (2004) provides a more comprehensive analysis
and a good summary of related work.


2.2.1   A Model of Demographic Flows


We capture these demographic facts in a model of overlapping generations of ex ante identi-
cal agents who are assumed to live up to I periods, with ages denoted by i ∈ I ≡ {1, . . . , I}.
At every point in time, there are I different cohorts alive. Individuals remain children for
I0 periods. As children they neither consume, accumulate capital nor supply labor. After
I0 periods the agents enter the economy as autonomous decision makers.

   The survival probability between age i and i + 1 is denoted si,t and varies with ages i
and time. The unconditional probability of reaching age i is denoted si and is the product
                                               Qi−1
of conditional survival probability rates; si = j=1 sj .

   Let xt ∈ RI be the vector of number of members in each cohort in period t. The
demographic structure of the population changes through changes in fertility, mortality and
immigration. According to time and age specific fertility rates ϕi,t , in each period these

                                                6
individuals give birth to a certain number of new individuals, and the number of newborns
in period t + 1, x1,t+1 , is the product of xt and the vector of fertility rates ϕt . Then the law
of motion of a population with survival rates as given above, but deterministic fertility, can
be described by a simple (I × I) matrix4 :


                                                                      
                                         ϕ1 ϕ2 ϕ3         ···    ϕI
                                     
                                        s1 0    0        ···    0     
                                                                       
                                Γ̂ = 
                                        0 s2 0           ···    0     
                                                                       
                                         .. .. . .       ..      ..   
                                          .  .     .        .     .   
                                         0   0 ···       sI−1     0


       where the diagonal elements (s1 , . . . , sI−1 ) are the conditional survival probabilities.

       Let mt ∈ RI be a vector with each element representing the cohort specific number of
net immigrants at time t. Denoting Γ̂t the matrix of deterministic fertility and mortality
rates at time t, the law of motion for the population may be written

                                         xt+1 = Γ̂t xt + mt .                                            (1)


2.3       Capital stocks


We look at one last variable, the capital-output ratio, which plays a central role in our
model. We compute capital stocks by standard methods from the Penn World Table, version
7.1. We take data on investment, estimate an initial capital stock value from a steady state
approximation, and update by the perpetual inventory method using an annual depreciation
rate of 6 percent. Caselli (2005) is one of many to describe the approach.

       We show in Figure 10 how the ratio has evolved in our four countries. Over the period
1980 to 2010, the capital-output ratio has been between two and three in the US and China,
about three in Germany, and has risen above four in Japan. China is the most surprising.
Between 1990 and 2010, its real investment share of GDP averaged 37 percent, significantly
higher than the 22 percent experienced by the US, yet its capital-output ratio is similar.
   4
    The largest eigenvalue of the matrix Γ is the rate of growth of the population in steady state regardless
of the initial condition. The eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue describes the share of each age
group in the steady state population.


                                                     7
The reason it’s not higher, of course, is that output has been growing so quickly. Could our
calculation be grossly wrong for China? Our guess is no: Holz (2006) constructs similar
estimates directly from company balance sheets.



3     An overlapping generations model

We study the impact of demographic changes in a model with overlapping generations of
agents who spread their consumption over their lifetimes and supply labor inelastically.
There is a common technology for producing goods from capital and labor. Countries differ
primarily in their demographics, including their age distribution and mortality rates.

    In this world supply of capital is determined by the collective decisions of households
who make savings-consumption decisions that determine the path of their net worth given
interest rates and prices. The production decisions of firms, given interest rates and prices
determines the demand for capital and the capital output ratio. Net foreign assets is the
difference between the aggregate net worth of agents and capital used by firms. Flows such
as saving, investment, and the current account can computed from the laws of motion of
the stocks.


3.1    Organizing framework


We use the structure of competitive equilibrium as the organzing framework to analyze the
effects of demographic change. In particular:


    1. Capital supply:

       (a) Individuals at every age solve their optimization problems given aggregate prices
              and conditional life expectancy.
       (b) The decisions of individuals of different ages are aggregated by the relative cohort
              sizes

    2. Capital demand: Firms employ all individuals of working age in each country and
      choose optimal quantities of capital demanded given prices.


                                                 8
   3. Prices are determined internationally.

        If the supply of capital is greater than demand for capital given prices the country is
        a capital exporter, and vice versa


   In the following sections we will consider variations on this definition of equilibrium
that illustrate the role of differences in mortality in the steady state and the nature of
capital flows given a path for interest rates and prices. Finally, we will compute a general
rquilibrium.


3.2     Households


Individual households take prices of labor and capital as given. Demographic changes affect
households individual decision problems by changing their life expectancy at every age.
They affect aggregate decisions through the change in the age composition of cohorts.


3.2.1     Individual households’ decisions


We refer to households as agents or cohorts. Households work, save, and consume.

   Consumption starts at age Iw and continues until death. Utility has a time-additive
power form, which we express recursively by

                              Uit = c1−σ
                                     it /(1 − σ) + βsit Ui+1,t+1                                (2)

for i = Iw , . . . , I. Here Uit is utility from date t forward for an agent of age i, cit is date-t
consumption for the same agent, and β is the discount factor. The intertemporal elasticity
of substitution is 1/σ. The limiting case σ = 1 corresponds to log utility. The use of the
survival probability sit follows the now-familiar application of expected utility to uncertain
lifetimes proposed by Yaari (1965).

   Labor is supplied inelastically once agents reach working age. Formally, the agent begins
to work at age Iw (w for work) , supplying one unit of labor every year until retirement.
At age Ir (r for retirement), the household stops working.



                                                 9
      We build productivity into labor. Each individual of working age supplies one unit of
labor. For an agent of age i at date t, that unit has efficiency eit . Efficiency is zero for
children and retirees: eit = 0 for i < Iw and i > Ir . If the wage per efficiency unit is wt ,
the agent earns labor income eit wt .

      Differences in eit across time and countries will lead to level effects on the economies
but will not matter much for the dynamics af capital flows. They can however be used to
capture differences in productivity levels across countries.

      Consumption and income are connected to changes in net worth through the budget
constraint. Let ait be financial assets or net worth owned by agents of age i at the start of
the period t. The sequence budget constraint for an agent of age i is

                        ai+1,t+1 = (1 + rt )ait + eit wt − cit + bi+1,t+1 ,

where rt is the real return between t and t + 1. We have one of these constraints for each
age i = Iw , . . . , I, plus boundary conditions

                                     aIw ,t = aI+1,t = 0.                                         (3)

Bequests bit are a necessary ingredient here, because we need to distribute the accidental
bequests of agents who die before age I. The simplest method is to spread the assets of
those who die among the living of the same generation: bi+1,t+1 = (1 − sit )ai+1,t+1 .



                            sit ai+1,t+1 = (1 + rt )ait + eit wt − cit .                          (4)

Other alternatives are to assume an annuity system, to distribute accidential bequests
equally to all individuals, to distribute accidential bequests to individuals of the assumed
offspring, or to let them be lost.      5   See, among many others, Hansen and Imrohoroglu
(2008), Rios-Rull (2001), and Yaari (1965).



                                    c−σ
                                     i,t = βc−σ
                                             i+1,t+1 (1 + rt ).

This tells us that the slope of the lifetime consumption profile is governed by the discount
factor β, the interest rate rt , and the preference parameter σ. The absence of sit stems from
the annuity. The asset profile depends on consumption and the profile for labor income.

    Since we are calibrating preference and technology parameters to match certain moments conditional
on the system, how we treat accidental bequests is not that critical.

3.2.2    Aggregation of individual decisions


Each of these individual or cohort variables has an aggregate analog. Aggregate consump-
                                             P
tion is the sum across generations: Ct =       i cit xit . Aggregate net worth is the same:
      P
At = i ait xit . The total supply of labor at date t is the sum over all agents of working
           P
age: Nt = i eit xit .


3.3     Firms


Firms in aggregate combine capital Kt and efficiency units of labor Nt to produce output
Yt . Demographic change affects firms’ demand for capital through changes in changes in
the number of efficiency units of labor supplied by the households.

   We give their technology a constant elasticity form:
                                                                       1/(1−ν)
                                               ωKt1−ν + (1 − ω)Nt1−ν
                                           
                  Yt = F (Kt , Nt ) =                                             .         (5)

The elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is 1/ν. The limiting case ν = 1
corresponds to Cobb-Douglas. The law of motion for capital is the usual

                                 Kt+1 = (1 − δ)Kt + It ,                                    (6)

where It is gross investment in new capital and δ is the rate of depreciation.

   A representative firm with this technology facing prices (rt , wt ) chooses capital and labor
equate marginal products to prices:

                                 ∂F (Kt , Nt )/∂Kt = rt + δ                                 (7)
                                ∂Fn (Kt , Nt )/∂Nt = wt .                                   (8)

With the constant elasticity function (5), the marginal product of capital takes the form

                             ∂F (Kt , Nt )/∂Kt = ω(Kt /Yt )−ν ,

a decreasing function of the capital-output ratio.

3.4        Equilibrium and capital flows

At any time t, each country takes the international rate of return on capital as given. For
given prices of capital and labor, households make their capital-supply decisions and firms
make their capital-demand decisions. If the supply of capital is larger than the demand for
capital for given prices, a country is a capital exporter – and vice versa if demand is larger
than supply.

        International capital markets must clear and the rate of return be such that the sum of
capital demanded across all countries equals the sum of capital supplied.

4        Demography and steady states

First we we consider the impact of increased life expectancy in the steady state. The
demographic inputs give us a stationary age distribution for each country. When we decrease
mortality rates, this increases life expectancy at every age and changes the age distribution,
making it older. Second, this change in the age distribution has consequences for all of the
variables in the model: consumption, labor supply, aggregate net worth, the capital stock,
the wage, and the interest rate. In our closed economy, an increase in life expectancy raises
aggregate net worth and the stock of capital. This reduces the marginal product of capital
and hence the interest rate. This is an important consequence of demographic change that
has been discussed by others.6

        In an open economy, with a fixed interest rate, the increase in aggregate net worth
shows up as an increase in net foreign assets. We describe these effects in a supply and
demand diagram, where the demand for capital comes from firms’ first-order condition and
the supply comes from households accumulation of assets.


4.1        Parameter values

We review the inputs to the model, starting with demography. We use stylized demographics
to illustrate the impact of increases in life expectancy. We start with benchmark mortality
    6
        See Henriksen(2002) and Geanakoplos, Magill and QuinziI


                                                     12
rates, adapted from WHO data, associated with a life expectancy at birth of 60 years:

                                     log(1 − si ) = µi .

The shape is evident from Figure 6, with mortality high for the young and old and low in
between. Only the latter matters here, because agents do nothing until they reach working
age. We then scale them up and down by some constant z,

                                   log(1 − sit ) = µi − zt                                 (9)

to reproduce other life expectancies. Demographers will recognize this as a simplified version
of Lee and Carter (1992). The larger is zt , the lower are mortality rates and the longer
is life expectancy. We see the results in Figure 11, where we plot the resulting survival
probabilities. The logarithmic form of (9) means that the greatest impact is on the largest
mortality rates: those of the young and old.

   With these mortality rates, and one birth each period, we can compute the stationary
age distribution. The result is pictured in Figure 12. We see that this mechanism gives us
an older population, on average, when we reduce mortality rates to reproduce longer life
expectancies.

   The next input is the technology. We set δ = 0.06, which we used to generate the data.
We also set ν = 1, which corresponds to an elasticity of substitution of one, and choose ω
to set capital’s share equal to one-third at a capital-output ratio of three. The capital share
in general is

                         ∂F (K, N )/∂K · (K/Y ) = ω(K/Y )1−ν .

With ν = 1, the capital share is one-third when ω = 1/3. With other values of ν, we adjust
ω appropriately. The interest rate is the marginal product of capital minus depreciation:

                                  rt = ω(Kt /Yt )−ν − δ.                                  (10)

Evaluated at a steady state with Kt /Yt = and ν = 1, we have r = 0.0511.

   A typical household’s problem includes the interest rate and labor income as inputs and
generates paths for consumption and net worth. We choose labor efficiencies eit = 1 for
agents of working age and zero otherwise. Working age starts at age Iw = 21 and ends at
retirement age Ir = 65. Finally, we set σ = 1 (log utility) and choose β to match the steady
state ratio of aggregate net worth to output of three. Since net worth and the capital stock
are the same, net foreign assets is zero in the benchmark case.

                                               13
4.2   Steady states


The interaction between the supply of capital by households and the demand for it by
firms takes its cleanest form in a steady state, where we can capture its properties in a
supply-and-demand diagram.

   Demand is relatively simple. The demand for capital comes from the first-order condition
(7). If we express capital as a ratio to output, the inverse demand function is equation (10).
This equation holds at every date, as well as in a steady state.

   Supply requires calculations that go beyond what we can show in an equation or two.
But suppose we have a steady state age distribution for the population. Then we can
compute the ratio of aggregate net worth to output for any constant interest rate. The
overlapping generations structure is essential here. In a representative agent model, supply
in a steady state is horizontal at the discount rate (1 − β)/β. Here there is some slope,
which depends on intertemporal elasticity.

   The results of these two sets of calculations are pictured in Figure 13. The downward-
sloping line is demand, the upward-sloping one is supply. They cross by design at our steady
state point: K/Y = A/Y = 3 and r = 0.0511. We show two examples of each. The solid
downward-sloping line is the demand curve for ν = 2/3 and the dashed line the demand
curve for ν = 3/2. As we might guess from (10), the line is flatter when ν is smaller. The
supply curves depend in a less obvious way on household decisions, but they have a similar
form. The solid line corresponds to σ = 1/2 and the dashed line to σ = 2. Evidently
the line gets flatter as we increase σ. In what follows, we compute steady states for the
intermediate values ν = σ = 1 (log utility and Cobb-Douglas production).

   Now consider the impact of an increase in life expectancy on the steady state from 65 to
80. That doesn’t change the demand for capital, because life expectancy has no impact on
the marginal product of capital. It does change the supply of capital. As we see in Figure
14, an increase in life expectancy increases the supply of capital. In a closed economy, we
get an increase in the capital-output ratio and a decline in the interest rate. These effects
of aging are well-known features of OG models. Here the impact combines two effects. One
is a composition effect - we have more households at ages associated with high net worth.
The other is that households have more wealth at all ages. The mechanism is one noted by


                                             14
Bloom, Canning, and Graham (2003): with longer life expectancy, households save more.
We see this in Figure 15, where net worth rises at most ages. The dashed line in the figure
shows the effect of the composition effect alone: we fix net worth at all ages but change the
age distribution. We see that this is a small part — less than ten percent — of the shift in
supply.

    In an open economy facing a fixed interest rate, the impact of increased life expectancy
falls entirely on aggregate net worth. The demand for capital, and therefore the capital-
output ratio, doesn’t change, but with aggregate net worth rising, the result is a positive
steady state net foreign asset position. If we take a general equilibrium perspective, we
might imagine a world with two countries, one with longer life expectancy than the other.
The equilibrium interest rate will split the difference, leading the country with longer life
expectancy to lend to the other — forever, if this situation continues.

    There are two important insights to be derived from this way of modelling capital flows
with demographic changes: First, the most important effect of demographic changes come
from increases in life expectancy and not from changes in the composition of cohort. Second,
it is differences in the change in life expectancy that drives persistent capital flows


5    Country dynamics

We now compute time paths for net foreign assets and other variables for our four countries.
In each case, all firms and all households in each country take interest rates and wage rates
as given at any time. The interest rate is computed endogenously as the rate that clears the
capital market between the United States, Japan and Germany. We emphasize that this is
not an implicit assumption that these three countries constitute the global capital market.
There are other big players - China, the oil exporting countries - that are big contributors
to capital flows. Here we study the evolution of capital flows for one reasonable endogenous
interest rate path as an example to see how effective demograpic differences might be it
explaing observed capital flows.

    The computed interest path is in line with the findings of other work: the interest rate
declines steadily from about 2000 to 2020. That is, as we’ve seen, the likely impact of
increases in life expectancy worldwide as households save more to compensate for increased
life expectancy.

                                              15
   The other parameters are similar to those in our steady state calculations. We use log
utility (σ = 1) and a Cobb-Douglas production function (ν = 1). The discount factor is
chosen to match steady state net worth for a benchmark economy and is the same in all
countries.

   The differences are in the demographics. We take mortality rates from the WHO’s
Global Health Observatory and update them using equation (9), with the shift zt chosen to
match reported life expectancy. This gives us the survival probabilities that enter household
consumption and saving decisions. Since mortality rates change with time, every generation
has different ones. The age distributions are adapted from the UN’s World Population
Prospects. They report distributions every five years from 1950 to 2100 for five-year cohorts.
We interpolate them to get annual numbers.

   The last input is the initial values of household asset positions. We compute initial asset
positions from their steady state values. From that point on, asset positions are computed
recursively, starting in 1950. We report capital stocks and flows starting in 1980, with the
hope that the effect of the initial conditions has worn off.


5.1     Capital Flows


Figure 17, shows the change in net foreign assets as a percentage of GDP implied by the
model with the endogenous interest rate path. This picture can be usefully compared to
Figure 1 which plots the Current Account in the data for these four countries. The ratio of
Net Foreign Assets to GDP implied by these flows is shown in Figure 18.


5.1.1    U.S. and Japan


It is useful to begin by looking at the flows between the U.S. and Japan, an exercise
that mimics the work in Henricksen (2002). The paths are broadly similar to what we
saw in Figure 1 for the last three decades, with the US experiencing capital inflows and
Japan capital outflows. The difference between the two, in the model, is due entirely to
demography largely the difference in the rate at which life expectancy is changing. Obviously
other factors have an influence, too, but this suggests that demography is an important
starting point.

                                              16
    We also see that Japan’s three decades of capital outflows is projected to reverse course
a bit over the next several years and then increase again.

    One issue for Japan is that its capital-output ratio has risen significantly over the last
twenty years;see Figure 10. That’s inconsistent with our model unless either Japan has
a different technology or faces, for some reason, a different interest rate than the other
countries. This increase in capital tends to offset what would otherwise be an even larger
increase in net foreign assets.


5.1.2   Germany and China


Figure 17 also shows the pattern of flows implied by the model for German and China.
The patterm for Germany roughly fits German experience, with the exception of the 1990s,
when the country was focused on unification of what was formerly East and West Germany.

    Chinese demographics of course are striking and the changes in life expectancy are
dramatic. These factors alone account for significant capital flows given world interest rates,
but it is still a huge challenge to account for China’s sky-high saving rate. Clearly, the simple
overlapping generations structure cannot account for a lot of the Chinese experience and
the role of state directed savings. We’ve seen that the capital-output ratio isn’t out of line,
but it strikes us as unlikely that a model of this sort will explain what others have failed to
explain. But see, among others, Chamon and Prasad (2010), Coeurdacier, Guibaud, and
Jin (2013), Wei and Zhang (2011), and Yang, Zhang, and Zhou (2010).



6    Concluding Comments

In recent years there has been significant angst expressed in the economics literature over the
persistence in international capital flows. Many view these so called “global imbalances”
as a threat the stability of the international financial system. We argue that perisistent
phenomena have persistant causes and the one of the most important and neglected drivers
is demographic change.

    We have shown that the most important element of demographic change is the change
in life expectancy or more precisely the difference inthe change in life expectancy across

                                               17
countrieson. These changes in life expectancy can explain much of the pattern of capital
flows across countries. Moreover, these changes in life expectancy and the concomittant
incentive to save more are quite consistent with the pattern of declining interest rates over
the past two decades.

   We have deliberately kept this model simple to highlight the important role of demo-
graphics for capital flows. Clearly there are other important differences across countries
that drive capital flows - productivity differences, tax rates on capital and retirement poli-
cies that affect savings and investment. These are all candidates for inclusion in a richer
model.
