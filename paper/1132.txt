                          ABSTRACT


     In this paper we extend the recent work on the choice of

input mix under uncertainty. In particular, we demonstrate that

the qualitative nature of the disturbance term, along with the

decision sequence, is a crucial determinant of the overall

effect of uncertainty on the optimal input mix of a firm. Using

general demand and production functions in conjunction with a

mean-variance framework for financial valuation, we demonstrate

the differential effects of systematic and non-systematic risk

on the firm's choice of an optimal input mix. Consistent with

earlier work in economics, this analysis demonstrates that

uncertainty, regardless of the source, has important implications

for the firm's choice of technology.

       Much of the recent work in financial economics can be viewed as an

attempt to synthesize contemporary financial market theory with the theory

of the firm under uncertainty. This line of research analyzes firm behavior

using models that explicitly incorporate the capital market's valuation of

risk. The early results indicate that this basic approach holds great promise

in   its   ability to consider the financial market effects on a host of deci-

sions made at the firm level.

       In this paper we extend the recent work of Greenberg, Marshall, and

Yawitz [1] and Shrieves [31 on the choice of input mix under uncertainty.

In particular, we demonstrate that the qualitative nature of the disturbance

term, along with the decision sequence, is a crucial determinant of the over-

all effect of uncertainty on the optimal input mix of a firm. Using general

demand and production functions in conjunction with a mean-variance frame-

work for financial valuation, we demonstrate the differential effects of

systematic and non-systematic risk on the firm's choice of an optimal input

mix. Consistent with earlier work in economics, this analysis demonstrates

that uncertainty, regardless of the source, has important implications for

the firm's choice of technology.1 When the source of the uncertainty is

firm specific, there is no need to take account of any reaction in the capital

markets; the risk-free rate of interest is the only relevant financial market

variable. We refer to the relationship between this type of uncertainty and

the choice of an optimal input mix as the "technical effect." However, when

the uncertainty is of the type that affects all firms in the economy, the

technology decision must also explicitly recognize the reaction of the finan-

cial markets.      In a rate of return framework, this market feedback will serve

to alter the firm's (or project's) required capitalization rate. This "finan—
                                   -2-

cial effect will, for the majority of firms, partially reverse the techni-

cal effect.


              II.   Sources of Risk and the Optimal Capital Stock


     In this paper we analyze the input choices of a firm that faces un-

certain demand for its product. The model is attractive in that it captures

two very important features of firm behavior. First, the uncertainty is the

result of demand disturbances. This specification seems reasonable since

the firm presumably has more information about technological and cost factors

than it has about consumer behavior. Second, the model affords the firm

flexibility in its production decision. In particular, we assume that the

firm is allowed to choose its variable factor inputs after demand is revealed.

     The particular model used in this paper assumes that the firm produces

its output using capital (K) and labor (L) according to the following pro-

duction function.


     (1) q = F(K,L)                            0   FKK,FLL < 0
                                    FK, FL >


The choice of output and input levels proceeds in two stages. Prior to the

revelation of the actual demand for its product, but with the knowledge of

the distribution of demand, the firm must choose its capital stock. The

demand curve is then revealed and the firm selects the quantity of labor

(and consequently the price and quantity of its output) that maximizes

profit.2 The only decision made under uncertainty (ex ante) is the choice

of K. This choice is made so as to maximize the net present value of the

cash flows. Under the assumptions of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM),

the value of the cash flows is given by equation (2).

               X. = net          cash flow of firm i


               Xm =       net cash flow to the market portfolio

               A     =    the    market price of risk.


The net cash flow is defined as revenue minus the variable costs of pro-

duction. The net present value of these cash flows is simply V1 minus

the acquisition cost of the capital, where p                  is the price of capital goods.3


        (3) NPV.               V. -


From this perspective, it is clear that the cash flow variable in equation

(2) must incorporate this conditional optimization. To analyze the effects

of demand uncertainty we assume that the firm faces an inverse demand function

of the form


        (1+)   p =   p(q) +

where          has zero mean, and c and XM are jointly normal variables with

variances          and a, respectively. Defining q(K,) as the optimal condi-

tional output, X is given by


        (5) X. =         [p(q*(K,c))+E]q*(K,c)      -
                                                        C(q(K,C),K)   =   X.(K,e),

where C(q"(K,c),K), the variable cost of production, is an increasing
                            2
convex function of q with        0. From Hoelling's Lemma it follows that
                                                  -4-
X.(K,c)    is an increasing function of c. Using this relationship, we

are able to determine the effect of uncertainty on the choice of an optimal

capital stock.

     Substituting equations (2) and (5)                   into   equation (3), we obtain


                                              —                          —
     (6) NPV. =       —

Note that COV(X(K,c),XM) will be non-zero only if c is correlated with XM.

Thus, there are valuation effects associated with systematic disturbances

that are not associated with firm specific disturbances.5 The implication

of this distinction for the choice of an optimal capital stock will now

be analyzed.

     The first order condition for the maximization of net present value is

given by

    3X' (K,c)
C0v[ K ,             Xx],   the covariance between the incremental cash flows and

the cash flows to the market portfolio, will be of the same sign as COV(c,XM),

except if the demand disturbance is firm specific in which case this term

vanishes.6 In that case the optimal capital stock, K*, is defined implicitly by


     (8)

                                 I   -=o.
Note that K is also the solution that would obtain if risk neutrality were

assumed, since in a risk neutral world X

     Since A > 0 the optimal capital stock in presence of systematic risk,

K"', will be lower (higher) than K' if COV(e,XM) > 0                     (   < 0).    This follows

because the covarinace of the incremental cash flows and XM has the same
                                     -5-
sign   as COV(c,XM), and because the second order condition for yalue maxi-

mization implies that NPV must be concave in K.

       The intuition here is straightforward. Holding constant total demand

variability, an increase in the systematic component will reduce the optimal

capital stock since "flexibility in the production process becomes increas-

ingly important. By replacing fixed costs (capital) with variable costs

(labor), the firm   is   able to dampen the procyclical nature of its profit

stream, and thereby reduce the penalty for positive coyariance. At the same

time this reduces expected profits. This substitution of labor for capital

continues to the point where the valuation effect from an additional reduc-

tion in profit variability is exactly equal to the yaluation effect frojn an

additional decrease in expected profit.

       Given the above results, one can also demonstrate that       < 0.   for the

positive covariance firm, indicating that further substitution of labor for

capital is justified for the reasons cited above.

       We have demonstrated that a systematic demand disturbance leads to a

lower optimal capital stock than does an equal size non-systematic distur

bance. We emphasize that this does not imply that non-systematic risk has

no effect on the capital stock decision of a firm. To the contrary, there

are technical effects that accompany both systematic and non-systematic risk.

       An increase in the variance of c whether systematic or non-systematic

will affect the optimal capital stock, independent of any financial effect.

Equivalently, even in a risk neutral world the optimal capital stock of a

firm will depend upon the variance of demand. The basic argument is as fol

lows. Since marginal costs are a positive function of output, X(K,c). is

convex in     for any giyen level of K.8 Thus, the expected value of X1(K,c),
                                  -6-

and therefore expected profit, is a decreasing function of the variance of E.

If   it is possible to alter the convexity of X1(K,) by adjusting K, then the

firm will have an incentive to change K when the variance of    changes.

Stated alternatively, if substitution of labor for capital flattens the

firm's marginal cost curve, it will also change the sensitivity of expected

profits to the variance in demand. Given the general nature of the demand

and cost function assumed, it is impossible to determine whether an increase

in     induces the firm to choose a higher or lower capital stock. A positive

technical effect (> 0) will occur if two conditions are met. First, ex-
                   dci
pected profits must be concave in K. This will be met If the second order

sufficiency condi tion for expected profit maximiation is satisfied. Second,

the convexity of the relationship between     and c must be increasing in K.9

It is this latter condition that cannot be signed for general demand and cost

functions. However, it is quite reasonable to believe that an increase in

K will flatten the marginal cost curve for most cost functions. This in

conjunction with a marginal revenue curve that is linear or convex is suffi-

cient to ensure that the technical effect is positive.10


                           III. Conclusions


      We have demonstrated that even under risk neutrality demand uncertainty

will affect the optimal capital stock. We term this the technical effect

and have shown it is present regardless of whether the risk is systematic or

non-systematic in nature. We have also demonstrated that systematic risk

causes the typical (positive covariance) value maximizing firms to choose a

smaller capital stock than would be selected if only the technical effect

were considered. That is, for firms whose income is positively correlated
                                   —7-

with   the market as a whole, the financial effect induces a decreased demand
for capital in an amount depending on the size of the covariance between the

incremental cash flow to the firm from a given increase in capital and the

returns to the market portfolio.

      In this Appendix we prove formally that a sufficient condition for a
                                                     *

increasing in K. Let f(K,) =                           , and      let K be the optimal capital stock

when c = 0 with certainty. By Taylor series expansion f(K,c) can be expressed

as follows


       (Al) f(K,) =      f(K,0)   +                    +       (K—K)


where the derivatives are evaluated at c                               and K =   8K+(.l-)K   for 0 < z,8 < 1.

An expected profit maximizer will set the expected value of (Al) equal to

By construction f(K,0) will also equal URF. Therefore, the optimal capital stock

of an expected profit maximizer can be related to K as follows

     7Since K" is the solution that obtains when systematic risk is not

present, one would expect the same solution for an expected profit maximizer.

This is indeed the case. Multiplying equation (8) through by RF, we obtain

a condition that states that the marginal contribution of a unit of capital

to the expected value of revenues minus labor costs must equal the implicit

rental rate of capital. This is precisely the condition one obtains when

maximizing expected profits.

     1While this paper analyzes the choice of an optimal stock of physical

capital, our approach is generalizable to other decisions including adver-

     2The model is sufficiently general to include both competitive and non-

competitive structures in the output market. However, we assume that the

input markets are competitive. Where appropriate, we will discuss the in-

fluence of product market structure on the results of the paper.

        Since we are using an explicit valuation framework, the input price

of capital need not include a capitalization rate.

        The assumption of additive uncertainty is made simply for convenience.

The qualitative results remain if the uncertainty is multiplicative.

     5Th1s statement needs to be qualified slightly. Since this firm is a

part of the market portfolio, even firm specific disturbances will appear in

XM. However, given the large number of firms in the economy, this effect will

be of such a small magnitude for the average firm in the capital market that it

can be essentially ignored. In any event, it is clear that the covariance be-

tween the cash flows of a particular firm and the market is usually dominated

by system wide disturbances.

     6The covariance between the incremental cash flows to this firm and the

cash flow to the market portfolio will be positive if c and XM are positively

correlated. The following argument demonstrates this point. Since c and X are
joint normal variables1,

revenue curve and a marginal cost curve that is flatter the higher K are suffi-

cient to make this derivative positive, and yield a positive technical effect.

    'Loist1 (1976) discusses the conditions under which this is a valid pro-

cedure. Basically, the requirements are that the partial derivatives of f(K,c)

between K and K, and between e and 0 must all exist and be continuous.
