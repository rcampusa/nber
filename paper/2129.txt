                Ultimate Sources of Aggregate Variability




                                ABSTRACT




     What, ultimately, is different from quarter to quarter or year to year
that accounts for the fact that macroeconomic variables change over these
intervals? That is, which are the biggest ultimate sources, in terms we may
say of tastes, technology, endowments, government policy, industrial
organization, labor-management relations, speculative behavior, or the like,
that change to cause this variability?

     There are a bewildering variety of claims in the literature for such
ultimate sources. Far fewer efforts have been made to give a breakdown of
the variance of macroeconomic aggregates by source. The two notable such
breakdowns to date are by Pigou (1929) and Fair (1987).

     The nature of the evidence for such breakdowns is discussed here, and
the possibility that a partial breakdown may be well-determined is put
forward. An unsuccessful attempt is made to detect a component of
macroeconomic fluctuations that is due to the weather.

      Any empirical model of the macroeconomy tells a story about the

 exogenous shocks that are ultimately responsible for changes from year to

 year in macroeconomic variables. The characterization of these sources of

 aggregate variability is of fundamental importance. Economic theory cannot

 be applied to data unless we know which economic relations are       them-

 selves shocked, or at least unless we know something about the shocks.1

      Recent models have differed widely in their characterizations of these

ultimate sources of aggregate variability. Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott

 (1982) and others proposed models of the business cycle in which the only

shocks to the macroeconomy are certain kinds of shocks to technology. Robert

Barro (1977) proposed a model in which 78% of the variance of a (trans-

formed) U. S. unemployment rate 1946-73 is due to unexpected changes in the

money stock, and military employment and minimum wage variables. David

Lilien (1982) argued that most of the unemployment fluctuations in the U. S.

in the l970's were due to "unusual structural shifts," such as changes in

the demand for produced goods relative to services. James Hamilton (1983)

argued that dramatic oil price shocks preceded all but one of the recessions

in the U. S. since World War II, and that these oil price shocks were in

turn caused by events such as the nationalization of Iranian assets

the Suez crisis, and strikes by oil and coal workers.

     Others have offered analyses that, while not necessarily claiming to

isolate the major source of aggregate fluctuations, do suggest that

qualitatively very different exogenous shocks may be quite important:

changes in desired consumption (Robert Hall, 1986), breakdowns in the

process of borrowing and lending (Ben Bernanke, 1981), breakdowns or estab-


                                      1
lishments of cartels (Julio Rotemberg and Garth Saloner, 1986), or varia-

tions in attitudes toward union membership (Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence

Summers, 1986). Moreover, any of these shocks might occur in a foreign

country, and be transmitted by trade relations to the domestic economy. Some

analyses have even emphasized that something that ought to be, by any

fundamental logic, truly irrelevant to the inacroeconomy, may well impor-

tantly influence it if people think it does, e. g., Michael Woodford (1987).

The potential importance of such variables may be even more important than

suggested in some papers in the theory literature if we allow for near-

rational expectations' as well as the strictly rational expectations.

     Recent evidence (John Campbell and N. Gregory Mankiw (1987)) suggests

that innovations in real gross national product (GNP) show little tendency

to be reversed subsequently, and that the apparent tendency of GNP to be

trend-reverting may be due to spurious trend estimation.2 To the extent that

this is right, then variations in the same sources that explain long-run

growth (and explain why the U. S. is wealthier than India or China) would

also play a role in explaining short-run movements. If cultural or institu-

tional factors influencing the dissemination and application of learning are

the reason, then changes in these factors may play a role. If economies of

scale are a factor deterniining intercountry differences, then the discovery

of new industries or regions of production functions where such economies

obtain might also play a role. Other possible factors are changes in

government expenditure on "infrastructure" formation, government policies

and other factors encouraging or discouraging initiative, or just population

growth and natural resource discoveries and depletion.

     There seem to be a bewildering array of possibilities for ultimate


                                      2
 sources. It is important to understand that it is in principle possible that

 they might all contribute substantially. It is technically possible that ten

 different independent shocks each might make a contribution whose standard

deviation is 32% (      J0.l)   of the standard deviation of the aggregate. Thus,

for each of the ten factors there may be evidence that it is often very

important and occasionally dominates aggregate fluctuations. Or, it is

possible that 100 independent factors each may make a contribution whose

standard deviation is 10% of the aggregate standard deviation.

     One is naturally led to wonder if there isn't any systematic way to

determine what is the relative importance of different sources of macroeco-

nomic variability.



                     I. Pigou's Analysis of Ultimate Sources

     A. C. Pigou's remarkable book Industrial Fluctuations (1929) appears

to be the most recent effort until now to provide such a systematic break-

down of sources. He grouped these sources into three broad categories. "Real

Causes" are "changes that have occurred, or are about to occur, in actual

industrial conditions and expectations based on these are true or valid

expectations." The principal real causes he cites are: (1) harvest varia-

tions, (2) inventions, (3) industrial disputes, (4) changes in fashion, (5)

wars, and (6) foreign demand and foreign openings for investment. "Psycho-

logical causes" are "changes that occur in men's attitude of mind, so that,

on a constant basis of fact, they do not form a constant judgment." "Autono-

mous monetary causes" are events affecting money, such as gold discoveries,

or changes in monetary or banking policies.3 He thought that removal of the

either the autonomous monetary or the psychological causes might reduce the


                                          3
amplitude of industrial fluctuations by about a half. Removal of harvest

variations might reduce amplitude by about a quarter. He thought that other

real causes, such as inventions or work stoppages, had much less effect.4

     Of the above sources, only one, the psychological, appears largely

absent from contemporary macroeconomics, though it might be interpreted as

present in some macroeconometric models in the form of error terms. Pigou

here describes swings in optimism or pessimism affecting investment that

arise "spontaneously," though perhaps ultimately as a "psychological reflex"

from some of the same factors that he calls "real" causes.5 He emphasized

that the swings occur simultaneously over a large number of people, because

of "psychological interdependence", "sympathetic or epidemic excitement", or

"mutual suggestion".6 He denied what we now call "rational expectations"

because there is "instability in the facts being assumed," though he

admitted that "if everything were absolutely stable, recurring every year

with exact similarity or in a perfectly regular progression, people could

not fail to be aware of the relevant facts and to form correct judgments."7

     What sort of evidence might Pigou have that his list comprises the

important sources? Although he made some use of statistics, his method

involves judgment that appears to be based on anecdotal and narrative

historical evidence. Such a method may in fact be of some use for this

purpose. A rough sense of proportion about some economic mechanisms may

suggest that if certain factors would change exogenously, there would be

important macroeconomic consequences. If these factors did indeed change

historically, then the only question that remains is whether such a change

could be purely endogenous, i. e. , caused ultimately by other economic

variables. We may then have some idea whether these factors are likely to be


                                      4
determined reliably by such other economic variables.

     Consider for example the case of the autonomous monetary causes. In the

contemporary context, we know that the Fed can and does move interest rates,

which have a major impact on the economy. Of course, the announced goal of

the Fed currently is to stabilize the economy, and their efforts may indeed

attenuate the effects of other shocks. But since their methods are judg-

mental and imprecise, it is to be expected that they must also serve to

shocks themselves. By analogy, if we analyzed the movements of an airplane

in rough weather, we would expect to find that a component of the airplane's

movements is ultimately due to the pilot.

     Methods like Pigou's are suggestive, but one might hope for something

more objective and quantitative.



           II. Evidence from Large-Scale Macroeconometric Models

     The large-scale macroeconometric models in the Keynesian tradition

appear to be the only models detailed enough to allow a decomposition of

output variability into a variety of constituent shocks as broad as that

proposed by Pigou. In these models, all macroeconomic fluctuations can be

traced ultimately to equation residuals or exogenous variables.

     Ray Fair (1987) has undertaken stochastic simulations of Fair Model of

the U. S. economy to show what are the important shocks to the model. The

Fair model is similar to most large-scale macroeconometric models in that it

includes consumption and investment functions, and a national income

identity to yield an IS curve, and demand for money equations that gives

rise to an LM curve. Monetary policy is modelled by a Fed reaction function,

but fiscal policy is taken to be exogenous.


                                      5
    To take account of shocks to exogenous variables, he added simple auto-

regressive forecasting equations for 23 exogenous variables to the 30 struc-

tural equations in his model, producing a 53 equation model with basically

no exogenous variables. Taking as given data through 1981 second quarter, a

stochastic simulation, the base simulation, was run using a 53 x 53 (block

diagonal, with a 30 x 30 and 23 x 23 block) variance covariance matrix

residuals, and the variance of actual real GNP for one to eight quarters

ahead (that is, 1981 third quarter through 1983 second quarter). He then set

residuals for the eight quarters to zero in each of the 53 equations, one at

a time and then in groups, and ran new stochastic simulations. The variance

in real GNP in any one of these simulations as a percent of the variance in

the base simulation is a measure of the importance of the residual that is

analogous to the square of the relative amplitudes described by Pigou.

     What is striking about the results is that the conclusions differ

substantially between one-quarter-ahead simulations and eight-quarter-ahead

simulations. For example, if we drop the error term to the inventory

investment equation real GNP variance falls by 29% relative to the base

simulation in the one-quarter-ahead simulations, but by only 4% in the

eight-quarter-ahead simulations. If we drop the error term in all investment

equations (consumer durables, housing, inventories and business fixed

investment) the corresponding figures are 50.6% and 13.4% . Thus, failure to

predict investment accounts for most of the model's difficulty in forecast-

ing one quarter ahead, but relatively little of the difficulty in making

longer-run forecasts. Other sources of variability grow faster with time

horizon, so that uncertainty about investment is swamped out.

     The story told by the Fair model is a complicated one, with no single


                                      6
source of variability dominating. Consider the percentage variance declines

 in the eight-quarter-ahead simulations for real GNP. Dropping all exogenous

variables' shocks reduced variance by 44%, the remainder being accounted for

by equation residuals. The principal grouping of exogenous variables was

government expenditure and transfers (federal, state, and local), for 21%,

and after that, exports, for 19%. Among endogenous variables, dropping

residuals on consumption on services and nondurables reduced variance by

10%, on the wage and price sector by 11%, and on import demand by 7%.

Dropping Federal Reserve policy shocks reduced variance by only 3%.

     What sort of evidence is behind the Fair Model that gave rise to these

variance decompositions? The modelling effort relied on the assumption that

a large list of variables is exogenous. Many of these are not plainly exo-

genous to the model, though one might suppose that their relation to econo-

mic activity is in some cases tenuous, complicated, and involving long lags.

The modelling effort also relied on a set of restrictions on coefficients

that vastly overidentified the model. Because of these overidentifying

restrictions, the estimate of the reduced form was not at all the same as if

it had been estimated by merely regressing endogenous variables on exogenous

and predetermined variables. The restrictions sometimes have the effect, for

example, of inferring an effect of an exogenous variable on GNP from an

observed effect on a component of GNP.

     These overidentifying restrictions were usually not explicitly dis-

cussed in the description of the model. Their specification appears to have

largely intuitive origins, just as was the case with the theory of Pigou.

One would wish that there were a method that was more capable of producing a

consensus in the profession as to ultimate sources.


                                      7
              III. Partial Specifications of Exogenous Sources

     Many doubt the assumptions of the large-scale macroeconometric models.

But, certainly some of their assumptions must be uncontroversial. Certainly

some variables (e. g., the weather) would be judged genuinely exogenous by

just about everyone. It would be progress if we could all agree that such a

variable explains x% of macroeconomic variability, even if x is very small.

Might not a Cranger or Sims causality test for causality from such a

variable to real GNP produce such an agreement?

     But it's hard to think of any single measurable clearly exogenous

variable that seems likely to have much impact on the aggregate economy. We

have a wealth of data at a finely disaggregated level, for example, informa-

tion on individual patents each of which represents a component of technolo-

gical progress. But how to aggregate this information into a data series

that might be found to cause GNP? We cannot regress GNP on hundreds of

exogenous variables each of which explains a component of it, since we would

have more independent variables than available observations.

     Weather variables are probably the most obvious candidates for a truly

exogenous variable that might really cause macroeconomic aggregates.

Regression models explaining individual crop yields (e. g., Wolfgang Baier,

1977) show that weather variables explain a substantial portion of year-to-

year crop variability. Often the R2 is over 0.5. But to achieve such R2 for

individual crops the researcher uses finely focussed weather variables that

differ across crops, such variables as "estimated June potential evapotran-

spiration," or "mean soil moisture reserves (mm) at heading stage in 0-100

cm. depth of soil." To explain aggregates well, these weather variables


                                      8
 should be measured at all the appropriate times and sites for the specific

crops to which they pertain. To explain weather effects on nonagricultural

productive activities would require yet very different weather variables. To

explain housing starts, we may use number of days in the year where tempera-

ture is below freezing, to explain restaurant meals the number of evenings

of inclement weather and highway conditions in urban areas, to explain

electricity demand an average of a nonlinear function of summer temperatures

above 75 degrees, to explain heating fuel demand an average of a nonlinear

function of winter temperatures below 60 degrees.8 It is not easy to find a

good aggregator of these shocks other than GNP (or its analogues) itself.

     I have attempted (see Appendix) to find an effect on net national

product of a couple of weather indices that I constructed: a summer precipi-

tation variable and a summer temperature variable. The aggregation of

national weather data for these indices took the form of summing summer

precipitation data and summer temperature data over four different weather

stations across the United States. These are crude indices, only four sites

are used, and there is no accounting for the geographical distribution of

important crops. No significant effect could be found for net national

product 1895-85, or in an earlier sample period 1895-1929. That the weather

variables are not completely off the mark is indicated by the fact that the

precipitation index is highly significant in explaining gross farm product.



                         IV. Models as Aggregators

     Finding an aggregator of very many exogenous shocks means building a

highly disaggregated model that explains many components of GNP and shows

how they interact to produce the total. If models are to be judged as


                                      9
aggregators, then models may be deemed successful even if they have known

structural defects that would cause them to be rejected by conventional

criteria. An aggregator model might be only a naive or crude model. For

example, we might build a large Leontief input-output model. Data on the

implementation of technological innovations, weather, or other known

exogenous shocks could be used to adjust using engineering or statistical

data the elements of the input-output matrix and the matrix of factor input

requirements. We might find that an index of structural change in the model

aggregates successfully (e. g., Granger-causes GNP) even though we know that

the assumption of fixed proportions is highly restrictive.

     Large macroeconometric model projects that deal laboriously with

details may thus yield insight into sources of variability. Existing large-

scale macroeconometric models may be viewed, even by those who accept some

of the well-known criticism of their theory, as having shown some such

success already (see Ray Fair and myself, 1987). It is natural to expect

that further progress can be made along these lines, taking account of

developments in economic theory and data, if people are willing to do more

work at a detailed level, and for many different countries.



                             V. Interpretation

     There is as yet no consensus in the profession as to the quantitative

importance of     of the various ultimate sources. In my judgment, however,

the existing literature does suggest that a great multiplicity of sources is

at work: shocks to tastes as well as technology, shocks in government

policy, demographic shocks, shocks to organizations in labor or industry,

and "psychological" shocks of the kind described by Pigou and others.


                                     10
     Currently popular methodology results in models that attempt to make do

with very few shocks. These models are valuable as special cases but should

be interpreted as exploratory exercises. We should not consider it an

objective of research to simplify or reduce the array of exogenous shocks.

Simplicity is of course a virtue, but simple models cannot be construed as

an objective if the world is not simple.

             Weather Variables as Sources of Aggregate Variability

       The idea that weather or other shocks to acriculture is an important

cause of macroeconomic fluctuations has a long history. W. Stanley Jevons

(1884) and A. Piatt Andrew (1906) thought that harvest data were substanti-

ally correlated with the business cycle. Henry Moore (1914) noted a correla-
                                                                         Q
tion   i871-i9O8 between pig iron production and yield per acre of crops.

However, the statistical significance of these result is questionable, and

harvest or yield per acre variables may not be exogenous.

       It is perhaps of some interest that Jevons (1884) proposed his theory

that sunspots affect real output on the notion that sunspots affect argi-

culture. Anyone who tries to study weather affects on aggregates must first

find an aggregate weather variable. If the solar cycle influences weather,

some measure of the solar cycle might be potentially attractive as such a

variable. There is an enormous literature, continuing today, claiming

evidence that the solar cycle does indeed have substantial effects on

weather and agriculture. However, one survey of the literature concludes

that "There is at present little or no convincing evidence of statistically

significant or practically useful correlations between sunspot cycles and

weather or climate at intermediate time scales. This conclusion seems

justified despite massive literature on the subject."1Â° Sunspots have no

discernable effect on real GNP (Sheehan and Grieves (1982)11

       One might expect that weather variables might be demonstrated to have a

measurable impact on aggregates in less-developed countries, where agricul-


                                       12
 ture remains a very important component of total output. However, I have not

 been able to find evidence that someone has documented such an impact.12 A

 computer search revealed no evidence of any concern in the macroeconomic or

meteorological literature of the last 15 years with finding an effect of

weather on economic aggregates.

      In my own explorations with U. S. data, a measure of aggregate economic

activity was regressed on six own lagged values and on a current and two

lagged values of weather variables in the regression. These are not,

strictly speaking, Cranger causality tests since the current values of the

weather variables are included among regressors. The assumption is that the

regressors are known to be exogenous, and we are as interested in effects of

current values of the variables as in the effects on lagged values.

     Two weather variables were constructed, which were focused roughly on

agricultural production. One was a summer precipitation variable, the other

a temperature variable. Both variables were based on measurements taken at

four sites across the U. S..

     In these regressions, no significant impact of either the temperature

or the precipitation variable could be found on aggregate net national

product. This remains true even in an early sample period, 1895-1929. Of

course, reducing the sample size reduces degrees of freedom; we may just not

have enough data to detect the impact of weather in this earlier sample

period.

     The precipitation variable was highly significant in explaining gross

farm product. This suggests that weather ought to be considered an input to

aggregate variability, but that the effect is too small to be revealed in

regressions of NNP on weather variables.


                                     13
     Better-focussed weather variables might yield more substantial results.

However, it is perhaps unlikely that we can obtain long historical time

series on some finely focussed weather variables.

l.Garber and King pointed out that contemporary Euler equation estimation

methods always assume that the shocks come in somewhere else in the model,

but that this assumption will not do for every equation in the model (1983).


2.Their conclusion has been criticised by Clark (1986), Cochrane (1986),

Watson (1986) and others, and so must be regarded as tentative.


3.Pigou, Industrial Fluctuations, pp. 35.


4.ibid., p. 219-25. Note that Pigou's breakdown denies independence of

factors: he thought eliminating one may reduce the impact of another.


5.ibid., p. 73.


6.Ibid. p. 86. On this point, compare Woodford (this issue).


7.ibid. p. 74.


8.Deere and Miron (1986) regressed U. S. layoff rates by state and industry

on state-specific (but not finely focussed) weather variables and other

variables. The weather variables were significant at the 90% level in about

25% of the regressions, and were very significant overall.

11. Oddly, Sheehan, and Grieves (1982) concluded that GNP Granger-causes

sunspots. They thought this was an absurd result, and inferred that Granger

causality tests are unreliable. Bessler and Kling (1984) argued that the

Cranger causality tests are less vulnerable to such spurious conclusions if

certain precautions are taken.


l2.For example, P. K. Pani (1984) attempts to use weather variables to

explain aggregates in India, but does not find them significant. His weather

variables are not finely focussed.
