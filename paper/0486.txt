          ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE RISE OF SERVICE EMPLOYMENT


                              ABSTRACT


         The distribution of employment among Agriculture, Industry, and

Service within countries is closely related to the level of real Gross

Domestic Product per capita. As real income rises, Agriculture's share

falls, Service employment rises, and Industryts share rises to a peak

at about $3,300 (1970 dollars) per capita and then declines. U.S. time

series and OECD cross—sections follow almost identical patterns of

employment change. The decline of Agriculture is attributable primarily

to differences in income elasticity of demand but the shift from Industry

to Service is attributable primarily to differential rates of growth of

output per worker. Economic growth also contributes to the rise of

service employment through an increase in female labor force participation

because families with working wives tend to spend a higher proportion

of their income on services. Productivity tends to grow less rapidly in

the Service sector than in the rest of the economy, but the shift of

employment to Services was not a major factor in the slowing of aggregate

productivity in the United States in the 1970's.

Introduction

        Interest among economists in the interaction between economic

growth and the industrial distribution of employment goes back more than

forty years to the seminal work of Allan C. B. Fisher (1935) and Cohn

Clark (1940). "The most important concomitant of economic progress,"

wrote Clark, is "the movement of labor from agriculture to manufacture,

and from manufacture to commerce and services."   This prediction, it must

be stated at the outset, is not derived from economic theory. Changes in

the distribution of employment across industries are primarily the

result of differences in income elasticities of demand for different

goods and services and differences in rates of growth of labor productivity.

Such differences     exist, but there is nothing in economic theory that

tells us that they will, or that when they do the differences will be

systematic and predictable.

        Clark's generalization, as well as the findings to be discussed

in this paper, should be viewed as descriptions of empirical regularities,

not tests of theoretically grounded hypotheses. They are, nevertheless,

of considerable interest. They do throw light on the growth process as

it has in fact evolved. Given the robustness of the regularities, they do

permit private and public decisionmakers to anticipate shifts in employment.

And   they   may help us understand the extent to which shifts in the

distribution of employment can feed back on the growth process itself.

         A National Bureau of Economic Research project on the U.S. service

industries (Fuchs 1968, Fuchs 1969) provided substantial confirmation of

Clark's observation up to 1965, and also explored the reasons for the

inter—sectoral shifts in employment. Investigators in other countries

reported similar patterns (Of er 1967a, Lengellé 1966, Worton 1969, Deakin

and George 1965), although there is clearly some variation. The

USSR experience, for instance, shows that the rate of growth of services

can be altered by public policy. The Soviets seem to have made a deliberate

effort to favor employment in manufacturing and to hold back the development

of trade and services (Ofer l967b).-' In Latin America, by contrast, it

is my impression that the increase of employment in trade and services has

outpaced overall economic growth, possibly as an unintended consequence of

relatively high wages in manufacturing and other policies which accelerated

migration from rural to urban areas.

             In this paper I bring up to date a broad overview of the U.S.

experience and compare that experience with the pattern of development

in the OECD countries. A new functional form for relating employment

shares by sector to Gross Domestic Product is presented and its predictive

accuracy assessed. I then examine one possible intervening variable

between economic growth and the rise of service employment, namely an

increase in female labor force participation. Expenditure data from a



        'Another way of interpreting the USSR experience is to say that
the time of the consumer has been substituted for measured employment in
retail trade.

U.S. household survey are used to estimate the effects of a wife's

participation in the labor market on the demand for services vs. goods.

The paper concludes with a discussion of somepossible effects of the rise

of service employment on economic growth.

        The sector definitions used in this paper are the same as those

I used in The Service Economy: "Agriculture" includes farming, forestry

and fishing; "Industry" includes mining, construction, transportation,

communications, and public utilities, as well as manufacturing; "Service"

includes all other industries, most notably trade; finance, insurance,

and real estate; professional, personal, business, and repair services;

and government (except those government enterprises which carry on

activities similar to those covered in "Industry").' This classification,

which is admittedly arbitrary, is similar to the one employed by Simon

Kuznets in Modern Economic Growth (1966) and has been used by other

investigators as well. The most questionable decision, the placement of

transportation, communication, and public utilities in "Industry" rather

than "Service," had very little impact on any of the conclusions for the

United States.

        The measurement of real output in the Service sector is, of course,

notoriously weak because of difficulties in evaluating quality change

and because substantial portions of the output are not sold in conventional

markets. In my judgment, however, the most important conclusions regarding

Service—Industry differentials are not attributable to biases in measurement.

While growth of output in some branches of Service is probably understated

in the official accounts (e.g., government services, banking) there are



            three—fold classification into Agriculture, Industry and
Service is traditional. The rapid expansion of Service, however,
suggests that disaggregation of that sector is highly desirable,
although beyond the scope of this paper.

other industries, such as retail trade, where the rate of growth of output

is probably overstated (see Schwartzman 1969 in Fuchs 1969). Furthermore,

there are significant portions of Industry where the official measures of

real output are probably significantly biased (e.g., computer manufacturing,

airplane manufacturing, construction).

        Another measurement problem involves international comparisons

of Gross Domestic Product at a point in time. In this paper I use the

results of Irving Kravis and his colleagues (1978) to convert GDP estimates

in own currency into U.S. dollar equivalents by actual comparison of

prices. Such conversions undoubtedly come closer to the purchasing power

parity concept than do the official exchange rates. I have, however,

checked my results against those obtained using official exchange rates

and the qualitative conclusions regarding the relationship between

economic growth and sector employment shares are not sensitive to choice

of conversion method.




Gross Domestic Product and sector shares of employment

        Table 1 presents the distribution of employment by sector in the

United States since 1870 and shows its relation to per capita GDP (in 1970

U.S. dollars). This relation Is partially confounded by cyclical

fluctuations (Industry's share of employment decreases during recessions)

and by historical shifts in International trade patterns. Nonetheless,

the dramatic fallof Agriculture, the rise and then fall of Industry, and

the steady rise of Service employment is clearly discernible.

        To be sure, the shifts revealed in Table 1 could be the result of

historical changes in technology or tastes which happen to be correlated

with the trend in real GDP per capita. An examination of Inter—country

differences at a fixed point in time provides an alternative view of the

relation between economic growth and the distribution of employment.

Table 2 shows the cross—section relation between GDP per capita and sector

employment shares in OECD countries in 1970. The general pattern seems

roughly similar to that of the U.S. historical experience; the extent of

the similarity and the nature of the differences are explored through

regression analysis.

        In order to develop a realistic, estimable form that relates each

sector's share of employment to the level of GDP, I assume that:

        1) Agriculture's share is 1.0 at zero GDP per capita and approaches

            zero asymptotically as GDP rises: A = e (GDP)

        2) Service's share is zero at zero GDP per capita and approaches

            1.0 asymptotically as GDP rises:   S = 1 — e (GDP')

These equations were transformed to logarithms and estimated as a system

using a maximum likelihood iterative procedure:/'

            Ln A =     GDP         and    Ln(1 —5) =    SGDP1


Inasmuch as Industry's share equals one minus the shares of Agriculture and

Service by definition, the Industry equation is obtained as the residual:

            I =      S(GDP') —   (GDPa)

        These regressions were run for the U.S. historical data and for

OECD cross—sections in 1960, 1970, and 1976. For the OECD countries in

1970, GDP per capita in 1970 U.S. dollars was obtained from Kravis etal.

using the International Comparison Project direct estimates for eight

countries and Kravis et al. indirect estimates for the remainder. Real

GDP per capita in 1960 (or 1976) was estimated in U.S. 1970 dollars by

fixing the 1970 purchasing power parity estimate as the base and

extrapolating back to 1960 (or forward to 1976) using each country's own

estimated   rate of change of real GDP per capita.

        The results, presented in Table 3, show similar parameter values

for all four sets of estimates.-' Moreover, as shown in Table 4, the

correlation between the shares predicted by the regressions and the actual

shares is very high in all cases (the median coefficient is .88). Indeed,

the coefficients of correlation between cross—predictions (using equations

estimated from other series) and actual values are, on average, about as high

as the coefficients between the predicted and actual shares of the same series.

        The similarity of the patterns and the goodness of fit are also

revealed in the graphs of the U.S. and 1970 OECD equations presented in

Figure 1. The curves for Agriculture are virtually identical. The curves

for Industry and those for Service also reveal a close correspondence in the

shape of the U.S. time series and the OECD cross—section, but there is a

noticeable difference in levels. At any given level of real GDP per capita,

the U.S. has had a larger fraction of employment in Service and a smaller

fraction in Industry than have the other OECD countries. This may be

explained by differences in composition of exports, with Industry playing

a larger role in the other OECD countries and Agriculture playing a larger

role in the U.S. It is particularly interesting to note that both the

U.S. and the OECD equations predict a peak in Industry's share of employment

at approximately the same level of real GDP per capita——somewhere between

$3,000 and $3,500 in 1970 dollars.

        Inspection of the actual shares (also plotted on Figure 1) shows

that most observations fall very close to the estimated curves. For the

U.S. time series, the median residual (absolute) is approximately .01 in

each sector. As might be expected, 1930 and 1940 both show negative

residuals for Industry (— .03) because of the Depression.


        .JFor the three OECD sets of regressions, a test based on the
difference in the logarithms of the likelihood functions indicates that the
null hypothesis of no difference among the three years cannot be rejected,
evenatapof .5.

        For the OECD series the median residuals (absolute) are:

Agriculture .03, Industry .03, and Service .04. Most countries conform well

to the predictions, but there are a few notably large residuals, some of

which are also observed in 1960 and 1976 (not plotted). Turkey and Greece

consistently have a larger than predicted share of employment in Agriculture

and have large negative residuals in Industry. This may be related to the

employment of many Greek and Turkish nationals in other OECD countries.

The U.K. shows a large negative residual in Agriculture in 1960 and 1976

as well as 1970. The U.K. had a large positive residual in Industry in

1960; this was smaller in 1970 and had virtually disappeared in 1976.

        West Germany shows an interesting pattern with substantially more

employment in Industry in 1970 and 1976 than would be expected given its

real GDP per capita. This excess is exactly offset by a negative residual

in Service. The growth of industrial exports by Germany may account for

some of this pattern.

        One of the most demanding tests of an alleged economic relationship

is to see how well a cross—section regression predicts change over time.

Another test is to see if a time—series regression for one period in one

country predicts changes in other countries over a different time period.

By this standard, the functions portrayed in Figure 1 stand up rather well

(see Table 5). The actual changes in sector shares in the OECD countries

between 1960 and 1976 are positively correlated with predicted changes

based on either the 1970 OECD regression or the U.S. 1870—1978 regression.

        The correlation coefficient between actual and predicted change

is much lower for Service than for Industry or Agriculture, but this

seems to be because the variance in change is small. Between 1960 and

1976 every country showed an increase in the share of employment in Service;

the mean change was .12, but the standard deviation was only .04. Despite

the large change in the Service share in most countries, the difference

between the actual and predicted change (median absolute residual) was

less than .02 for half the countries and only two countries had absolute

residuals larger than .06.

        Although the correlation coefficient for Industry is higher than

for Service, the median absolute residual is actually higher also. During

the period 1960—76 many of the OECD countries were at levels of GDP per

capita that put them on the flat portion of the Industry employment share

curve. For those countries, changes in that share between 1960 and 1976

were affected relatively more by cyclical phenomena and country—specific

transitory factors in either 1960 or 1976 than by movement along the long—run

function.




Reasons for the rise of service employment in the U.S. since 1948

        The rise of Service employment in the course of economic growth

is certainly beyond question, but the reasons for the correlation are

more difficult to establish. Fisher and Clark both emphasized sector

differences in income elasticities of demand, and this view is also held

by many current writers (e.g., Richard Caves (1980)). I believe the

emphasis on differential income elasticities is correct if one thinks of

the expansion of the Service sector as part of the growth of nonagricultural

output relative to Agriculture. At higher levels of GDP per capita,

however, the principal phenomenon to be explained is the growth of Service

employment relative to Industry.-1 This differential, in my judgment, is

due more to differential trends in labor productivity than to differences

in income elasticities, at least in the United States.



        -"Agriculture becomes a much smaller and less important part of
the employment story.
                                               17


        Consider the measures in Table 6 which show sector rates of change

(and levels) of employment, output, and productivity in theU.S. from 1948 to

1978. We see that the rate of growth of employment in the Service sector

exceeded that in Industryby 1.55 percentage points per annum. By contrast, the

differential in the rate of growth of output (GDP1n 1972 dollars) was only

.40 percentage points per annum. Thus, in a purely statistical sense the

largest part of the differential trend in employment is attributable to the

differential trend in output perworker (1.15 percentage points per annum).-'

To be sure, thedifferential trend inreal GDPmay understate the effects of

sector differences in income elasticities somewhat because the rise in the

relative price of Service output probably deflected some demand to Industry.

On the other hand, some of the growth of real GDP in the Service sector does

not represent any real addition in service activity, but is attributable to

a shift of services formerly produced within Industry to separate

identifiable firms classified in the Service sector.

        It is important to note that not all of the differential in rate

of change of output per worker can be regarded as a pure productivity

differential. The sector difference in trends of output per unit of total

factor input is estimated from the trends in GDP in constant dollars

relative to GDP in current dollars as follows:


                       =     (0   —   G)   —     — Gt)


where   IT =   relative      total factor productivity;
        o =    GDP in constant dollars;

        G = GDP in current dollars;
        s =    sector   s;
        t =    total   economy
        and all variables are rates of change.

It follows that              —         = (0         —

This is a reasonable approximation unless the prices of factors of production

change at substantially different rates in Industry and Service, or unless

relative factor prices change substantially and there are marked differences

in factor proportions in the two sectors.

        The total factor productivity differential between Service and

Industry is only .73 percent per annum, indicating that part of the reason

for the large differential trend in output per worker (and for the growth

of Service employment) is the more rapid growth of other inputs (physical

and human capital) in Industry. This has occurred at a rate of .42 percent

per annum (1.15— .73), and this conclusion is independent of possible errors

in measuring constant dollar GDP in either sector.

        This result suggests several interesting questions for research.

Have other OECD countries experienced a similar pattern in recent decades?

Is the faster growth of capital per worker in Industry in the U.S.

attributable to non—neutral technological change, or to the greater amount

of unionization in Industry than in Service, or to other factors? Another

interesting research question is to identify the sources of the .73 percent

per annum "pure" productivity differential, e.g. economies of scale or

technological progress.




Female labor force participation and the demand for services

        In the U.S. data for 1870—1978, both real GDP per capita and the

service sector's share of total employment are highly correlated with the

female labor force participation rate)' One possible connection is that

the growth of Service employment induces a rise in female labor force



        'This correlation is not observed in the OECD cross—section
data.
                                   20


participation by expanding job opportunities in industries which have

traditionally been heavily female. Between 1950 and 1970 almost one—half

of the female—male differential in the rate of growth of employment is

attributable to changes in industry mix rather than to an increase in the

female share of employment in each industry (Fuchs 1978).

       A causal connection which runs from real GD? per capita to female

labor force participation is also plausible. Gary Becker (1965) and

Jacob Mincer (1962) have argued that economic growth tends to raise the

value of women's time in the labor market relative to the value of time

at home, thus inducing more women to participate in paid work. In recent

decades in the U.S. the increase in female labor force participation has

been notable among married women with spouse present and most notable among

those who have young children at home (see Table 7).

        When a wife enters paid employment, the household's demand for goods

and services may change differentially for two principal reasons. First,

the household will typically have more money income and income elasticities

of demand may differ. Second, the household may reallocate expenditures

because the wife now has less time for production in the home or because she

demands a different mix of commodities in connection with her work. For

instance, the household with a working wife may allocate a larger share of

expenditures to restaurant meals or to domestic servants, or the wife may

purchase an automobile in order to get to work.

        To explore the possible differential impact of rising female labor

force participation on the demand for goods and services, a statistical

experiment was performed on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics

Consumer Expenditure Survey 1972—73)' In order to increase the homogeneity

of the sample, the analysis was restricted to white, home—owning households

consisting of a wife, an employed husband, and one or two children under

the age of 18 (N =   829).   Unfortunately, it is not possible with these data

to make a consistent match between consumer expenditure classes and the

sector classifications previously discussed (based on employment and Gross

Domestic Product). I try to achieve rough comparability by grouping

expenditures into "goods," "services," and "other." "Goods" consist of

food, alcohol, and tobacco consumed at home; clothing; vehicles and

transportation; and all other durables. "Services" consists of food and

alcohol consumed away from home; vacations; domestic servants, laundry and

dry cleaning; and out—of—pocket expenditures for health and education.

"Other" is equal to the household's after—tax income minus "goods" and

"services." It includes saving, home mortgage payments, real estate taxes,

life insurance premiums, and a variety of miscellaneous goods and services,

such as heating fuel, telephone, and electricity.

        To determine the effect-' of a wife working on the share of

expenditures going to goods or services, the logarithm of the expenditure

share is regressed on a dummy variable "wife working full time" (compared

with wife not working at all) plus a large number of other variables

introduced to control for other factors that might affect expenditure shares.

These are: age of husband, education of husband, education of wife, number

and age of children, region of country, size of city, and the logarithm of

total expenditures. In one set of regressions total expenditures are equal

to goods plus services plus other. In the other set, the total is only the



        -1This model assumes that causality runs from the employment status
of wife to expenditure patterns, not the reverse. To the extent that the
reverse causality is true, the coefficient of the wife's work status variable
may be biased. I am grateful to Thomas MaCurdy for discussion of this point.

sum of goods and services. The dependent variable is always the logarithm

of the share of total expenditures in a particular class (i.e., goods,

services or other).

        The regression coefficient of the wife working variable shows the

difference between households with wife working full time and those with

wife not working in the share of total expenditures spent for the designated

class of commodities. Because the dependent variable is the logarithm of

the share, the coefficient indicates the percent differential. For example,

a coefficient of — .04 for goods in the first regression (Table 8) indicates

that in households with wife working the share of goods in total expenditures

is four percent less than in households with wife not working.

        Three regressions were run for each class in each set. In the first,

no other independent variables were included. In the second, all the other

variables except the log of total expenditures were included; this variable

was added in the third. Thus the third shows the reallocative effect net

of possible differential income elasticity effects.

        Table 8 indicates that the effect of a wife working on expenditure

shares is different for goods than for services and the difference is

statistically significant at p <   .01.   This result holds regardless of which

other variables are included and regardless of how "total expenditures" is

specified)1 The share of expenditures going to services seems to rise by

about 10 percent as a result of a wife going to work. (I.e., if the share

in a household with wife not working is .30, it would be .33 in a similar

household with a working wife.) The share going to goods seems to fall by

about three or four percent. The fact that the coefficients are very similar

regardless of whether the logarithm of total expenditures is held constant

specifications (not shown) which allow for possible interactions between
wife's work status and income.

or not suggests that the difference in effect on goods and services is

primarily due to reallocation rather than to differential income elasticities.

        If we take these results at face value, the reallocative effect of

a wife going to work is approximately .1. Thus, an increase in the female

labor force participation rate of one percentage point per year (the U.S.

experience since 1950 has come close to that rate of change) would imply

a shift of demand toward services of approximately .1 percent per annum.

This is about one—fourth of the .4 percent per annum shift in the service

sector's share of real GDP shown in Table 6.

        This experiment can hardly be regarded as definitive, but it does

suggest that in the U.S. the increase in female labor force participation

may have made a small contribution to the rise of service employment

through a reallocation of expenditures by households toward services.




Effects of the rise of service employment on economic growth

        At the present time there seems to be more interest in the

consequences of the rise in Service employment on economic growth than

in explanations of why growth shifts employment to Services. This interest

is undoubtedly triggered by the slowdown in aggregate productivity growth

in the United States and other countries, and the desire to attribute the

slowdown to some one or some thing. Because productivity rises more

slowly in Service than in Industry, some observers take it as self—evident

that the growth of the Service sector's share of employment must be a

major factor in the productivity malaise of the 1970's. A healthy skepticism

about such a facile explanation, however, is clearly in order. After all,

the shift to Service employment was every bit as strong during the earlier

post—war decades when aggregate productivity was rising rapidly.
                                    26


        Serious analysis must begin by noting that changes in the sector

distribution of employment can change the aggregate productivity trend

only through level effects, rate effects, and the interaction between these

effects. Level effects can be significant if the sectors differ substantially

in the level of productivity in the base year and if there are substantial

shifts in sector shares of constant dollar GDP over time. A classic

example of the level effect is the shift In constant dollar GDP from

Agriculture (a sector with relatively low base year productivity) to

Industry and Service. This shift undoubtedly contributed to aggregate

productivity growth in the United States and in other countries as well.

        The rate effect depends on sector differences in rates of growth

of productivity and on a shift in input shares between sectors.-' Thus

the decline in the share of employment in Agriculture (a sector with

particularly rapid productivity growth in the U.S.) has tended to slow

down the change in aggregate productivity.

        Given the relatively small share of Agriculture in the U.S. economy

in the 1970's (measured either in employment or GDP), it Is most fruitful

to concentrate on the Industry—Service differential in order to determine

the extent to which the shift to Service employment can explain changes

in aggregate productivity trends. Michael Grossman and I explored this

question in considerable detail with a series of simulations under a variety

of assumptions about sector levels and rates of change in productivity

(Grossman and Fuchs 1973). Given reasonable parameter values, based on U.S.

experience, we found that the growth of the Service sector relative to Industry

could account for only small changes in productivity trends even over a

fifty—year period. The principal reason is that the distribution of



             simplify, the following discussion will assume that there is
only one input——"employinent." The conclusion would not be materially
altered by consideration of multiple inputs.
                                        27


constant dollar GDP between Industry and Service has not changed much in

the last three decades (see Table 6); thus the level effect must be small.

If, for simplicity, we assume constant shares of real GDP, the rate of

change in aggregate productivity is a weighted average of the rates of

change in the two sectors where the weights are employment shares in the

terminal year, i.e.


                       =        + (l-m)R1
                           mR

where   R =   rate   of change of productivity;

        m =   the Service sector's share of total employment (i.e.,
              Industry plus Service);

        S =   Service;
        I =   Industry;
        T =   total.

        The effect of the shift to Service then, is the change in weights

multiplied by the differential in the rates. We see in Table 6 that the

Industry—Service differential in rate of change of labor productivity is

1.15 percent per annum, and of total factor productivity, .73 percent per

annum. The change in the Service sector's employment share of Industry

plus Service is from .52 in 1948 to .63 in 1978)' Roughly speaking, we

have a one percent per annum differential in rate multiplied by a .1 change

in weight. This implies a slowing down of aggregate productivity growth

in the U.S. of approximately .1 percent per annum between 1948 and 1978

as a result of the rise of Service employment. Inasmuch as the slowdown

in aggregate productivity growth is at least one percent per annum, we

see that the growth of the Service sector cannot be a major explanatory factor.



        -'The Service share of Industry plus Service total input increased
from .48 to .57.
                                  28


        A few additional points about U.S. growth in recent decades are

worth noting. The rapid increase in female labor force participation

since the end of World War II has tended to raise the rate of growth of

measured real GDP per capita because the ratio of working to total

population has risen. To the extent that women are now producing less in

nonmarket activities (not included in GDP), this is a spurious growth of

total economic output. Another effect of the rise in female labor force

participation is to lower the rate of growth of output per worker, but

this too is spurious because it reflects a change in labor force mix rather

than a slowdown in productivity for given workers. Finally, even if both

the above effects of rising female labor force participation have been

operative in the U.S., they can scarcely be a source of any significant

change in the rate of change because female labor force participation has

been rising rapidly throughout the post—World War II era.
