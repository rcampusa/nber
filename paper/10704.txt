This paper examines the economic environments in which past U.S. stock market booms occurred

as a first step toward understanding how asset price booms come about and whether monetary policy

should be used to defuse booms. We identify several episodes of sustained rapid rise in equity prices

in the 19th and 20th Centuries, and then assess the growth of real output, productivity, the price

level, money and credit stocks during each episode. Two booms stand out in terms of their length

and rate of increase in market prices n the booms of 1923-29 and 1994-2000. In general, we find
that booms occurred in periods of rapid real growth and productivity advance, suggesting that booms

are driven at least partly by fundamentals. We find no consistent relationship between inflation and

stock market booms, though booms have typically occurred when money and credit growth were

above average.

     Monetary Policy and Asset Prices: A Look Back at Past U.S. Stock Market Booms


        Large swings in asset prices and economic activity in the United States, Japan, and other

countries over the past several years have brought renewed focus on the linkages between

monetary policy and asset markets. Monetary policy has been cited as both a possible cause of

asset price booms and a tool for defusing booms before they can cause macroeconomic

instability. Economists and policymakers have focused on how monetary policy might cause an

asset price boom, or turn a boom caused by real phenomena, such as an increase in aggregate

productivity growth, into a bubble. They have also addressed how monetary policy authorities

should respond to asset price booms.

        This paper examines the economic environments in which past U.S. stock market booms

occurred as a first step toward understanding how asset price booms come about. Have past

booms reflected real economic growth and productivity advance, expansionary monetary policy,

inflation, or simply “irrational exuberance” that defies explanation? We use a simple metric to

identify several episodes of sustained rapid rises in equity prices in the 19th and 20th Centuries,

and then asses both narrative and quantitative information about the growth of real output,

productivity, the price level, money supply and credit during each episode. Across some two

hundred years, we find that two U.S. stock market booms stand out in terms of their length and

rate of increase in market prices – the booms of 1923-29 and 1994-2000. In general, we find that

booms occurred in periods of rapid real growth and productivity advance. We find, however, no

consistent relationship between inflation and stock market booms, though booms have typically

occurred when money and credit growth were above average. Finally, contrary to conventional

wisdom, we find that wars have not always been good for the market.

        This paper begins by reviewing relevant issues concerning the links between monetary

policy and asset prices. The following section presents a monthly time series index of U.S. equity

prices spanning two hundred years, and identifies boom episodes. Subsequent sections present a

descriptive history of U.S. stock market booms since 1834, summarize our findings, and offer

conclusions.

MONETARY POLICY ISSUES

         The literature on the linkages between monetary policy and asset markets is vast. Here,

we focus on two issues – the role of asset prices in the transmission of monetary policy to the

economy as a whole, and the appropriate response of monetary policy to asset price booms. The

first concerns the extent to which monetary policy might cause an asset price boom. The second

concerns the circumstances in which monetary policymakers should attempt to defuse asset price

booms.

Asset Prices and the Transmission Mechanism

         There are many views about how monetary policy might cause an asset price boom. For

example, a traditional view focuses on the response of asset prices to a change in money supply,

arguing that added liquidity causes asset prices to rise as a link in the transmission of monetary

policy actions to the economy as a whole. A second view, voiced by Austrian economists in the

1920s and more recently by economists of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), argues

that asset price booms are more likely to arise in an environment of low, stable inflation. In this

view, monetary policy can encourage asset price booms simply by credibly stabilizing the price

level. Still another view, coming from the dynamic general equilibrium macroeconomics

literature, argues that asset price bubbles can result from failure of monetary policy to credibly

stabilize the price level.

         The liquidity view has a long history. Some early Keynesian IS-LM models, such as that

of Metlzer (1951), had central bank operations affecting stock prices directly. A next generation

of models, variants of which are presented in Friedman and Schwartz (1963b), Tobin (1969), and

Brunner and Meltzer (1973), introduce a broader range of assets into the traditional Keynesian

liquidity mechanism. In these models, central bank operations that increase liquidity will cause

the prices of assets that comprise the private sector’s portfolio, including equities and real estate,
                                                                                                        3


to rise and thereby lower their returns. Substitution from more to less liquid assets occurs as the

returns on the former decline relative to the latter. The impact of expansionary monetary policy

will be apparent first in the price of short–term government securities, then longer-term securities,

then other assets such as stocks, real estate, old masters and commodities such as gold, and finally

in the overall price level. Thus, this view sees rising asset prices as a possible harbinger of future

inflation.

          The Austrian – BIS view argues that an asset price boom, whatever its fundamental

cause, can degenerate into a bubble if monetary policy passively allows bank credit to expand to

fuel the boom. This view holds that unless policymakers act to defuse a boom, a crash will

inevitably follow that in turn may cause a downturn in economic activity. The Austrians tended

to equate rising asset prices with general price inflation. For example, although the level of U.S.

consumer prices was virtually unchanged between 1923 and 1929, the Austrians viewed the

period as one of rapid inflation fueled by loose Federal Reserve policy and excessive growth of

bank credit (e.g., Rothbard, 1983).1

          This view has carried forward into the modern discussion of asset price booms. Two

issues are relevant. The first is whether the price index targeted by the central bank should

include asset prices. Alchian and Klein (1973) contend that a theoretically correct measure of

inflation is the change in the price of a given level of utility, which includes the present value of

future consumption. An accurate estimate of inflation, they argue, requires a broader price index

than one consisting only of the prices of current consumption goods and services. To capture the

price of future consumption, Alchian and Klein (1973) contend that monetary authorities should

target a price index that includes asset prices. Bryan, et al. (2002) concur, arguing that because it

omits asset prices (especially housing prices), the Consumer Price Index (CPI) seriously

understated inflation during the 1990s.2

        A second connection of the Austrian view to the recent experience concerns the issue of

“financial imbalances,” which Borio and Lowe (2002) define as rapid growth of credit in

conjunction with rapid increases in asset prices and, possibly, investment.3 Borio and Lowe

(2002) argue that a build up of such imbalances can increase the risk of a financial crisis and

macroeconomic instability. They construct an index of imbalances based on a credit gap

(deviations of credit growth from trend), an equity price gap, and an output gap, to identify

incipient asset price declines that lead to significant real output losses, and advocate its use as a

guide for proactive action. Eichengreen and Mitchener (2003) find that a similar index for the

1920s helps explain the severity of the Great Depression.

        Borio and Lowe (2002) argue that low inflation can promote financial imbalances,

regardless of the underlying cause of an asset price boom. For example, by generating optimism

about the macroeconomic environment, low inflation might cause asset prices to rise more in

response to an increase in productivity growth than they otherwise would. Similarly, an increase

in demand is more likely to cause asset prices to rise if the central bank is viewed as credibly

committed to price stability. A commitment to price stability that is viewed as credible, Borio

and Lowe (2002) argue, will make product prices less sensitive and output and profits more

sensitive in the short run to an increase in demand. At the same time, the absence of inflation

may cause monetary policymakers to delay tightening policy as demand pressures build. Thus,

Borio and Lowe (2002, pp. 30-31) contend, “these endogenous responses to credible monetary

policy [can] increase the probability that the latent inflation pressures manifest themselves in the

prices in an index of inflation would not substantially improve U.S. economic performance.

Michener (2003) for discussion of the similarities and differences between the modern “imbalance” view
and the Austrian emphasis on bank credit induced “forced saving” as the cause of “overinvestment” in the
1920s that led to the stock market crash and the Great Depression.

development of imbalances in the financial system, rather than immediate upward pressure in

higher goods and services price inflation.”

        The possibility that monetary policy can produce asset price bubbles has also been

studied extensively in equilibrium rational expectations models. In such models, poorly designed

monetary policies, such as the use of interest rate rules without commitment to a steady long run

inflation rate, can lead to self-fulfilling prophesies and asset price bubbles. Such outcomes are

less likely, Woodford (2003) argues, if monetary policymakers follow a clear rule in which the

interest rate target is adjusted sufficiently to stabilize inflation. The theoretical literature thus

suggests that consideration of the monetary policy environment may be crucial to understanding

why asset booms come about.

Proactive Policy in Response to Asset Price Booms?

        The appropriate response, if any, of monetary policy to an asset price boom was the

subject of extensive debate during the U.S. stock market boom of 1994-2000 and the recession

that followed. Since periods of explosive growth in asset prices have often preceded financial

crises and contractions in economic activity, some economists argue that by defusing asset price

booms, monetary policy can limit the adverse impact of financial instability on economic activity.

The likelihood of a price collapse and subsequent macroeconomic decline might, however,

depend on why asset prices are rising in the first place. Many analysts believe that asset booms

do not pose a threat to economic activity or the outlook for inflation so long as they can be

justified by realistic prospects of future earnings growth. On the other hand, if rising stock prices

reflect “irrational exuberance,” they may pose a threat to economic stability and, in the minds of

many, justify a monetary policy response to encourage market participants to revalue equities

more realistically.

        The traditional view holds that monetary policy should react to asset price movements

only to the extent that they provide information about future inflation. This view holds that

monetary policy will contribute to financial stability by maintaining stability of the price level
                                                                                                        6


(Bordo et al., 2002, 2003; Schwartz, 1995), and that financial imbalances or crises should be dealt

with separately by regulatory or lender of last resort policies (Schwartz, 2002).4

        Many economists do not accept the traditional view, at least not entirely. Smets (1997),

for example, argues that monetary policy tightening is optimal in response to “irrational

exuberance” in financial markets (see also Detken and Smets, 2003). Similarly, Cecchetti, et al.

(2000), contend that monetary policy should react when asset prices become misaligned with

fundamentals. Bernanke and Gertler (2001) express doubt that policymakers can judge reliably

whether asset prices are being driven by “irrational exuberance,” or that an asset price collapse is

imminent. Cecchetti (2003) replies, however, that asset price misalignments are no more difficult

to identify than other components of the Taylor rule, such as potential output.

        Bordo and Jeanne (2002a, 2002b) offer a novel argument in support of a monetary policy

response to asset price booms. They argue that preemptive actions to defuse an asset price boom

can be regarded as insurance against the high cost of lost output should a bust occur. Bordo and

Jeanne contend that policymakers should attempt to contain asset price misalignments when the

risk of a bust (or the consequences of a bust) is large, or when the cost of defusing a boom is low

in terms of foregone output. Bordo and Jeanne show that a tension exists between these two

conditions. As investors become more exuberant, the risks associated with a reversal in market

sentiment increases, but leaning against the wind of investor optimism requires more costly

monetary actions. Thus, the monetary authorities must evaluate both the probability of a costly

crisis and the extent to which they can reduce this probability.

FOMC Deliberations about the Stock Market

        The debate about the appropriate response of monetary policy to asset price booms has

not taken place solely in professional journals and working papers. The implications of rising

asset prices became an increasingly important component of Federal Reserve policy discussions

  Bernanke and Gertler (1999, 2001) present the traditional view in the context of a Taylor Rule. Bernanke
(2002), Bullard and Schaling (2002), Schinasi and Hargraves (1993), and White (2004) are among other
                                                                                                    7


during the U.S. stock market boom of 1994-2000. Cecchetti (2003) presents evidence suggesting

that movements in equity prices help explain adjustments in the Federal Open Market

Committee’s (FOMC’s) federal funds rate target during this period.5

         Transcripts of FOMC meetings in 1996 and 1997 reveal that Fed officials focused on a

potential “wealth effect” of rising stock prices on consumer confidence and spending, and

worried that a sudden reversal of equity prices could cause real economic activity to decline

sharply. For example, at a meeting on March 26, 1996, Chairman Greenspan stated that “It’s

hard to believe that if any series of adverse developments were to occur, the market would not

come down rather substantially and reverse the wealth effect. That probably would dampen

economic activity quite substantially.” (FOMC transcript, March 26, 1996, p. 29)

         Policymakers grew increasingly concerned as equity prices continued to rise, and the

FOMC discussed how to respond. At a Committee meeting on February 4-5, 1997, Chairman

Greenspan stated that the prevailing level of equity prices, along with unusually narrow interest

rate credit spreads, “suggest that product prices alone should not be the sole criterion [for

conducting monetary policy] if we are going to maintain a stable, viable financial system whose

fundamental goal … is the attainment of maximum sustainable economic growth.” (FOMC

transcript, February 4-5, 1997, p. 103)

         Greenspan saw a conundrum in the use of monetary policy to defuse an asset price boom,

however, and expressed the view that stock market booms are more likely to occur when inflation

is low: “We have very great difficulty in monetary policy when we confront stock market

bubbles. That is because, to the extent that we are successful in keeping product price inflation

down, history tells us that price-earnings ratios under those conditions go through the roof. What

is really needed to keep stock market bubbles from occurring is a lot of product price inflation,

which historically has tended to undercut stock markets almost everywhere. There is a clear


studies supporting the traditional view.
                                                                                                       8


tradeoff. If monetary policy succeeds in one, it fails in the other. Now, unless we have the

capability of playing in between and managing to know exactly when to push a little here and to

pull a little there, it is not obvious to me that there is a simple set of monetary policy solutions

that deflate the bubble.” (FOMC transcript, September 24, 1996, pp. 30-31)

        We next turn to the history of past U.S. stock market booms to try to identify the

macroeconomic environments in which booms have occurred as a first step toward identifying

lessons for the conduct of monetary policy in response to asset price booms.

HISTORICAL DATA ON THE U.S. STOCK MARKET

        We focus on the stock market because long-term data on the prices of other assets, e.g.,

real estate, are not available and, moreover, because stock prices are often the focus of policy

concerns about the causes and effects of booms and busts (e.g., during the late 1990s and the

1920s).6 Our interest is with the performance of broad stock market averages, not in the

performance of individual stocks or groups of stocks. Booms, of course, are typically centered in

particular sectors – usually the “high-tech” sectors of the day – but the booms that capture the

attention of macroeconomists and policymakers are broadly based. In the 1990s, computer,

telecommunications, and internet stocks were at the epicenter of the stock market boom. The

stock prices of a wide range of companies also rose sharply, however, and the broader market

averages, such as the S&P 500 and the Wilshire 5000, all increased substantially, though not as

much as the NASDAQ, which quintupled (see Figure 1 for comparison of the S&P500 and

NASDAQ from 1990-2003).

        Schwert (1990) constructed a continuous monthly stock market index for the United

States from 1802-1870, linking indexes created by Smith and Cole (1935) for 1802-62 and

Macaulay (1938) for 1863-70. Banks were the first large corporate enterprises in the United

(2003). Hayford and Malliaris (2004), by contrast, find that the Fed did not respond to the market.

States, and for 1802-34, the stock market index consists only of bank stocks. Railroads, the

largest corporate sector throughout much of the 19th Century, got their start in the 1830s. For

1835-45, the stock market index is comprised of both bank and railroad stock prices, and for

1846-70 of just railroad stocks.

        The U.S. industrial sector grew to include large publicly traded manufacturers of steel,

petroleum products, chemicals, and other goods after the Civil War, and available indexes of

stock prices reflect the increasing breadth of the market. We link Schwert’s (1990) index for

1802-70 to the Cowles (1939) index of New York Stock Exchange prices covering 1871-1920,

and then to the Standard and Poors (S&P) Composite index. A consistent S&P series is available

from 1921 to the present modern form, the S&P 500 index.7 Figure 2 plots the entire index, from

1802 to 2002.8

Identifying Booms

        Our objective is to describe the macroeconomic environments in which sustained, rapid

rises in stock prices have occurred. Over our entire sample, two boom episodes stand out, both in

terms of their length and rate of advance in the market index: the bull markets of 1923-29 and of

1994-2000. The rate of advance in the market has been faster at other times, but only for short

periods. Similarly, there have been other long bull markets, but none with such a rapid average

rate of increase in the index. Since the bull market of the 1920s stands out, we examine both the

macroeconomic environment in which that boom occurred and the debate it generated among

monetary policymakers. We also examine other episodes of rapid, sustained increases in the

stock market index, however, in our attempt to identify environmental characteristics of stock

market booms in general.

  Data for 1871-1920 are from the NBER macrohistory database (series m11025a), and those for 1921-
2002 are from Haver Analytics. Alternative indexes are available, e.g., the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
which began in 1895, but the episodes of “boom” and “bust” that appear in one index are common to all of
the alternative broad indexes.

   The New York Stock Exchange was closed during August-November 1914 and, hence, there are no
index values for those months.
                                                                                                       10


        There is, of course, no precise empirical definition of an asset price boom, and

researchers have imposed a number of filters to identify specific episodes that they then define as

booms. We begin by using the methodology of Pagan and Sossounov (2003) to identify

sustained periods of rising stock prices. Beginning in 1834, we identify the months in which the

market reached a peak and a trough within a rolling, 25-month window.9 We require that peaks

and troughs alternate, and so we eliminate all but the highest (lowest) of peaks (troughs) that

occur before a subsequent trough (peak). Finally, we identify booms as periods lasting at least

three years from trough to peak. Table 1 lists all such booms in our data, plus a few shorter

episodes of exceptional increase in the market index, such as February 1834 – May 1835. The

table also lists a few periods that include two or more consecutive booms that were interrupted by

short market declines, and that might be better thought of as a single episode. For each period,

the table also lists the average, annualized increase in the index during the boom period, i.e., from

the month following the trough to the peak month.

        One might question whether stock market booms should be defined to include recoveries

from prior stock market declines. Indeed, some of the booms listed in Table 1 include long

periods in which the market average remained below a prior peak. Hence, for each boom, we

also indicate the month in which the previous (local) peak was reached, as well as the month in

which the previous all-time market (global) peak was reached.10 For each episode, we report the

average, annualized increase in the index from the month following the attainment of both the

prior local and global peaks to the new peak month. Clearly, a few sustained booms, such as that

of July 1861 – March 1864, involved several months in which the market was merely recovering

to a prior peak (or to the prior all-time high). Indeed, a few booms ended without reaching a prior

global peak. In general, the average increase in the market index was larger during the recovery

9
   We begin with 1834 because the stock market index before that year was comprised of only a small
number of bank stocks and, as shown in Figure 2, there appear to have been no large movements in the
index before then.
                                                                                                           11


phase of booms than during the phase in which the market index exceeded its prior high.

Interestingly, two exceptions are the booms of the 1920s and of the late 1990s, suggesting again

that these two booms were unique in character as well as magnitude.

         Some studies define booms as sustained periods of increase in an asset price index above

a trend growth rate (e.g., Bordo and Jeanne, 2002a; Detken and Smets, 2003). Figures 3 and 4

plot values of our stock price index alongside a nine-year trailing moving average of the index.11

From these charts, episodes when the market average increased (or fell) rapidly relative to its

recent trend are evident. Booms are evident in the mid-1830s, during the Civil War, from about

1879 to 1881, and, with interruptions, from about 1896 to 1906. The bull market of the 1920s is

clearly evident, as is the rise from 1994 to 2000. In addition, the market advanced well above

trend in the early 1950s and again from about 1984 to 1987.

         Figure 5 plots the “real”, i.e., inflation-adjusted, stock market index and nine-year trailing

moving average for 1924-2002. In theory, stock prices should not be affected by inflation that is

anticipated.12 Nevertheless, this plot illustrates more clearly that the bull markets of the 1920s

and 1994-2000 stand out as exceptional periods of sustained, large increases in real as well as

nominal stock prices. The real stock market index also rose substantially during the mid-1950s

and between 1984 and 1987. Thus, regardless of how one looks at the data, the same boom

episodes stand out.

    Helbling and Terrones (2004) use a similar approach in their cross-country study of stock market and
real estate booms since 1970.
11
   We do not plot data for 1914-21 because the New York Stock Exchange was closed during August-
November 1914, thereby complicating the calculation of the nine-year moving average. As is evident from
Figure 2, there was no boom during 1914-21.
12
   The traditional capital asset pricing model posits that the current market price of a stock will equal the
present discounted value of the expected dividend stream to the stockholder. Expected inflation should not
affect the current price of the stock because even though expected inflation may increase the nominal
dividend stream, the relevant interest rate for discounting those earnings also will reflect the expected
inflation. Unanticipated inflation can, of course, wreak havoc with an investor’s ex post real return on asset
holdings, as occurred during the 1970s.

THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT OF BOOMS

        Table 2 reports information about the growth rates of labor productivity, real GDP,

industrial production, money, credit, and the price level during the boom episodes identified in

Table 1. Here we define the start of a boom as the month following a market trough. For

comparison, we also report growth rates of these variables over longer periods. Unfortunately,

few macroeconomic data exist for early boom periods, and what data there are usually consist of

annual observations. It appears, however, that market booms generally occurred during periods

of relatively rapid growth of output and productivity. Pre-World War II booms also tended to

occur during periods of above average growth in the money stock, bank credit, and, sometimes,

the price level. The growth rates of money, credit, and the price level were not above average

during the boom of 1923-29, however, nor during most post-World War II booms.

        We proceed next to examine specific historical episodes in more detail. Obviously, not

every episode identified in Table 1 deserves attention. From looking closely at a few episodes,

however, we identify certain characteristics about the environments in which booms have

occurred.

Antebellum Stock Market Booms

        The stock market booms of the 19th Century were closely associated with the

development of the nation’s infrastructure, first canals and steamships, then railroads.

        1834-35. Schwert’s (1990) stock market index for this period combines indexes of bank

and railroad stocks from Smith and Cole (1935), with more weight put on the railroad stock

index. Smith and Cole (1935) document a close relationship between public land sales and

railroad stock prices in 1834-35, though stock prices peaked and began to fall before land sales

started to decline in 1836 (p. 82). The close correlation between land sales and railroad stock

prices throughout the antebellum period led Smith and Cole to conclude that “both series … may

be regarded as reflecting a common element – that of the well-known speculative spirit of the

country” (p. 82).
                                                                                                             13


         Federal Government land sales rose from under $2 million a year in the 1820s to $5

million in 1834, $15 million in 1835, and $25 million in 1836. The land-sales and stock market

booms occurred during a period of commodity price inflation. Temin (1967, p. 92) argues that

the land boom was sparked by a sharp increase in the price of cotton, which rose some 50 percent

during 1834 alone. The money stock increased sharply in 1835-36, spurred by large inflows of

Mexican silver which increased the growth rate of the monetary base (Temin, 1967, pp. 68-69).13

It appears from limited data that the boom also occurred during a period of fairly strong growth of

real economic activity. Smith and Cole’s (1935, p. 73) index of the volume of trade shows a 14

percent rise in domestic trade from 1834 to 1835, and even larger percentage gains in exports in

1835-36. Davis’ (2002) index of industrial production shows an increase of about 12 percent

between 1934 and 1835 (Table 2). Hence, the boom episode coincided with both a general price

inflation and rapid real economic growth.

         The boom was short-lived. Stock prices peaked in May 1835, and land sales peaked in

the first six months of 1836. Monetary policy actions appear to explain the end of the boom and a

subsequent banking panic in 1837. Acting under the Deposit Act of June, 1836, the Secretary of

the Treasury ordered a redistribution of public balances from New York City banks to banks in

other states. Subsequently, President Andrew Jackson issued an executive order known as the

Specie Circular mandating the use of specie (gold and silver) rather than bank notes in the

purchase of Federal land. In the absence of a well-functioning interregional reserves market, the

ensuing outflow of reserves left the New York money market vulnerable to shocks and, according

to Rousseau (2002), precipitated the Panic of 1837.14

         Limited data make it impossible to determine whether the stock market and land booms

of the 1830s were justified by reasonable expectations of profit growth. The success of New

13
   At the time, the United States was on a bimetallic – gold and silver – standard. An increase in British
investment in U.S. securities, coupled with a decline in silver exports to China, caused the inflow of
Mexican silver to increase the monetary base.
                                                                                                      14


York’s Erie Canal, which was completed in 1825, brought heavy investment in other canal

projects. Railroad building took off about the same time. The prospect of greatly reduced

transportation costs, combined with rising export prices (chiefly cotton), were real phenomena

that could cause equity prices and public land sales to increase. Nevertheless, monetary shocks,

and perhaps a dose of irrational exuberance, may have also contributed to the boom, and the end

of the boom was caused by monetary policy actions.

        The 1840s. The stock market recovered quickly from a trough in 1843. Much of the

1843-45 boom was a recovery to a prior (local) peak (see Table 1). Smith and Cole (1935, p.

136) attribute the recovery to “cheap money” and rapid expansion of economic activity, with

capital inflows from abroad sustaining the boom (p. 111). As in the 1830s, the stock market

boom coincided with a sharp increase in public land sales. The period also was marked by rapid

growth of the money stock, price level, and industrial production (see Table 2).

        After a pause in the mid-1840s, stock prices increased sharply in 1847 but fell back

quickly during the Panic of 1847. Stock prices began to rise again in 1848 and rose at about a 10

percent annual rate through 1852. As during the prior boom, the period 1848-52 was

characterized by above average growth of the money stock, price level, and industrial production.

Thus, all three of the antebellum stock market booms we identify occurred during periods of rapid

growth of the money stock and price level as well as strong economic activity.

The Civil War Boom

        Equity prices rose sharply from July 1861 to March 1864, though the real, inflation-

adjusted returns to investors were more modest. The stock price index rose at an average annual

rate of 40.2 percent during the boom, whereas the price level rose at an average annual rate of

25.8 percent (Table 2). Adjusted for inflation, the market peak occurred in October 1863, and the

real stock price index declined precipitously until early 1865, as shown in Figure 6.


14
    Temin (1967), by contrast, argues that the U.S. money market tightened when the Bank of England
raised its discount rate (i.e., Bank Rate) to discourage capital outflows from the United Kingdom.
                                                                                                    15


        It was once thought that the Civil War had encouraged the development of manufacturing

and thereby increased the subsequent growth rate of the U.S. economy. Industrial production

rose fairly rapidly during the war (see Table 2). Estimates of the economic cost of the Civil War

and its impact on growth indicate, however, that although specific firms and industries

experienced high profits during the war, the economy as a whole suffered and the war did not

increase growth (Goldin and Lewis, 1975). Recent studies have related break points in various

asset price time series to war news, with major Union victories producing increases in asset prices

(e.g., McCandless, 1996).

From the Civil War to World War I

        The United States experienced a great industrial expansion during the late 19th and early

20th Centuries, with many new corporations formed and listed on the stock exchanges. Our stock

market index shows a sustained, though not especially rapid, rise from April 1867 to April 1872,

a more rapid rise from June 1877 to June 1881, and a long rise with two significant interruptions

from August 1896 to September 1906.

        The U.S. price level declined almost continuously from 1866 to 1896, with the cost of

living falling at an average annual rate of 2 percent (David and Solar, 1977). Figure 7 plots our

stock market index alongside a commodity price index for 1866-1913. Like the cost of living,

commodity prices fell almost continuously until 1896, except from mid-1879 to mid-1882, when

commodity prices rose at an average annual rate of 9 percent. At the ends of the stock market

booms of 1867-72 and 1877-81, the level of commodity prices was below where it had been at

the start of each boom.

        By contrast, the price level rose during the booms of 1896-1906. Commodity prices rose

at a fairly rapid 4.58 percent annual rate during the 1896-99 boom, and again rose during the

subsequent booms of 1900-02 and 1903-06 (see Table 2). Hence, the evidence from the post-

Civil War era indicates that stock market booms can occur during periods of inflation, deflation,

and a fairly stable price level.
                                                                                                                   16


          Figure 8 plots end-of-quarter values of the stock market index alongside Balke-Gordon’s

(1986) quarterly estimates of real GNP from 1875 to 1913. Real output growth accelerated in

1879, after several years of modest growth following a cycle peak in October 1873, and achieved

an astounding 8.4 percent average rate during the boom of 1877-81 (see Table 2). The growth

rates of the stock price index and of both real GNP and industrial production were closely

correlated during 1890-1913 (see Table 2). Hence, as in the antebellum era, our evidence

indicates that late 19th Century stock market booms occurred during periods of unusually rapid

growth in real economic activity.

          Linking stock market booms to productivity growth during this era is more difficult

because productivity data are limited. Figure 9 plots annual estimates of labor productivity

growth from 1875 to 1913 alongside June values of our stock price index. Productivity growth

appears to have increased before the stock market in 1896, and the ups and downs in the market

that follow are correlated positively with changes in productivity growth.15

          Next we examine growth of the money and credit stocks. We plot end of quarter values

of our stock market index and a broad money stock measure (“M2”) for 1875-1913 in Figure 10

(M2 data are from Balke and Gordon, 1986). Like real output and commodity prices, M2 grew

rapidly during the course of the 1877-81 stock market boom. M2 also grew at double-digit rates

during the stock market booms of 1896-99, 1900-02, and 1903-06.

          The relationship between the stock market and bank credit is more difficult to ascertain

because the only comprehensive credit data for this period are annual. Figure 11 plots total bank

credit against June values of the stock market index for 1866-1913, and Figure 12 plots annual

data on the stock market loans of New York City national bank against the stock market index for

1880-1913. Whereas the correlation between the growth of total bank credit and the stock market




15
     The pattern of growth in total factor productivity is similar to that of labor productivity in this period.
                                                                                                      17


index is low, Figure 12 indicates that stock market loan growth increased during the booms of

1896-99, 1900-02, and 1903-06, as well as during the recovery of 1908-09.16

           Railroads were the most visible industry in the economic expansion and stock market

between 1867 and 1873. Railroad investment hit a peak in 1871-72, as did stock prices (Fels,

1959, p. 98). The collapse of Jay Cooke and Company, the principal financier of the Northern

Pacific Railroad, triggered the financial crisis of 1873. Railroad building was stagnant until 1876,

but began to expand rapidly in 1877, and the stock market revived. Although the railroads grew

faster than any other industry, the 1870s and early 1880s also witnessed rapid growth in

manufacturing, as well as agricultural output and productivity (Friedman and Schwartz, 1963a,

pp. 35).

           On the monetary side, the United States returned to the gold standard, which had been

suspended during the Civil War, in 1879. Hence, the stock market boom occurred in an

environment of strong growth of real economic activity and successful resumption of the

international monetary standard. While there were reasons to be optimistic about the growth of

corporate earnings in this environment, contemporary accounts, cited by Fels (1959, pp. 120-25),

suggest that risk premiums fell unjustifiably and investors were swept up in a “bubble of

overoptimism.”

           Similar contemporary and historical accounts cite “speculative activity” as one reason for

rapid increases in equity prices during subsequent booms. For example, Friedman and Schwartz

(1963a, p. 153) write that “The years from 1902 to 1907 were characterized by industrial growth

… by speculative activity in the stock market, and by a wave of immigration.”

           In summary, we find that the 19th and early 20th Century booms occurred when growth of

real output and the money stock were high, but we observe no consistent pattern with respect to


16
   Data on stock market loans are as of call report dates (usually September) from Bordo, Rappaport and
Schwartz (1992). Although stock market loans appear to rise and peak before the stock market, because the
data on loans and the stock market index are not for the same month in each year, we are hesitant to draw
any conclusions about timing.
                                                                                                   18


the price level, i.e., booms occurred during periods of deflation, inflation, and more or less stable

prices. Anecdotes suggest that speculation also characterized most booms, but a quantitative

assessment of the extent to which the rise in stock prices during booms exceeded rational pricing

based on fundamentals is beyond the scope of this article.

20th Century Booms

        The period between the Panic of 1907 and the beginning of the bull market of the 1920s

was characterized by a choppy market. A significant panic occurred at the start of World War I

in 1914, and the U.S. stock market was closed for four months. There were no sustained

movements in the market between 1914 and 1923.

        1923-29. In terms of duration and amplitude, the U.S. stock market boom of 1994-2000

has but one historical rival – the boom of 1923-29. The market index rose at an annual average

rate of about 20 percent during both six year booms. Both periods were also characterized by low

and stable inflation, and high average growth of real GDP and industrial production. Productivity

growth also increased during both the 1920s and 1990s. In the 1920s, however, the increase in

productivity growth occurred in the three years preceding the stock market boom, and

productivity growth slowed during the boom period. By contrast, in the 1990s, productivity

began to accelerate around 1995, and rapid productivity growth coincided with the stock market

boom.

        Figure 13 plots our stock market index alongside the Consumer Price Index for 1915-40.

A rapid increase in the price level during World War I was followed by deflation in 1920-21.

The consumer price level was virtually unchanged over the remainder of the 1920s. As illustrated

in Figure 14, real GNP exhibited positive growth during 1923-29, interrupted by brief recessions

in 1923-24 and 1927. GNP growth during the boom averaged above the historical norm, but not

above the growth rates experienced during prior booms (see Table 2). Industrial production also

grew rapidly during the 1923-29 boom, shown in Figure 15, and reached a peak a few months
                                                                                                         19


before the stock market peak in September 1929. Average growth of industrial production during

the boom was similar to that experienced in late 19th Century booms (Table 2).

         Figure 16 plots annual estimates of nonfarm labor and total factor productivity for the

U.S. economy, from Kendrick (1961), alongside June values of our stock market index for 1889-

1940. Both labor and total factor productivity grew relatively rapidly in the early 1920s.

Economists have attributed this growth to the diffusion of technological breakthroughs that had

occurred in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, including the internal combustion engine and

inventions that made the industrial use of electric power practical. Although the stock market

boom of the 1920s did not coincide precisely with the productivity acceleration, as it did during

1995-2000, both booms have been associated with technological breakthroughs that

revolutionized production in numerous existing industries as well as created entirely new

industries. The high-flying stocks of the 1920s, such as RCA, Aluminum Company of America,

United Aircraft and Transportation Corporation, and General Motors were direct beneficiaries of

the new general purpose technologies and were expected to have high profit potential, not unlike

the “dot-com” stocks that led the boom of the 1990s.17

         Whereas technological progress and accelerating productivity would be expected to

generate an increase in the growth of corporate profits, and thereby justify an increase in stock

prices, the question remains whether such “fundamentals” can explain the entire increase in the

market. Contemporary observers disagreed about the whether the stock market boom of 1923-29


17
    The internal combustion engine and electric motors are often referred to as general purpose
technologies because of their wide applicability and potential to increase productivity in many industries.
The microprocessor is also regarded as a general purpose technology, and the increase in productivity
growth that occurred around 1995 is commonly attributed to the widespread application of computer
technology. Greenspan (2000), for example, contends that “When historians look back at the latter half of
the 1990s a decade or two hence, I suspect that they will conclude we are now living through a pivotal
period in American economic history. New technologies that evolved from the cumulative innovations of
the past half-century have now begun to bring about dramatic changes in the way goods and services are
produced and in the way they are distributed to final users. Those innovations, exemplified most recently
by the multiplying uses of the Internet, have brought on a flood of startup firms, many of which claim to
offer the chance to revolutionize and dominate large shares of the nation’s production and distribution
system.” See also David (1990), David and Wright (1999), Gordon (2000a), and Jovanovic and Rousseau
(2004).
                                                                                                      20


was justified by realistic expectations of future earnings, as do economists who look back at the

episode. Yale economist Irving Fisher famously defended the level of the stock market. For

example, he argued that the increase in corporate profits during the first nine months of 1929 “is

eloquent justification of a heightened level of common stock prices” (quoted in White, 2004, p.

10). There were naysayers, however, including Paul M. Warburg, a leading banker and former

member of the Federal Reserve Board. Warburg argued in March 1929 that the market reflected

“unrestrained speculation” that, if continued, would result in a collapse and a “general depression

involving the entire country.”18

          In addition to rapid earnings growth, Fisher (1930) cited improved management methods,

a decline in labor disputes, and high levels of investment in research and development as reasons

why stocks were not overvalued in 1929. McGrattan and Prescott (2003) argue that Fisher was

correct. Although the total market value of U.S. corporations in 1929 exceeded the value of their

tangible capital stock by 30 percent, McGrattan and Prescott (2003) estimate that the value of

intangible corporate assets, e.g., the value of R&D investment, fully justified the level of equity

prices.

          Other researchers have examined the growth of corporate earnings and dividends during

the 1920s, and most conclude that equity prices rose far higher than could be justified by

reasonable expectations of future dividends. White (2004), who surveys and extends this

literature, concludes that the increase in stock prices during 1928-29 exceeded what could be

explained by earnings growth, the earnings payout rate, the level of interest rates, or by changes

in the equity premium, all of which are components of a standard equity pricing model.

          Several Federal Reserve officials, Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, as well as a

number of other prominent public officials attributed the stock market boom to loose monetary

policy and rapid growth of credit. Neither the money stock nor total bank credit grew at an

unusually fast pace during 1923-29 (see Table 2). Brokers’ loans rose rapidly and in line with

18
     Quoted in Galbraith (1961, p. 77).
                                                                                                         21


stock prices, however, as Figure 17 illustrates. Federal Reserve officials viewed the growth in

loans to stock brokers and dealers with alarm. Many adhered to the so-called Real Bills Doctrine,

which focuses on the composition, rather than total quantity, of bank credit. According to this

view, banks should make only short-term commercial and agricultural loans to finance the

production of real goods and services. Loans to finance purchases of financial assets tend to

promote speculation, misallocation of economic resources, and inflation.19 Moreover, asset price

bubbles inevitably lead to crashes and depressions, which are required to “purge the rottenness

out of the system,” as U.S. Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon famously once said (Hoover,

1952, p. 30).

        Federal Reserve officials debated whether their actions had contributed to the growth of

brokers’ loans and financial speculation. Some officials complained that the Fed was fueling the

stock market boom by making discount window loans to banks that in turn lent to stock brokers

and dealers. Although only short-term commercial and agricultural loans could be used as

collateral for discount window loans, some Federal Reserve Board members argued that banks

should be forced to liquidate their loans to stock brokers and dealers before being allowed to

borrow at the discount window with eligible collateral. In February 1929, the Federal Reserve

Board directed the Reserve Banks to ensure that Federal Reserve credit was not used to finance

speculative activity: “The Board … has a grave responsibility whenever there is evidence that

member banks are maintaining speculative security loans with the aid of Federal Reserve credit.

When such is the case the Federal Reserve Bank becomes either a contributing or a sustaining

factor in the current volume of speculative security credit. This is not in harmony with the intent




19
    Contemporaries argued that banks “pushed” loans to purchase stocks on an unsophisticated public.
Rappoport and White (1994) show, however, that the risk premium on brokers loans increased sharply in
the late 1920s, indicating that the growth of brokers loan volume reflected growing demand rather than
increasing loan supply.
                                                                                                         22


of the Federal Reserve Act nor is it conducive to the wholesome operation of the banking and

credit system of the country.”20

         Open market operations constituted a second channel by which Federal Reserve credit

contributed to the stock market boom, according to critics. Open market purchases made during

economic recessions in 1924 and 1927 came when “business could not use, and was not asking

for increased money,” Federal Reserve Board member Adolph Miller alleged.21 In the absence of

increased demand for Fed credit for “legitimate” business needs, according to this view, open

market purchases increased the supply of funds available to purchase stocks, and thereby inflated

the bubble.

         Fed officials were not unanimous in their views. In general, Federal Reserve Bank

officials disagreed with the idea that it was desirable, or even possible, to control commercial

banks’ use of funds obtained from the discount window. Reserve Bank officials tended to argue

for discount rate increases, rather than any form of “direct pressure,” to curtail discount window

borrowing.

         Fed officials also disagreed about the relationship between open market operations and

the stock market. Disagreement centered on whether the large open market purchases of 1924

and 1927 had been desirable or harmful. Benjamin Strong, the Governor of the Federal Reserve

Bank of New York from its inception in 1914, was the Fed’s dominant figure and head of the

System’s Open Market Investment Committee until his death in 1928. Although other System

officials acquiesced, the open market purchases of 1924 and 1927 were largely Strong’s idea.22

   Strong’s motives for engaging in open market purchases in 1924 and 1927 have been debated. Meltzer
(2003, pp. 197-221) finds that the actions were undertaken both to encourage domestic economic recovery
from recessions and to assist the Bank of England in attracting and maintaining gold reserves by lowering
U.S. interest rates relative to those in the United Kingdom. Meltzer concludes, however, that international
cooperation was relatively more important than domestic recovery in 1927. Wheelock (1991) reports
empirical evidence that both domestic and international goals were important throughout 1924-29.

appropriate, some Reserve Bank officials argued that they had been useful but perhaps too large,

while other Fed officials contended that no open market purchases should have been made in

those years. For example, officials of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago argued that the

purchases in 1924 had been too large and “in 1927 the danger of putting money into the market

was greater than in 1924 as speculation was well under way.” Officials of the Federal Reserve

Bank of Richmond went further, arguing that “we think … securities should not have been

purchased in these periods, and the aim should have been to decrease rather than augment the

total supply of Federal Reserve Credit.”23 Although not reflected in growth of the money stock or

total bank credit, critics charged that the Fed had pursued a dangerously loose monetary policy as

reflected in the growth of brokers’ loans and rise in the stock market.

          The 1930s. At its nadir in June 1932, the S&P stock market index stood at just 15

percent of its September 1929 peak. The market staged a brief recovery in 1933, then surged

from March 1935 to February 1937. The boom of 1935-37 coincided with a period of rapid

growth in real output and the money stock, and came in the middle of a decade of unusually rapid

growth in total factor productivity (Field, 2003). Inflation, however, remained low (see Table 2).

The adoption of highly restrictive monetary and fiscal policies in 1936-37 snuffed out the

economic recovery and brought a halt to the stock market boom in early 1937.

          World War II. The next stock market boom occurred during World War II. U.S. equity

prices declined when the war began in Europe, hitting a low point in March 1942. The stock

market then rose as the U.S. economy was being mobilized for war. Similar to the view that the

Civil War had a positive effect on postwar economic growth by hastening the development of

manufacturing industries, World War II has also been viewed as an important source of

technological progress and postwar economic growth. Field (2004) shows, however, that most of

the seeds of postwar growth were sown during the 1930s, and that productivity growth was slow

during the war outside the munitions industries. Thus, the stock market boom probably reflected

more the rapid increases in output and liquidity during the war as the economy finally reached

full employment than productivity-driven expectations of a long-run increase in the growth of

corporate profits.

The Post-World War II Era

        The nearly 60 years since the end of World War II can be divided into three distinct eras.

The first, from the end of the war to the early 1970s, was characterized by a rising stock market,

strong real economic growth, a high average rate of productivity growth and, toward the end of

the period, rising inflation. The second era, covering the 1970s and early 1980s, was

characterized by stagflation – high inflation coupled with both highly variable and low average

output and productivity growth. Nominal stock returns were flat, and ex post real returns were

negative. In the third era, from the mid-1980s to the present, real output growth has been more

stable and, on average, higher than it was before 1980. Inflation has fallen markedly, and since

the mid-1990s, productivity growth has returned to the high average rates observed in the 1950s

and early 1960s. Stock returns have been high, both in nominal and real terms, especially during

the booms of 1984-1987 and 1994-2000. Figures 18-22 illustrate these patterns.

        Technological breakthroughs in chemicals, electronics, and other industries during the

1930s and 1940s enabled rapid growth in labor productivity and living standards during the 1950s

and 1960s (Field, 2003; Gordon, 2000a). These decades also witnessed high levels of investment

in public infrastructure and education. Our metric identifies three specific stock market booms in

these decades, though one might characterize the entire period as a boom.

        The first boom began as the economy pulled out of a mild recession in 1949. The market

rose at an average annual rate of 18 percent between June 1949 and January 1953. Following a

pause during another recession in 1953-54, the market rose at an average annual rate of nearly 27

percent from September 1953 to July 1956. Although the growth rates of output and productivity

were somewhat slower during the latter boom, the return to more stable monetary and fiscal

policies after the Korean War may explain why the stock market increased at a faster pace. The
                                                                                                 25


third distinct boom lasted from June 1962 to January 1966, and coincided with a long period of

economic expansion, characterized by high average growth of GDP, industrial production, and

productivity, as well as low inflation.

        The stock market performed poorly during the 1970s, with the market peak of January

1973 not reached again until July 1980. No stock market booms occurred during this decade of

adverse supply shocks, low productivity growth, highly variable output growth and high inflation.

The next market boom occurred during the three year period from July 1984 to August 1987.

This period of economic recovery was characterized by moderately strong real economic growth

and falling inflation, but productivity growth that was below its post-World War II average.

        The macroeconomic environment of the April 1994–August 2000 boom period is well

known. This period was characterized by somewhat above average growth of real output and

industrial production, and low and stable inflation. An increase in the trend growth rate of

productivity to approximately the rate that had prevailed during the 1950s and 1960s was the

most remarked about feature of this boom period, and has often been cited as the main

fundamental cause of the stock market boom.

CONCLUSION

        Our survey finds that U.S. stock market booms have occurred in a variety of

macroeconomic environments. Nevertheless, some common patterns are evident:

        1. Most booms occurred during periods of relatively rapid economic growth and, to the

        extent it can be measured, productivity advance. This suggests that booms were driven at

        least to some extent by fundamentals.

        2. Many booms also occurred during periods of relatively rapid growth of the money

        stock and bank credit, reflecting either passive accommodation of booms by the banking

        system or expansion of the monetary base via gold inflows or monetary policy actions.

        3. Stock market booms have occurred in periods of deflation, e.g., the late 1870s and

        early 1880s, in periods of inflation, e.g., the 1830s, 1840s, and late 1890s and early
                                                                                                      26


        1900s, and in periods of price stability, e.g., the 1920s and 1990s. In general, booms

        appear to have been driven by increases in the growth of real output and productivity, and

        can persist despite either inflation or deflation so long as the growth of output and

        productivity remain strong.24 The tendency for the money stock, but not the price level,

        to grow rapidly during booms suggests that money growth accommodated increases in

        productivity that fueled booms. In the absence of an increase in money growth, the

        quantity theory predicts that an increase in productivity and potential output growth

        would lead to deflation. In future work, we intend to examine formally whether

        accelerations in money stock growth during booms were quantitatively consistent with

        increases in long-run productivity growth.

        4. Wartime experience seems to have been different from peacetime but no consistent

        wartime pattern emerges. The old adage that “war is good for the market” does not seem

        to always hold up. Stock market booms occurred during World War II and to a lesser

        extent the Civil War, but market performance was relatively poor during World War I

        and the Vietnam War.

        The stock market booms of 1923-29 and 1994-2000 stand alone in terms of their length

and the extent to which market averages increased. Both bull markets have been attributed to

increased productivity growth associated with the widespread application of new general purpose

technologies that promised new eras of rapid economic growth. The macroeconomic

environments in which these two booms occurred were strikingly similar. Both decades saw

above average though not exceptional growth of real output and industrial production, while


24
    Periods of depressed stock market returns occurred during periods of declining productivity growth or
other adverse supply shocks. Some such periods were characterized by deflation, e.g., 1929-32, while
others were characterized by inflation, e.g., the 1970s. In deflationary periods when aggregate supply
growth outpaced aggregate demand, such as in the late 1870s and early 1880s, the market did as well as it
did in the inflationary 1830s, 1840s, and late 1890s and early 1900s when rapid aggregate supply growth
was surpassed by demand growth (Bordo and Redish, 2002; Bordo, Lane and Redish, 2004). This contrasts
sharply with the experiences of the Great Depression, when collapsing aggregate demand coincided with a
                                                                                                       27


consumer price inflation was quite low and stable during both boom periods. Productivity growth

did increase in both the 1920s and 1990s, though in the 1920s productivity growth appears to

have occurred prior to the stock market boom, whereas the increase in productivity growth during

the 1990s coincided with the boom.

        Policymakers paid a great deal of attention to the stock market during each of the great

booms. In the 1920s, debate centered on whether the Fed had fostered the boom by

oversupplying Federal Reserve credit through open market purchases and inadequate

administration of the discount window. Many Fed officials adhered to the Real Bills Doctrine,

which held that an increase in credit beyond that required to finance short-term production and

distribution of real goods would end up fostering speculation and inflation. Despite the absence

of consumer price inflation, officials interpreted the stock market boom as evidence of inflation.

Accordingly, the Fed tightened policy in 1928 and 1929, which may have hastened the collapse

of both stock prices and the economy (Schwartz, 1991; Hamilton, 1987). Lingering doubts about

the efficacy of using monetary policy to foster economic recovery then contributed to the Fed’s

failure to ease aggressively to fight the Great Depression (Wheelock, 1991; Meltzer, 2002).

        The Fed’s understanding of the role of monetary policy was quite different in the 1990s

and 2000s. Transcripts of FOMC meetings indicate that during the 1990s, the Fed was mainly

concerned about the potential consequences of a sharp decline in stock prices, fearing that falling

stock prices would reduce consumption by reducing wealth. Although the Fed did tighten policy

in the later stages of the boom by raising its target for the fed funds rate in 1999-2000, it eased

aggressively when stock prices declined and the economy entered recession. In sharp contrast to

its policy in the early 1930s, the Fed maintained an aggressively accommodative monetary policy

well after the stock market decline had ended with the objectives of preventing deflation and

encouraging economic recovery.


decline in aggregate supply, and the Stagflation of the 1970s, which was characterized by excessive growth
of aggregate demand in the face of low or negative aggregate supply growth.
                                                                                                28


        Our survey of U.S. stock market booms finds that booms do not occur in the absence of

increases in real economic growth and perhaps productivity growth. We find little indication that

booms were caused by excessive growth of money or credit, though 19th Century booms tended to

occur during periods of monetary expansion. The view that monetary policy can cause asset

market speculation by failing to control the use of credit has been largely discarded.

Nevertheless, anecdotal evidence suggests that the stock market sometimes rises more than can be

justified by fundamentals, though economists continue to debate whether even the market peak of

1929 was too high. Not surprisingly, these questions leave the issue of how monetary policy

should respond to an asset price boom unsettled. Although one can offer plausible theoretical

arguments for responding proactively to an asset price boom, our survey suggests that

policymakers should be cautious about attempting to deflate asset prices without strong evidence

that a collapse of asset prices would have severe macroeconomic costs.

Table 2, continued: Definitions and Sources

Percentage changes (%∆) are computed as annualized percentage changes in monthly data, i.e., %∆t = 1200[(xt/xt-1) – 1] (similar formulae are used for quarterly
or annual data). The figures reported in the table are averages of these percentage changes from the month (quarter or year) following the trough month to the
peak month, except as noted below.

Productivity: For 1879-1946, labor productivity from Gordon (2000b). The data are annual – we report the average annual percentage change in productivity
from the year after that in which the trough occurs to the year in which the peak occurs. For 1947-2000, non-farm business sector labor productivity
(output/hour, seasonally adjusted, 1992=100) from the Commerce Department. The data are quarterly – we report average annualized growth rates from the
quarter following the trough to the quarter of the peak, unless the peak occurred in the first month of a quarter, in which case our averages are based on data
through the previous quarter).

Money: For 1834-1906, data are annual, and we report the average annual percent change in the money stock from the trough year to the peak year. For 1907-
2000, data are monthly, and we report the average annualized percent change from the month following the trough to the peak month. The data for 1834-59 are
the broad money stock series in Friedman and Schwartz (1970). For 1860-62, we use estimates provided by Hugh Rockhoff. Data for 1863-66 are not available.
The data for 1867-1946 are the broad money stock series in Friedman and Schwartz (1963a). The data for 1947-58 are a broad money stock series from the
NBER Macro-History Database (series 14195). For 1960-2002, we use the M2 money stock (seasonally adjusted) from the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System.

Bank Credit: For 1834-1946, data are annual (June figures), and we report the average annual percent change in total bank credit from the trough year to the
peak year. Source: Historical Statistics of the United States (1976, Series X580). Data prior to 1896 are incomplete. For 1947-2002, data are monthly from the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

Price level: For 1834-1912, monthly wholesale price index (Warren-Pearson and BLS) from Cole (1938) and NBER Macro-History database (series
M04048a/b). For 1913-2000, CPI-U (all items, seasonally adjusted).

Industrial Production: For 1834-95, Davis (2002). Davis’ data are annual – we report the average annual growth rate from the year following the trough (except
that for the boom beginning in January 1843 we include 1843) through the peak year. For 1896-1940, Miron and Romer (1989), monthly data. For 1941-2000,
Federal Reserve monthly Index of Industrial Production (seasonally adjusted).

GDP: For 1879-1946 (quarterly data), Balke and Gordon (1986). For 1949-2000, real GDP (chained $1996) (quarterly data). We report the average annual
growth rate from the quarter following the trough to the peak quarter.
