The Shrinking Advantage of Market Potential

                                          ABSTRACT

How does a country's economic geography evolve along the development path? This paper
documents recent employment growth in 18,961 regions in eight of the world's main economies.
Overall, market potential is losing importance, and local density is gaining importance, as
correlates of local growth. In mature economies, growth is strongest in low-market-potential
areas. In emerging economies, the opposite is true, though the association with market potential is
also weakening there. Structural transformation away from agriculture can account for some of
the observed changes. The part left unexplained by structural transformation is consistent with a
standard economic geography model that yields a bell-shaped relation between trade costs and the
growth of centrally located regions.

1 Introduction
Geographic proximity to markets is often seen as an important locational advantage. Regions with
access to large pools of nearby consumers save on transport costs and are hence attractive places
for firms to locate. Examples of regions with high market potential include Northwest Europe, the
U.S. Northeast and Midwest, China's eastern seaboard, and the coastal regions of Brazil and India.
      The role of market potential in shaping the spatial distribution of economic activity changes as
an economy develops. Early in this process, when agriculture is an economy's main activity and
trade costs are high, a location's inherent productivity plays an outsized role and market potential
is less relevant. As development proceeds, at least two important changes affect an economy's
geography. First, structural transformation shifts employment from agriculture to manufacturing,
and later to services. This diminishes the importance of local land suitability, and increases the role
of connectivity to other places (Henderson et al., 2018). As a result, we might expect central locations
to grow faster. Second, falling transport costs first improve the fortunes of centrally located places,
and later benefit more peripheral locations. In today's world of ever-lower trade costs, more isolated
places experience greater relative improvements in access to markets. As a result, we might expect
peripheral locations to grow faster.
      To illustrate how the importance of market potential might change with economic development,
compare the U.S. and Mexico. The five U.S. counties with the highest rates of job growth between
1990 and 2010 were Tunica, Miss., Douglas, Col., Forsyth, Ga., Dawson, Ga., and Williamson, Tex.1
While all five are part of large metro areas (Memphis, Denver, Atlanta and Austin), they are rela-
tively far from the high-market-potential areas of America's Northeast and Midwest. When focusing
on counties with employment above 400,000, we observe a similar pattern: Maricopa (Phoenix) tops
the employment growth ranking, despite its isolation (27th percentile in terms of market potential),
while the lowest employment growth was recorded in Detroit (Wayne county), despite its centrality
(99th percentile in terms of market potential). The picture is quite different in Mexico, where the
five fastest-growing municipalities are in well-connected areas close to Monterrey, Mexico City and
the Yucatan Coast (85th percentile in terms of market potential).2 While we see opposing patterns
when focusing on the importance of market potential, the same is not true for local density. In both
countries growth concentrated in areas of relatively high employment density. This suggests that
market potential and local density differ in their relevance for growth.
      In this paper, we explore whether this comparison generalizes by empirically analyzing the
changing importance of market potential and local density for employment growth across 18,961
  1  We exclude micro counties, defined as having 1990 employment below 300.

regions over the period 1990-2010. These regions cover eight of the world's main economies and
account for three-quarters of global GDP. In its scope and detail, our analysis constitutes the most
comprehensive effort thus far to document local employment growth patterns across the globe. By
including both more developed and less developed economies, we uncover meaningful differences
in the spatial growth patterns of countries at different stages of development, and we relate those
differences to structural transformation and declining trade costs.
   Our empirical analysis identifies two novel stylized facts. First, for the world as a whole, when
comparing the 2000s to the 1990s, market potential is becoming less important, and local den-
sity is becoming more important as a correlate of employment growth. Second, when comparing
economies at different levels of development, we uncover a stark contrast: whereas in emerging
economies growth tends to be greater in high-market-potential areas, in mature economies the op-
posite is true and growth concentrates in low-market-potential areas. This shows that the illustrative
examples comparing Mexico to the U.S. hold more generally across many regions and countries.
Taken together, the two stylized facts are consistent with a secular decline of market potential as a
locational advantage.
   What might account for the changing spatial distribution of employment, and in particular
for the two stylized facts? A first possible determinant is structural transformation. In emerging
economies, manufacturing and services are both disproportionately concentrated in high-density,
high-market-potential areas. The same is true for services in mature economies. Hence, struc-
tural transformation, away from agriculture in emerging economies and towards services in mature
economies, tends to shift employment to high-density, high-market-potential areas in both types
of economies. Using a simple accounting approach in the spirit of Michaels, Rauch and Redding
(2012), we show that structural transformation significantly contributes to explaining the overall
move toward higher-density areas in the world, as well as for the shift to high-market-potential
regions in emerging economies. However, it is unable to account for the weakening importance of
market potential in the world as a whole, and in particular for the lower growth in the high-market-
potential regions of mature economies.
   A second possible determinant of the world's changing economic geography is the well doc-
umented decline in transport costs (World Trade Organization, 2008; Redding and Turner, 2015;
Hummels, 2007). To form a prior on how we would expect falling trade costs to affect the loca-
tion of employment, we propose a standard economic geography model with one central and two
peripheral locations. When trade costs are prohibitive, there is no advantage to centrality, and
employment is equally spread across the three locations. As trade costs drop, the central location
initially gains employment at the expense of the peripheral locations, because it benefits dispropor-
tionately from improved access to the other locations. However, as trade costs continue to fall, the


                                                  2
central location starts to lose its proximity advantage. The peripheral locations suffer increasingly
less from worse market access, and become once again attractive because of their lower conges-
tion. This yields a well known result in economic geography: a bell-shaped relation between the
employment share of the central location and the level of trade costs.
       While we do not have precise measures of the change in transport costs across space to directly
test the model, we do know that mature economies started off at a lower level (World Bank, 2009,
UNCTAD, 2012). Hence, to the extent that mature economies experienced a drop in already low
transport costs, our simple model is consistent with the observed negative relation between initial
market potential and subsequent growth in these economies. This does not imply that market
potential is no longer an advantage. Instead, it reflects a shrinking advantage of centrality as market
potential is growing relatively faster in peripheral places. We confirm this insight by analyzing the
effect of a simulated uniform decline in transport costs in mature economies. We find that, as
predicted by the model, low-market-potential regions experience greater improvements in market
potential, and hence faster growth.
       This paper contributes to the empirical literature that documents spatial economic trends across
the world. Recent papers in that area include Gennaioli et al. (2014) who study income convergence
across 1,528 sub-national regions in 83 countries, as well as Henderson, Storeygard and Weil (2012)
and Henderson et al. (2018), who rely on satellite imagery of night lights to analyze local economic
growth and the distribution of economic activity at a high spatial resolution across the globe. In
contrast to our work, these papers do not draw on sector-level information, nor do they explore the
changing role of market potential across different economies.
       The sector-specific nature of our data allows us to assess the role of structural transformation
in shaping the changing economic geography of the world. Previous work by Michaels, Rauch and
Redding (2012, 2018) and Desmet and Rossi-Hansberg (2009, 2014) has analyzed the role of struc-
tural change in the long-run evolution of the U.S. economic geography. While our paper covers
a shorter time span, it encompasses the major economies around the world. In distinguishing be-
tween emerging and mature economies, we further enhance our understanding of how development
shapes an economy's geography (Desmet and Henderson, 2015).
       Our paper also relates to theoretical and empirical work on the bell-shaped relation between
transport costs and spatial concentration. Tabuchi (1998) generates this non-monotonicity result
in a setting with mobile labor by combining urban agglomeration economies and congestion from
intra-city commuting.3 In contrast to our work, his two-city model cannot adequately disentangle
market potential from local density, a crucial distinction in our analysis. The few quantitative or
   3 See also Krugman and Venables (1995) and Puga (1999) for models on the relation between transport costs and
real wage differences across regions in models without geographic mobility of workers. Fujita and Thisse (2006) offer a
corresponding analysis considering changes in communication costs in addition to changes in transport costs.

empirical papers that have explored the existence of a non-monotonic relation between trade costs
and geographic concentration have focused on one country or region of the world. Examples include
Kim (1995), Forslid, Haaland and Midelfart-Knarvik (2002) and Combes et al. (2011). Our paper is
the first to provide both temporal and cross-sectional empirical evidence of this bell-shaped relation
for a wide variety of regions across the globe.
      There is an extensive literature on the importance of market potential for development. In
a seminal paper, Redding and Venables (2004) estimate the role of market access in determining
the cross-country variation in per capita income. In other cross-country studies, Head and Mayer
(2011) and Jacks and Novy (2018) analyze the role of market potential as a determinant of growth
in income per capita. The importance of market potential for development and growth is related to
the role of distance for trade, and it features prominently in gravity models (Head and Mayer, 2004;
Disdier and Head, 2008). Our paper also analyzes the association of market potential with growth,
and we are first in documenting its weakening importance.
      A key contribution of the paper is the construction of a sectoral dataset that spans the period
1990 to 2010 and covers sub-national regions in eight of the world's most important economies:
Brazil, China, Europe (East and West), India, Japan, Mexico and the United States. The sectorally
disaggregated employment data come from national censuses. In its spatial, sectoral and time
coverage, the database we develop constitutes, to our knowledge, the largest source of census-based
employment data currently available. In addition, given the importance of the world's densest
metro areas for our analysis, we expend considerable effort in making those locations comparable
across different countries. To that end, we combine information on nighttime lights and land usage
to determine when different contiguous regions should be merged to form one urban area.
      The rest of the paper is organized as followed. Section 2 describes the data sources for all
countries, and explains the algorithm we use to define the world's densest areas in a consistent way
across countries. Section 3 reports the empirical findings. Sections 4 and 5 relate our findings to
structural transformation and the drop in transport costs. Section 6 concludes.


2 Data
This section discusses the data we use to investigate the effect of employment density and market
potential on employment growth across 18,961 regions of the world over the period 1990-2010.4 The
analysis covers 34 countries, which together make up 55% of world population and 74% of global
GDP in 2010.5 For part of our analysis we split the sample into emerging and mature economies.
  4   Note that we use the term `effect' is in a broad sense that need not imply direct causation.

When doing so, we define the group of emerging economies to be Brazil, Central and Eastern
Europe, China, India, and Mexico; and we define the group of mature economies to be Japan, the
United States, and Western Europe.6

2.1 Geographic Units
Depending on the country, our geographic units of observation consist of second- or third-level
administrative divisions. We use municipalities for Brazil, Japan and Mexico, counties for China
and the U.S., subdistricts for India, and NUTS3 regions for Europe. To make these geographic
units as comparable as possible across time and across space, we need to deal with mergers and
break-ups of administrative regions, as well as with differences in the granularity of the data across
countries.


Mergers and break-ups. Over a span of twenty years there are inevitably certain sub-national units
that get merged and others that get divided. We aggregate sub-national units in such a way that
the resulting geographic entities are consistent over the entire time period. Whenever a break-up
occurs, we merge subdivisions in subsequent years, and whenever a merger occurs, we aggregate
subdivisions in previous years. The numbers of actual and consolidated regions by economy are
provided in columns (1) and (2) in Table 1. Starting with 22,677 regions, consolidation lowers this
number to 19,725.

Urban areas.      Administrative regions do not always capture labor markets adequately. In partic-
ular, large urban areas often consist of multiple administrative regions that form one unified labor
market. Because of this, we adopt a methodology that aggregates administrative units whenever
they are part of the same urban area.7 To do so, we rely on two datasets with worldwide coverage
and use a procedure to group contiguous administrative regions into one urban area when their
densities warrant us to do so. We combine nighttime lights data from the Defense Meteorological
Satellites Program ­ Operational Linescan System (DMSP­OLS) with land cover information from
ESA's Globcover project to identify high-density areas which cover several administrative subdivi-
sions. Administrative subdivisions covered by a common urban area are then merged into a single
region, provided a minimum share of their areas are covered by the high-density area. Appendix
A.2 gives further details of the exact procedure we follow. Column (3) in Table 1 displays the num-
ber of regions resulting from consolidating urban areas. It shows a reduction in their total number
from 19,725 to 19,192. After dropping consolidated regions with an area of less than 20 square kilo-
meters, as well as a few regions with missing employment data, we are left with the 18,961 regions
in column (4) that form the core database used in our empirical analysis.8 In Sections 4 and 5,
where we use sector-level employment data, we moreover drop all observations for which reported
total employment differs by more than 15% from the sum of reported employment across the three
sectors (agriculture, manufacturing, services). This adjustment mainly affects India, where we lose
22% of regions, and Brazil, where we lose 15% of regions. It brings the total number of observations
to 17,418 (see Table 5).
    Defining urban areas in a consistent and comparable manner across economies also helps to
ensure that our results are not driven by systematic differences in the size of administrative units
across economies. For instance, the metropolitan division of New York City covers 11 counties,
whereas much of Beijing is covered by the single county of Beijing Shi.9 Failing to aggregate regions
which belong to the same urban area in countries with a finer level of administrative disaggregation
could lead to artificial differences in our empirical findings across countries.


Weighting and standardizing. As can be seen in Table 2, there are important differences across
economies in the fineness of administrative subdivisions. For example, the average U.S. county
   7 Our sector-level employment data being available at the level of administrative regions, we can only correct in the

sense of combining regions that together form a functional urban area, but we cannot decompose regions that are "too
large". For urban area definitions based entirely on remotely sensed data, see Baragwanath-Vogel, Goldblatt, Hanson
and Khandelwal (2018).
   8 We drop consolidated regions with an area of less than 20 square kilometers because they typically exhibit excep-

tionally high density but due to their small size are nevertheless economically unimportant (e.g. military bases).

has an area of 2,953 square kilometers, whereas the average Mexican municipality has an area of
872 square kilometers. To the extent that these differences are especially relevant for the upper
tail of the distribution, we have already addressed this issue by adopting a consistent definition of
urban areas across economies. Of course, these differences may also matter for the lower tail of the
distribution. For example, 94% of the Brazilian municipalities had a density lower than the first
quartile of Chinese counties in 1990. This is mainly because employment density in Brazil is less
than one-tenth that of China. To avoid a situation where different density intervals correspond to
different economies, we express our independent variables in terms of their percentile within each
economy. Recall that economies correspond to countries, except in Europe, where we aggregate
countries into either Western Europe or Central and Eastern Europe.
       Differences in the fineness of administrative subdivisions also pose another problem: without
further adjustment, our results are likely going to be driven by economies that happen to be subdi-
vided into a large number of regions, simply because these economies make up a larger share of the
observations. To avoid this pitfall, our regressions weight each economy equally. That is, the weight
                                              1
of each region of economy c is wc =           Nc ,   where Nc denotes the number of regions in economy c.
Also, since average employment growth varies considerably across economies, for reasons that are
often unrelated to their geography, we mean-deviate growth rates by economy.

2.2 Employment and Density
We rely on multiple statistical sources to construct our employment database of 18,961 regions. For
example, for China we use county-level employment data from the Population Census, distributed
by the University of Michigan China Data Center; for Mexico we use municipal-level employment
data from the General Census of Population and Housing, published by the Mexican National In-
stitute of Statistics and Geography; and for the U.S. we use county-level employment data from the
County Business Patterns, published by the U.S. Census Bureau. To enable us to study employment
growth across time, our database focuses on three years: 1990, 2000 and 2010. In addition to total
employment, we also consider sectoral employment in agriculture, manufacturing and services.10
Table 2 reports summary statistics of the employment data, and Appendix A.1 provides further
details about the different sources.
       For our measure of land area, we use administrative boundaries from the Global Administrative
Areas Database (GADM) for all countries, with the exception of China (Michigan's China Data
Center), the U.S. (Siczewicz, 2011) and India (ORGI, 2011). Given that we are interested in land area
to get a measure of employment density, we exclude areas unfit for economic activity. To that end,
  10 Strictly speaking, our data allow us to distinguish between primary, secondary and tertiary employment. Hence,
"agriculture" also contains forestry and fisheries, and "manufacturing" includes energy, mining and construction. Given
the relatively minor employment weights of those neighboring sectors, we prefer to use the simpler terminology.

we rely on the European Space Agency (ESA) Globcover project (Version 2.3, 2009) and its Land
Cover gridded map which categorizes land cover into 22 classes at a spatial resolution of 300m.
We define the relevant area as the land covered by all types of surface but water bodies, bare areas
and permanent snow and ice.11 Using data on employment and on area, Figure 1 panel (a) depicts
employment density across our sample economies. The color-coding is based on economy-specific
deciles.

2.3 Market Potential
A location's attraction as a place to produce depends partly on the market it can access in its own
location and in all other locations, a concept Harris (1954) refers to as market potential. Intuitively,
the market potential of location i depends (i) positively on the income of all locations, Yj , and (ii)
negatively on the cost of accessing all locations, dij . Based on this, we can define a location's market
potential as the access-cost-adjusted sum of aggregate income in all other locations:

                                               N M Pi =      Yj dij
                                                                 -
                                                                    ,                                               (1)
                                                           j J


where J is the set of all locations and  is the rate at which the contribution of other locations to
market potential decays with the cost of access. Head and Mayer (2004) refer to (17) as nominal
market potential, hence our notation NMP. The related concept of real market potential adjusts for
differences in the price index across locations. The simple economic geography model in Appendix
B discusses this in further detail.
       As for the value of the decay parameter, Disdier and Head (2008) carry out a systematic analysis
of 1,467 estimates of  in 103 papers, and find a range from -0.04 to 2.33, with a mean of 0.91 and a
median of 0.87. We therefore set  equal to 1, so that our expression of market potential simplifies
to
                                                                   Yj
                                                  N M Pi =      dij .                                               (2)
                                                               j

This is equivalent to the market potential expression in Harris (1954). We now discuss how we get
estimates of Yj and dij .
       When measuring market potential in the data, we use worldwide nighttime lights to proxy for
income.12 For the purpose of estimating the contribution of different locations to a region's market
potential, the geographic units we have used so far are too coarse. Given the steep spatial decay
  11 The surface of bare areas is characterized by hardpans, gravels, bare rock, stones, boulders, sandy desert or salt
hardpans. Considering the case of the USA, 97% of the territory is included. The excluded surface consists of water
bodies (1.6%), permanent snow and ice (1.1%) and bare areas (0.3%)
  12 We approximate 1990 market potentials with lights data for 1996, the earliest available year. For 2000 and 2010, we

can compute market potentials from lights measurements in the corresponding years.



                                                           9
in (2), the within-region geographic distribution of economic activity is relevant. For example,
whether a neighboring region's economic activity is concentrated in the area closest to or farthest
away from the region under consideration makes an important difference. The importance of the
within-region distribution is even more obvious when we consider the market potential coming
from the own region's economic activity. To address these concerns when estimating the market
potential of region i in economy c, we discretize economy c into 6 by 6 cells, indexed by h  Hc ,
and we discretize the rest of the world in 1 by 1 grid cells, indexed by g  Gc .13 The market
potential of grid cell h in country c is then:

                                                             Yh        Yg
                                         N M Phc =           dhh
                                                                 + 
                                                                      d
                                                                          ,
                                                      h Hc        g Gc hg


where the first term measures market potential originating in the own economy and the second
term measures market potential from the rest of the world. For each region i in economy c, we then
take the average market potential of all grid cells with centroids inside the region, weighted by their
share of the nighttime lights of the entire region:

                                                       hcHic N M Phc Yhc
                                          N M Pic =                                                                    (3)
                                                         hcHic Yhc

where Hic is the set of grid cells with centroids located in region i of economy c. This measure can
be interpreted as the average market potential faced by a firm in region i of country c.
      To estimate bilateral trade costs dhh , we use information on major roads, other roads, railroads
and water to attach a cost to each grid cell. We then apply the method in Desmet, Nagy and
Rossi-Hansberg (2018) and Allen and Arkolakis (2014) to create a cost surface, and use the 2D Fast
Marching Algorithm to calculate dhh . The cost of a grid cell trading with itself is calculated as the
average travel cost to the center of a disk with the same area. As shown by Head and Mayer (2000),
                      
this cost will be 0.67 area/ times the average cost per kilometer. Since the distance distortion in
any projected coordinate system is quite large when we consider two locations that are far apart,
we use the 3D Fast Marching Algorithm to calculate dhg . As the cost surface in 2D and 3D Fast
Marching exercises have different resolutions, the cost function in the 2D Fast Marching exercise is
normalized to match the costs per kilometer in the 3D Fast Marching exercise, conditioning on the
geographic features.
      Figure 1 panel (b) depicts market potential across our sample economies. Once again, the color-
coding is based on economy-specific deciles. The world's high-market-potential regions can be
found in the Northeast and the Midwest in the U.S., northwestern Europe, the Gulf Coast of Mexico
stretching to the nation's capital, Brazil's coastline area, China's eastern seaboard, India's coasts
 13   We take a coarser grid cell for market potential from the rest of the world to keep computing time manageable.

Panel (a) shows regional population densities, binned in economy-specific deciles (data for 1990). Panel (b) shows regional market
potential, binned in economy-specific deciles. Measures of market potential include own-region effects and are based on worldwide
gridded nightlights data for 1996. Given the within-economy binning applied to both maps, color codes are comparable only within
economies but not between them. We distinguish 8 economies: Brazil, Central and Eastern Europe, China, India, Japan, Mexico, United
States, Western Europe.

potential, the world's high-density areas are often located within high-market-potential regions,
but not always. Examples of high-density locations in areas of overall low market potential that
are easily visible in the maps of Figure 1 include Denver and Salt Lake City in the U.S., Manaus in
Brazil, Madrid in Spain, and Jiuquan in China.

          Density and market potential ranked within each economy and normalized to the range [0,1]. Data for 1990.


   A further illustration of the joint distribution of density and market potential in our sample is
given by the scatter plot of Figure 2. It shows that the two measures are correlated, as the scatter
is at its densest in the vicinity of the diagonal. Indeed, the correlation between the (ranked and
normalized) densities and market potentials is 0.54. While positive and significant, this correlation
is far below unity. As can be seen in Figure 2, a large number of regions score relatively high on one
variable but relatively low on the other. We therefore can exploit identifying variation that covers
the entire density-market potential spectrum.
   Finally, we illustrate some basic features of our data by documenting where sector-level growth
took place over the 1990-2010 sample period. To this end, Figure 3, plots heat maps based on cubic
regressions of sector-level employment growth against market potential and density. Unlike in our
subsequent analysis, growth is not demeaned ­ allowing us to show differences in absolute growth
rates across sectors and economies. In the remainder of the paper, we instead focus on reallocations
across regions given an economy-sector average growth rate. The z -axis scale is held constant across

                         Several findings emerge from these heat maps. First, employment growth was strongest in
emerging economy service sectors and weakest (indeed negative) in mature economy agriculture.
Second, in mature economies the growth patterns were similar across all sectors: employment
grew relatively fast in low-market-potential, medium-high-density locations, not just in services,
but also in agriculture and manufacturing. Third, the highest growth rates of all are observed for
services in high-market-potential emerging-economy regions. Emerging-economy manufacturing
employment, instead, appears to be shifting toward medium-market potential locations.

3 Market Potential, Local Density and Employment Growth
In this section we empirically analyze employment growth across 18,961 regions of the world for
the decades spanning 1990 to 2010. We focus on the relation between market potential, local em-
ployment density and employment growth. We explore how the importance of market potential
and local employment density has changed over time, and how this differs across emerging and
mature economies.
   The regressions of regional employment growth on regional market potential and regional em-
ployment density take the general form:

                       Ei,c,t+1 - Ei,c,t Ec,t+1 - Ec,t
                                        -              = f (Ei,c,t ) + g (N M P i,c,t ) + ui,c,t+1 ,               (4)
                             Ei,c,t           Ec,t

        Ei,c,t+1 -Ei,c,t       Ec,t+1 -Ec,t
where        Ei,c,t        -       Ec,t       is the growth rate of employment in region i of economy c between
years t and t + 1 demeaned by the growth rate of employment in economy c between years t and
t + 1; f (Ei,c,t ) is a linear, quadratic or cubic function of Ei,c,t , the employment density in region i of
economy c in year t expressed as an economy-specific percentile; g (N M P i,c,t ) is a linear, quadratic
or cubic function of N M P i,c,t , the nominal market potential of region i in economy c in year t
expressed as an economy-specific percentile; and ui,c,t+1 is a mean-zero stochastic term.

weighting economies by wc =                                                     Nc .   In column (1) of Table 3 we find market potential to have a
positive effect on subsequent growth. When controlling for local density in column (2), the result
is unchanged: market potential matters positively, whereas local density has essentially no effect.
The estimated coefficient on market potential of 0.47 implies that annual employment growth in an
economy's region with the highest market potential was on average about 0.47 percentage points
higher than employment growth in that same economy's region with the lowest market potential.
Given that the average annual employment growth rate in our sample was 0.8 percent, this is an
economically sizable difference. To facilitate a visual interpretation of the results in column (2),
Figure 4 panel (a) plots the linear predictions of the effect of market potential and density on
aggregate employment growth .

           When comparing the 1990s and the 2000s in columns (4) and (6) of Table 3, we find that the im-
portance of market potential for employment growth has declined over time, becoming statistically

                                                                                                 15
insignificant in the latter decade. Density, however, goes from exhibiting a negative and statisti-
cally significant coefficient to exhibiting a positive and statistically significant effect. Once again,
these changes are economically meaningful: whereas in the 1990s a region with the highest market
potential is estimated to have benefitted from an annual growth rate 0.71 percentage points above
that of a region with the lowest market potential, this advantage had dropped to 0.14 percentage
points by the 2000s. In the case of density, the change goes in the opposite direction: in the 1990s a
region with the highest density had an estimated growth rate 0.22 percentage points below that of
a region with the lowest density; by the 2000s this disadvantage had turned to an advantage of 0.39
percentage points. The linear predictions of columns (4) and (6) are visually represented in Figure
4 panel (b). From this we can conclude that, for the world as a whole, market potential is losing
importance, whereas density is gaining importance as a determinant of local growth. We refer to
this finding as the first stylized fact we uncover in our analysis.


Comparing mature and emerging economies. When comparing growth patterns in mature and
emerging economies, we uncover a stark difference. As reported in column (1) of Table 4, market
potential has opposing effects in the two economies: positive for emerging and negative for mature.
We refer to this as the second stylized fact of our empirical analysis. Moreover, the positive effect in
emerging economies has weakened in the most recent decade, whereas the negative effect in mature
economies has strengthened between 1990-2000 and 2000-2010 ­ confirming the generality of our
first stylized fact. To be precise, in emerging economies the estimated annual growth advantage of
the highest-market potential relative to the lowest-market potential region dropped from 0.95 to 0.45
percentage points between the 1990s and the 2000s, whereas in mature economies the disadvantage
increased from -0.03 to -0.59 percentage points over the same time period. Density also has opposing
effects in both types of economies, but in the reverse sense: initial density hurts employment growth
in emerging economies, whereas it helps employment growth in mature economies.
   When plotting the predicted linear effects of market potential and density on growth, panels
(c) and (d) of Figure 4 show that mature and emerging economies are mirror images of each other.
However, our second stylized fact focuses only on the opposing effects of market potential, because
the opposing effects of density are no longer present in the 2000s. In particular, columns (3) and (5)
of Table 4 show how the coefficient on density in emerging economies turns from negative in the
1990s to positive in the 2000s.


Non-linear effects.   There is no reason why the relations between market potential, density and
employment growth should necessarily be linear. When allowing for quadratic terms in our esti-
mating equation (4), Tables 3 and 4 show that these additional terms are statistically significant, and

the explanatory power of the model, while still low, rises by a factor of up to four. Figure 5 depicts
the predicted quadratic relations based on column (2) of Table 4. In mature economies, market
potential has an overall negative effect, and density an overall positive effect, whereas for emerging
economies, market potential has a positive effect, whereas density has a nonlinear effect, with both
high- and low-density places growing faster than middle-density places.
      A more comprehensive way of visualizing our results is to use "heat maps" based on cubic
regressions of growth on market potential and density.14 Figure 6 plots, for all combinations of
market potential and employment density, the predicted employment growth of regression (4) when
 14   For comparability, the color scale is held constant within sets of heat maps that illustrate predicted growth rates.

including linear, quadratic and cubic terms of the two explanatory variables. In the emerging
economies, growth is concentrated in the high-market-potential regions, with both low- and high-
density places doing well. In contrast, in mature economies, growth is highest in the low-market-
potential, medium-high-density locations. This confirms our previous findings.

4 The Spatial Implications of Structural Transformation
We now turn to exploring possible explanations for the spatial patterns we have identified. We
start by assessing the role of structural transformation. Because sectors differ in where they tend
to locate, the sectoral shift away from agriculture in emerging economies and towards services in
mature economies is hence likely to change the spatial distribution of economic activity.

4.1 The Global Rise of Services
As can be seen in Table 2, the share of agricultural employment in our total sample fell from 49.9
percent in 1990 to 36.8 percent in 2010, whereas the corresponding employment share of services
increased from 30.9 to 40.7 percent. The decline of agriculture and the rise of services can be
observed in each of our eight sample economies. The share of manufacturing employment fell in
six of our eight sample economies, the important exceptions being China and India.
   To understand how structural transformation might impact spatial growth patterns, we first
document where different sectors located at the beginning of our sample period. Figure 7 depicts
heat maps of predicted sectoral employment shares in 1990 as a function of third-order polynomials
of market potential and employment density. In emerging economies, both manufacturing and
service employment were strongly concentrated in high-density, high-market-potential locations.
In mature economies, we see the same pattern for services, whereas manufacturing concentrates in
medium-density, medium-market-potential places. In both economies, agriculture is concentrated in
low-density, low-market-potential regions. Based on these initial sectoral shares, we would expect
structural transformation, away from agriculture in emerging economies and towards services in
mature economies, to especially benefit high-density, high-market-potential locations in both types
of economies. In the next subsection, we analyze this prediction more formally.


4.2 Counterfactual Growth Due to Structural Change
To evaluate the role of structural transformation for the observed spatial growth patterns, we ap-
ply the accounting methodology used by Michaels, Rauch and Redding (2012). For each region,
we calculate how fast growth would have been if each of its sectors had grown at its respective
economy-wide sectoral growth rate. If actual growth patterns resemble these counterfactual growth
patterns, we can conclude that structural transformation is an important driver of the relation be-
tween market potential, density and growth.

   Formally, we take the employment level in sector s and region i of economy c in 1990, Ei ,c,1990 ,
and apply to it the economy-level employment growth rate of sector s between 1990 and 2010,

   Based on cubic regressions of the counterfactual growth rate on market potential and employ-
ment density, Figure 8 shows heat maps of the predicted counterfactual growth rates. The figures
show that structural change correlates strongly with changing economic geographies in emerging
economies, but not in mature economies. Panel (b), for mature economies, shows structural trans-
formation leaving the spatial distribution of employment essentially unaffected. In contrast, struc-
tural change in emerging economies, away from agriculture and towards services, clearly favored
employment growth in high-market-potential, high-density areas (Panel (c)).
   Figure 9 illustrates the role of structural transformation in a different way. It compares the actual
growth rates and the counterfactual growth rates as predicted by quadratic regressions on market
potential and density. When considering all economies for the period 1990-2010, we see very little
difference between actual growth and counterfactual growth. Hence, if the only force at work had
been structural transformation, it would have let to a similar relation between market potential,
density and growth as the one observed in the data. This suggests that structural transformation
accounts well for the relationship between market potential, density and growth. If we look over
time, structural transformation is unable to pick up the drop in importance in market potential
between the two decades. If anything, it predicts market potential having an increasing effect,
while the opposite is true in the data.
   In Figure 10, we illustrate the role of structural change separately for mature and emerging
economies. It again becomes clear that structural transformation is able to account for the high
growth of high-market-potential regions in emerging economies. Panel (b) shows that if the only
force at work were structural transformation, it would have generated essentially the same rela-
tion between growth and market potential as the one observed in the data. In contrast, structural
transformation is unable to explain the negative effect of market potential on growth in mature
economies. In fact, Panel (a) shows that structural transformation by itself would have generated
growth rates that bear little relation to density and market potential.


4.3 Residual Growth
An alternative way to assess the role of structural transformation is to analyze what it leaves un-
explained. We refer to this unexplained part as residual growth, and define it as the difference
between actual growth and counterfactual growth. Figure 11 shows heat maps of residual growth
on market potential and density. These heat maps can be compared to Figure 6 for total employ-
ment growth and to Figure 8 for counterfactual employment growth due to structural change. For
all economies taken together, residual growth patterns are largely unrelated to market potential and
density, confirming that structural transformation accounts for the observed patterns in the data.
Likewise, for emerging economies, structural transformation is able to explain the relatively fast

growth of high-market-potential locations, though it underpredicts growth if those locations have
low density ­ a fact that is likely due to population and economic activity "spreading out" into hith-
erto sparsely populated areas. In contrast, for mature economies, the residual growth patterns look
very similar to the actual growth patterns, indicating that structural change plays no discernible
role in the rise of low-market-potential locations.15
            In addition to visually inspecting heat maps, we also compare regressions of residual employ-
ment growth (Table 5) to regressions of actual employment growth (Table 3). By comparing column
(1) of Table 5 to column (2) of Table 3, we can infer that, for the world as a whole, structural trans-
formation accounts for about two-thirds of the positive effect of market potential on growth. To
see this, in the actual growth regression the coefficient on market potential is 0.47, whereas in the
residual growth regression that same coefficient is 0.15, so that a share (0.47 - 0.15)/0.47 = 0.68 of
   15 This conclusion is consistent with Figure 3, where we find that in mature economies all three sectors grew most

strongly in these low-market-potential regions.

the overall effect can be accounted for by structural transformation, with the remaining one third
still to be explained.
                         We now do the same comparisons for emerging and mature economies. In emerging economies,
comparing column (3) of Table 5 to column (1) of Table 4 reveals that the positive effect of market
potential on residual growth is only about 40 percent as large as the effect on total growth ­ some
60 percent of the observed market potential effect is therefore accounted for by structural trans-
formation. In contrast, a comparison of column (2) of Table 5 to column (1) of Table 4 shows that
structural transformation does not correlate significantly with changes in the economic geography
of mature economies. If anything, the result goes the other way: the coefficient on market potential
in the residual growth regression is negative and of a larger magnitude than its corresponding coef-
ficient in the actual growth regression. If the only force at work had been structural transformation,
it would have benefited high-market-potential places in mature economies.

decades. A comparison with Table 3 confirms that also within each decade the effect of market
potential is consistently less positive for residual employment growth than for total employment
growth. The most striking finding of the between-decade comparison is the strong decline in the
residual employment growth effect of market potential across the two subperiods, turning from
significantly positive in the 1990s to significantly negative in the 2000s. Hence, both the cross-
sectional comparison of mature and emerging economies and the intertemporal comparison across
our two sample decades suggest that structural change acted as a brake on the relative loss of
dynamism of high-market-potential regions.
   Summarizing the evidence in the last two subsections, we can conclude that structural transfor-
mation accounts rather well for the spatial growth patterns in the world as a whole over the period
1990-2010. This is almost entirely due to its high explanatory power in emerging economies. It does
less well in accounting for the weakening importance of market potential over time in the world
economy, and for the negative effect of market potential on growth in mature economies. That is,
the shift away from market potential, especially in mature economies, remains to be explained.


5 Transport Costs and Market Potential
In this section we offer a possible explanation for the negative effect of market potential on residual
growth in mature economies and in the world as a whole in the more recent decade. In addition
to structural transformation, a second force that is likely to have shaped the world's changing eco-
nomic geography is the systematic decline in transport and trade costs (World Trade Organization,
2008; Redding and Turner, 2015). For example, the cost of air shipping dropped by 92 percent


                                                     24
between 1955 and 2004, and the cost of maritime transport has been steadily declining since the
mid-1980s (Hummels, 2007). Several factors have contributed to this trend, including technological
improvements, scale economies and market liberalization.
   To understand how the drop in transport costs might have affected the relation between market
potential and growth, consider a standard economic geography model with one central location
and two peripheral locations. The full details of the model are given in Appendix B; here we limit
ourselves to a brief description. In an otherwise symmetric setup, when trade costs are prohibitive,
free mobility implies that employment will be equally spread across the three locations. As trade
costs gradually drop, the high-market-potential central location initially gains employment at the
expense of the peripheral locations, because it benefits disproportionately from improved access
to the other locations. However, as trade costs continue to fall, the proximity advantage of the
high-market-potential central location starts to erode. The peripheral locations benefit from a larger
improvement in market access, and they once again become attractive because of their lower conges-
tion. This yields a bell-shaped relation between the employment share of the high-market-potential
location and the level of trade costs.
   In this model, when transport costs are already relatively low, any further drop generates a
negative relation between initial market potential and growth: the low-market-potential (peripheral)
locations gain relative to the high-market-potential (central) location. The lower growth of the high-
market-potential region does not imply that there is a disadvantage to market access. Rather, it
reflects peripheral locations gaining increasingly equal market access, leading to a weakening of the
relative advantage of centrality. That is, the improvement in market potential is larger in locations
that start off with lower market potential. This explains why a drop in transport costs causes
peripheral locations to grow faster.
   Might this account for the negative relation between market potential and residual growth in
mature economies? We do not have precise measures of the improvement in transport costs across
space for the period 1990-2010, and we are therefore unable to test the model's predictions directly.
However, if mature economies experienced a drop in already low transport costs, our empirical
findings are consistent with the model. Moreover, to the extent that the fall in transport costs was
uniform across space in mature economies, we can gauge the relevance of the model's predictions
by simulating the effect of lower trade costs. Since transport infrastructure networks in mature
economies were already largely in place in 1990, most cost savings in interregional transport came
from technological and regulatory changes. As a first approximation, it is therefore reasonable
to assume that such changes affected all locations in a similar way. Following this argument, we
consider a uniform drop in the distance decay parameter  in equation (1) to generate simulated
estimates of the changes in market potential in all locations. This approach yields negative (but not


                                                 25
perfect) correlations between simulated increases in market potentials and initial market potentials.
Hence, the gain in market potential is larger in locations with initially lower market potential. Table
6 reports regressions of mature-economy residual growth on simulated changes of market poten-
tial, assuming different reductions in the decay parameter.16 We observe that in all specifications
employment growth correlates positively and significantly with simulated increases in market po-
tential. This is consistent with the mechanism of our geography model. Both in the model and in
the data, locations with lower initial market potential benefit from greater gains in market poten-
tial. This explain why the negative relation between initial market potential and growth implies a
positive relation between the change in market potential and growth.

      Why did we not see this same relation between market potential and growth in emerging
economies? We can think of at least three potential reasons. First, the model's bell-shaped pre-
diction says that a drop in transport costs will hurt high-market-potential locations if those costs are
relatively low, but it will benefit high-market-potential locations if those costs are relatively high.
Hence, if transport was still relatively expensive in emerging economies, our findings of central lo-
 16   In some specification, we assume transport costs fall only between regions but not within regions.



                                                            26
cations experiencing faster growth is consistent with the theory.17 Second, transport infrastructure
investment has been a big driver of falling transport costs in emerging economies. To the extent
that these improvements did not occur uniformly across the board but were mostly concentrated
in locations with already high market potential, we are less likely to see a negative relation be-
tween market potential and growth.18 Third, in emerging economies structural transformation is
the main determinant of growth in high-market-potential locations over the full sample period. As
is obvious from Figure 10, Panel (b), counterfactual growth based on structural transformation lines
up nearly perfectly with the actual growth rate in emerging economies. Hence, residual growth
patterns are less revelatory of the dominant forces shaping the location of overall employment in
emerging economies than in mature economies.


6 Conclusions
This paper has documented employment growth patterns in 18,961 regions across the world for
the period 1990 to 2010. In doing so, we have identified two stylized facts. First, for the world as
a whole, market potential is becoming less important, and local density is becoming more impor-
tant for economic growth. Second, market potential has a positive effect on growth in emerging
economies, while the opposite is true in mature economies. We have shown that structural transfor-
mation ­ especially the growing share of employment in services ­ goes some way in accounting for
the world's changing economic geography. It offers an explanation for the increasing importance
of local density in the world as a whole, and it accounts well for local growth patterns in emerg-
ing economies. However, it fails to provide an explanation for the shrinking advantage of market
potential, especially in mature economies. We have then shown that this latter finding is consistent
with a standard economic geography model that yields a bell-shaped relation between trade costs
and the growth of high-market-potential areas.




  17 We indeed know that transport costs are higher in emerging economies than in mature economies (World Bank,
2009). As an example, over the period 1995-2014 maritime freight costs were between 20 and 50 percent higher in the
developing countries of Asia and America than in the developed world (UNCTAD, 2012).
  18 This also means that simulations of uniform changes in transport costs across region pairs analogous to Table 6

would not be appropriate in the case of our emerging-economy sample.

A      Data Construction
A.1 Country Data
Brazil. Brazilian employment data come from the Demographic Censuses for the years 1991, 2000
and 2010. These microlevel data are published by the Brazilian Institute for Statistics and Geogra-
phy (IBGE). We aggregate the data to the municipal level. This corresponds to the second level of
administrative divisions, beneath the states. We use concordance tables from IBGE to convert the
1991 industrial classification, specific to the 1991 census, to the CNAE-Domiciliar classification of the
2000 census, which is used for both the 2000 and 2010 censuses.

China. Employment data for China come from the 1990, 2000 and 2010 Population Census. We use
data at the county level, the third division level after the province and the prefecture. These data
are distributed by the University of Michigan China Data Center.

Europe. European regional employment comes from Cambridge Econometrics. It covers the 27
member states of the European Union and Norway. Data are at the third administrative division
level (NUTS3) and are available at an annual frequency. For part of our analysis we split Europe
into Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe, with the divide being what used to be the
Iron Curtain. Due to data availability, the initial year of analysis for Central and Eastern European
countries is 1991.

India. The main data source for India is the Primary Census Abstract published by the Office of the
Registrar General of India and Census Commissioner of India. We use data for the years 1991, 2001
and 2011. The data are available at the subdistrict level, which corresponds to the third-level admin-
istrative division, beneath the states and the districts. We ignore the state of Jammu & Kashmir, due
to the unavailability of data for the year 1991. The 1991 census provides employment information
for 10 sectors, while the censuses of 2001 and 2011 only distinguishes four sectors. To address this
shortcoming, we augment data for 2000 and 2011 with sectoral details from the Employment &
Unemployment Survey published by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO).19

Japan. Japanese employment data come from the Population Censuses for the years 1990, 2000 and
2010. They are distributed by the Statistical Information Institute for Consulting and Analysis (Sin-
fonica). The data are available at the municipality (Shi, Machi and Mura) level, which is the second
  19 The 55th (2000) and 66th (2010) rounds of the NSS provide employment at the district level for 5-digit industries.
To get estimates of employment at the subdistrict level, we regress district-level sectoral employment shares from NSS
on different variables available in the census: 4 sectors (cultivators, agricultural, household industry, others), the share
of urban population, the literacy rate and state fixed effects. Since the dependent variable is a share  [0, 1], we use
GLM estimation with logit link and binomial family. We then use the parameters estimates from the regression to predict
sectoral shares at the subdistrict level, making sure that the estimated share corresponds to the actual district aggregates
from the NSS data.

degree of administrative divisions, below the prefecture.

Mexico. Data for Mexico are taken from the census (Censo General de Población y Vivienda) for the
years 1990, 2000 and 2010. These data are published by the Mexican National Institute of Statistics
and Geography (INEGI) and are available at the municipality level, which corresponds to the third-
degree administrative divisions, below the states and districts.20

United States. U.S. employment data comes from the County Business Patterns (CBP) dataset pub-
lished by the U.S. Census Bureau. The data cover workers in the private sector at the county level
(second-level administrative division, below the states).21 We complement private sector employ-
ment from the CBP with government employment from the Regional Economic Accounts of the U.S.
Bureau of Economic Analysis. The classification of the CBP data is based on the 1988-1997 Stan-
dard Industrial Classification (SIC) nomenclature in 1990, the 1998-2001 North American Industry
Classification System (NAICS) in 2000 and the 2007-2008 NAICS in 2010. We convert 1990 and 2000
data into the NAICS 2007 classification using concordance tables from the U.S. Census Bureau.

A.1.1      Sectoral Disaggregation.

The available sectoral detail for regional employment varies across countries and over time. For
the sake of comparability, we aggregate employment data to the following three broad sectors:
agriculture (primary), manufacturing (secondary) and services (tertiary). All details of how this is
done is available in the paper's Online Appendix.

A.2 Urban Areas
To construct comparable urban areas across economies, we start by using the Defense Meteorolog-
ical Satellites Program ­ Operational Linescan System (DMSP­OLS) nighttime lights data of 2010.
We correct the DMSP­OLS data for over-glow following Pinkovskiy (2017). To capture high-density
areas, we form polygons based on the top most luminous grids of night light. The yellow polygons
in Figure A6 panel (a) illustrate this for the case of the U.S. Eastern Seaboard. For a polygon to qual-
ify as an urban area, we assume a minimum size, and for an administrative region to be included
in an urban area, we assume a minimum share of its area must be covered by a polygon.
       To determine the values of this minimum size and this minimum share, we perform a calibra-
tion exercise that targets the high-density part of large Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in
  20 We augment the data for Oaxaca in 2000, available only at the district-level in the census, with a 10.6% micro-
data municipality-level sample from the census obtained through the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS).
We obtain total municipality level data by using weights from the IPUMS data that correspond to district employment
shares. Likewise, due to limited sectoral information for 2010 in the state of Oaxaca, we also rely on a 10% micro-data
sample of the 2010 census obtained from IPUMS. In that case, we multiply municipality-level sectoral shares from IPUMS
by the total employment level in the census.
  21 Since CBP employment by industry is sometimes reported as intervals, we use the fixed-point algorithm of Autor,

Dorn and Hanson (2013) to estimate employment numbers within those intervals.


                                                          32
the U.S. We obtain reasonable results by considering counties with at least 20% of their surface
covered by night light polygons of at least 200 square kilometers.22 One issue is that some night
light polygons generate continuous urban areas that are unreasonably large. For example, Figure
A6 panel (a) shows one of the night light polygons covering, without discontinuity, two MSAs,
Washington-Arlington-Alexandria and Baltimore-Towson. To avoid such cases, we use additional
data on Artificial surfaces and associated areas (Urban areas >50%) from ESA's Globcover project. The
polygons formed by artificial surfaces aim to capture the cores of the different urban areas which
otherwise cannot be segregated using the night light data. Such artificial surfaces are represented
in red in Figure A6 panel (a). When a polygon of night light covers several urban cores, we assign
the county to an urban area based on its proximity to those cores.
       Applying this algorithm, we identify in the U.S. 37 urban areas covering 77 counties, all of which
are assigned to the correct MSAs as delineated by the OMB. Because our aim is to capture the high-
density parts of large MSAs, we exclude certain types of counties that would otherwise enter into
the definition of an MSA. An example would be a county that is divided into a large low-density
hinterland and a small high-density cluster close to an urban core. Although most of its population
is functionally part of the urban area, including such a county would introduce a downward bias on
the density of urban areas. Figure A6 panel (b) provides a comparison between our methodology
and the OMB classification of MSAs.23 If we consider MSAs with a population of at least one
million, our procedure captures the different MSAs reasonably well. From north to south on the
U.S. Eastern Seaboard, we can distinguish Boston-Cambridge-Quincy, New York-Northern New
Jersey-Long Island, Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, Baltimore-Towson, Washington-Arlington-
Alexandria, Richmond, and Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News.
       However, with the exception of Baltimore-Towson, in general our procedure does not capture
the full extent of the MSAs. The correlation between the counties we identify as urban and the
counties that belong to MSAs with a population of at least one million is 0.51. Although a lower
parameter for the share of a county covered by night light would yield a higher correlation, this
would come at the price of including certain low-density and other intruder counties that are not
categorized as belonging to any MSA. Since our main aim is to identify high-density urban areas,
we avoid this by setting parameter values that exclude both low-density and intruder counties.
  22 Including smaller polygons results in identifying too many urban areas which do not exist in the U.S. Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) delineation of MSAs. It also results in splitting actual MSAs into several metropolitan
areas. For instance, considering polygons of night light with a surface greater or equal to 100 km splits the MSA of
Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News into two distinct urban regions. This is due to the agglomerations of Hampton
and Newport News (night light surface of 167 km2 ) being separated from the larger agglomeration of Virginia Beach,
Norfolk and Portsmouth (night light surface of 512 km2 ).
  23 We only include the core counties of MSAs.

B        Model
In this section we provide a simple three-location economic geography model to analyze the relation
between trade costs, market potential and population growth. We analytically show that the effect
of market potential on growth is non-monotonic in trade costs. Starting at a high level, falling trade
costs makes market potential more important, favoring growth in the location with better market
access. However, if trade costs continue to drop, eventually growth shifts to the peripheral locations,
with worse market access. We further illustrate the model's implications with a series of numerical
examples.

B.1       Setup and Equilibrium
Endowments.           The economy consists of three locations on a line, a central location, k , and two
peripheral locations,       1   and   2.   Locations are indexed by either i or j , where i, j  {k , 1 ,             2 }.   The
distance between location i and j is denoted by dij , where dij = dji . We refer to k as central and
to   1   and   2   as peripheral, because d     1k
                                                     <d   1 2
                                                                and d   2k
                                                                             <d   1 2
                                                                                        . Each location has one unit of land,
collectively owned by the local population. The economy has a labor endowment L which is freely
mobile across locations.


Technology and supply.            Each location produces a different good. Firms are perfectly competitive.
The production technology is Cobb-Douglas in land and labor. Given the normalization of land,
output in location i can be written as:

                                                             ¯ i L
                                                      Yi = ( A         
                                                                  i ) Li                                                    (5)

                                               ¯ i L
where Li is the labor input in location i, and A    i is TFP in location i. TFP depends on a location's
                        ¯ i , and on local density, L
exogenous productivity, A                            i , which captures agglomeration economies.
Congestion costs come from the use of land. Their strength depends on the importance of land,
1 - . We assume that agglomeration economies are weaker than congestion costs,  < 1 - .
     Profit maximization implies that agents in location i earn a wage

                                                             ¯ i L+-1

                                                                  i


where pi is the price of good i in location i. When one good of location i is shipped to location
j , (1 + dij )- units arrive. Hence, the price of good i in location j is pi (1 + dij ) . Each agent in
location i earns land income equal to

                                                               ¯ i L+-1

Preferences and demand. Consumers in location i have CES preferences over the three different
goods:

where cj is the consumption of good j . An agent in location i earning income yi has the following
demand for good j :
                                                    yi (pj (1 + dij ) )-

Equilibrium. Workers are freely mobile, so utility equalizes across locations. We are now ready
to define an equilibrium.

Recall that congestion costs from land are stronger than agglomeration economies from density,
1 -  > . This implies that any equilibrium is stable: if utility equalizes across locations, no
individual has an incentive to deviate and change location. To see this, recall that the utility of an
                               ¯ i L+-1 /Pi . Any individual deviation leaves pi and Pi unchanged,
agent in location i is ui = pi A    i
so ui is decreasing in the size of the local population Li . As such, any individual deviation from
an equilibrium where utility equalizes across locations results in a decrease in the utility of the
deviating agent. Hence, that agent prefers not to deviate, which proves that the equilibrium is
stable.


Concept of market potential. A location's attraction depends on the market it can access in its
own location and in other locations. This is the concept Harris (1954) refers to as market potential.
Intuitively, the market potential of location i depends (i) positively on the income of all other loca-
tions, yj Lj , and (ii) negatively on the difficulty of accessing all other locations, (1 + dij ) . Based on
this, we can define a location's market potential as the distance-adjusted sum of aggregate demand
in different locations:
                                      N M Pi =    yj Lj ((1 + dij ) )1-                                (17)
                                                 j

Head and Mayer (2004) call this concept nominal market potential to distinguish it from the related
concept of real market potential that adjusts for the variation in the price index across locations.
The rationale for the concept of real market potential is that if a firm faces greater competition in a
given market, as captured by a lower price index in that market, this limits the effective demand it
faces. To see this, re-write the total revenue of location i in (14) as:

                                      yj Lj (pi (1 + dij ) )1-

                                                                        i

This is also the concept of market potential used in Fujita et al. (1999) and Redding and Venables
(2004). For measurement reasons, in the empirical section we focus on N M Pi , but the difference
between both concepts is inconsequential for the insights we are interested in.


Market potential and trade costs. In a world with transportation costs, the central location has
an advantage in terms of market potential, because of the relatively shorter distance to the other
locations. The strength of that centrality advantage is non-monotonic in transport costs. If transport

costs are prohibitively high, being in the center, rather than on the periphery, yields no additional
benefit. Likewise, if transport costs are zero, then all locations have the same market potential, so
there is no benefit to being centrally located. However, when transport costs are at an intermediate
level, the central location enjoys better market potential, and as a result attracts a greater population.
      It is straightforward to formally show this non-monotonicity result in a symmetric setting. Sup-
pose the central location is equidistant from both peripheral locations, so that d                     1k
                                                                                                            =d   2k
                                                                                                                          =d   k    and
d                                                                             ¯i = A
          > d k . All locations have the same exogenous productivity, so that A    ¯ for all i. Consider
    1 2

the case where  goes to infinity, so trade is prohibitively expensive. It is easy to see that an alloca-
tion where each location has an equal share of the population and where the mill prices of all three
goods are the same satisfies all equilibrium conditions (8), (12), (14), (15) and (16). Now consider
the case where  goes to zero, so trade is free. Again, it is straightforward to see that a symmetric
allocation of population, with equal prices across locations, satisfies (8), (12), (14), (15) and (16).
      If  is strictly in between zero and infinity, the symmetric allocation is no longer an equilibrium.
To see this, start from symmetry, with labor equally distributed across locations and the mill prices
of all three goods the same. In that case, the price index of the central location, Pk , will be lower
than the price index of either one of the peripheral regions, P                     1
                                                                                        = P 2 . Because d        1k
                                                                                                                          = d   2k

will have an incentive to move from the peripheral locations to the central location. Hence, in
equilibrium the population of the central location will be larger than that of the peripheral locations.
      What does this imply in terms of the relation between market potential, transport costs and
population growth? The above discussion says that if transport costs drop, the population share of
the central location first increases and then decreases. We also know that the market potential of
the central location is weakly greater than that of the peripheral locations. To see this, notice that
in a symmetric allocation N M Pk > N M P               1
                                                           = N M P 2 , as long as  ]0, [. We already know that
in that case, free mobility will make people move to the central location, so that Lk > L                                  1
                                                                                                                               = L 2.
Because the elasticity of substitution is greater than one, this implies that yk Lk > y 1 L                           1
                                                                                                                          = y 2L 2,
so that a fortiori N M Pk > N M P           1
                                                = N M P 2 . As a result, the central location has greater market
potential. Hence, we can conclude that if transport costs drop, the population of the high market
potential location first increases and then decreases. In what follows we summarize this result.

what we refer to as the shrinking advantage of market potential.

B.2     Numerical Examples
In this section we use numerical examples to further illustrate the different insights we can gain from
the model. We start by discussing some of the parameter values. For the elasticity of substitution,
we set  equal to 3, a value within the range of those estimated by Simonovska and Waugh (2014).
For the labor (or non-land share) we choose a value for  of 0.7. This is slightly high if interpreted as
the labor share, but slightly low if interpreted as the non-land share. For agglomeration economies,
the parameter that measures the elasticity of TFP to population, , is set to 0.05, as estimated in
Behrens, Duranton and Robert-Nicoud (2014). The total population is set to 9, but this choice is
inconsequential, as the entire problem can easily be rewritten in terms of population shares, rather
than absolute levels.
   The objective of the numerical examples is to show how the population shares of the central and
the peripheral locations vary with trade costs. To that end, we will conduct comparative statics over
a range of values of the trade cost parameter  . Disdier and Head (2008) carry out a systematic
analysis of 1,467 estimates of  in 103 papers, and find a range from -0.04 to 2.33, with a mean of
0.91 and a median of 0.87. We will therefore run our model for a range of   [0.0, 2.0], keeping
in mind that on average the world is a bit below 1.0. For less developed countries the number is
bound to be larger than for more developed countries. For example, for the case of Brazil, Daumal
and Zignago (2010) estimate an elasticity of 1.9.


Symmetry. We start by illustrating the non-monotonic relation between the population share of
the high market potential central location and trade costs. To focus on the sole effect of centrality,
                                                                                   ¯ i = 1,
we choose a symmetric setup, where each location has the same exogenous TFP level, A
i  { 1 , 2 , k }, and where the distance between the central location and the two peripheral locations
is identical, d   1k
                       =d   2k
                                 = 1 and d   1 2
                                                   = 2.
   The results are shown in Figure A6. Consistent with Result 1, in panel a. we see that lowering
trade costs initially benefits the central high-market-potential location in terms of population share,
but eventually that benefit is eroded as trade costs drop to zero. As a result, panel b. shows
population growth being higher in the central location when transport costs are high, but then
shifting to the peripheral locations when transport costs drop enough. As can be seen in panel
c., this means that with high enough transport costs, population growth concentrates in the high
market potential region, whereas for low enough transport costs, population growth shifts to the
low market potential regions. The reason for this shift can be seen in panel d. Starting off at
high transport costs, a lowering of these costs increases the market potential of the central region

more than that of the peripheral regions. However, if transport costs keep falling, eventually the
peripheral regions catch up in terms of market potential. Hence, with low enough transport costs,
the market potential of the peripheral regions grows faster than that of the central region.


Low-productivity central location.    In an alternative exercise, we give the peripheral locations a
                                                                               ¯
higher exogenous level of TFP than the central location. In particular, we set A        ¯ = 1.075 >
                                                                                       =A
                                                                                   1      2

¯ k = 1. Figure A6 shows the results. The dynamics do not change qualitatively: as transport costs
A
drop, initially the central location gains in population share, but eventually population growth
shifts to the peripheral locations. The only difference is that the central location no longer always
coincides with the high market potential location. With high enough transport costs, the greater
market access of the central region no longer compensates for its lower TFP, so that its market
potential is lower.

Asymmetry in productivity of peripheral locations. We now introduce an asymmetry between
                                                                                         ¯

        = 1.025 and A
    2

central region first gains in population, but later growth shifts to the periphery. When it does so, the
less populous and less productive peripheral location experiences faster population growth than the
more populous and more productive peripheral location. As can be seen in panel d., this happens
because the drop in transport costs benefits the least productive peripheral region relatively more.
This is what we would expect: relative to the less productive peripheral region, the more productive
peripheral region gets more of its market potential from its own demand, and hence relies less on
the other two locations.


Asymmetry in distance and productivity.          In this last simulation, we simultaneously introduce
asymmetries in the exogenous productivity levels and in the distances to the peripheral regions.

d         = 3. Now, as transport costs drop, population growth shifts from the central region to the
    1 2

high-productivity peripheral region, rather than to the low-productivity peripheral region (Figure
A6). With low enough transportation costs, growth is concentrated in the high-density, low-market-
potential location. The difference with the previous exercise is that the high-productivity peripheral
location is further removed from the center, so a drop in trade costs benefits it more than the other,
lower-productivity, peripheral location.


Summary of results.        The different numerical examples show that growth tends to concentrate
in the locations where market potential improves relatively more. This insight is useful to further
explain two important findings. First, when a drop in trade costs yields faster growth in the low-
market-potential peripheral locations than in the high-market-potential central location, this is not
because market potential does no longer contribute to a location's attractiveness. Instead, it is

because the drop in transport costs improves the market potential of the peripheral regions more
than it improves the market potential of the central region. As such, it shifts growth from the center
to the periphery. Second, when growth moves away from the center, it benefits the less dense of the
two peripheral locations if both are at equal distance from the center, but it benefits the more dense
peripheral region if it is further away from the center. Once again, this difference depends on which
of the two peripheral regions gains relatively more market potential when trade costs drop.
