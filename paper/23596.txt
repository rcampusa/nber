Executive Compensation: A Survey of Theory and Evidence

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on executive compensation. We start
by presenting data on the level of CEO and other top executive pay over time and across firms,
the changing composition of pay; and the strength of executive incentives. We compare pay in
U.S. public firms to private and non-U.S. firms. We then critically analyze three non-exclusive
explanations for what drives executive pay -- shareholder value maximization by boards, rent
extraction by executives, and institutional factors such as regulation, taxation, and accounting
policy. We confront each hypothesis with the evidence. While shareholder value maximization is
consistent with many practices that initially seem inefficient, no single explanation can account
for all facts and historical trends; we highlight major gaps for future research. We discuss
evidence on the effects of executive pay, highlighting recent identification strategies, and suggest
policy implications grounded in theoretical and empirical research. Our survey has two main
goals. First, we aim to tightly link the theoretical literature to the empirical evidence, and
combine the insights contributed by all three views on the drivers of pay. Second, we aim to
provide a user-friendly guide to executive compensation, presenting shareholder value theories
using a simple unifying model, and discussing the challenges and methodological issues with
empirical research.

1.     Introduction
Executive compensation is a rich, complex, and controversial topic. In addition to there being
an intense debate among academics on its drivers, the e¢ciency of current practices, and the
case for reform, few topics have sparked as much interest among the general public. Politicians,
regulators, investors, and executives themselves have all taken strong positions on whether and
how to reform pay.
    This paper sheds light on this debate by surveying the theoretical and empirical literature
on executive compensation. We start in Section 2 by presenting the stylized facts, starting
with U.S. data on public rms going back to 1936. We show that, while the level of pay has
generally increased over time, this trend has been neither constant nor uniform, contrary to
popular belief. We next decompose total pay into its components, illustrating in particular
the rise and fall of option compensation, and discuss the increasing use or disclosure of other
forms of pay, such as performance-based equity, (multi-year) bonus plans, pensions, perquisites
(perks), and severance pay. We then present evidence on the level and composition of pay in
non-U.S. countries, and survey recent ndings on pay in U.S. private rms.
    There is considerable debate among both academics and practitioners on what causes the
observed trends in pay. There are three broad perspectives. One is the shareholder value
view, which argues that compensation contracts are chosen to maximize value for shareholders,
taking into account the competitive market for executives and the need to provide adequate
incentives. Section 3 presents a simple unifying model of the level and sensitivity of pay, in both
a static and dynamic setting, under shareholder value maximization. We discuss its empirical
implications and the extent to which a shareholder value view can explain the stylized facts. We
also address the optimality of relative performance evaluation and debt-based pay, and whether
incentives should be provided using stock or options. Section 4 discusses the rent extraction
view, which argues that contracts are set by executives themselves to maximize their own rents.
Since the theoretical development of this view is more limited, we focus on presenting empirical
 ndings suggestive of rent extraction, such as pay for non-performance, hidden pay, and the
association of certain practices with poor corporate governance. A third perspective, which we
discuss in Section 5, is that pay is shaped by institutional forces, such as regulation, tax, and
accounting policies.
    While Sections 3-5 explore the determinants of executive pay, Section 6 summarizes evidence
on its e¤ects. Such evidence is relatively scarce, since compensation contracts are endogenous
and causal identi cation is di¢cult, but we discuss some promising approaches. Section 7
tackles policy interventions that have been proposed, and in some cases enacted, and critically
evaluates them using both theory and evidence. Section 8 suggests directions for future research,
and Section 9 concludes. We also include an Appendix that provides an overview of institutional
detail, such as legislation, disclosure requirements, accounting treatments, and tax treatments,
focusing on the U.S. but also discussing the U.K. and Europe. We hope this overview will be


                                                5
particularly useful to those new to the literature.

   In addition to the speci c conclusions of each chapter, we make the following broader points.

    Observed compensation arrangements result from a combination of potentially conicting
     forces  shareholders desire to maximize rm value, executives desire to maximize their
     rents, and the inuence of legislation, taxation, accounting policies, and social pressures.
     No one perspective can explain all of the evidence, and a narrow attachment to one
     perspective will distort rather than inform our view of executive pay.

    Recent theoretical contributions make clear that shareholder value models can be consis-
     tent with a wide range of observed compensation patterns and practices, including the
     large increase in executive pay since the 1970s. The challenge is now to confront these
     new models more rigorously with the data, explore their limitations, and contrast them
     with (mostly yet-to-be-written) rent extraction models.

    Theories of executive pay must take into account the speci c features of executives jobs;
     models of the general principal-agent problem are not automatically applicable to execu-
     tives. For example, the skills of executives may be particularly scarce, and CEOs have a
     much larger impact on rm value than rank-and- le employees, which can fundamentally
     change the nature of the optimal contract.

    Theorists should consider very carefully their modeling choices. Seemingly innocuous
     features of the modeling setup, often made for tractability or convenience (such as the
     choice between additive or multiplicative utility and production functions, or between
     binary and continuous actions) can lead to large di¤erences in the models implications 
     and thus conclusions as to whether observed practices are consistent with theory.

    Compensation contracts have evolved over time. For example, the U.S. has seen a shift
     in the largest component of CEO pay from cash in the 1970s to options in the 1980s and
     1990s and to performance-based stock in the 2000s. The reasons for this evolution are
     not fully understood. Likely drivers include boards learning over time how to improve
     pay practices as well as regulatory and institutional changes.

    Attempts to improve CEO pay should focus on the incentives created, and especially
     on the sensitivity of CEO wealth to long-term performance. The level of pay receives
     the most criticism, but usually amounts to only a small fraction of rm value. Badly
     structured incentives, on the other hand, can easily cause value losses that are orders of
     magnitudes larger.

    Any high-powered incentive contract creates incentives to manipulate the performance
     measure(s) it relies upon. However, nding that a pay practice, such as equity-linked pay,


                                                6
       is associated with manipulation does not imply that incentive contracts are worse than
       no incentive contract.

      Most of what we know about executive pay concerns CEOs of U.S. public rms. We need
       more research on top executives other than CEOs, countries outside the U.S., and private
        rms.

      Identifying the causal e¤ect of compensation contracts on any interesting outcome vari-
       able is extraordinarily di¢cult. These contracts are endogenous  executives, directors,
       and compensation consultants spend time and e¤ort designing them, taking into account
       unobservable rm, industry, and executive characteristics. As a result, compensation
       contracts are inevitably correlated with these unobservable characteristics, which in turn
       a¤ect rm behavior, performance, and value.

      There are almost no instrumental variables or natural experiments that create as-good-
       as-random variation in compensation contracts. The few exceptions have signi cantly
       advanced our understanding of the causal e¤ects of executive pay, and we strongly welcome
       any additions to this short list. On the other hand, insistence on clean identi cation
       frequently results in the use of bogus instruments that almost certainly violate the
       exclusion restriction, a focus on narrow questions, or the avoidance of research on executive
       pay altogether. Much can be learned from papers that do not attempt to identify causal
       e¤ects, and instead carefully study how rms endogenously choose compensation contracts
       in di¤erent settings.

    This chapter builds on and signi cantly expands three earlier surveys on executive pay
(co-)written by the authors: Frydman and Jenter (2010), which focuses on empirics, and Ed-
mans and Gabaix (2009, 2016), which focus on theories. Other notable surveys include Core,
Guay, and Larcker (2003), which focuses on empirics, and Murphy (2013), which is particularly
valuable for a historical and institutional perspective.


2.      The Stylized Facts
This section presents the important facts about CEO pay, covering both the past and the
present. We focus on the level and composition of CEO pay and the relation between CEO pay
and rm performance. Much of the data is from the U.S., where more and better data have
traditionally been available, but international evidence is included wherever available. The
presentation in this section draws heavily on Frydman and Jenter (2010).




                                                  7
2.1.     The Level of Pay
The increase in CEO pay since the 1970s, and particularly its rapid acceleration in the 1990s,
is well documented.1 By 2014, the median CEO in the S&P 500 earned $10.1 million per year,
which is substantially higher than in other countries and represents a sixfold increase since 1980.
Pay of the average worker has risen much more slowly. Across the S&P 500, the average ratio of
CEO pay to average worker pay was 335 times in 2015 (according to the AFL-CIO), compared
to 40 times in 1980 (according to the Economic Policy Institute). Piketty and Saez (2003) and
Piketty (2014) argue that the rapid increase in executive pay has contributed signi cantly to
the recent rise in income inequality, and thus has political economy implications.
    It would be a mistake, however, to view the history of executive compensation as one of
ever increasing pay. In fact, executive pay levels in the U.S. fell during World War II and
did not change much from the 1940s to the mid-1970s, when they started their meteoric rise.
For the largest rms, this rise came to a halt in the 2000s, with average pay levels falling and
median pay levels roughly constant from 2001 to 2014. For medium-sized and small public
  rms, executive pay levels continued rising after 2001, and the ratio of CEO pay to the pay of
other top executives kept increasing.
    The evolution of pay from 1936 to 2005 for the three highest-paid executives in the 50
largest U.S. rms, taken from Frydman and Saks (2010), is shown in Figure 1.2 Total annual
pay, expressed in 2014 dollars, is measured as the sum of the executives salary, realized payouts
from bonuses and long-term incentive plans (LTIPs), plus the grant-date value of new stock
and option awards, the latter calculated using Black-Scholes.3 Total pay follows a J-shaped
pattern over the 19362005 period. Following a sharp decline during World War II and a
further slow decline in the late 1940s, it increased slowly (by 0.8% per year on average) from
the early 1950s to the mid-1970s. Rapid pay growth only started in the mid-1970s and continued
almost until the sample ends in 2005. The increases were most dramatic in the 1990s, with
annual growth rates in excess of 10% by the end of the decade. Figure 1 also shows that CEO
pay grew more rapidly than the pay of the other highest-paid executives since the late-1970s,
but not before. The median ratio of CEO pay to that of other top executives was stable at
approximately 1.4 before 1980 but rose to almost 2.6 by 2000-05.
    The surge in pay during the 1990s was not restricted to only the largest rms. Table 1 and
Figure 2 show the evolution of pay levels from 1992 to 2014 for CEOs and other top executives
   1
      See, for example, Jensen and Murphy (1990a), Hall and Liebman (1998), Murphy (1999), Bebchuk and
Grinstein (2005), Frydman and Jenter (2010), and Murphy (2013).
    2
      The Frydman and Saks (2010) sample contains the largest 50 rms in 1940, 1960 and 1990 (for a total
of 101 rms). Firms are selected based on total sales in 1960 and 1990 and based on market value in 1940.
Compensation data is hand-collected for all available years from 1936 to 1992; the S&P ExecuComp database
is used to extend the data to 2005.
    3
      Black-Scholes values are likely to overstate both the cost of option compensation to the rm and its value
to the executive (Lambert, Larcker, and Verrecchia, 1991; Carpenter, 1998; Meulbroek, 2001; Hall and Murphy,
2002; Ingersoll, 2006; Carpenter, Stanton, and Wallace, 2010, 2017). Section 2.1.2 examines the value of equity
compensation to the executive.


                                                      8
in large-cap rms (members of the S&P 500 index), in mid-cap rms (S&P MidCap 400), and
in small-cap rms (S&P SmallCap 600). Total pay has risen for rms of all sizes, even though
the increases were steeper in larger rms. For CEOs of S&P 500 rms, the median level of pay
climbed rapidly from $3.1 million in 1992 to a peak of $10.0 million in 2001, a 223% increase.
After 2001, median CEO pay stabilized between $8 and $10 million for more than ten years. It
passed its 2001 peak only in 2014, reaching $10.1 million.
     In mid-cap rms, median CEO pay rose more slowly during the 1990s, from $1.9 million in
1994 to $3.5 million in 2001, for a 90% increase. In small-cap rms, median pay increased by
only 45%, from $1.3 million in 1994 to $1.9 million in 2001. Even though mid-cap and small-cap
CEOs saw smaller raises during the 1990s, their pay continued to climb after 2001, when the
pay of large-cap CEOs stagnated. Median pay for mid-cap (small-cap) CEOs rose from $3.5
($1.9) million in 2001 to $5.4 ($2.8) million in 2014.
     Beyond the overall rise in pay, Table 1 reveals four important facts. First, the increase in
mean CEO pay during the 1990s was larger than the increase in median pay. This was due to a
relatively small number of extremely highly-paid CEOs in the late 1990s. After 2001, this trend
reversed, and a decline in outliers decreased the skewness of CEO pay for rms of all sizes. For
the S&P 500, the di¤erence between mean and median CEO pay declined from 67% in 2001 to
only 19% in 2014. As a result, whether a researcher chooses to represent average CEO pay
by the mean or the median has important implications (Frydman and Jenter, 2010). Both are
appropriate under di¤erent circumstances. Mean pay is relevant in assessing aggregate levels
in pay across all CEOs, while median pay is relevant in assessing the pay for a typical CEO
(Murphy, 2013). Moreover, the skewness of pay levels means that it is important to control for
outliers in cross-sectional analyses.
     Second, contrary to popular belief, pay has not constantly risen over time, and there are
long periods  even decades  in which pay has been constant or declining. As a result, similar
to the choice of means versus medians, the choice of a starting point to measure time trends
in pay is far from innocuous. This also means that any explanation for changes in the level of
pay will have to explain not only why pay rose in some periods, but also why pay was at in
other periods, and suggests that any single hypothesis is unlikely to be able to explain trends
in pay since World War II.
     Third, there are interesting di¤erences in the evolution of pay levels between large-cap, mid-
cap, and small-cap rms. Executive pay increased across the board during the 1990s, but much
more so in larger rms. Shown in Figure 3, the premium for running a larger rm increased
during the 1990s and fell afterwards. In 1994, the pay of the median S&P 500 CEO was 109%
larger than that of the median mid-cap CEO. In 2001, this di¤erence had risen to 186%, before
falling to only 86% by 2014. Comparing mid-cap to small-cap CEOs, the premium for running
a mid-cap rm was 45% in 1994, rose to a rst peak of 109% in 2002, a second peak of 116%
in 2008, and then declined to 96% by 2014.
     Finally, CEO pay has grown faster than the pay of other top executives. This increase in


                                                9
the CEO pay premium, shown in Figure 4, is fairly uniform across rms of di¤erent sizes. For
S&P 500 rms, the median of the within- rm ratio of CEO pay to the average pay of other
top-3 executives rose from 1.8 in 1992 to 2.4 in 2014. For mid-cap (small-cap) rms, the median
of the same ratio increased from 1.7 (1.7) in 1994 to 2.3 (2.1) in 2014.
    To summarize, the post-World War II era can be divided into three distinct periods. Prior
to the 1970s, we observe low levels of pay and little dispersion across top managers. From the
mid-1970s to the late 1990s, pay grew dramatically, and di¤erences in pay across executives
and rms widened. Finally, from 2001 to 2014, median CEO pay was essentially at for S&P
500 CEOs, while it continued to rise for mid-cap and small-cap CEOs. The skewness of CEO
pay declined, but the pay premium for CEOs over other top-3 executives continued to rise even
after 2001.

2.1.1.    Cross-Sectional Variation in Pay

This section explores how the level of CEO pay correlates with rm and CEO characteristics.4
Table 2 regresses annual CEO pay from 1992 to 2014 on rm value, volatility, stock return
performance, CEO age, CEO tenure, and a female CEO indicator. The sample is the S&P 1,500,
which combines the S&P 500, MidCap 400, and SmallCap 600. CEO pay is strongly positively
correlated with total rm value, with a CEO pay- rm size elasticity of about 0.45. This
elasticity is robust to the inclusion of industry, year, and industry-year xed e¤ects. A positive
relationship between rm size and CEO pay has been documented by, among others, Roberts
(1956), Murphy (1985), Baker, Jensen, and Murphy (1988), Barro and Barro (1990), Murphy
(1999), Gabaix and Landier (2008), Frydman and Saks (2010), and Gabaix, Landier, and
Sauvagnat (2014). Section 3.1 relates the observed CEO pay-size elasticity to the predictions
of CEO- rm assignment models, and Section 3.3 to the predictions of assignment models with
moral hazard.
    CEO pay is also positively related to stock return volatility, and this correlation is again
robust to the inclusion of industry, year, and industry-year xed e¤ects.5 A one standard
deviation increase in the volatility of monthly stock returns is associated with an 8 to 15%
increase in annual CEO pay. A positive relationship between risk and CEO pay is consistent
with evidence in Garen (1994) for salaries and in Chen, Hong, and Scheinkman (2015) for total
pay in nancial institutions. Section 3.2 surveys models of optimal CEO compensation that
relate pay to volatility.
    Columns 4 and 5 introduce CEO age, tenure, and a female CEO indicator into the pay
regressions. In the pooled cross-section and time series (column 4), CEO pay is correlated
negatively with age and insigni cantly positively with tenure. When CEO xed e¤ects are
   4
     Graham, Li, and Qiu (2012) show that, after controlling for characteristics, there are large managerial xed
e¤ects in CEO pay, which suggests a large role for unobserved CEO characteristics.
   5
     The positive correlation between volatility and pay becomes small and insigni cant with CEO xed e¤ects
(column 5). Changes in volatility within a CEOs tenure are highly correlated with changes in performance,
which makes interpreting the correlation between volatility and pay di¢cult.

                                                      10
introduced (column 5), the correlation of pay with age becomes positive but insigni cant,
while the positive correlation with tenure becomes signi cant. Section 3.7 reviews dynamic
contracting models that link optimal CEO pay to tenure, while Section 4 explores the idea that
entrenchment and rent extraction might increase with tenure.
    There is no signi cant di¤erence in the annual pay of male and female CEOs after we control
for rm size, CEO age, and tenure. In fact, the point estimate suggests a small wage premium
for female CEOs. This is consistent with the earlier results of Bertand and Hallock (2001), who
also note that women tend to run smaller rms. Female CEOs remain extraordinarily rare,
making up only 2.5% of our sample.
    The last column of Table 2 introduces stock returns into the regression. CEO pay is strongly
positively correlated with both contemporaneous and lagged returns, consistent with a literature
going back to Murphy (1985) and Coughlan and Schmidt (1985) that documents a signi cant
pay-for-performance relationship. The e¤ect of past performance on current pay remains highly
signi cant even after four years, consistent with Boschen and Smith (1995). Section 3.7 surveys
dynamic contracting models that predict these long-term e¤ects of performance on CEO pay.
    Even though the coe¢cients in column 6 suggest a strong pay-performance relationship,
they underestimate CEOs incentives. Most CEOs have large equity holdings in their employer,
which directly tie their wealth to stock price performance. For the typical CEO, the wealth
changes caused by stock price movements are much larger than the corresponding changes in
annual pay. In Section 2.3, we therefore measure CEOs overall wealth-performance relationship.
    We emphasize that the relationships in Table 2 are correlations and not causal e¤ects.
Important explanatory variables for CEO pay, such as rm size or risk, are themselves a¤ected
by CEOs incentives and actions, and are also correlated with unobservable rm, industry, and
executive characteristics that a¤ect pay. Consequently, their correlations with pay are di¢cult
to interpret. For example, CEO pay might be positively correlated with risk because higher
risk causally requires rms to pay more, or because higher pay causes CEOs to take more risk,
or because risk is correlated with other determinants of pay such as investment opportunities,
product market competition, or CEO risk aversion.

2.1.2.   The Value of Pay to the Executive

The pay levels analyzed in the previous sections measure the cost of compensation to sharehold-
ers. The (pre-tax) value of the same pay to a risk-averse executive is potentially much lower.
Executives receive performance-linked pay and have often large holdings of company stock and
options that are highly correlated with their rm-speci c human capital (Lambert, Larcker and
Verrecchia, 1991; Meulbroek, 2001; Hall and Murphy, 2002). Thus, rational executives should
value equity grants well below their fair market values, which are determined by diversi ed
investors in nancial markets.
    Calibration exercises suggest that the appropriate valuation discounts can be large. Hall
and Murphy (2002), using reasonable assumptions for executive risk aversion and exposures to

                                              11
company stock price, nd discounts of 40 to 60% for typical at-the-money options with a 10-
year life. Given these sizable discounts, to be consistent with shareholder value maximization,
equity grants need to be justi ed by their incentive or retention e¤ects.
    The valuation discounts di¤er across compensation instruments. Discounts are larger the
more exposed to the stock price, and hence the riskier, a compensation instrument is. Thus,
for example, they are higher for options than stock, because options are a levered claim with
higher volatility. As a result, a shift in the composition of pay can change the value perceived
by executives, even if the fair market value stays unchanged. In Section 2.2, we show that
the increase in executive pay during the 1990s was mostly an increase in option compensation.
If executives assign low valuations to options, their utilities may have increased much less
during the 1990s than suggested by the increase in pay levels. Similarly, the relative stability
in pay levels between 2001 and 2014 was accompanied by a shift from option compensation to
performance-based stock. If executives assign lower discounts to the latter, the perceived value
of pay might have increased over this period, even though the fair market value of pay did not.
    There are at least two other reasons why the value of equity awards to the executive may be
below their market value, although these reasons also lower their cost to the rm. First, risk-
averse executives, seeking diversi cation and liquidity, exercise options earlier than prescribed
by the value-maximizing exercise strategy (Carpenter, 1998; Bettis, Bizjak, and Lemmon, 2005;
Carpenter, Stanton, and Wallace, 2010, 2017). Second, sunset provisions lead to the executive
forfeiting equity on retirement, resignation, or death. Dahiya and Yermack (2008) estimate
that, for CEOs aged over 65 who expect to retire in a year, such provisions reduce the value of
new option awards by more than half, and the value of total pay by 25%.


2.2.     The Structure of Pay
Despite substantial heterogeneity in pay practices across rms, most executive pay packages
contain ve basic components: salary, annual bonus, payouts from LTIPs, restricted option
grants, and restricted stock grants. In addition, top executives often receive perks, de ned-
bene t pension plans, and severance payments upon departure. The relative importance of
these compensation elements has changed considerably over time.

2.2.1.   The Main Components of Executive Pay

Figure 5 illustrates the importance of the major pay components for CEOs of the 50 largest
U.S. rms from 1936 to 2005, using again the Frydman and Saks (2010) data. From 1936 to the
1950s, pay comprised mainly salaries and annual bonuses. Like today, bonuses were typically
non-discretionary, tied to one or more measures of annual accounting performance, and paid
in either cash or stock. LTIPs started to become signi cant from the 1960s. These are bonus
plans based on multi-year performance, often paid out over several years, in cash or stock.
    The most striking pattern in Figure 5 is the large increase in stock option compensation

                                               12
starting in the early 1980s. The use of options was negligible until 1950, when a tax reform
permitted certain option payo¤s to be taxed at the much lower capital gains rate rather than
at the income tax rate. Although many rms responded by instituting option plans, option
grants remained a small proportion of total pay until the late 1970s.
    During the 1980s and especially the 1990s, options surged to become the largest component
of executive pay. Panel A of Figure 6 illustrates this development for large-cap CEOs from
1992 to 2014. Options increased from only 19% of pay in 1992 to 49% by 2000. Thus, a large
portion of the overall rise in CEO pay is growth in options, and any theory that explains the
surge in CEO pay needs to account for this important change in the structure of pay as well.
The growth in options did not occur at the expense of other components of pay; median salaries
are constant at $1.2 million, and short- and long-term bonuses rose from $0.9 to $1.4 million
over the same period (all in 2014 dollars).
    A second important shift in the structure of pay occurred after the end of the 1990s technol-
ogy boom and the stock market decline of 2000-01. Options rapidly declined, both in relative
and absolute terms, and by 2006 restricted stock grants had become more popular. Between
2000 and 2014, options declined from 49% to 16% of pay, while restricted stock increased from
7% to 44%. The rise of restricted stock was accompanied by a further important change: the
replacement of conventional time-vesting stock by grants for which the number of shares vested
depends on one or more performance measures. We discuss the rise and characteristics of
so-called performance-based equity in Section 2.3.3.
    The composition of pay evolved in the same manner for other top-3 executives. Panel B
of Figure 6 shows that non-CEO top executives in S&P 500 rms receive a slightly smaller
portion of their pay in stock and options than CEOs (55% vs. 60% in 2014), and a slightly
larger portion in salary (17% vs. 13% in 2014). The changes in pay structures over time were
almost identical for the two groups of executives: a surge in options until 2000, followed by
their gradual replacement with restricted stock.
    Figures 7 and 8 show the major pay components for executives of S&P MidCap and S&P
SmallCap rms. Executives in smaller rms receive less of their pay in stock and options and
more in salary. In 2014, small-cap CEOs received on average 43% of their pay as stock and
options, compared to 54% for mid-cap and 60% for S&P 500 CEOs. The salary proportion was
29%, 19%, and 13%, respectively. The evolution of pay structures, and speci cally the increase
in options until 2000 and their subsequent replacement by restricted stock, is remarkably similar
across rms of di¤erent sizes.
    Explaining these drastic changes in the structure of pay since the 1980s, especially the surge
in option compensation and its replacement by (performance-based) restricted stock, remains
a challenge. Section 3.5 surveys the predictions of shareholder value models for the use of stock
and options in incentive contracts. Section 4.3 explores whether self-serving executives might
choose compensation instruments that shareholders nd di¢cult to observe or value. Sections
5.1 and 5.2 examine tax policies and accounting rules as potential drivers of the composition


                                               13
of pay.
    To summarize, the composition of executive pay has changed dramatically over time. In
parallel with changes in the level of pay, the post-World War II era can be divided into three
distinct periods. Prior to the 1970s, pay was dominated by salaries and annual bonuses, with
only moderate levels of equity. From the mid-1970s to the end of the 1990s, options surged and
became the largest component of CEO pay. Between 2001 and 2014, performance-based stock
replaced options as the most popular form of equity compensation.

2.2.2.   Other Forms of Pay

Three important components of executive compensation that have received less attention in
the literature are perks, pensions, and severance pay. Obtaining comprehensive information on
these forms of pay was extremely di¢cult until the SEC increased its disclosure requirements
in 2006.
    Perks encompass a wide variety of goods and services provided to the executive, including
corporate jets, club memberships, and personal security. Section 4.3 reviews the limited evi-
dence on their use and discusses the extent to which perks can be interpreted as rent extraction.
The historical evidence on de ned bene t pensions is similarly sparse. Prior to December 2006,
SEC disclosure rules did not require rms to report the actuarial values of executive pensions.
In their absence, Bebchuk and Jackson (2005) estimate pension claims in a small sample of
S&P 500 CEOs. Conditional on having a pension plan, the median actuarial value at retire-
ment corresponds to roughly 35% of the CEOs total pay throughout his tenure. Using a larger
sample of Fortune 500 CEOs from 1996-2002, Sundaram and Yermack (2007) estimate annual
increases in pension values to be approximately 10% of total CEO pay.
    Since 2006, U.S. public rms are required to disclose both the present value of executives
accumulated pension bene t and its year-to-year change. Cadman and Vincent (2015) report
that the use of de ned bene t pension plans has declined since this tightening of disclosure
requirements, from 48% of S&P 1,500 CEOs in 2006 to only 36% in 2012. The mean (median)
year-on-year change in pension plan value within this time period is 15% (11%) of annual CEO
pay. The mean (median) overall pension value over this period is 23% (15%) of the CEOs
total wealth held in the rm. This suggests that ignoring pensions can result in a signi cant
underestimation of total CEO pay.
    A lack of readily available data has also hampered the study of severance pay. Researchers
have to hand-collect information from employment contracts, separation agreements, and other
corporate lings. There are two types of severance pay: golden handshakes, which are awarded
to retiring or red CEOs, and golden parachutes, which are awarded to CEOs who lose their
job because their rm is acquired. Rusticus (2006) shows that ex-ante separation agreements,
signed when CEOs are hired, are common and, on average, promise golden handshakes equal
two times the CEOs cash compensation. Yermack (2006b) reports that ex-post payments of
golden handshakes are also common, but usually moderate in value (see Section 4.2). Goldman

                                               14
and Huang (2015) show that 40% of S&P 500 CEOs receive ex-post separation pay in excess
of that speci ed in their ex-ante severance contract. Finally, golden parachutes, which became
widespread during the 1980s and 90s, are usually part of CEOs ex-ante compensation contracts,
but are also frequently increased ex-post at the time a merger is approved (Hartzell, Ofek, and
Yermack, 2004). Section 3.7.2 surveys shareholder value models in which severance pay can
be e¢cient, while Sections 4.2 and 4.3 explore whether severance pay may be a form of rent
extraction.


2.3.     The Sensitivity of Executive Wealth to Performance
Principal-agent problems between shareholders and executives have been a concern since the
separation of corporate ownership from control at the turn of the twentieth century (Berle and
Means, 1932). If managers are self-interested and shareholders cannot perfectly monitor them
(or do not know the best course of action), executives are likely to pursue their own well-being
at the expense of shareholder value.
    Executive contracts can be used to alleviate agency problems by aligning managers interests
with those of shareholders (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). In principle, pay should be based on
any signal that is incrementally informative about whether the executive has taken actions that
maximize shareholder value (Holmström, 1979). In reality, many incentive contracts use equity
instruments to directly link executives payo¤s to shareholder value, the principals ultimate
objective. The evidence surveyed in this section shows that the sensitivity of CEO wealth to
stock price performance surged in the 1990s, mostly owing to rapidly growing option holdings,
and has remained high. At the same time, most CEOs equity ownership remains low as a
percentage of the rms total equity, which suggests that at least certain types of moral hazard
problems remain a serious concern.

2.3.1.    Quantifying Managerial Incentives

 Measuring the incentives created by executive pay to increase value has been a central goal
of the compensation literature since at least the 1950s.6 Early studies focused on identifying
the measure of rm size or performance (e.g., sales, pro ts, or market capitalization) that best
explains di¤erences in pay levels across rms (Roberts, 1956; Lewellen and Huntsman, 1970).
The next generation of studies tried to quantify managerial incentives by relating changes
in executive pay to stock price performance (Murphy, 1985; Coughlan and Schmidt, 1985).
Although these studies found the predicted positive relationship between pay and stock returns,
they systematically underestimated the level of incentives by focusing on current pay (Benston,
1985; Murphy, 1985). Most executives have considerable stock and option holdings in their
employer, which directly tie their wealth to their employers stock price performance. For the
   6
    We focus here on incentives to increase shareholder value and consider risk-taking incentives in Sections 3.5
and 6.2.2.


                                                       15
typical executive, the direct wealth changes caused by stock price movements are several times
larger than the corresponding changes in their annual pay.
    A comprehensive measure of incentives must take all links between rm performance and
executive wealth into account. Current performance a¤ects not only current pay, but also future
pay by decreasing the probability of dismissal or improving the executives outside options
and bargaining power. The largest e¤ect of current performance, however, is on the value
of the executives stock and option holdings. Any empirical measure of executive incentives
must take into account the incentives provided by changes in the value of the executives
equity holdings  i.e., measure wealth-performance sensitivities, rather than pay-performance
sensitivities. Focusing only on changes in salary, bonuses, and new equity grants misses the
majority of incentives, at least in countries such as the U.S. and U.K., where equity holdings
are substantial.
    Jensen and Murphy (1990a) are the rst to integrate many of these e¤ects in a study of large
publicly traded U.S. rms from 1974 to 1986. They measure CEO incentives by the change
in CEO wealth for a $1,000 increase in rm value, which they calculate to be only $3.25 
corresponding to an e¤ective percentage ownership of only 0.325%. Hence, Jensen and Murphy
(1990b) conclude that U.S. CEOs are paid like bureaucrats.
    Table 3 con rms the Jensen and Murphy (1990a) result using Frydman and Sakss (2010)
1936-2005 data for the top three executives in the 50 largest U.S. rms. We follow the literature
and use two approximations to calculate an executives e¤ective percentage ownership. First, we
consider only changes in wealth due to revaluations of stock and option holdings. This channel
has swamped the incentives provided by annual changes in pay for most of the twentieth century
(Hall and Liebman, 1998; Frydman and Saks, 2010). This channel can also be estimated on
an ex ante basis  by calculating the delta of the executives shares and options, we obtain his
sensitivity to future changes in the stock price.7 In contrast, the incentives provided by changes
in future ow pay can only be estimated ex post, which requires many years of data. Second,
we follow Core and Guay (2002) and use an approximation to measure the sensitivity of the
executives option portfolio to the stock price. Appendix B in Edmans, Gabaix, and Landier
(2009) describes our implementation of the Core and Guay algorithm. After 2006, disclosure is
improved and no approximation is needed.
    Column 1 of Table 3 shows that executives e¤ective percentage ownership declined sharply
in the 1940s, recovered in the next two decades, and shrank again in the 1970s. While it
increased rapidly since the 1980s, it has yet to reach its pre-World War II value. Its level is
small throughout, with the typical top-3 executive never holding more than 0.14% of his rms
equity. Figure 9 zooms in on CEO incentives in S&P 500 rms from 1992 to 2014. Consistent
with the long-run sample, the median e¤ective percentage ownership doubled from 0.37% in
   7
     Delta is the dollar change in value for a $1 increase in stock price. Jenter (2002) shows that, with risk-averse
executives, measuring option incentives using deltas is problematic. Options pay o¤ in states of the world in
which marginal utility is low, which causes the incentives created by a given delta to be smaller for options than
for stock.


                                                         16
1992 to 0.74% in 2002, before falling back to only 0.34% in 2014. Thus, if the median CEO
extracts $1 million of perks, the value of his equity falls by only $3,400.
    In contrast to Jensen and Murphy (1990a), Hall and Liebman (1998) dispute the view that
CEO incentives are insu¢cient on two grounds. First, the increase in option compensation in
the 1980s and 90s has strengthened the link between CEO wealth and performance. Second,
the changes in CEO wealth caused by typical changes in rm values are in fact large. Even
though CEOs percentage stakes are small, the dollar values of those stakes are not. As a result,
the typical CEO stands to gain millions from improving rm performance. This leads Hall and
Liebman to propose the dollar change in wealth for a percentage  not dollar  change in rm
value as measure of incentives. In practice, this measure is simply the executives e¤ective
dollar ownership, or his equity-at-stake.8
    Using again the Frydman and Saks (2010) data, Column 2 of Table 3 reports the e¤ective
dollar ownership for the typical top three executive in the 50 largest U.S. rms from 1936 to
2005. Although dollar ownership follows a similar pattern of ups and downs as the ownership
percentage, it paints a very di¤erent picture of the strength of incentives toward the end of
the sample. Based on dollar ownership, incentives have been higher than their 1930s level in
every decade since the 1960s, reaching a peak in 2000-05 at 12 times their level in 1936-40.
The sharpest increase in incentives occurred during the 1990s and 2000s, once again driven by
the increase in options. By 2000-05, the typical top-3 executive has more than $31 million of
e¤ective equity ownership, vastly higher than the $4.8 million in 1980-89 (all in 2014 dollars).
    For S&P 500 rms, top executives e¤ective dollar ownership has reached similar heights.
Figure 9 shows its value for the median S&P 500 CEO from 1992 to 2014. Dollar ownership rose
from $19 million in 1992 to $97 million in 2000, fell to $38 million in 2008, and recovered to $67
million by 2014. These large swings are at least in part due to movements in the aggregate stock
market. The overall time trend, however, is upwards, with CEOs e¤ective dollar ownership
more than three times larger in 2014 than in 1992.
    There are interesting di¤erences between S&P 500, MidCap, and SmallCap rms in both
level and evolution of the two incentive measures. Panels B and C of Figure 9 show that
CEOs e¤ective percentage ownership is larger in smaller rms. In 2014, the typical mid-cap
(small-cap) CEO has an ownership percentage of 0.61% (1.26%), far higher than the 0.34% for
S&P 500 CEOs. Over time, however, ownership percentages have declined for both mid-cap
and small-cap CEOs, and 2014 percentages are less than half their 1994 level. The ownership
percentages of S&P 500 CEOs have declined less, from 0.46% in 1994 to 0.34% in 2014.
    Given the di¤erences in rm sizes, the larger ownership percentages of mid-cap and small-
cap CEOs translate into smaller dollar holdings. By 2014, the typical mid-cap (small-cap) CEO
   8
    It is also the Jensen-Murphy e¤ective ownership percentage times the rms equity market capitalization.
Some researchers refer to the Hall-Liebman measure as delta. We recommend not using this terminology since
the delta of an option is the dollar change in its value for a dollar change in the underlying stock price, so the
delta should refer to the Jensen-Murphy measure. To avoid such ambiguities, we use the terms e¤ective
percentage ownership and e¤ective dollar ownership.


                                                       17
has e¤ective dollar ownership of $24 ($13) million, much less than the $67 million of S&P 500
CEOs. Neither mid-cap nor small-cap CEOs have experienced the same growth in stock and
option holdings as S&P 500 CEOs. Their level of e¤ective dollar ownership is roughly the same
in 2014 as in 1994, while it almost tripled for S&P 500 CEOs.
    The juxtaposition of e¤ective percentage and dollar ownership in Table 3 and Figure 9
highlights that alternative measures of the wealth-performance sensitivity can lead to very
di¤erent views on the strength of incentives. The divergence in the level of these two incentive
measures is mostly due to growth in rm values over time: Executives tend to own smaller
percentage but larger dollar stakes in larger rms (Garen, 1994; Schaefer; 1998; Baker and
Hall, 2004; Edmans, Gabaix, and Landier, 2009), with the result that rm growth leads to
lower percentage but higher dollar ownership. Nevertheless, at least for the largest rms, both
measures rose from the 1970s to the 2000s, mostly due to increasing option holdings. By 2000-
05, the median large- rm executive holds options worth $9.8 million, signi cantly larger than
his stock holdings of $6.8 million, and almost 30 times his option holdings in 1970-79 (Columns
3 and 4 of Table 3). For S&P 500 CEOs, dollar ownership peaks in the late 1990s and remains
high, with the median CEOs equity exposure at $97 million in 2000 and at $67 million in 2014.
    To summarize, the vast majority of executive incentives stem from revaluations of stock and
option holdings, rather than changes in annual pay. E¤ective dollar ownership was sizeable for
most of the twentieth century and increased strongly between 1970 and 2000, mostly owing to
rapidly growing option portfolios. Since 2000, dollar ownership has fallen but remains at least
at the levels of the early 1990s. By contrast, percentage ownership has always been low and is
even lower today than in the 1930s.
    Because of these conicting signals about top executives incentives, we examine the merits of
di¤erent incentive measures in Section 3.2.1. In brief, the correct measure of incentives depends
on how executive actions a¤ect rm value, i.e., on the executives production function (Baker
and Hall, 2004; Edmans, Gabaix, and Landier, 2009). With an additive production function,
executive actions have the same dollar impact on value regardless of rm size, and the e¤ective
percentage ownership is the right measure of incentives. For example, the cost to an executive
of wasting funds on an unnecessary corporate jet depends on his percentage ownership. With a
multiplicative production function, the impact of executive actions on value scales with rm size,
and e¤ective dollar ownership is the right measure of incentives. For example, the bene t to an
executive of a restructuring that increases rm value by 1% depends on his dollar ownership.
Because top executives engage in both types of activities, both measures of incentives are
important. The high values of dollar ownership and the low percentage ownership levels in
Figure 9 suggest that todays CEOs are well motivated to restructure their rms but may still
  nd it optimal to waste money on perks. Thus, direct monitoring, rather than incentives, may
be the best way to control additive actions (Edmans, Gabaix, and Landier, 2009).
    The above incentive measures gauge an executives monetary reward from actions to in-
crease the rms equity value. However, incentives stem from the e¤ect of stock returns on


                                               18
the executives utility, rather than his monetary wealth, which will di¤er if he is risk-averse
(see Jenter, 2002; Dittmann and Maug, 2007; and Section 2.1.2). Dittmann and Maug (2007)
estimate a measure of utility-adjusted wealth-performance sensitivity based on assumptions on
CEOs relative risk aversion. In addition, an executives actions may a¤ect the rms total
value rather than its equity value. If the rm is highly levered, the executives incentives to
increase equity value may signi cantly overestimate his incentives to increase total rm value,
since those value gains may primarily bene t debtholders. Measuring the sensitivity of CEOs
stock and option holdings to changes in total rm values, rather than to changes in equity
values, is therefore a promising research direction (see Chesney, Stromberg, and Wagner, 2017).

2.3.2.    Cross-Sectional Variation in Incentives

This section explores how CEOs ownership incentives correlate with rm and CEO character-
istics. Table 4 regresses CEOs e¤ective percentage and dollar ownership on rm size, volatility,
stock return performance, CEO age, tenure, and a female CEO indicator in the S&P 1,500 from
1992 to 2014.
    CEOs e¤ective percentage ownership, shown in Panel A, is strongly negatively related to
total rm value, with a rm size elasticity of about -0.35. CEOs e¤ective dollar ownership,
shown in Panel B, is strongly positively related to total rm value, with a rm size elasticity
of about 0.55. Hence, CEOs tend to own smaller percentage but larger dollar equity stakes
in larger rms. Both elasticities are robust to the inclusion of industry, year, and industry-
year xed e¤ects. A negative correlation between rm size and CEOs percentage ownership
has been documented by, among others, Jensen and Murphy (1990a), Garen (1994), Schaefer
(1998), Baker and Hall (2004), and Edmans, Gabaix, and Landier (2009). A positive correlation
between rm size and CEOs dollar ownership has been documented by, among others, Baker
and Hall (2004) and Edmans, Gabaix, and Landier (2009).9 Section 3.3 compares the observed
elasticities to the predictions of a market equilibrium model with moral hazard.
    Column 4 of Panels A and B introduces CEO age, tenure, and a female CEO indicator
into the regressions. Both e¤ective percentage and dollar ownership are positively correlated
with CEO tenure and negatively with CEO age. Section 3.7 reviews dynamic contracting
models that predict how optimal CEO incentives evolve with tenure. Female CEOs hold smaller
percentage and smaller dollar stakes, even though the association with percentage ownership is
only signi cant at the 10% level.
    Column 5 of Panels A and B adds contemporaneous and lagged stock returns to the regres-
sions. Both e¤ective percentage and dollar ownership are strongly positively correlated with
   9
    Edmans, Gabaix, and Landier (2009) report a more negative percentage ownership- rm size elasticity of
-0.61, and a less positive dollar ownership- rm size elasticity of 0.39. There are two reasons for the di¤erences:
First, Edmans, Gabaix, and Landiers estimates are for the largest 500 rms in each year only, and e¤ective
dollar (percentage) ownership stakes increase less fast (decrease faster) with rm size for larger rms. Second,
we measure percentage ownership as percentage of equity, while Edmans, Gabaix, and Landier measure it as
percentage of total rm value.


                                                       19
stock returns. The correlation between stock returns and dollar ownership is largely mechanical
 stock returns directly change the dollar value of CEOs holdings. Likely causes of the positive
correlation with percentage ownership include the positive e¤ect of returns on option deltas,
which mechanically increases e¤ective percentage ownership, and high returns indicating more
valuable e¤ort, in turn increasing the optimal level of incentives (see the model of Holmström
and Milgrom (1987), laid out in Section 3.2.3.)
    The prior literature disagrees on the relationship between stock return volatility and CEOs
ownership incentives. While Lambert and Larcker (1987), Aggarwal and Samwick (1999a),
and Jin (2002) nd a negative relationship, Core and Guay (1999), Oyer and Schaefer (2005),
and Coles, Daniel, and Naveen (2006) document a positive one, and Garen (1994), Yermack
(1995), Bushman, Indjejikian, and Smith (1996), Ittner, Larcker, and Rajan (1997), Conyon
and Murphy (2000), Edmans, Gabaix, and Landier (2009), and Cheng, Hong, and Scheinkman
(2015) show either no relationship or mixed results. Section 3.2 surveys shareholder value
models that make predictions about the relationship between volatility and incentives.
    Table 4 Panel A shows that stock return volatility and CEOs e¤ective percentage ownership
are positively correlated, suggesting that CEOs own larger percentage stakes in riskier rms.
This correlation is robust to the inclusion of industry, year, and industry-year xed e¤ects. A
one standard deviation increase in the volatility of monthly stock returns is associated with a
7 to 18% increase in CEOs e¤ective percentage ownership.
    Panel B shows that CEOs e¤ective dollar ownership is positively correlated with stock re-
turn volatility in the overall cross-section (Column 1), but that this correlation turns negative
when industry xed e¤ects are included (Columns 2-4). This negative within-industry corre-
lation, however, vanishes again when contemporaneous and lagged stock returns are included
(Column 5). The reason is that volatility and stock price performance are negatively correlated,
so high volatility proxies for low stock returns if the latter are omitted, which creates a spurious
negative correlation with dollar ownership. With stock returns included, the within-industry
correlation between volatility and dollar ownership is e¤ectively zero.
    Aggarwal and Samwick (1999a) use an alternative approach to measure the e¤ect of volatility
on the wealth-performance sensitivity: they regress annual dollar changes in CEOs rm-related
wealth on contemporaneous dollar changes in shareholder value and an interaction between
changes in value and volatility.10 The coe¢cient on CEO wealth is equivalent to the CEOs
e¤ective percentage ownership, and the interaction coe¢cient measures how percentage own-
ership varies with volatility. Aggarwal and Samwick also argue that the relevant measure of
risk for percentage ownership is the variance of dollar returns, not the variance of percentage
returns.11 (Section 3.2.3 discusses how the appropriate measure of risk depends on the produc-
  10
     Annual changes in CEOs rm-related wealth are measured as the sum of ow pay plus the change in the
value of stock and option holdings due to stock returns. This value change is calculated as the annual stock
return multiplied by the CEOs e¤ective dollar ownership at the start of the year. Daniel, Li, and Naveen (2012)
improve on this approximation by accounting for stock sales, stock purchases, and option exercises.
  11
     Dollar returns are the product of percentage returns with the rms once-lagged equity market capitalization,


                                                       20
tion function). Intuitively, dollar variance captures that the same percentage stake exposes the
owner to more risk in a larger rm. To accommodate the skewness of dollar variances and rm
values, Aggarwal and Samwick replace their values by their scaled ranks within the sample,
and run median regressions.
    Panel C of Table 4 presents the regressions, which show that the positive e¤ect of dollar
returns on CEO wealth diminishes as dollar volatility increases. This negative interaction,
which is robust to the inclusion of year and industry xed e¤ects, suggests that CEOs e¤ective
percentage ownership declines as dollar volatility increases. Columns 4 and 5, however, con rm
that the e¤ective ownership percentage increases in percentage volatility, consistent with Panel
A. This discrepancy between percentage and dollar volatility is another promising direction for
future research.
    To summarize, rm size and CEOs ownership incentives are strongly correlated, with
smaller e¤ective percentage stakes and larger e¤ective dollar stakes in larger rms. The re-
lationship between stock return volatility and ownership incentives is more complex and de-
pends on whether volatility is measured in percentages or in dollars. However, we emphasize
once again that the relationships in Table 4 are correlations and not causal e¤ects. Important
explanatory variables for CEOs ownership incentives, such as rm size and volatility, are them-
selves a¤ected by CEOs actions, and are also correlated with unobservable rm, industry, and
executive characteristics that a¤ect incentives. Consequently, the correlations between these
explanatory variables and CEOs ownership incentives have to be interpreted with caution.

2.3.3.    Performance-Based Equity

Since the mid-2000s, the relationship between rm performance and executive wealth has be-
come more complex. In Section 2.2.1, we observed that between 2001 and 2014, restricted stock
grants have replaced options as the most popular form of equity compensation. However, many
of these new stock grants are not conventional time-vesting grants but instead performance-
based grants, for which vesting depends on rm performance. This is an important change
with rst-order e¤ects on the wealth-performance relationship.
    Most performance-based equity comes in one of two varieties.12 With performance-vesting
stock (options), the executive receives a xed number of shares (options) at the end of the
vesting period, which is often three years, if the executive is still with the rm and one or
more performance conditions have been ful lled. For example, the executive might receive
10,000 shares if earnings-per-share are above a pre-determined threshold during each year of
the vesting period. This contrasts with time-vesting restricted stock, which vests independently
and the dollar variance is the product (or interaction) of the percentage variance with the once-lagged equity
market capitalization.
  12
     A third variety is performance-accelerated stock and option grants, which vest faster if one or more per-
formance conditions are ful lled and otherwise behave like time-vesting grants. They saw some use in the late
1990s but vanished almost completely by 2010 (Bettis, Bizjak, Coles, and Kalpathy, 2016).



                                                     21
of performance, as long as the executive remains with the rm.13
    The second popular variety of performance-based equity are performance shares (options).
Conditional on still being with the rm, the executive receives a variable number of shares (op-
tions) at the end of the vesting period, with the number a function of one or more performance
metrics. The mapping from the performance metric(s) into the number of securities is usually
non-linear, with a lower performance threshold below which no securities are granted, a discrete
jump at the threshold, an incentive zone over which the number of securities increases linearly
(or piecewise linearly) with performance, and a ceiling beyond which the number of securities
does not increase. Towards the middle of the incentive zone is a target performance level at
which a target number of securities is awarded.
    Figure 10 shows a typical performance-vesting stock grant (Panel A) and a typical performance-
share grant (Panel B). For simplicity, the gure assumes that each grant uses only one per-
formance metric, even though real-world grants are frequently based on more than one. The
mapping from the performance metric into the number of securities delivered at vesting, de-
picted as the bold line, is given by the terms of the grant. The mapping from performance
into the dollar payo¤ received is less clear and depends on the stock price at vesting. Un-
der the assumption that performance and stock prices are positively correlated, the value of
the equity received is increasing in performance. This is depicted as the dotted line in the
diagrams. For performance shares, an interaction e¤ect ensues: In the incentive zone, better
performance delivers both more shares and more valuable shares to the executive, which makes
the wealth-performance relationship convex.
    Unlike conventional stock and option grants, empirically observed performance-based grants
are heterogeneous and vary along several dimensions. The securities received at vesting can be
shares or options, the number of securities received can depend on one or more performance
metrics, and the metrics might be based on market prices, accounting numbers, or anything
else the board deems worth rewarding (e.g., customer satisfaction or workplace safety).
    The use of performance-based equity has increased dramatically over time. Among the 750
largest U.S. public rms, Bettis, Bizjak, Coles, and Kalpathy (2016) nd that the fraction using
performance-based equity rose from 20% in 1998 to 70% in 2012. By 2012, the number of rms
granting performance-based equity exceeded that granting time-vesting stock for the rst time.
    Combining the hand-collected samples of Gerakos, Ittner, and Larcker (2009), Bettis, Bizjak,
Coles, and Kalpathy (2010), and Bettis et al. (2016) reveals several interesting facts about the
use of performance-based equity:

        Performance-based grants have become more complex over time. The earlier studies
         observe relatively simple performance-vesting grants, with zero vesting up to a threshold
  13
    Performance-based equity rst gained prominence in large publicly traded UK rms in the late 1990s
(Conyon, Peck, Read, and Sadler, 2000). In 1995, the UK Confederation of Business and Industry issued a
report recommending that grants under incentive schemes, including[...] grants under [...] option schemes,
should be subject to challenging performance criteria (Greenbury, 1995).


                                                    22
        and full vesting at the threshold. After 2010, grants for which the number of securities
        varies piecewise linearly with the performance metric(s) dominate.

       Accounting-based performance metrics are used more frequently than stock-price based
        metrics, and the use of accounting metrics has increased over time. Earnings-based met-
        rics, such as earnings-per-share, are the most common accounting measures, while total
        shareholder return is the most popular stock-based metric.

       More awards use absolute than relative performance measures. However, relative perfor-
        mance metrics, which compare rm performance to that of a peer group or index, still
        feature prominently. In 2012, 48% of rms granting performance-based equity used at
        least one relative performance metric (Bettis et al., 2016).

       The performance requirements of performance-based grants have considerable bite. Bettis
        et al. (2016) nd that target performance levels are achieved for only 47% of grants, and
        that performance provisions reduce the grant-date value of awards by 42% compared to
        similar grants without provisions.

       Stock is the back-end security for more than 90% of all performance-based grants, with
        options making up the rest.

    The shift to complex performance-based equity awards creates serious challenges for board
members, shareholders, regulators, and researchers. Determining the ex-ante values of performance-
based equity grants, and especially of grants using accounting performance metrics, is di¢cult.
The grant-date fair values reported by rms are typically the result of (opaque) Monte Carlo
simulations done by compensation consultants. Bettis et al. (2016) apply their own valuation
models to performance-based grants and report large discrepancies with the values reported by
  rms. Surprisingly, they nd that companies appear to overstate values. Studies that use these
reported grant-date values to measure pay are likely to su¤er from both measurement error and
biases.
    Determining the incentives created by performance-based equity is even more of a challenge,
especially for grants that use multiple performance metrics. Holding the grant-date value con-
stant, making the number of securities delivered at vesting a function of performance increases
the sensitivity of wealth to stock returns. The magnitude of this increase depends on the perfor-
mance provisions and on the correlation between the performance metric(s) and stock returns.
Moreover, executives risk taking incentives are a¤ected by convexities and concavities in the
wealth-performance relation created by the performance provisions.14

2.3.4.   Bonus Plans

Even though the literature has focused on the incentive e¤ects of executives stock and option
holdings, most top executives also participate in annual or multi-year bonus plans. Bonus
payments are usually a function of one or more measures of accounting performance, such as
earnings per share, operating income, or sales, with most plans using more than one metric
(Murphy, 1999, 2001; De Angelis and Grinstein, 2015). Many bonus plans use at least one
relative performance measure, such as sales growth minus the average sales growth of a peer
group (Gong, Li, and Shin, 2011). Performance may be measured over one or across multiple
years. The proportion of S&P 500 rms with bonus plans based on multi-year accounting
performance rose from 17% in 1996 to 43% in 2008 (Li and Wang, 2016). In addition to pre-
speci ed, formula-based plans, many rms also award discretionary bonuses based on qualitative
evaluations of executive performance (Murphy, 1999).
    Figure 11 illustrates the payo¤ structure of a typical formula-based bonus plan. No bonus
is paid until performance reaches a lower threshold, at which point the payo¤ jumps discretely.
On the upside, the bonus is capped at a second threshold beyond which the payo¤ does not
increase. In the incentive zone in between, the bonus increases in performance. This increase
may be linear, as shown in Figure 11, but may also be convex or concave. In the middle of
the incentive zone is a target performance level at which a target bonus is awarded. The
overall pay-for-performance relation is indicated by the bold line, which has strong similarities
to the payo¤ structure of performance shares (Figure 10).
    Comparing the strength of the incentives from bonus plans to those from stock and option
holdings is not trivial. On the one hand, the variation in wealth caused by changes in the value
of equity holdings is much larger than that caused by changes in bonus payments (Hall and
Liebman, 1998). On the other hand, the link between executives actions and the performance
metrics underlying bonus payouts is often more direct than the link between actions and stock
price changes. For example, an executive might understand how winning a new contract a¤ects
earnings and sales, but might be much less certain about the e¤ect on the stock price. As a
result, the incentive e¤ects of bonus plans might be stronger than suggested by simply measuring
wealth-performance sensitivities (Murphy, 2013).
    A frequent criticism of both bonus plans and performance-based equity is that the discrete
jumps and nonlinearities in the payo¤s give executives strong incentives to manipulate per-
formance (Murphy, 2013). For example, an executive with performance just below the lower
threshold gains much by inating performance to exceed the threshold, while an executive with
performance far above the upper threshold optimally slacks o¤ and defers additional perfor-
mance to the next period. We examine these issues and the related evidence in Section 6.2.1.




                                               24
2.3.5.   Executive Turnover

The threat of termination after poor performance can provide CEOs and other executives with
additional incentives (see Section 3.7.2). Both forced and total turnover rates for U.S. CEOs
have slowly increased since the 1970s (Huson, Parrino, and Starks, 2001; Kaplan and Minton,
2011; Jenter and Lewellen, 2017). The probability of forced turnover increases as stock or
accounting performance decline (Coughlin and Schmidt, 1985; Warner, Watts, and Wruck,
1988; Weisbach, 1988; Jensen and Murphy, 1990a; Denis, Denis, and Sarin, 1997; Parrino,
1997; Murphy, 1999; Huson, Parrino, and Starks, 2001; Kaplan and Minton, 2011; Jenter and
Lewellen, 2017). However, the economic magnitudes are modest. Depending on the sample
and the performance measure used, the annual probability of forced CEO turnover is 2 to 6
percentage points higher for a bottom decile than for a top decile performer. This led Jensen and
Murphy (1990a) to conclude that dismissals are not an important source of CEO incentives.
Even under the aggressive assumption that the CEO receives no severance package and is
unable to nd alternative employment until retirement, Jensen and Murphy (1990a) estimate
that incentives from expected dismissals are equivalent to an equity stake of only 0.03%.
    One reason for these weak incentives is that the observed rate of forced turnover is low
 less than 3% per year in most studies. The literature distinguishes forced from voluntary
turnovers based on CEO characteristics, especially CEO age, and characteristics of the turnover
process (Warner, Watts, and Wruck, 1988; Denis and Denis, 1995; Kim 1996; Parrino, 1997).
Crucially, these classi cation schemes do not use performance to identify forced turnovers.
Kaplan and Minton (2011) and Jenter and Lewellen (2017) note that turnovers usually classi ed
as voluntary are signi cantly more frequent at lower levels of performance, suggesting that
many of them might in fact be caused by bad performance. Poor performance may lead to not
only the CEO being red (a forced turnover) but also the CEO choosing to quit given the
disutility and reputational damage from underperformance (a voluntary turnover)  either
way, the turnover would not have occurred had performance been better. Jenter and Lewellen
(2017) attempt to estimate the number of performance-induced turnovers directly from the
turnover-performance relationship, without any prior classi cation into forced vs. voluntary.
Their estimates suggest that around half of all CEO turnovers in publicly traded U.S. rms are
performance-induced.


2.4.     International Evidence
Academic research on executive pay has focused on the U.S., mostly because of data availability.
While the U.S. has required detailed disclosure of executive pay since the 1930s, most other
countries have historically required at most the disclosure of aggregate cash compensation
for all top executives combined, with no individual data and little information on other pay
components (Murphy, 2013). For most countries, this forced researchers to rely on industry
surveys (Abowd and Boggano, 1995; Abowd and Kaplan, 1999; Murphy, 1999; Kato and Kubo,

                                               25
2006; Thomas, 2009; Fabbri and Marin, 2015), to focus on only the cash component of pay
(Kato and Rockel, 1992; Conyon and Schwalbach, 2000; Kato and Long, 2006; Kato, Kim, and
Lee, 2007), or to examine the combined pay of the entire management team (Kaplan, 1994;
Elson and Goldberg, 2003; Bryan, Nash, and Patel, 2006; Muslu, 2010). Notable exceptions
with better disclosure are Canada and the U.K., which have required detailed pay disclosures
since 1993 and 1995, respectively.
    An almost universal conclusion of international pay comparisons is that U.S. executives are
paid more and receive a higher fraction of pay in equity than in other countries. Many studies
rely on surveys of compensation consultants, such as Tower Perrins Worldwide Total Remuner-
ation Reports, to reach this conclusion (Abowd and Boggano, 1995; Abowd and Kaplan, 1999;
Murphy, 1999; Thomas, 2009). Using actual corporate disclosures, Zhou (2000) con rms that
in 1993-95, Canadian CEOs received less than half the pay of U.S. CEOs, a smaller fraction of
pay in equity, and had lower wealth-performance sensitivities. Using Japanese tax records from
2004, Nakazato, Ramseyer, and Rasmusen (2011) show that, controlling for rm size, Japanese
executives earned only 20% of the pay of their U.S. counterparts.
    Comparing CEO pay in the U.S. and U.K. in 1997 and controlling for rm size, industry, and
other rm and executive characteristics, Conyon and Murphy (2000) nd that U.S. CEOs earned
almost twice as much and had six times higher wealth-performance sensitivities. Comparing
propensity-score matched U.S. and U.K. CEOs, Conyon, Core, and Guay (2011) report that
the U.S. pay premium declined from a mean (median) of 200% (118%) in 1997 to 81% (23%)
in 2003. They argue that the pay premium completely vanishes by 2003 if CEO pay is adjusted
for the risk associated with more equity-based pay.
    Disclosure has improved markedly in recent years (Murphy, 2013). Ireland and South Africa
require detailed executive pay disclosures from 2000 and Australia from 2004. By 2006, fol-
lowing a prior recommendation by the E.U. Commission, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands, and Sweden had mandated detailed disclosure, as had (outside the E.U.) Norway
and Switzerland.
    Using newly available data from 14 countries that required individual pay disclosures by
2006, Fernandes, Ferreira, Matos, and Murphy (2013) argue that the U.S. pay premium has
become economically small: Controlling for standard rm characteristics (such as industry,
size, and performance), but also for ownership and board structure, U.S. CEOs earned only
26% more than their foreign counterparts in 2006. U.S. rms tend to have higher institutional
ownership and more independent boards, both of which are associated with higher pay and more
equity-based pay. They also have fewer large inside blockholders (large shareholders), such as
families, that are associated with lower pay and less equity-based pay, potentially because direct
monitoring reduces agency problems. Fernandes et al. also compare pay levels after adjusting
for the risk of equity-based pay. Because U.S. rms continue to grant more equity, this reduces
the U.S. pay premium further and makes it statistically insigni cant by 2006.
    Table 5 presents some of the data utilized by the Fernandes et al. analysis for 2002-9. Our


                                               26
sample, taken from BoardEx and ExecuComp, includes CEOs of the largest publicly-traded
 rms with available data from 10 European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, U.K.) and the U.S.15 With no controls for rm or
governance characteristics, the level of CEO pay remains highest in the U.S. and exceeds that
in other countries by 102% on average. Di¤erences in taxation exacerbate rather than attenuate
di¤erences in gross pay: Piketty, Saez, and Stancheva (2014) nd that CEOs are paid more in
countries with low marginal tax rates.
    Figure 12 and Table 5 also show large di¤erences in the composition of pay across countries.
Stock and option compensation is a larger fraction of CEO pay in the U.S. than in any other
country, which may explain at least in part why U.S. CEOs are paid more. U.S. CEOs receive
on average 42% of pay in stock and options, compared to only 19% in other countries. Salary,
on the other hand, is 53% of CEO pay outside the U.S. but only 30% in the U.S.
    To summarize, based on simple univariate comparisons, pay levels are signi cantly higher
in the U.S. than other countries. However, the pay gap has narrowed in recent years, and
controlling for rm and pay characteristics reduces the gap. U.S. rms tend to be larger and
pay their CEOs more with equity, which explains much of the U.S. pay premium.


2.5.     Private Firms
Almost all studies of executive pay examine publicly-traded rms, simply because regulators
usually do not require private companies to disclose pay. As a result, little is known about
pay levels and pay design in privately-held rms. The few existing studies of executive pay in
private rms are either based on surveys or on small, selected samples.
    Several studies examine the information on o¢cers compensation in the Survey of Small
Business Finances (SSBF), a nationally representative sample of more than 4,000 U.S. busi-
nesses with fewer than 500 employees. Questions about executive pay were included in the
surveys 1993 and 2003 iterations. Combining the results of Cole and Mehran (1996), Caval-
luzzo and Sanjaraguruswamy (2000), Farrell and Winter (2008), Michiels, Voordeckers, Lybaert,
and Steijvers (2013), and Cole and Mehran (2016) reveals several interesting patterns. First,
CEO pay increases with rm size, regardless of whether size is measured as sales, book assets,
or number of employees. Cole and Mehran (2016) report that the pay-size elasticity is higher
for small private rms than for large public rms. Second, CEOs with higher percentage equity
ownership tend to receive less pay. Third, studies disagree about the relationship between CEO
pay and accounting pro tability, which suggests that this relationship is weak and not robust to
the inclusion of controls. Because the SSBF does not permit following the same rm over time,
this pay-performance sensitivity is estimated from the cross-section of rms and di¢cult to
interpret. Fourth, comparing the 1993 and 2003 surveys suggests a decline in ination-adjusted
  15
    We restrict our analysis to 2002-9 because the BoardEx data covers many fewer rms both before and
afterwards. We are grateful to Nuno Fernandes, Miguel Ferreira, Pedro Matos, and Kevin Murphy for answering
numerous questions about the data used in their paper.


                                                    27
CEO pay, a remarkable di¤erence to the steep increase in large public rms shown in Figure 2.
    An important caveat to studies on private rms is that many of the CEOs are the controlling
shareholder of their rm. This is a crucial di¤erence to most public rms, in which CEOs tend to
be employees with only small equity stakes. If a CEO is a controlling shareholder, the standard
considerations of contract design  attraction, retention, and incentive alignment  are mostly
irrelevant. As a result, his pay is determined by other considerations, such as liquidity needs
and tax optimization. For example, an owner-manager might nd it optimal to pay himself a
larger salary out of pre-tax corporate income instead of receiving the same pay as a dividend
(Ke, 2001).
    The SEC requires privately-held U.S. rms to reveal information about top executive pay if
the rm has a class of equity securities with more than 500 shareholders, or if it has registered
a public o¤ering of debt securities. Gao and Li (2015) analyze such rms in 1999-2011 and
  nd that CEOs in private rms are paid 30% less than their industry- and size-matched public
counterparts. The link between CEO pay and accounting performance is much weaker in private
  rms, a nding that is robust to restricting the sample to CEOs with small ownership stakes
(i.e., to excluding owner-managers). Unsurprisingly, private rms use much less equity-based
pay than comparable public rms.16
    Both public and privately-held U.S. property-liability insurers are required to le executive
pay data with state regulators. Ke, Petroni, and Sa edinne (1999) collect data on 45 CEOs
of private and 18 CEOs of public insurers from 1994-96. They nd a positive relationship
between pro tability and CEO pay for publicly-held insurers but not for private ones. Within
private insurers, Ke (2001) provides suggestive evidence that insurers with owner-managers
reduce CEO pay when individual tax rates increase relative to corporate tax rates, consistent
with tax optimization.
    The weak pay-performance sensitivity for private- rm CEOs who are not owner-managers is
interesting. Given that private rms cannot use stock prices as performance signals, one might
have expected a close link between CEO pay and accounting performance. On the other hand,
concentrated owners may substitute monitoring for incentive pay. Owners of privately-held
  rms are likely to have more direct oversight of managers and, at least in some rms, may take
important strategic decisions themselves. This reduces the need for incentive pay, and indeed
for top-level executive talent in the rst place.
    An especially interesting group of privately-held rms are those controlled by private equity
(PE) investors. PE portfolio companies have controlling shareholders who provide close
monitoring and are often seen as models of good governance (Cronqvist and Fahlenbrach,
2013). Moreover, portfolio companies are frequently large, used to be publicly traded rms or
divisions of publicly-traded rms, and often become public rms again as the PE investor exits.
  16
    Using Japanese tax return data, Nakazato, Ramseyer, and Rasmussen (2009) report that, after controlling
for rm size, public and private company CEOs have similar compensation levels. However, pay is more sensitive
to pro tability in public than in private rms, consistent with the U.S. evidence.



                                                     28
    Jackson (2013) and Leslie and Oyer (2013) examine PE-controlled rms that undertake
an IPO. IPO rms are required to le a registration statement with the SEC that discloses
executive pay for the previous two years. This sampling strategy selects portfolio rms that are
unusually successful, and the results may not generalize to more typical portfolio rms. Both
studies suggest that CEOs of PE-controlled rms receive similar levels of pay as in matched
public rms. However, CEOs of portfolio companies have much stronger equity incentives, both
in terms of e¤ective dollar ownership and e¤ective percentage ownership, while earning lower
base pay.17 These di¤erences do not exist before these companies are bought by PE investors,
and the di¤erences quickly disappear after portfolio rms undertake an IPO.
    Cronqvist and Fahlenbrach (2013) follow 20 leveraged buyout (LBO) rms that are taken
private by PE investors in 2005-07 but are required to continue ling with the SEC because of
public debt. After the LBO, CEOs e¤ective percentage ownership increases by a factor of 2
to 3, regardless of whether CEOs are retained or replaced. However, e¤ective dollar ownership
declines, as CEOs treat the buy-out as a liquidity event and cash out some (or in case of turnover
all) of their pre-LBO holdings.18 PE owners do not reduce base salaries or perks for CEOs,
and they increase target bonuses and the use of performance-vesting equity. Bonus schemes are
redesigned away from qualitative, non- nancial, and earnings-based metrics towards cash-ow
based metrics. Severance agreements become tougher after LBOs, with unvested stock and
options forfeited to a larger extent if a CEO is dismissed.
    Based on this limited evidence from heavily selected samples, it appears that PE-controlled
 rms use more pay-for-performance and stronger equity incentives than comparable public
 rms. Other private rms, however, seem to have weak pay-for-performance incentives for
executives who are not owner-managers. It is an important question whether both compensation
models are optimal, which would suggest that these two sets of rms are very di¤erent, or
whether some of the observed compensation arrangements are ine¢cient.


3.     The Shareholder Value View
The rapid rise in executive pay since the 1970s has sparked a lively debate about the determi-
nants of executive pay. One end of the spectrum, analyzed in this section, views CEO pay as
the e¢cient outcome of a labor market in which rms optimally compete for managerial talent.
The other end, analyzed in Section 4, views CEO pay as the result of rent extraction by CEOs.
Section 5 presents a third view, that institutional factors have contributed signi cantly to the
rise in pay.
    The shareholder value view proposes that CEO contracts are the outcome of shareholder
value maximizing rms that compete with each other in an e¢cient market for managerial tal-
  17
     The result that CEOs in PE-controlled rms that undertake an IPO have unusually high ownership per-
centages is con rmed by Muscarella and Vetsuypens (1990), who study an earlier sample from 1976 to 1987.
  18
     Kaplan and Stein (1993) nd similar changes in executives equity incentives around LBOs in the 1980s.


                                                   29
ent. This view broadens what is commonly referred to as the optimal contracting view, which
typically focuses on the details of bilateral contracts. We use the term shareholder value view
for two main reasons. First, it emphasizes the need to take into account additional dimensions
such as market forces and competitive equilibrium. Second, in reality boards are unlikely to
choose the perfectly optimal contract, even if they are concerned with shareholder value rather
than rent extraction. One reason is a preference for simplicity, which may restrict them to
piecewise linear contracts. The theoretically optimal contract is typically highly nonlinear and
never observed in reality; under a strict de nition of optimal contracting, this view would be
immediately rejected. A second reason is bounded rationality, which may lead to boards not
being aware of certain (potentially non-obvious) performance measures that could theoretically
improve the contract if included.
    We start in Section 3.1 by analyzing theories of the level of pay in a competitive market
equilibrium. We then study the sensitivity of pay to performance in a single- rm setting in
Section 3.2 and in a market equilibrium in Section 3.3. Section 3.4 discusses relative performance
evaluation and other performance signals, Section 3.5 addresses the optimal mix of stock vs.
options, and Section 3.6 does the same for debt vs. equity. Finally, Section 3.7 tackles dynamic
models and the horizon of pay. For a more extensive analysis of shareholder value theories,
please see Edmans and Gabaix (2016) which also includes proofs.


3.1.    The Level of Pay
Models that take the shareholder value view determine the level of CEO pay by deriving optimal
contracts (potentially subject to some contracting restrictions) and by endogenizing CEOs and
  rms outside options in a competitive market for talent. The rms outside option is to hire
a di¤erent CEO, and the CEOs outside option is to work elsewhere. Hence, what matters for
pay is how the current CEOs contribution to rm value compares to that of the next best
manager the rm could hire, and how much the CEO could earn in the next best job he could
take.
    The shareholder value view therefore identi es three mechanisms that might explain the
rise in CEO pay since the 1970s. First, the di¤erence between the CEOs contribution to rm
value and that of the next best manager may have increased, perhaps because the importance
of CEO ability has grown. Second, the CEOs expected earnings in the next best job may
have increased, perhaps because CEO skills have become more portable. Third, the CEOs
disutility from the optimal contract may have increased, perhaps because risk and e¤ort levels
have increased.
    In this section, we abstract from agency problems (which we later introduce in Section 3.2)
and focus on the pay required to attract the CEO to a rm. We present an assignment model in
which rm scale determines the demand for CEO talent in Section 3.1.1, introduce alternative
and complementary explanations for the level of CEO pay in Section 3.1.2, and confront the


                                               30
models with the evidence in Section 3.1.3.

3.1.1.    Assignment Models

Assignment models have long been used to model the allocation of workers to tasks (e.g.,
Sattinger, 1975, 1979; Rosen, 1981, 1982). A typical model speci es the jobs available, the
relevant di¤erences among workers, and the technology relating worker and job characteristics
to output. Most assignment models assume that workers have full knowledge of all job o¤ers,
that employers have full knowledge of all workers characteristics, that markets are competitive,
and that there are no frictions.19 As a result, the equilibrium assignment of workers to jobs is
e¢cient.
    More recently, Gabaix and Landier (2008) and Terviö (2008) have applied assignment models
to CEOs. Our exposition follows the tractable market equilibrium model in Gabaix and Landier
(2008). A continuum of rms and potential CEOs are matched together. Firm n 2 [0; N ] has
a baseline size S (n) and CEO m 2 [0; N ] has talent T (m). Low n denotes a larger rm and
low m a more talented CEO: S 0 (n) < 0, T 0 (m) < 0. n (respectively, m) can be thought of as
the rank of the rm (respectively, CEO), or a number proportional to it, such as its quantile of
rank (in which case it is in (0; 1]).
    We consider the problem faced by one particular rm. At t = 0, it hires a CEO of talent
T (m) for one period. The CEOs talent increases rm value according to

                                      V = S (n) + CS (n) T (m) ;                                         (1)

where C parametrizes the productivity of talent and the elasticity with respect to rm size.
The multiplicative structure implies that the productivity of talent increases with rm size
(Rosen, 1982). If     = 1 (respectively,   < 1), the model exhibits constant (respectively,
decreasing) returns to scale. We assume that the productivity of talent C and the elasticity
with respect to rm size is the same for all rms.
   We now determine equilibrium wages, which requires us to allocate one CEO to each rm.
Let w (m) denote the equilibrium wage of a CEO with index m. Firm n, taking the market
wage of CEOs as given, selects CEO m to maximize its value net of wages:

                                      max CS (n) T (m)         w (m) .
                                       m


  The competitive equilibrium is Pareto optimal and involves positive assortative matching:
more talented CEOs match with larger rms, where their value added is greater. In equilibrium,
m = n, and so w0 (n) = CS (n) T 0 (n). Let wN denote the reservation wage of the least talented
CEO (who is matched to rm n = N ). We obtain the classic assignment equation (Sattinger,
  19
    This di¤erentiates the assignment literature from matching models (Mortensen, 1986) and search models
(Jovanovic, 1979; Diamond, 1981; Pissarides, 1984), which feature uncertainty or asymmetric information about
job o¤ers or worker characteristics.

                                                            Z     N
                                           w (n) =                    CS (u) T 0 (u) du + wN :                                                  (2)
                                                              n

    Speci c functional forms are required to proceed further. We assume a Pareto rm size
distribution with exponent 1= : S (n) = An . Using results from extreme value theory,
Gabaix and Landier (2008) use the following asymptotic value for the spacings of the talent
distribution: T 0 (n) = Bn 1 . These functional forms give the wage in closed form for the
largest rms, taking the limit as n=N ! 0:

            Z    N
                                    +     1                   A BC               (      )          (       )
                                                                                                                            A BC           (    )
w (n) =              A BCu                    du+wN =               n                          N                    +wN                n            :
             n
                                                                                         (3)
   To interpret equation (3), we consider a reference rm, for instance the median rm in the
universe of the top 500 rms. Denote its index n , and its size S(n ) = An . We eventually
obtain:
                              w (n) = D (n ) S(n ) = S (n) = ;                         (4)

where D (n ) = Cn T 0 (n ) = (      ) is a constant independent of rm size.20
    Equation (4) gives the CEOs wage in closed form, which yields two clear predictions. First,
CEO pay is increasing in rm size: large rms hire the most talented CEOs, who command
the highest wages. Moreover, the prediction of equation (4) is quantitative: the pay- rm size
elasticity should be  =        = . Gabaix and Landier (2008) calibrate using = 1 (a Zipfs
law for rms, as in Axtell (2001)) and = 1 (constant returns to scale). Since there is no
clear a priori value for , they set = 2=3 to yield the pay-size elasticity of  = 1=3 that
is found empirically (e.g., Roberts, 1956). Baranchuk, MacDonald, and Yang (2011) extend
the model to endogenize rm size and show that the pay-size relationship is stronger when
industry conditions are favorable, as talented CEOs are not only paid a greater premium but
also optimally grow their rms to a larger size.
    Second, pay increases with the size of the average rm in the economy S (n ). Since a
CEOs talent can be applied to the entire rm, when rms are larger, the dollar bene ts from
a more talented CEO are higher and so there is more competition for talent. This is a similar

                                                                            1=

which yields equation (4).




                                                                           32
superstars e¤ect to Rosen (1992). Again, the prediction is quantitative. We use constant
returns to scale ( = 1), the standard benchmark for production functions. Average rm size
increased sixfold between 1980 and 2011. When both S (n ) and S (n) rise by a factor of 6,
CEO pay should rise by a factor of 6  [ = + (    = )] = 6 = 6, which Gabaix and Landier
(2008) show has been the case.

3.1.2.   Other Shareholder Value Explanations

The literature o¤ers several other explanations for rising CEO pay that assume shareholder value
maximization. One set of studies suggest that the growth in pay results from either increasing
demand for CEO talent from sources other than the increase in rm size, or increasing demand
for CEO e¤ort (from any source)  not only must the rm directly compensate the CEO for
exerting a higher e¤ort level, but also o¤er stronger incentives to induce this higher e¤ort level,
thus requiring greater pay as a risk premium (see Section 3.2). For example, the productivity
of managerial e¤ort and talent may have increased because of more intense competition due
to deregulation or entry by foreign rms (Hubbard and Palia, 1995; Cuñat and Guadalupe,
2009a, 2009b), improvements in the communication technologies used by managers (Garicano
and Rossi-Hansberg, 2006), or a more volatile business environment (Dow and Raposo, 2005).
An increase in rm size can also raise the optimal level of CEO e¤ort if the marginal product
of e¤ort increases with size (Himmelberg and Hubbard, 2000; Baker and Hall, 2004). Finally,
moral hazard problems may be more severe in larger rms, resulting in stronger incentives and
greater disutility for CEOs as rms grow (Gayle and Miller, 2009).
    An alternative market-based explanation for the growth in CEO pay is an increase in CEOs
bargaining power resulting from a shift in rms demand from rm-speci c to general managerial
skills. Such a shift intensi es the competition for talent and thus allows managers to capture
a larger fraction of their rms rents (Murphy and Zábojník, 2004, 2007; Frydman, 2017).
This theory predicts an increase in the level of CEO pay, rising inequality among executives
within and across rms, and a higher fraction of externally-hired CEOs. The assignment model
in the previous section does not include variation in CEOs bargaining power and ability to
extract surplus. Assignment models are typically perfectly competitive, so there is no surplus
to bargain on. Modeling bargaining power requires that the CEOs value-added is discretely
larger in his current rm than in the next best job, which can be achieved by either making rms
and managers discrete or making both rms needs and CEOs talents multi-dimensional. Pan
(2017) combines both approaches, with rms di¤ering in size, complexity, and R&D intensity
and executives matching based on their e¢ciency, experience, and technical expertise.
    A di¤erent market-based explanation proposes that the growth in CEO pay is the result of
stricter corporate governance and improved monitoring of CEOs by boards and large sharehold-
ers. The single- rm model of Hermalin (2005) shows that, if an increase in monitoring raises
CEO e¤ort and the risk of dismissal, CEOs demand greater pay as a compensating di¤eren-
tial. According to this theory, the observed rise in pay should be accompanied by higher CEO

                                                33
turnover, a stronger link between CEO turnover and rm performance, and more external CEO
hires. However, the market equilibrium model of Edmans and Gabaix (2011a) shows that an
economy-wide strengthening of governance may not lead to higher pay  while working for ones
current rm becomes less attractive, so do the outside options. In Chaigneau and Sahuguet
(2017), improved monitoring facilitates the dismissal of CEOs whose (initially unknown) ability
turns out to be low. This increases rms valuation of CEOs with uncertain ability, which in
turn raises the market equilibrium pay of all CEOs.

3.1.3.    Evidence

In this section, we assess the extent to which the shareholder value view is consistent with the
evidence. Theories based on the e¤ect of rm size on the demand for CEO talent nd their
strongest empirical support in the correlated increases in rm value and CEO pay since the
1970s. As discussed in Section 3.1.1, Gabaix and Landier (2008) show that the growth in the
aggregate value of the median S&P 500 rm can explain the entire growth in CEO pay from
1980 to 2003.21
    However, the data on the rm size-pay relation is not unambiguously consistent with their
model. While pay and rm values grew together from 1980 to the present, Frydman and Saks
(2010) show that median CEO pay was almost constant between the 1940s and early 1970s,
despite rm size increasing over this period. Gabaix and Landier (2008) discuss potential ex-
planations for this discrepancy. One is that the supply of talent greatly increased, which creates
downward pressure on CEO wages; another is that, in the early period, CEOs tended to be
internally promoted rather than externally hired, suggesting that their model does not describe
the CEO labor market before 1980. Nagel (2010) raises sample selection and methodological
concerns. However, Gabaix, Landier, and Sauvagnat (2014) conclude that the results are robust
to these changes.22
    Of course, observing that both rm sizes and CEO pay have trended upwards since 1980
does not imply causality. Even if causal, the positive correlation between pay and rm size
cannot be interpreted as de nitive evidence for assignment models, since it is also potentially
explainable by an (as yet unwritten) rent extraction model (see Section 4). For example, large
  rms may have more resources, allowing the CEO to extract higher pay.
    Looking beyond CEO pay, the frictionless assignment model in Section 3.1.1 is inconsistent
with several features of the CEO labor market. First, most CEOs of U.S. public rms are
promoted from within the rm, suggesting that rm-speci c human capital or other frictions
disadvantage outside candidates (Parrino, 1997; Cremers and Grinstein, 2014). Second, CEOs
almost never move directly between rms. Cziraki and Jenter (2017) show that fewer than
  21
     Kaplan and Rauh (2010, 2013) and Kaplan (2012) show that pay has risen even faster in other scalable
professions, such as private equity, venture capital, hedge funds, and law.
  22
     They also provide a users guide on these methodological issues, such as the relevant universe, the available
datasets and long-run compensation indices, and the relevant measure of rm size.



                                                        34
3% of new CEOs in S&P 500 rms are recruited directly from CEO positions in other rms,
indicating that even worse frictions hinder the mobility of incumbent CEOs. Third, Jenter,
Matveyev, and Roth (2017) show that stock prices react positively to deaths of old and long-
tenured CEOs, which suggests that these CEO- rm matches are not optimal. Stock prices react
negatively to deaths of young CEOs and founders, which points to the existence of rm-speci c
human capital partially captured by shareholders.
    None of these observations negate the usefulness of the competitive assignment model for
analyzing the CEO labor market. However, they do suggest that the model needs to be extended
to incorporate frictions, such as rm-speci c human capital or turnover costs, to become more
empirically realistic. Identifying and estimating the size of these frictions is an important future
research area (see Section 8). If these frictions are severe, they can create large match-speci c
rents that a powerful CEO might be able to capture (see Section 4 for a discussion of rent
extraction models).
    Supportive cross-sectional evidence for a role of talent or ability in CEO pay is provided by
Falato, Li, and Milbourn (2015). They proxy for ability using a CEOs reputational, career, and
educational credentials and nd these credentials to be positively related to pay. Engelberg,
Gao, and Parsons (2013) show that CEO pay increases in the number of personal connections
the CEO has to high-ranking executives and directors in other rms, which they interpret as a
component of ability, as such contacts likely help him improve rm value. Chang, Dasgupta, and
Hilary (2010) show that the probability of a departed CEO obtaining another top management
position increases in his pay compared to that of other top executives in the previous rm. This
is consistent with CEO pay proxying for ability or, at least, for labor market opportunities.
    There is also empirical support for theories that explain the rise in CEO pay with a rising
value of CEO talent or CEO e¤ort. For example, changes in product markets appear to have
increased the demand for CEO talent and raised pay. Hubbard and Palia (1995) and Cuñat
and Guadalupe (2009a) document higher pay following industry deregulations, and Cuñat and
Guadalupe (2009b) show that pay levels and incentives increase when rms face more import
penetration. However, the estimated magnitudes are modest, leaving a large fraction of the rise
in CEO pay unexplained.
    The alternative explanation that rms demand for CEO skills has shifted from rm-speci c
to general managerial ability predicts not only an increase in pay, but also changes in pay
dispersion and managerial mobility that are consistent with the evidence. As shown in Section
2.1, recent decades have seen a marked increase in the di¤erences in executive pay between
large and small rms, and between CEOs and other top executives. Over the same period,
the ratio of new CEOs appointed from outside the rm has risen sharply, top executives have
become more mobile across sectors, their business experiences have become more diverse, and
the fraction of CEOs with an MBA has risen (Murphy and Zábojník, 2004, 2007; Frydman,
2017). In the largest 500 U.S. rms, external hires as a percentage of all new CEO appointments
increased from 15% in the 1970s to 27% during the 1990s (Murphy and Zábojník, 2007) and to


                                                35
32% during the 2000s (Cziraki and Jenter, 2017).
    However, these changes in managers backgrounds and skills appear to have occurred slowly
over time (Frydman, 2017), and the magnitude and timing of the changes may not be large or
quick enough to explain the rapid rise in CEO pay since the 1980s. Cross-sectionally, Custódio,
Ferreira, and Matos (2013) nd that pay is higher for CEOs with generalist rather than specialist
managerial skills, but the di¤erences, even though substantial, are again too small to explain
the overall increase in CEO pay.
    Hermalin (2005) argues that rising CEO pay is the result of stricter monitoring of CEOs by
boards and large shareholders. This view is broadly consistent with the evidence. The fraction
of outside directors on boards and the level of institutional stock ownership have increased since
the 1970s (Huson, Parrino, and Starks, 2001), while CEO turnovers have become more frequent
(Kaplan and Minton, 2011) and closely linked to rm performance (Jenter and Lewellen, 2017).
Although these trends are suggestive, there is no direct evidence that changes in governance
caused the surge in CEO pay or that added pressure on CEOs can account for the magnitude
of the pay increase. In the cross-section, Peters and Wagner (2014) show that more volatile
industry conditions are associated with more CEO dismissals and higher CEO pay, consistent
with CEOs being compensated for turnover risk.


3.2.    The Sensitivity of Pay
We now turn from determining the level of pay to the CEOs incentives. As with any survey,
we are forced to draw boundaries. We focus on moral hazard, rather than adverse selection,
as the moral hazard literature is more extensive. For learning models of CEO contracts, where
either the CEOs general ability or his speci c match quality with a rm is initially unknown to
both sides, we refer the reader to Harris and Holmström (1982), Gibbons and Murphy (1992),
Holmström (1999), Hermalin and Weisbach (1998, 2012), Taylor (2010, 2013), Garrett and
Pavan (2012), and the survey by Hermalin and Weisbach (2017).
    This section considers a single-period moral hazard model; we consider multiple periods in
Section 3.7. This setting has been widely covered in textbooks (e.g., Bolton and Dewatripont
(2005), Tirole (2006)) and earlier surveys (Prendergast, 1999), but typically with additive pro-
duction functions and preferences, and often a binary e¤ort level. We show that multiplicative
speci cations, which may be particularly relevant for the CEO setting, lead to quite di¤er-
ent conclusions for the best empirical measure of incentives and how incentives should vary
cross-sectionally between rms.
    We start with a standard principal-agent problem applied to an executive compensation
setting. The principal (board of directors on behalf of shareholders) hires an agent (CEO) to
run the rm. The production function is given by V (a; S; "), which is increasing in the CEOs
action a and rm size S. Suppressing the dependence on S and " for brevity, we specialize this



                                               36
to
                                           V (a) = S + b (S) a + ":                                            (5)

    We consider an all-equity rm for simplicity and discuss leverage in Section 3.6. The variable
a 2 [0; 1) is an action taken by the CEO that improves expected rm value but is personally
costly. Examples include e¤ort (low a represents shirking), project choice (low a involves
selecting value-destructive projects that maximize private bene ts), or rent extraction (low a
reects cash ow diversion.) We typically refer to a as e¤ort for brevity. The variable " is
mean-zero noise, with interval support on ("; "), where the bounds may be in nite.23 Shortly
after the CEO takes his action, noise and then nal rm value V are realized. Firm value is
observable and contractible, but neither e¤ort nor noise are individually observable.
    The function b (S) measures the e¤ect of e¤ort on rm value for a rm of size S. One
possibility is b (S) = b, which yields V (a) = S + ba + ": an additive production function where
the e¤ect of e¤ort on rm value is independent of rm size. This speci cation is appropriate
for a perk consumption decision, if the amount of perks that can be consumed is independent
of rm size. For example, buying a $10 million corporate jet reduces rm value by $10 million,
regardless of S. Another possibility is b (S) = bS, which yields V (a) = S (1 + ba) + ": a
multiplicative production function where the e¤ect of e¤ort on rm value is linear in rm size.
Many CEO actions can be rolled out across the entire rm and thus have a greater e¤ect in
a larger company, such as a change in strategy or a program to improve production e¢ciency.
A multiplicative speci cation is also appropriate for a rent extraction setting, if there are more
resources to extract in a larger rm.
    The CEO is paid a wage c (V ) contingent upon rm value. We always assume limited
liability on the principal (c (V )  V ): she cannot pay out more than total rm value. In
some versions of the model we also assume limited liability on the CEO (c (V )  0). He has
reservation utility of w  0 and his objective function is given by24 :

                                        E [U ] = E [u (v (c)     g (a))] :                                     (6)

The function g represents the cost of e¤ort, which is increasing and weakly convex, where
g (0) = 0. u is the utility function and v is the felicity25 function that denotes the CEOs utility
from cash; both are increasing and weakly concave. g, u, and v are all twice continuously
di¤erentiable. The objective function (6) contains functions for both utility and felicity to
maximize generality. One common assumption is v(c) = c so that E [U ] = E [u (c g (a))], in
which case the cost of e¤ort is pecuniary, i.e., can be expressed as a subtraction to cash pay.
This is appropriate if e¤ort involves a nancial expenditure or the opportunity cost of forgoing
  23
      For simplicity, we assume that S is su¢ciently large, or the probability of low " is su¢ciently small, that V
is non-negative almost surely and so we do not need to complicate the model with non-negativity constraints.
   24
      Note that w refers to the expected wage, while c refers to actual pay.
   25
      The term felicity is typically used to denote one-period utility in an intertemporal model. We use it in a
non-standard manner here to distinguish it from the utility function u.

an alternative income-generating activity. Another is u (x) = x, which yields E [v (c) g (a)],
where the cost of e¤ort is separable from the bene ts of cash. This speci cation is reasonable
if e¤ort involves disutility, or forgoing leisure or private bene ts.
    Both of the above speci cations represent additive preferences. E¤ort of a reduces the
CEOs utility by g (a) in dollars (utils) in the rst (second) speci cation. A third speci cation
                                                                                           
is v (c) = ln c, in which case (6) becomes, after a slight change in notation, E u(ce g(a) ) .26 This
speci cation corresponds to multiplicative preferences, where the cost of e¤ort is increasing in c.
Here, private bene ts are a normal good: the utility they provide is increasing in consumption,
consistent with the treatment of most goods and services in consumer theory. This speci cation
is also plausible under the literal interpretation of e¤ort as forgoing leisure: a day of vacation
is more valuable to a richer CEO, as he has more wealth to enjoy during it. Thus, the CEOs
expenditure on leisure and private bene ts rises in proportion to his wealth. Multiplicative
preferences are also commonly used in macroeconomic models (e.g., Cooley and Prescott (1995))
to generate realistic income e¤ects. In particular, they are necessary for labor supply to be
constant over time as the hourly wage rises.27
    The principal is assumed to be risk-neutral, since shareholders are typically well-diversi ed.
Her program is given by:

                                 max E [V (a)      c (V (a))] s.t.                                          (7)

                                                                         a))] :                             (9)

She chooses the e¤ort level a and contract c (V )28 to maximize (7), expected rm value minus the
expected wage, subject to the CEOs individual rationality or participation constraint (IR,
(8)) and incentive compatibility constraint (IC, (9)).
    Consider the rst-best benchmark where e¤ort is observable. Let a be the e¤ort level that
the principal wishes to implement. She can simply direct the CEO to exert e¤ort a , and so
we can ignore the IC (9). It is easy to show that the CEO is given a constant wage c (V ) = c,
as this leads to e¢cient risk-sharing. The IR (8) yields c  w + g (a ). This will bind in the
  26
                                                                        
      With v (c) = ln c, (6) becomes E [u (ln c g (a))] = E u ln ceg(a) . We remove the ln as it is a monotonic
transformation.
   27
      When the hourly wage rises, working becomes preferable to leisure (the substitution e¤ect). With multi-
plicative preferences, the rise in the wage increases the agents labor endowment income and thus demand for
leisure (the income e¤ect), which exactly o¤sets the substitution e¤ect. With additive preferences, there is no
income e¤ect, and so leisure falls to zero as the wage increases.
   28
      Here, we focus on deterministic contracts, so that there is a one-to-one mapping between rm value V and
compensation c. An even more general model allows for stochastic contracts, where rm value of V leads to a
random amount c. Gjesdal (1982), Arnott and Stiglitz (1988), and Edmans and Gabaix (2011b) derive su¢cient
conditions for random contracts to be suboptimal, allowing the focus on deterministic ones.

                                      E [V (a )]       g (a )     w:                           (10)

This de nes the rst-best e¤ort level as

                                          g 0 (aF B ) = b (S) :                                (11)

The principal trades o¤ the marginal increase in rm value from e¤ort, b (S), with the CEOs
marginal cost, g 0 (aF B ). Thus, aF B maximizes total surplus. In turn, aF B is decreasing in the
convexity of the cost of e¤ort. It is also increasing in rm size S if b (S) is increasing in S, since
e¤ort then has a greater dollar e¤ect in a larger rm.

3.2.1.   Risk-Neutral Agent

We now turn to a setting in which e¤ort is unobservable and the IC (9) must be imposed. We
 rst consider risk neutrality and additive preferences. We have u (x) = x and v (c) = c so the
IR (8) and IC (9) specialize to

                                   E [c (V )]       g (a)  w                                   (12)

   Grossman and Hart (1983) show that the contracting problem can be solved in two stages,
which correspond to the principals two choice variables. She rst chooses the contract c (V )
that implements a given action a at least cost, and then the optimal a taking into account
the cost of the contract c (V ) needed to implement each action a . Starting with the rst stage,
the rst-order condition of the CEOs e¤ort choice (13) is given by

                                         0               0  
                                     E [c (V ) b (S)] = g (a ) .                                (14)

Rogerson (1985), Jewitt (1988), Carroll (2012), and Jung and Kim (2015) give conditions under
which the rst-order condition is su¢cient, and so the IC (13) can be replaced by the rst-order
condition (14), which greatly simpli es the problem. Throughout this paper, we assume that
these conditions are satis ed, so that the rst-order approach is valid.
   Given risk neutrality and unlimited liability for the CEO, there is no loss of generality in
focusing on a linear contract of the form c (V ) =  + V , where  is the xed wage and  is the
CEOs e¤ective percentage ownership. Then, using (14), in order to implement e¤ort of a , the
CEOs incentives must be such that, at a , the marginal bene t of e¤ort equals the marginal
cost:
                                         b (S) = g 0 (a ) :                               (15)



                                                     39
    A sizeable empirical literature tries to measure CEOs incentives to improve rm value, i.e.,
to exert e¤ort a . This is given by the left-hand side of (15), the CEOs marginal bene t from
increasing rm value. Equation (15) shows how the optimal measure of incentives depends
on how we specify the CEOs production function. When it is additive (b (S) = b), then to
implement a given e¤ort level a , the rm must set correctly the incentive measure , the
CEOs percentage stake in rm value V . This measure corresponds to the e¤ective percentage
ownership reported in Section 2.3  the dollar change in pay for a one dollar change in rm
value ($-$ incentives).29
    Many important CEO actions have a multiplicative, instead of additive, e¤ect on rm
value. With a multiplicative production function (b (S) = bS), we have bS = g 0 (a ), and so
the relevant incentive measure is S, the CEOs dollar stake. This measure corresponds to the
e¤ective dollar ownership reported in Section 2.3  the dollar change in pay for a one percentage
point change in rm value ($-% incentives). Thus, while it is common to assume an additive
production function for simplicity, researchers should think carefully about this choice, as it
has important implications for the relevant measure of incentives  a point rst noted by Baker
and Hall (2004).
    We now consider multiplicative preferences, as studied by Edmans, Gabaix, and Landier
(2009). In the general objective function (6), their speci cation corresponds to u (x) = ex and
v (c) = ln c, which yields
                                                  g(a) 
                                       E [U ] = E ce       .

    We normalize a = 0, and so the t = 0 stock price (net of CEO pay) is S.30 We also assume
b (S) = bS, i.e., a multiplicative production function, so that rm value at t = 1 is given by:

                                         V (a) = S (1 + ba) + ".

The IR is given by E [cja = a ] = w, which yields:

                           w = [cja = a ] =  + E [V ja = a ] =  + S.

If the CEO exerts e¤ort a, his utility is:
                                               g(a)
                                                                                  g(a)
                       E [U (a)] = E c (a) e               = ( +  E [V (a)]) e
                                 = ( + S (1 + ba)) e g(a) = (w + Sba) e g(a)
                                               
                                           Sb
                                               a e g(a) = weln(1+ w a) g(a) .
                                                                   Sb
                                 =w 1+
                                            w
  29
      The empirical literature focuses on CEOs percentage equity ownership, not their percentage ownership of
total rm value (equity plus debt). Gabaix, Landier, and Sauvagnat (2014) discuss which measure of rm scale
is appropriate under di¤erent assumptions about the CEOs production function.
   30
      For simplicity, we assume that initial rm size S is net of the expected wage w.




                                                           40
The IC is a 2 arg maxa E [U (a)]. At a = 0, this yields E [U 0 (0)] = 0, i.e.,

                                            S   g 0 (a )
                                               =           :                                   (16)
                                            w        b

Thus, to implement a given e¤ort level a , the rm must set correctly the incentive measure S   w
                                                                                                   ,
i.e., the CEOs dollar equity stake scaled by his annual pay, or alternatively the fraction of total
pay w that is in equity. It corresponds to the percentage change in pay for a one percentage
point change in rm value (%-% incentives, i.e., the elasticity of pay to rm value), as used
by Murphy (1985), Gibbons and Murphy (1992), and Rosen (1992).
     Using I , II , and III , respectively, to denote %-%, $-$, and $-% incentives, we have:

                                          @c 1        ln Pay
                                   I =        =                                               (17)

where r = V =S 1 is the rms stock market return. In our one-period model, the CEOs
incentives  can arises from new grants of stock and options, plus changes in cash pay (salary
and bonuses). Thus, these incentive measures are referred to as pay-performance sensitivity.
As discussed in Section 2.3, the vast majority of incentives stem from changes in the value of
previously granted stock and options, which swamp changes in cash pay. Replacing ow pay c
in the numerator of expressions (17) to (19) with the CEOs wealth W yields analogous expres-
sions for wealth-performance sensitivity, the change in the CEOs entire wealth (including
previously granted stock and options) for a change in rm performance:

                          is the percentage change in wealth for a one percentage point change in
the stock return, scaled by annual pay, which Edmans, Gabaix, and Landier (2009) call scaled
wealth-performance sensitivity. Section 3.3 below predicts how the three incentive measures
should scale with rm size under di¤erent assumptions about utility and production functions.
Section 3.3.2 reviews the corresponding evidence, which is most consistent with multiplicative
utility and production functions.
    The table below illustrates how the production and cost functions a¤ect the relevant measure
of incentives:

    We now solve for the second stage of Grossman and Hart (1983), i.e., the optimal e¤ort
level, returning to the case of additive preferences. If the CEO exhibits unlimited liability,
the principal can always adjust xed pay  so that the participation constraint (12) binds.
Thus, his expected pay is E [c (V )] = w + g (a ), just as in the rst-best, and so the principals
objective function remains (10). As a result, she implements the rst-best e¤ort level, de ned
by (11). Using (11) and (14), the optimal contract satis es

                                          0
                                      E [c (V ) b (S)] = b (S) .                                (23)

With a linear contract (c (V ) =  + V ), this yields  = 1 and so the optimal contract is given
by
                                     c (V ) =  + V , where                                  (24)

                                   = w + g (a )      S   b (S) a .                           (25)

     The principal e¤ectively sells the rm V to the CEO for an up-front fee of , chosen
so that the participation constraint (12) binds. Since the CEO bene ts one-for-one from any
increase in rm value, he fully internalizes the bene ts of e¤ort and the rst-best e¤ort level
aF B is achieved. The level of incentives is one size ts all: regardless of the cost or production
function, we have  = 1.
     In the above framework, the e¤ort level aF B is endogenous  the principal implements
whatever e¤ort level is implied by  = 1. One simple way to obtain meaningful contracts that
do di¤er across rms is to consider a binary e¤ort decision, a 2 fa; ag where the principal
implements a, as in Holmström and Tirole (1997), Edmans, Gabaix, and Landier (2009), Biais
et al. (2010), and the textbook of Tirole (2006). A similar speci cation is a continuous but
bounded action space, a 2 [a; a], where again the principal wishes to implement a. The upper
bound reects the fact that there may be a limit to the number of actions that a CEO can take
to increase rm value. The high e¤ort level a represents full productive e¢ciency, rather than
working 24 hours a day. In a cash ow diversion model, full productive e¢ciency corresponds
to zero stealing; in a project selection model, it corresponds to taking all positive net present
value (NPV) projects while rejecting negative-NPV ones; in an e¤ort model, it corresponds
to the CEO not deliberately forgoing a value-increasing action because it would involve too
much e¤ort. Then, from equations (15) and (16), the optimal incentive level is b (S) = g 0 (a)


                                                  42
if utility is additive and b(S)
                              w
                                  = g 0 (a) if utility is multiplicative.31 Thus, the optimal level of
incentives ($-$, $-%, or %-% depending on the model speci cation) is increasing in the cost of
e¤ort g 0 (a). Intuitively, where e¤ort is more costly, stronger incentives are needed to implement
a given e¤ort level. Incentives are higher in rms with greater agency problems, rather than
one size ts all.
    The rst-best is still achieved in the xed-action setting. In reality, the rst-best cannot
be achieved for two reasons. First, the CEO may be subject to limited liability (c (V )  0).
Under contract (24), the CEO will receive a negative payo¤ if V is su¢ciently low, violating
limited liability. Put di¤erently, the CEO may not have enough cash to buy the rm. Innes
(1990) shows that the optimal contract is an option on rm value in this case. Second, he may
be risk-averse and demand a premium for bearing the risk associated with rm value V . We
now analyze this case.

3.2.2.   Risk-Averse Agent

Under the general utility function (6), and returning to general (rather than linear) contracts,
the CEOs rst-order condition is given by:

                                  0      0     0
                              E [u () (v (c) c (V ) b (S)   g 0 (a ))] = 0.                       (26)

Even assuming a given implemented action a , the contracting problem remains di¢cult because
equation (26) only requires the contract to satisfy the CEOs incentive constraint on average:
The CEOs average expected marginal bene t from e¤ort, E [u0 ()v 0 (c) c0 (V ) b (S)], must equal
the average marginal cost of e¤ort, E [u0 ()g 0 (a )]. There are many potential contracts that will
satisfy this constraint on average. This makes the principals problem complex as she must
solve for the one contract out of this continuum that minimizes the expected wage.

3.2.3.   Holmström-Milgrom Framework

Holmström and Milgrom (1987, HM) show that the contracting problem becomes substan-
tially simpler if four assumptions are made. First, the CEO exhibits exponential utility, so
u (x) = e x , where  is the coe¢cient of absolute risk aversion. Second, the cost of e¤ort is
pecuniary, so v (c) = c. Third, the noise " is Normal, i.e., "  N (0;  2 ). Fourth, they consider
a multi-period model where the CEO chooses his e¤ort every instant in continuous time. Under
these assumptions, HM show that the optimal contract is linear, i.e., c =  + V , and that the
problem is equivalent to a single-period static problem. The intuition is that a linear contract
subjects the CEO to a constant dollar incentive pressure irrespective of the history of past
performance, and a constant dollar incentive pressure equates to a constant utility incentive
  31
    When a is a boundary action, the IC becomes an inequality and a continuum of contracts will implement
a = a. We choose the contract that involves the minimum amount of incentives, as this is optimal for any
non-zero level of risk aversion, and so the IC continues to bind.


                                                    43
pressure since exponential utility removes wealth e¤ects. This result suggests that incentives
should be implemented purely with stock, and not non-linear instruments such as options.
   If we also assume a quadratic cost function (g (a) = 21 ga2 ) for simplicity, the principals
problem becomes:

                                    max E [V c]                                                             (27)

    that the CEO requires. This risk premium is increasing in the CEOs risk aversion ,
risk  2 , and incentives . From (30), the CEOs rst-order condition is given by

His e¤ort choice is independent of risk  2 and risk aversion , since noise is additive. It is also
independent of the xed wage , since exponential utility removes wealth e¤ects. Thus,  can
be adjusted to satisfy the CEOs participation constraint without a¤ecting his incentives.
    Setting the participation constraint (28) to bind, evaluating the expectation on the left-hand

    Optimal incentives  are a trade-o¤ between two forces. A sharper contract increases e¤ort
a = b(S)
        g
            and thus rm value, but also increases disutility 21 ga2 and the risk premium 2 2  2 .
Thus,  is decreasing in risk aversion  and risk  2 as these augment the required risk premium.
The e¤ect of the cost of e¤ort g is more nuanced. On the one hand, xing a , the required
                    a g
incentives are  = b(S)  and increase in g. On the other hand, when e¤ort is costlier to implement
(g is higher), the optimal e¤ort level a is lower. The second e¤ect dominates: when e¤ort is
costlier, an increase in  leads to a smaller rise in e¤ort, and so the optimal  falls. (Since the
bene t of e¤ort b() has the opposite e¤ect of the cost of e¤ort g, we discuss only the latter
throughout). Equation (33) also highlights that the relevant measure of risk for determining
incentives depends on the production function. With a multiplicative production function
(b (S) = S), the relevant measure of risk is S , the volatility of the rms percentage returns;
with an additive production function it is , the volatility of the rms dollar returns.
    To nd xed pay , we set the participation constraint to bind (b     c (a) = w). This yields

                                               1 (b (S))2  2 2
                              =w       S                +   .
                                               2     g     2

The comparative statics for  are ambiguous. On the one hand, a higher cost of e¤ort g,
higher risk aversion , and higher risk  2 increase the required xed pay  as a compensating
di¤erential (i.e., to ensure the IR remains satis ed). On the other hand, these changes also
reduce the optimal level of incentives (from (33)), which lowers the risk premium.
    The HM framework is attractive for a number of reasons. First, it derives (rather than
assumes) a linear contract as being optimal. Second, it solves for not only the optimal contract
to implement a given e¤ort level, but also the optimal e¤ort level, i.e., both stages of Grossman
and Hart (1983). Third, the xed salary  does not a¤ect the CEOs e¤ort choice. Thus,
changes in reservation utility can be simply met by varying , without changing incentives.
However, HM stress that a number of assumptions were necessary for their linearity result:
exponential utility, a pecuniary cost of e¤ort, Normal noise, and continuous time. Hellwig and
Schmidt (2002) show that linearity continues to hold in discrete time under two additional
assumptions: the principal does not observe the time path of pro ts (only the total pro t in



                                                  45
the nal period), and the CEO can destroy pro ts before he reports them to the principal.32

3.2.4.     Fixed Target Action

In HM, the e¤ort level a = b(S)  g
                                       is chosen endogenously. As described in Section 3.2.1, an
alternative speci cation is for the action space to be bounded above by a and the principal to
implement a xed target action a. The optimal contract is now b (S) = ga, which leads to very
di¤erent empirical implications. The level of incentives b (S) arises from the desire to induce
e¤ort a, and not any trade-o¤ with disutility or risk. Thus, only the rst e¤ect of g exists  a
higher cost of e¤ort raises the incentives required to induce a  and so incentives are increasing
in g, in contrast to HM. They are also increasing in the target e¤ort a, but independent of 
and  2 , since the contract is not determined by any trade-o¤ with these parameters. Consistent
with this, the cross-sectional correlations shown in Section 2.3.2 and prior studies (surveyed in
Section 3.2.5) suggest that the empirical relationship between risk and incentives is complex
and ambiguous.
    If the xed action model accurately represents reality, it has the attractive practical impli-
cation that incentives do not depend on the CEOs risk aversion, which is typically hard to
observe. In addition, we now have unambiguous predictions for how increases in risk  2 and
risk aversion  a¤ect the level of pay. There is now only the direct e¤ect, that pay rises as
a compensating di¤erential, but no indirect e¤ect because these parameters do not a¤ect the
optimal e¤ort level. Consistent with this, the evidence in Section 2.1.1 shows a strong positive
correlation between volatility and the level of pay.
    Whether the endogenous or xed action model is more realistic depends on the setting. In
many cases, the endogenous action case is more accurate as principals choose to implement less-
than-full e¤ort to save on wages. For example, a factory boss may only require a production
operative to work an eight-hour day, to avoid paying overtime. However, for CEOs, a xed
action may be more appropriate. Edmans and Gabaix (2011b) show that, if CEO e¤ort has a
multiplicative e¤ect on rm value, implementing full productive e¢ciency a is optimal if the
  rm is large enough. (The result holds for any unboundedly increasing function b (S)). The
bene ts of e¤ort are a function of rm size; the cost of e¤ort (a higher wage to compensate
for risk and disutility) is a function of the CEOs reservation wage w. Thus, if S is su¢ciently
large compared to w, the bene ts of e¤ort dominate the trade-o¤ and it is optimal to induce
full productive e¢ciency regardless of g,  or  2 . For example, in a $10bn rm, if implementing
e¤ort level a  rather than a reduces rm value by only 0:1%, this translates into $10m. If
the CEOs salary is $10m, then even if salary can be reduced by 50% by allowing the CEO to
exert only a , implementing a remains optimal. The xed action model more likely applies
to CEOs than rank-and- le employees, who have a more limited e¤ect on rm value.
    The overall point that we would like to stress is not that one model is superior to the other.
 32
      See Edmans and Gabaix (2016) for a discussion of the role played by the rst three assumptions.



                                                      46
Di¤erent models apply to di¤erent scenarios. Rather, we wish to highlight how a contracting
models empirical implications hinge critically on the assumptions  whether we specify mul-
tiplicative versus additive production or preference functions, or a xed versus endogenously
chosen action. Sometimes, researchers may assume a binary action space or additive functions
out of convenience, but these modeling choices can lead to vastly di¤erent predictions.

3.2.5.   Evidence

We now turn to tests of the empirical predictions of these models.
Level of Incentives. Section 2.3.1 shows CEOs and other top executives e¤ective percentage
ownership ($-$ incentives) in the 50 largest U.S. rms for 1936-2005 and in S&P 500 rms for
1992-2014. The level of percentage ownership is small throughout. The typical S&P 500 CEO
has an e¤ective percentage ownership of only 0.37% in 1992, which decreases to 0.34% by
2014. Jensen and Murphy (1990a), who measure incentives in large publicly traded U.S. rms
from 1974 to 1986, nd an average ownership percentage of 0.325%. Motivated by traditional
additive models, they interpret this stake as too low to be reconciled with optimal contracting,
and thus conclude that CEOs are paid like bureaucrats. However, to make this assessment,
we need to compare this stake to the sensitivity predicted by a model. Even if we assume an
additive model (and so $-$ incentives are relevant), theory predicts that incentives should be
 ga            1
b(S)
      or               2 , but parameters such as the cost of e¤ort g are di¢cult to quantify. Haubrich
         1+g ( b(S)
                 
                     )
(1994) suggests that the magnitudes found in Section 2.3.1 and by Jensen and Murphy (1990a)
can be optimal if the CEO is su¢ciently risk-averse, but attaches wide con dence intervals to
his conclusion given the di¢culties in calibration.
     If CEO e¤ort has a multiplicative e¤ect on rm value, it is dollar ownership ($-% incentives),
rather than percentage ownership, that is relevant. Section 2.3.1 also reports CEOs and other
executives e¤ective dollar ownership. Even though executives percentage ownership is small,
their dollar ownership is large  the e¤ective dollar ownership of the median S&P 500 CEO was
$19 million in 1992 and $67 million in 2014. This means that CEOs stand to gain millions from
good rm performance and lose millions from poor performance, a point rst made by Hall and
Liebman (1998). High dollar ownership and low percentage ownership suggest that CEOs are
well motivated to take actions with a multiplicative e¤ect on rm value (e.g., reorganizing the
  rm), but badly motivated to take actions with additive e¤ects (e.g., refraining from consuming
perks). Edmans, Gabaix, and Landier (2009) suggest that these additive actions are best
corrected via direct monitoring, rather than incentives.
Cross-Sectional Variation in Incentives. Given the di¢culties of quantifying parameters
such as g to calculate the optimal level of incentives, incentive theories are typically tested
instead in terms of their cross-sectional predictions  whether they vary with parameters such
as S, g,  and  2 as predicted. It is important for empirical tests to study the precise measure
of incentives predicted by the theory. For example, if the theory is a multiplicative model that

                                                  47
predicts how the dollar equity stake S varies with g, , and  2 , studying the percentage stake 
is not a valid test of the model as these parameters vary with rm size S. Similarly, depending
on the production function, the relevant measure of risk may be the volatility of the rms
percentage returns or of its dollar returns .
    We start with HMs prediction that incentives  are decreasing in risk . While Lambert
and Larcker (1987), Aggarwal and Samwick (1999a), and Jin (2002) nd a negative relation-
ship, Core and Guay (1999), Oyer and Schaefer (2005), and Coles, Daniel, and Naveen (2006)
document a positive one, and Garen (1994), Yermack (1995), Bushman, Indjejikian, and Smith
(1996), Ittner, Larcker, and Rajan (1997), Conyon and Murphy (2000), Edmans, Gabaix, and
Landier (2009), and Cheng, Hong, and Scheinkman (2015) show either no relationship or mixed
results. The mixed results arise, in part, because of di¤erences in the measurement of incentives
(e¤ective percentage versus dollar ownership) and risk (Aggarwal and Samwick (1999a) and Jin
(2002) study the volatility of dollar returns; the other papers study percentage returns).
    Our own empirical analysis in Section 2.3.2 con rms the mixed results. We nd a positive
correlation between percentage volatility and CEOs percentage ownership, a negative correla-
tion between dollar volatility and percentage ownership, and no correlation between percentage
volatility and dollar ownership (once we control for stock return performance and industry).
Thus, the evidence points to a fairly weak relationship between risk and incentives. The xed
action model provides a potential explanation: risk is second-order compared to the bene ts of
e¤ort  it is incentive considerations, not risk considerations, that determine the slope of the
contract.
    Alternatively, volatility might be correlated with other rm characteristics that a¤ect the
optimal level of incentives. For example, Smith and Watts (1992) argue that growth oppor-
tunities make it di¢cult for shareholders to know the value maximizing strategy and thus to
know whether executives are choosing it. Shareholders might react by increasing executives
equity incentives in growth rms, which tend to also have high volatility. In the same vein,
Demsetz and Lehn (1985) and Prendergast (2002) argue that more risky and uncertain en-
vironments increase shareholders monitoring costs. Hence, if incentives and monitoring are
substitutes, volatility might reduce the optimal level of monitoring and increase the optimal
level of incentives.
    The prediction that  is decreasing in risk aversion  is harder to test as risk aversion is
unobservable. Becker (2006) uses data on CEO wealth, available in Sweden, as a (negative)
proxy for risk aversion under the assumption of decreasing absolute risk aversion. As predicted,
he nds that wealth is positively related to both percentage ownership ($-$ incentives) and
dollar ownership ($-% incentives), although the results are only signi cant at the 10% level.33
However, wealth can a¤ect incentives through channels other than risk aversion. In the Edmans
  33
    HM assume constant absolute risk aversion utility, so risk aversion is independent of wealth. Sannikov
(2008) allows for general utility functions, and thus for absolute risk aversion to decrease in wealth, and generally
predicts that incentives fall with risk aversion by the same intuition as in HM.

and Gabaix (2011b) xed action model, the contract is not driven by a trade-o¤ with risk
aversion. Higher wealth instead reduces the CEOs marginal utility from money, and so greater
incentives are required to induce him to work.
Cross-Sectional Variation in Pay Levels. The theories also make predictions for expected
pay E [c], usually measured as the level of pay in empirical studies. Firm risk and the cost
of e¤ort have an ambiguous e¤ect on the level of pay in the HM model, but increase it in
the xed action model due to the required compensating di¤erential. Garen (1994) shows
that salaries are insigni cantly increasing in rm risk as measured by dollar volatility, and
insigni cantly decreasing in percentage volatility. Cheng, Hong, and Scheinkman (2015) nd a
signi cant positive relationship between total pay and percentage volatility for nancial rms.
Our empirical analysis in Section 2.1.1 shows a strong positive relationship between volatility
and pay for all rms.
    Greater agency problems in large rms may necessitate higher equity incentives and thus
more pay as a risk premium (Gayle and Miller, 2009). Our analyses in Sections 2.1.1 and
2.3.2 con rm that rm size is strongly positively related to both CEO pay levels and their
e¤ective dollar ownership. Conyon, Core, and Guay (2011) and Fernandes, Ferreira, Matos,
and Murphy (2013) compare CEO pay in the U.S. to the rest of the world and argue that
the pay premium to U.S. CEOs is justi ed by their greater equity exposure. Similarly, the
structural estimation of Gayle, Golan, and Miller (2015) suggests that risk premia can explain
over 80% of the pay di¤erential between small and large rms. Risk premia di¤erences arise
in their model both because large rms require greater incentives to address moral hazard, but
also because stock returns are a poorer signal of e¤ort in large rms. It is an open question
whether pay di¤erentials between small and large rms are mostly due to stronger incentives
in larger rms, as argued by Gayle, Golan, and Miller (2015), or due to talent matching, as
argued by Gabaix and Landier (2008).


3.3.     Incentives in Market Equilibrium
3.3.1.   Theory

Section 3.2 has taken the reservation wage w as given. We now endogenize w using the as-
signment model of Gabaix and Landier (2008) to study how CEO incentives vary across rms
in market equilibrium. We use the Edmans, Gabaix, and Landier (2009) framework of a risk-
neutral CEO, multiplicative preferences and a xed target action, as in Section 3.2.1, with
a = a. We will show that even this simple model leads to predictions consistent with empirical
  ndings. (Edmans and Gabaix (2011a) extend the model to risk aversion.)
    From (16), we have  = w
                            S
                               where  = g 0 (a ). The xed salary  is chosen so that the IR
binds, i.e.,  = w S = w (1 ). Thus, the CEO in rm n is given a xed salary  , and




                                              49
S worth of shares, with:

                                    n Sn = w (n) ;                                       (34)
                                       n = w (n) (1   ) ;                                (35)

where w (n) is given by equation (4) from Section 3.1.1. Thus, a fraction  of the equilibrium
wage is paid in equity, and the remainder is paid in cash.
   We can now solve for the three incentive measures in equations (17)-(19) in terms of model
primitives:

                                        I =  / S 0                                       (36)
                                              w
                                       II =  / S     1
                                                                                           (37)
                                              S
                                       III
                                       = w / S  ;                                       (38)

    Equation (16) earlier suggested that, in a multiplicative model, the correct incentive mea-
sure is I (%-% incentives) since it determines the implemented e¤ort level. Equation (36)
illustrates a related advantage: in a multiplicative model, I is independent of rm size and
thus comparable across rms of di¤erent size. This comparability is useful. For example, a
passive investor who believes that incentives are not fully priced in the market may wish to
invest in a stock with high CEO incentives; an activist investor may wish to target a rm
with low incentives. However, if the CEO of a large rm has $2m of equity and the CEO of a
smaller rm has $1m of equity, we cannot conclude which CEO is better incentivized as dollar
equity holdings optimally increase with rm size. Comparability is also valuable for boards or
compensation consultants undertaking benchmarking analyses.
    While %-% incentives should be independent of size, with  =          = = 1=3 as in Gabaix
and Landier (2008), equation (37) shows that $-$ incentives (i.e., the e¤ective percentage own-
ership) should have a rm-size elasticity of  1 = 2=3. If e¤ort has a multiplicative e¤ect
on rm value, it has a higher dollar e¤ect in a larger rm, and so a lower percentage stake is
needed to induce e¤ort. In addition, equation (38) shows that $-% incentives (i.e., the e¤ective
dollar ownership) should have an elasticity of  = 1=3. Larger rms hire more talented CEOs
who command higher wages. Since the bene ts of shirking are higher, given multiplicative
preferences, a higher dollar equity stake is needed to induce e¤ort.
    In addition to how incentives scale with rm size, equations (36) and (37) also have im-
plications for the absolute level of incentives. $-$ incentives (e¤ective percentage ownership)
are given by II = I wS . Since rm size S is substantially larger than the CEOs wage w, $-$
incentives should be low. Especially for large rms, the dollar bene ts of e¤ort are likely to be
much greater than the disutility cost to the CEO, and so only a small equity stake is needed
to induce e¤ort.



                                              50
3.3.2.   Evidence

In a multiplicative model, CEO e¤ort has a larger dollar e¤ect in a bigger rm, so a smaller
percentage equity stake is required to induce e¤ort. A negative correlation between rm size and
CEOs e¤ective percentage ownership has been documented by Jensen and Murphy (1990a),
Garen (1994), Schaefer (1998), Baker and Hall (2004), and many others. Edmans, Gabaix,
and Landier (2009) quantitatively predict a rm-size elasticity of 2=3, consistent with their
empirical estimate of 0:61. Similarly, Edmans, Gabaix, and Landier (2009) nd that %-%
incentives are independent of rm size, and that e¤ective dollar ownership ($-% incentives) has
a size-elasticity of 0:39, close to the predicted value of 1=3. These results suggest that a model
with multiplicative utility and production functions can quantitatively explain the size-scalings
of incentives.
    Our own analysis in Section 2.3.2 nds a less negative rm-size elasticity of CEOs percent-
age ownership of about -0.35, and a more positive rm-size elasticity of CEOs dollar ownership
of about 0.55. There are two reasons for these di¤erences: First, our analysis includes large-cap,
medium-cap, and small-cap rms, while Edmans, Gabaix, and Landiers estimates are for the
largest 500 rms in each year only, consistent with the models use of extreme value theory. Sec-
ond, we measure CEOs percentage ownership as percentage of equity, while Edmans, Gabaix,
and Landier measure it as percentage of aggregate rm value. Hence, the di¤erences suggest
that CEOs e¤ective dollar (percentage) ownership increases less fast (decreases faster) with
  rm size for larger rms, and that these rm-size elasticities change with corporate leverage.


3.4.     Additional Performance Signals and Relative Performance Eval-
         uation
The informativeness principle of Holmström (1979) states that any signal that is incremen-
tally informative about the CEOs e¤ort should be included in his contract. This result has two
implications: First, signals correlated with performance components unrelated to the CEOs ac-
tions can be used to remove noise and improve the informativeness of the performance measure.
Second, the use of signals that are directly correlated with CEOs actions, such as accounting
earnings or sales, can improve incentive contracts. We discuss both mechanisms in this section.

3.4.1.   Relative Performance Evaluation: Theory

When deducing executive actions from rm performance, the principal should ignore, or lter
out, performance components caused by factors beyond the executives control, such as the
state of the overall economy (Holmström, 1979; Holmström, 1982; Diamond and Verrecchia,
1982). Hence, if CEOs performance is a¤ected by common exogenous shocks, CEOs should be
evaluated on the basis of their performance relative to their peer group. Peer performance is
informative about the degree to which high rm value V is due to high e¤ort or due to good


                                               51
luck and allows ltering luck from the performance signal.
    Motivated by evidence showing at best incomplete relative performance evaluation (RPE)
in executive pay, the literature has proposed several theories that explain incomplete bench-
marking as an e¢cient contracting outcome. Aggarwal and Samwick (1999b) argue that the
desire to soften competition in oligopolistic industries generates compensation contracts that
place positive weight on rival rm performance. Hansen and Lott (1996) and Antón, Ederer,
Giné, and Schmalz (2017) suggest that investors who own stakes in multiple rms in the same
industry strengthen this e¤ect. Jin (2002), Jenter (2002), and Garvey and Milbourn (2003)
suggest that benchmarking performance against industry peers or the market is unnecessary if
executives can trade the industry or market index. Barro and Barro (1990) and Himmelberg
and Hubbard (2000) propose that the marginal product of CEO talent and e¤ort, and therefore
CEOs equilibrium pay, covaries positively with industry and market conditions. Oyer (2004)
suggests a model where adjusting compensation contracts is costly and executives outside op-
portunities are correlated with market conditions. Paying executives with standard, nonindexed
equity instruments allows the value of their pay to vary with their outside opportunities, saving
on renegotiation costs. Dye (1992) and Gopalan, Milbourn, and Song (2010) argue that not in-
dexing an executive to industry performance induces him to choose the rms industry exposure
optimally. In Ho¤mann and Pfeil (2010), a positive shock indicates high future pro tability
and makes termination more ine¢cient. As a result, the optimal contract o¤ers the CEO higher
promised utility, thus rewarding him for luck. DeMarzo and Kaniel (2016) and Liu and Sun
(2016) show that, when executives have relative wealth concerns, it is optimal for rms to pay
them for general industry upswings to ensure that their pay does not lag their industry peers.
    While Holmström (1979, 1982) derives the optimality of RPE under no contracting con-
straints, a second set of papers shows that real-world constraints on contracting may lead RPE
to be no longer optimal. For example, a preference for simplicity can lead to the use of piecewise
linear contracts  indeed, cash, stock, and options are typically used in practice.34 Dittmann,
Maug, and Spalt (2013) study the e¤ect of indexation when contracts are restricted to these
instruments and show that the indexation of options can destroy incentives. Since an indexed
option is in the money only if the stock price rises high enough to outperform the benchmark,
indexation is tantamount to increasing the strike price of the option and reducing the drift rate
of the underlying asset. Both e¤ects reduce the options delta and thus incentives. To preserve
incentives, additional equity must be given, and their calibration shows that full indexation of
all options would increase compensation costs by 50% on average. If rms choose the optimal
proportion of options to index, average compensation costs would only fall by 2.3%, and 75% of
  rms would choose zero indexation. They show that indexing stock also has little bene t. The
optimal contracting model of Chaigneau, Edmans, and Gottlieb (2017a) shows that reducing
the volatility of the performance measure, through indexation or any other means, can lower
the CEOs incentives. With limited liability, the CEO is paid zero if performance is below a
 34
      See Gabaix (2014) for a sparsity-based model where agents have a preference for simplicity.


                                                       52
threshold, and a positive and increasing amount above the threshold. Thus, if the performance
measure ends up below the threshold, the CEO does not gain from marginal improvements in
performance. If the threshold is high (e.g., the CEO has out-of-the-money options), a fall in
volatility lowers incentives because it reduces the likelihood of beating the threshold and being
rewarded for marginal increases in e¤ort.

3.4.2.    Relative Performance Evaluation: Evidence

The evidence on the use of RPE in executive pay is mixed. One the one hand, a long list of
studies shows that CEO pay and changes in CEO wealth are a¤ected by industry and market
performance and other shocks that are beyond CEOs control (Murphy, 1985; Coughlan and
Schmidt, 1985; Antle and Smith, 1986; Gibbons and Murphy, 1990; Janakiraman, Lambert,
and Larker, 1992; Garen, 1994; Aggarwal and Samwick, 1999a, 1999b; Murphy, 1999; Bertrand
and Mullainathan, 2001). The strongest evidence against RPE comes from studies of CEO
wealth changes, which are driven by revaluations of stock and option holdings. Because the
equity granted to executives are not indexed against any peer group, CEO wealth is strongly
a¤ected by exogenous shocks to equity values.35
    On the other hand, several studies provide evidence that RPE against speci c peer groups is
in fact used in CEO pay contracts. Albuquerque (2009) argues that relevant peers are not only
 rms in the same industry, but also those of similar size. When de ning rms according to both
industry and size, she nds signi cant evidence for RPE. Rather than assuming a peer group,
Lewellen (2015) hand-collects the peers that rms report as their primary product market
competitors in their 10-Ks, and also nds evidence for RPE. Even more directly, Gong, Li, and
Shin (2011) study the explicit use of RPE in compensation contracts, based on the disclosure
of peer rms and performance measures mandated by the SEC in 2006. They nd that 25%
of S&P 1,500 rms explicitly use RPE. Bettis et al. (2016) nd that 48% of rms granting
performance-based equity in 2012 used at least one relative performance metric. De Angelis
and Grinstein (2017) show that, among rms using RPE, 88% measure the rank performance
of the CEO relative to peers. Most empirical studies instead measure the di¤erence between
 rm and peer performance, implicitly assuming that contracts are concerned with absolute
peer-adjusted performance. Using a rank-based speci cation, they nd signi cant evidence of
RPE.36
    Hence, a mixed picture emerges: RPE is explicitly used in many executive contracts, and
  35
      CEO ring decisions also appear to be a¤ected by industry and market performance (Jenter and Kanaan,
2015).
   36
      In addition, De Angelis and Grinstein (2017) examine the motives for RPE. The standard agency explana-
tion, based on the informativeness principle, argues that RPE is used to lter out exogenous shocks, in which
case RPE-based awards should be paid in cash; in contrast, they nd that they are typically given in stock. The
authors analyze a typically understudied motive, based on labor market and retention motives rather than moral
hazard: relative performance reveals the CEOs talent, and so higher pay is necessary to retain him (Gibbons
and Murphy, 1990). Consistent with this hypothesis, they nd that RPE awards vest over time, and so are only
paid if the CEO remains with the rm, and are also more prevalent where CEO talent is more transferable.


                                                     53
many rms lter the performance of speci c peer groups when measuring performance for
compensation purposes. However, many large and obvious exogenous shocks (e.g., market
returns, oil prices) are not ltered out, and so CEO pay, and especially CEO wealth, remain
heavily (and seemingly unnecessarily) exposed to forces beyond CEOs control. It is an open
question to what extent, if any, this exposure is a sign of ine¢cient contracting.

3.4.3.   Additional Performance Signals: Theory

Stock returns are an attractive measure of executive performance because equity valuations
are forward-looking. If investors are well-informed and markets e¢cient, then stock prices
should reect the e¤ect of managers current actions on expected long-term value creation. The
informativeness principle, however, implies that optimal contracts should utilize any other signal
that is incrementally informative about executives actions. Even if stock price maximization
is the principals objective, stock prices are an extremely noisy measure of executives actions
and performance. This noise implies that there are bene ts to supplementing stock prices with
other signals, such as accounting numbers, in executive contracts (Lambert and Larcker, 1987).
Intuitively, even if stock prices aggregate information about rm values e¢ciently, they are
likely to aggregate information about managers actions ine¢ciently and inconsistently (Paul,
1992; Bushman and Indjejikian, 1993; Lambert, 1993; Feltham and Xie, 1994; Core, Guay, and
Verrecchia, 2003).
    The informativeness principle was derived assuming no constraints in contracting. Chaigneau,
Edmans, and Gottlieb (2017b) show that with limited liability, the optimal contract might ig-
nore signals that are informative about CEO e¤ort. If the stock price is su¢ciently low, it
is su¢ciently likely that the CEO has shirked, so he is red and paid zero. Even if a signal
provides incremental information that the CEO has shirked, it cannot be used to reduce his
pay further. Thus, signals only have value where constraints on contracting do not bind. If
a contract is driven by constraints (as in Innes (1990)), a signal could be informative almost
everywhere yet not be used in the contract.
    Banker and Datar (1989) identify necessary and su¢cient conditions on the joint probability
distribution of performance signals such that the optimal incentive contract is based on a linear
combination of those signals. They predict that the relative weight on each performance measure
is determined by how much noise the measure contains and by how sensitive it is to the CEOs
actions. A signals sensitivity is the extent to which its expected value changes with the CEOs
action, adjusted for the correlation with other signals that also change with the action. In
the optimal contract, the relative weight on each signal is proportional to the ratio of this
sensitivity to the signals conditional variance, i.e., proportional to the performance measures
signal-to-noise ratio.




                                               54
3.4.4.   Additional Performance Signals: Evidence

Performance signals other than stock returns are widely used in executive pay. Many top
executives participate in bonus plans whose payouts are a function of one or more measures
of accounting performance, such as earnings per share, operating income, or sales (Murphy,
1999, 2001; De Angelis and Grinstein, 2015; see also Section 2.3.4). In addition, the use of
performance-based equity, whose vesting depends on rm performance, has increased rapidly
in recent years. Accounting-based performance metrics are used more frequently than stock-
price based metrics in these grants, and the use of accounting metrics has increased over time
(Bettis, Bizjak, Coles, and Kalpathy, 2016; see also Section 2.3.3).
    Lambert and Larcker (1987), Sloan (1993), and Ittner, Larcker, and Rajan (1997) examine
whether the relative use of stock price and accounting measures of performance in CEO pay is
related to the level of noise in those signals. Consistent with the predictions of Banker and
Datar (1993), CEO pay is relatively more strongly related to stock price performance, and less
strongly to accounting performance, if the variance of accounting performance is high relative
to the variance of stock returns. However, these studies focus on pay-performance sensitivities
instead of wealth-performance sensitivities. Core, Guay, and Verrecchia (2003) nd that, in
contrast to the prior literature, and inconsistent with the predictions of Banker and Datar
(1993), changes in CEO wealth are relatively more sensitive to stock prices if the stock return
variance is high relative to the variance of accounting performance.
    De Angelis and Grinstein (2015) examine the performance metrics used in performance-
based cash and equity awards by S&P 500 rms. Most awards are based on accounting perfor-
mance measures, usually income- or sales-based measures. Larger rms and rms with more
growth opportunities rely more heavily on stock price-based measures, while more mature rms
rely more heavily on accounting-based measures. They interpret these patterns as rms choos-
ing performance measures that are more informative of CEO e¤ort. For example, in growth
 rms, CEO e¤ort is more likely to be reected in forward-looking stock price changes than in
year-end accounting numbers.


3.5.     Stock vs. Options
The models of Section 3.2 predict that executives wealth should be sensitive to the stock price,
but generally do not specify whether this sensitivity should be provided by stock or options (or
any other instrument). The trade-o¤ is as follows. On the one hand, $1 of options provide a
higher delta (i.e., a higher wealth-performance sensitivity) than $1 of stock. On the other hand,
options pay o¤ in high states of the world in which risk-averse executives marginal utility
is low, which causes the ex-ante incentives created per unit of delta to be smaller for options
than for stock (Jenter, 2002). Moreover, since option values are more volatile, $1 of options
is worth less to the executive than $1 of stock, rendering them less e¤ective in meeting the
executives participation constraint. Which considerations dominate is a quantitative question.

                                               55
Hall and Murphy (2002), Jenter (2002), and Dittmann and Maug (2007) answer it by calibrating
a standard agency model with constant relative risk aversion utility and lognormal rm value37
and nd that the disadvantages of options dominate, suggesting that the optimal contract
should use only stock and no options. Moreover, when Dittmann and Maug (2007) drop the
restriction that the contract must be piecewise linear (i.e., consist of salary, stock, and options),
they nd that the optimal nonlinear contract is concave. Using a di¤erent model, Holmström
and Milgrom (1987) predict linear contracts, which again suggests that incentives should be
implemented purely with stock, and not non-linear instruments such as options. The intuition
is that a linear contract subjects the CEO to a constant incentive pressure irrespective of the
history of past performance (see Section 3.2.3).
    In contrast to both frameworks, option compensation is widespread in the U.S. and many
other countries (see Sections 2.2.1 and 2.4). The use of options can be justi ed if the CEO
a¤ects rm risk in addition to e¤ort, by inducing him to take value-adding risky projects.
In Smith and Stulz (1985), the CEO takes a single action that reduces risk via hedging. If
the CEO is risk averse, he will naturally hedge, but if given stock options he may not, since
their convexity counterbalances the concavity of the CEOs utility function. In their model,
hedging does not reduce rm value, and may even increase it if there are bankruptcy costs, so
option compensation is not optimal. In Edmans and Gabaix (2011a), actions that the CEO
undertakes to increase rm value also increase rm risk, such as risky positive-NPV projects.
Thus, it is optimal for the rm to grant the CEO a convex contract to induce e¢cient risk-
taking. Dittmann, Yu, and Zhang (2017) calibrate a model where the CEO chooses both e¤ort
and risk, and show that it can explain the mix of stock and options found empirically.
    However, Carpenter (2000) and Ross (2004) show theoretically, and Lewellen (2006) numer-
ically, that options may not increase the managers risk-taking incentives: while an option has
vega (positive sensitivity to volatility), it also has delta (positive sensitivity to rm value).
Thus, a risk-averse manager may wish to reduce volatility in the value of the rm and thus his
options. Shue and Townsend (2017a) evaluate this theoretical debate empirically by showing
that increases in options have a positive causal e¤ect on risk taking (see Section 6.2.2).
    Option compensation can also be an optimal response to executives behavioral biases or
to executives having non-standard preferences. The calibration of Dittmann, Maug, and Spalt
(2010) demonstrates that the observed use of options can be rationalized by realistic levels
of CEO loss aversion, since options provide downside protection. Chaigneau, Sahuguet, and
Sinclair-Desgagné (2017) show that options can be optimal if the agent is su¢ciently prudent
(captured by the negative of the ratio of the third and second derivatives of his utility function).
Prudence implies a preference for positive skewness, and convex contracts increase the skewness
of the distribution of pay. Gervais, Heaton, and Odean (2011) consider an overcon dent CEO,
  37
    Moral hazard models with constant relative risk aversion utility and lognormal rm value have also been
studied by Lambert, Larcker, and Verrecchia (1991), Hall and Murphy (2000), Himmelberg and Hubbard (2000),
Hall and Knox (2004), and Oyer and Schaefer (2005).



                                                   56
i.e., one who overestimates the precision of his private signal on investment opportunities. Over-
con dence counters risk aversion, because an overcon dent manager overestimates the amount
of risk that his signal eliminates. Thus, a mildly overcon dent manager needs a less convex
contract (fewer options) to induce risk. However, when overcon dence becomes su¢ciently
high, another force starts to dominate  since the manager has con dence in his signal (and
thus that he will make correct investment decisions), he overestimates the possibility of right-
tail realizations and thus overvalues options. The rms optimal response is to give the CEO
more options to exploit his overvaluation.38 Consistent with this theory, Humphery-Jenner et
al. (2016) measure overcon dence by the extent to which the CEO holds deep in-the-money
options after they have become exercisable, and nd that more overcon dent managers receive
more options. However, this result is also consistent with managers having a preference for
options for reasons other than overcon dence (e.g., probability weighting or other mechanisms
generating a preference for skewness), which leads to them both preferring to hold onto options
after they become exercisable, and preferring to be compensated with options rather than other
instruments.39


3.6.     Debt vs. Equity
3.6.1.   Theory

The models in Section 3.5 consider good risk-taking that improves rm value. However,
the CEO may also have incentives to engage in bad risk-taking that reduces rm value. In
particular, in a levered rm, an equity-aligned manager may undertake a risky project even if it
is negative-NPV, because shareholders bene t from the upside but have limited downside risk
due to limited liability (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). Anticipating this, creditors will demand
a high cost of debt and/or tight covenants, to the detriment of shareholders.
    A potential solution to such risk-shifting is to compensate the CEO with debt as well as
equity (Edmans and Liu, 2010). Such debt is referred to as inside debt, as it is owned
by the manager rather than outside creditors. Previously proposed remedies for risk-shifting
include bonuses for achieving solvency, or salaries and private bene ts that are forfeited in
bankruptcy (e.g., Brander and Poitevin, 1992). These instruments are sensitive to the incidence
of bankruptcy, but if bankruptcy occurs, they pay zero regardless of liquidation value. In
contrast, inside debt yields a positive payo¤ in bankruptcy, proportional to the recovery value.
Thus, it renders the manager sensitive to rm value in bankruptcy, and not just to the incidence
of bankruptcy  exactly as desired by creditors  and thus reduces the cost of raising debt, to
the bene t of shareholders. Interestingly, they show the optimal debt-to-equity ratio for the
  38
     Bergman and Jenter (2007) make a related argument in the context of option compensation to employees
 rms award employees more options when they overvalue them, although due to sentiment rather than
overcon dence in a private signal.
  39
     Spalt (2013) uses a calibrated model to argue that probability weighting can explain option grants to
non-executive employees.


                                                   57
CEO is typically not the rms debt-to-equity ratio. While equating the ratios minimizes risk-
shifting, an equity (debt) bias is optimal to induce e¤ort if e¤ort pays o¤ more in solvency
(bankruptcy) states.
    For future research, it would be interesting to model the trade-o¤ between inducing execu-
tives to take good risks and discouraging them from taking bad risks. In Smith and Stulz
(1985), the rm is unlevered, so there are no risk-shifting concerns; as a result, the contract
contains options but no debt. In Edmans and Liu (2010), the CEO is risk-neutral, so there is no
problem of inducing him to take good risk; the contract contains debt, but not options. To
our knowledge, no existing study incorporates both leverage and risk aversion into a model of
e¤ort choice and risk-taking, to determine the optimal mix of salary, stock, options, and debt.

3.6.2.   Evidence

Many CEOs hold a substantial amount of inside debt through de ned bene t pensions and
deferred compensation (Sundaram and Yermack, 2007; Wei and Yermack, 2011). These are
unsecured obligations that yield an equal claim with other creditors in bankruptcy, and thus
constitute inside debt.40 For example, Sundaram and Yermack (2007) report that GEs Jack
Welch had over $100 million of inside debt when he retired in 2001. In banks and other nancial
institutions, the alignment of executives with debt has gathered pace since the recent nancial
crisis. In 2010, American International Group tied 80% of highly paid employees pay to the
price of its bonds, and 20% to the price of its stock; UBS and Credit Suisse have since started
paying bonuses in bonds; and Royal Bank of Scotland pays most of its deferred compensation
in bonds.
    Because inside debt is an endogenous choice variable, establishing its causal e¤ect on exec-
utive behavior is a challenge. Using de ned bene t pensions and deferred compensation as a
measure of inside debt, Sundaram and Yermack (2007) nd a positive correlation between exec-
utives debt-alignment and rms distance to default. After an increase in mandated disclosure,
bond prices increased and equity prices decreased at the revelation of signi cant inside debt
holdings by CEOs (Wei and Yermack, 2011). Inside debt is also associated with lower stock
return volatility, R&D expenditures, and nancial leverage (Cassell, Huang, Sanchez, and Stu-
art, 2012), and with lower bond yields and fewer covenants (Anantharaman, Fang, and Gong,
2014). However, without credible instruments for inside debt, interpreting these correlations
is di¢cult. Finally, Campbell, Galpin, and Johnson (2016) provide suggestive evidence that
shareholder value rises when a CEOs inside debt level moves closer to those at peer rms with
similar characteristics. However, without knowing why rms deviated from their peers in the
  rst place, this result is also di¢cult to interpret.
  40
    For de ned bene t pensions and deferred compensation to be inside debt, it is important that rms do not
shield these claims from creditors by, e.g., funding bankruptcy-remote trusts (Bebchuk and Jackson, 2005).

3.7.       Dynamic Models and the Horizon of Pay
Many of the moral hazard models discussed so far are static, one-period models. In reality,
CEOs are employed for several years, and there is uncertainty about when the employment
relationship will end. A dynamic setting leads to additional questions, such as how to spread
the rewards for good performance over time, how the level and sensitivity of pay vary over time,
and when the CEO quits or is red. While there are a number of dynamic models, all with
their own particular frameworks, they tend to share several general results.
    To illustrate some of the forces, we present a simple example from Edmans, Gabaix, Sadzik,
and Sannikov (2012), which is a tractable model that yields closed-form solutions.41 We rst
consider a model in which the CEO has log utility with no discounting, works for three periods,
and then immediately retires. We assume that the implemented action at is a constant a
across periods, and we normalize the marginal cost of e¤ort g 0 (a ) to 1. De ning rt as the
 rms stock return in period t, the optimal contract is given by
                                                r1
                                        ln c1 =    + 1 ,                                                (39)
                                                3
                                                r 1 r2
                                        ln c2 =    + + 2 ,
                                                3    2
                                                r 1 r2 r3
                                        ln c3 =    + + + 3 ,
                                                3    2    1
where t is a constant. An increase in r1 increases log consumption (i.e., utility) not only in
the current period, but also all future periods  it rises by r31 in all periods. In addition, the
                                    ln ct
pay-performance sensitivity t = @ @r t
                                          increases over time, from 1=3 to 1=2 to 1=1. The total
lifetime reward for e¤ort is a constant 1 in all periods.
    We next consider the case in which the CEO still works for three periods, but lives for ve
periods. The optimal contract is now
                                                   r1
                                         ln c1 =        + 1 ;                                           (40)
                                                   5
                                                   r1     r2
                                         ln c2 =        + + 2 ;
                                                   5      4
                                                   r1     r 2 r3
                                         ln c3 =        + + + 3 ;
                                                   5      4    3
                                                   r1     r 2 r3
                                         ln c4 =        + + + 4 ;
                                                   5      4    3
                                                   r1     r 2 r3
                                         ln c5 =        + + + 5 :
                                                   5      4    3
Since the CEO takes no action from t = 4, his pay does not depend on r4 or r5 . However,
it depends on r1 , r2 , and r3 as his earlier e¤orts a¤ect his wealth, from which he consumes.
The possibility of private saving changes the constants t , but not any other features of the
contract.
 41
      Like almost all dynamic contracting models, we assume that the principal can commit to the contract.



                                                         59
   This example illustrates forces that are at work in many dynamic models:
Deferred Reward. A high stock return in a particular period boosts the CEOs income not
only in that period, but also in all future periods. Since the CEO is risk averse, it is e¢cient
to spread out the reward for good performance (or punishment for poor performance) across
all future periods  including post-retirement  to achieve consumption smoothing. This result
was rst derived by Lambert (1983) and Rogerson (1985) who consider a two-period model,
and is featured in the multi-period model of Edmans et al. (2012).
Increasing Incentives. The sensitivity t of current income ct to the current stock return
rt generally increases over time. The mechanism behind this result varies across models. In
Gibbons and Murphy (1992), the CEOs motivation to exert e¤ort stems not only from nan-
cial incentives, but also reputational concerns. As he approaches retirement, career concerns
weaken, and so nancial incentives must strengthen. In the adverse selection model of Garrett
and Pavan (2015), implementing high e¤ort in low-productivity workers requires paying higher
compensation to high-productivity workers to deter them from mimicking the former. These
informational rents are greatest at the start of the relationship, and so the principal optimally
implements low e¤ort early on and high e¤ort later, which entails a rising sensitivity over time.
In Edmans et al. (2012), the lifetime reward for e¤ort (increase in utility due to higher in-
come in the current and all future periods) must be su¢cient to induce e¤ort. As the CEO
approaches retirement, there are fewer periods over which to spread this lifetime reward, and
so the reward in the current period must be higher.42 For example, in the contract in (39), if
the CEO increases r1 by 1, he is rewarded by an increase in his lifetime utility by 1; this is
achieved by increasing his utility by 1=3 in each of periods 1, 2, and 3. If he increases r3 by
1, there are no future periods over which to spread out his reward, so his utility rises by 1 in
period 3.
Private Saving. Some dynamic models allow for the CEO to engage in private saving. This
creates additional complexity since, by saving, the CEO can achieve a di¤erent consumption
pro le from the income pro le provided by the contract. In standard models without private
saving (e.g., Rogerson (1985)), the optimal wage pro le is front-loaded, but such a pro le will
induce the CEO to save to insure himself against future income shocks; moreover, such insurance
may in turn reduce e¤ort incentives. Edmans et al. (2012) show that permitting private saving
does not a¤ect the sensitivity of pay to performance t (as it depends only on the marginal
cost of e¤ort and number of periods until retirement), but does a¤ect the level of pay (the
intercept t ). When private saving is possible (i.e., the principal cannot observe the CEOs
saving decision), the growth rate of consumption is higher than when it is impossible. This
faster upward trend means that the contract e¤ectively saves for the CEO, removing the need
for him to do so himself. Moreover, the growth rate is increasing in the risk to which the CEO
  42
     The only case in which this does not happen is an in nite horizon model, in which the number of future
periods does not change with t, and so incentives are constant.


                                                    60
is exposed, and thus his incentives t and rm volatility . Since t rises over time, this means
the growth rate of consumption increases, and hence pay accelerates over time.43 He (2012)
similarly nds that the wage pro le must be back-loaded to deter private saving, in contrast
to the front-loaded pro le of Rogerson (1985). He also nds that pay does not fall upon poor
performance but exhibits a permanent rise after a su¢ciently good performance history.44

3.7.1.    Short-Termism

Edmans et al. (2012) also extend the model to allow the CEO to engage in short-termism
(in addition to e¤ort and private saving), and study how this possibility a¤ects the optimal
contract. Short-termism is broadly de ned to encompass any action that increases current
returns at the expense of future returns  scrapping positive-NPV investments that reduce
short-term performance (Stein, 1988), taking negative-NPV projects that boost short-term
performance, earnings management, and accounting manipulation. Consider the case in which
action mt  0 increases the current return to rt0 = rt + M (mt ) and reduces the next-period
return to rt+1
            0
               = rt+1 mt , where M 0 (0) 2 [0; 1) is related to the marginal ine¢ciency of
myopia and M 00 () < 0. If the rm is su¢ciently large, the principal will wish to implement
zero manipulation. The contract in (40) now changes to:
                                           r1
                                 ln c1 =        + 1 ;                                                      (41)
                                           5
                                           r1     r2
                                 ln c2 =        + + 2 ;
                                           5      4
                                           r1     r 2 r3
                                 ln c3 =        + + + 3 ;
                                           5      4    3
                                           r1     r2 r3 M 0 (0) r4
                                 ln c4 =        + + +              + 4 ;
                                           5      4    3    2
                                           r1     r2 r3 M 0 (0) r4
                                 ln c5 =        + + +              + 5 :
                                           5      4    3    2
    Even though the CEO retires at the end of t = 3, his income depends on r4 , otherwise he
would have an incentive to boost r3 at the expense of r4 . Thus, the CEO should retain equity
in the rm even after retirement. This result is also found by Marinovic and Varas (2016).
For the general case in which manipulation reduces the return H periods into the future, the
CEO should be sensitive to rm returns for H years after retirement. This result formalizes the
argument of Bebchuk and Fried (2004), who advocate escrowing the CEOs equity to deter him
from inating the stock price before retirement and then cashing out. Deferring equity until
  43
      Lazear (1979) has a back-loaded wage pattern for incentive, rather than private saving considerations (the
agent is risk-neutral in his model). If wages increase with tenure, the agent exerts e¤ort to avoid being red
and ensure he receives the high future wages. Similarly, in Yang (2009), a back-loaded wage pattern induces
agents to work to avoid the rm being shut down.
   44
      This downward rigidity is also predicted by Harris and Holmstrom (1982), but through a quite di¤erent
channel. Their model features two-sided learning about the agents ability rather than moral hazard. Downward
rigidity in wages insures the agent against negative news about his ability, while wage rises after positive news
ensure that he does not quit.

                                                       61
after retirement is also recommended by the April 2016 U.K. Corporate Governance Code and
already practiced by some companies such as King sher and Unilever.
    The sensitivity to r4 depends on the ine¢ciency of manipulation M 0 (0); in the extreme,
if M 0 (0) = 0, myopia is impossible and there is no need to expose the CEO to returns after
retirement. Because there is no discounting, there is no incentive to inate earnings at t = 1 or
t = 2. The negative e¤ect of myopia on future returns reduces the CEOs lifetime utility by more
than the positive e¤ect on current returns increases it. With discounting, incentives increase
even faster over time than in the absence of a myopia problem. The higher sensitivity to future
returns ensures that myopia causes the CEO to lose enough in the future to counterbalance the
e¤ect of discounting.
    While Edmans et al. (2012) and Marinovic and Varas (2016) highlight the bene ts of long
vesting horizons in combating myopia, lengthening vesting periods is not costless. First, doing
so exposes the CEO to more risk outside his control. Second, Laux (2012) shows theoretically
that, if the CEO forfeits unvested equity upon dismissal, he may engage in myopic actions to
avoid the risk of dismissal until his equity has vested. Third, Brisley (2006) demonstrates that
if unvested equity ties up a signi cant portion of the CEOs wealth within the rm, he may
turn down risky, value-creating projects.
    Several other models feature the possibility of a myopic action and argue that it justi es
the low dollar-dollar incentives found in Section 2.3. Benmelech, Kandel, and Veronesi (2010)
assume that equity incentives vest in the short-term. As a result, the CEO may conceal infor-
mation that investment opportunities have declined to keep the current stock price high, even
though disclosing such information would allow him to e¢ciently disinvest. In a similar vein,
Peng and Roell (2008, 2014) and Goldman and Slezak (2006) demonstrate that high-powered
incentives can encourage the manager to expend rm resources to manipulate the stock price
upwards, again under the assumption that any equity granted vests in the short-term. However,
these unintended consequences of incentive contracts can potentially be avoided by granting
equity with long vesting horizons.

3.7.2.    Termination

While the CEOs retirement date is xed in Edmans et al. (2012), other dynamic models
allow for an endogenous end date. The threat of termination upon poor performance provides
additional e¤ort incentives in DeMarzo and Sannikov (2006), DeMarzo and Fishman (2007),
Biais, Mariotti, Plantin, and Rochet (2007), He (2012), and Sannikov (2008).45 The rst four
models feature limited liability for the agent, which reduces the principals ability to punish
poor performance nancially, thus leading to a role for termination. In some cases, such as
  45
    Termination after poor performance is typically not subgame-perfect, so dynamic moral hazard models
assume that the rm can commit to terminate the CEO. Learning models predict subgame-perfect termination
after poor performance, as such performance signals low managerial quality (e.g., Jovanovic 1979; Harris and
Holmström, 1982; Murphy, 1986; Gibbons and Murphy, 1992; Hermalin and Weisbach, 1998; Taylor, 2010;
Garrett and Pavan, 2012; Chaigneau and Sahuguet, 2017).

                                                    62
Sannikov (2008), termination also arises after very good performance as the CEO becomes too
expensive to incentivize.
    Models where termination provides e¤ort incentives imply that the CEO should be given the
lowest possible wage (typically zero) upon termination, to maximize e¤ort incentives. However,
other models predict that severance pay can be optimal. In Almazan and Suarez (2003),
severance pay induces the CEO to leave voluntarily when a more able replacement is available; in
Inderst and Mueller (2010), it deters the CEO from entrenching himself by concealing negative
information that would lead to his dismissal. For example, severance pay (in the form of
a golden parachute) can induce the CEO to accept a takeover bid, which typically yields a
substantial premium to shareholders but causes the CEO to lose his job. Manso (2011) shows
that downside protection from severance pay can induce the CEO to explore new technologies
rather than merely exploit existing ones. In He (2012), severance pay is part of a back-loaded
wage pattern that is robust to private savings.

3.7.3.   Evidence

Deferred Reward. Boschen and Smith (1995) and our own analysis in Section 2.1.1 show
that current rm performance has a much greater e¤ect on the NPV of future pay than current
pay. These ndings are consistent with theories predicting that rm performance should a¤ect
future as well as current pay due to consumption smoothing considerations.
Incentives and Tenure. Gibbons and Murphy (1992) nd that incentives rise with tenure,
although they study pay-performance sensitivity rather than wealth-performance sensitivity.
This result is consistent with both consumption smoothing and career concerns falling with
tenure. Our empirical analysis in Section 2.3.2 shows that both CEOs e¤ective dollar ownership
and their e¤ective percentage ownership increase with tenure.
Level of Pay and Tenure. Murphy (1986), Graham, Kim, and Leary (2017), and our own
analysis in Section 2.1.1 show that pay increases with tenure, consistent with models that
predict a backward-loaded wage pattern to remove incentives for private saving. The common
practice of seniority-based pay is also consistent with this prediction, as is the observation
that stock prices react positively to the unexpected deaths of long-tenured CEOs (Salas, 2010;
Jenter, Matveyev, and Roth, 2017). However, to our knowledge, predictions that the growth
rate of pay depends on the level of incentives  and rm risk  are as yet untested.46
Determinants of CEO Horizon. Edmans et al. (2012) predict that rms in which the
CEO has greater scope to engage in myopia should have longer vesting periods and also more
rapidly increasing incentives over time. Gopalan, Milbourn, Song, and Thakor (2014) develop a
measure of executive pay duration and nd, consistent with the rst prediction, that incentives
  46
    The positive association between pay and tenure may also result from tournament-based incentives (e.g.,
Green and Stokey, 1983). Tournament winners are rewarded by both longer tenure and high pay, and this
high pay is not exclusively due to ability or productivity, but a reward for winning the tournament.


                                                    63
have longer horizons in rms with more growth opportunities and greater R&D intensity.47
Section 6 reviews the evidence on the e¤ect of incentive horizons on behavior.
Termination. The evidence reviewed in Section 2.3.5 shows that forced CEO turnovers become
more frequent as stock returns and accounting performance decline. However, the economic
magnitudes are modest, leading Jensen and Murphy (1990a,b) and others to conclude that
dismissals are not an important source of CEO incentives. Jenter and Lewellen (2017) attempt
to estimate the number of CEO turnovers caused by bad performance directly from the turnover-
performance relationship. Their estimates suggest that around half of CEO turnovers in public
U.S. rms are performance-induced, i.e., would not have occurred had performance been
better. Without reference to a model, it is impossible to assess whether the observed turnover-
performance sensitivities are optimal, and we are unaware of any moral hazard model that
yields quantitative predictions for the optimal rate of ring.48


4.     The Rent Extraction View
The shareholder value view assumes that executive pay is decided directly by shareholders, or by
their well-incentivized or monitored representatives (directors). In contrast, the rent extraction
view argues that both the level and structure of pay are decided by the executives themselves
(in conjunction with a complicit board) to maximize the amount that they can extract without
inviting intervention by activist investors or corporate raiders (Bertrand and Mullainathan,
2001; Bebchuk, Fried, and Walker, 2002; Bebchuk and Fried, 2003, 2004).
    The rent extraction view starts with the observation that, in practice, executive pay is
set by the board of directors and its compensation committee. This creates another agency
problem, as directors on the compensation committee have their own agenda and may have
incentives to curry favor with executives. In theory, market forces  including the market
for corporate control, capital markets, product markets, and the managerial labor market 
impose constraints on how much value destruction directors (and executives) can allow from
rent extraction. However, the constraints from market forces can be loose and permit large
deviations from e¢cient contracting (Bebchuk, Fried, and Walker, 2002), since many rms are
e¤ectively insulated from the market for corporate control, have little need for outside capital,
and have executives with no desire for a career beyond their current job.
    The cost to shareholders may be far greater than the direct cost of inated compensation.
If contracts provide insu¢cient incentives to exert e¤ort or refrain from empire-building, or
induce short-termism and manipulation (see Sections 2.3.3 and 2.3.4), the losses to rm value
can be large. In contrast, median CEO pay in the S&P 500 in 2014 was $10.1 million, which is
  47
     Gopalan et al. measure pay duration as the weighted average vesting period of each pay component,
calculated analogously to the duration of a bond.
  48
     Taylor (2010) estimates a model with learning about CEO ability but no moral hazard and concludes that
the low rate of dismissals can only be justi ed by a substantial non-pecuniary cost of ring CEOs.


                                                    64
only 0.03% of the value of the median S&P 500 rm (see Section 2.1).


4.1.        Theory
Most of the arguments in favor of the rent extraction view are empirical; there are very few
theories formally modeling rent extraction through executive pay. A notable exception is Kuh-
nen and Zwiebel (2009). In their model, the manager can extract hidden pay, but doing so
reduces pro ts and thus shareholders assessment of the managers ability, which may lead to
him being red. Rent extraction survives in equilibrium because ring is costly and because
any replacement CEO is also expected to extract rents. The model predicts that hidden pay is
increasing in production uncertainty (since it is easier to disguise low pro ts as resulting from
bad luck) and the managers outside option (since ring is less of a concern). It is decreasing in
uncertainty about the managers ability, as then pro ts have a greater e¤ect on shareholders
assessment of his ability and thus their ring decision. Kuhnen and Zwiebel nd qualitative
support for these predictions, measuring hidden pay with options, restricted stock, and other
annual pay that is not salary and bonus.
    While not models of rent extraction, Acharya and Volpin (2010) and Dicks (2012) show
that, when rms compete in the managerial labor market, one poorly-governed rm permitting
its executives to extract rents can a¤ect executive pay (and governance) in other rms. By
improving executives outside option, rent extraction in one rm imposes a negative externality
on other rms.49 This channel is also predicted by Gabaix and Landier (2008), who study
the equilibrium of their assignment model when some rms over-pay, while others are e¢cient.
They nd a potentially large contagion e¤ect of the high-paying rms on the whole market.


4.2.        Compensation for Non-Performance
Shareholder value models suggest that high pay can be justi ed either because it attracts pro-
ductive and scarce managerial talent, or as ex-post reward for strong performance. Proponents
of the rent extraction view, however, argue that high pay, and large increases in pay, are often
unrelated to performance.
Pay-For-Luck. Bebchuk and Fried (2004) view the absence of (complete) RPE in executive
pay as a key piece of evidence in support of the rent extraction view. Standard stock and option
grants fail to lter out stock price increases due to industry and market movements, and thus
unrelated to managers performance, in apparent contradiction to the predictions of optimal
contracting models (see Section 3.4). However, simply letting exogenous performance elements
a¤ect executive pay, while holding its expected value constant, would lower, not increase, the
utility of a risk-averse executive. In order for pay for luck to bene t managers, it needs to
be asymmetric, exposing pay more strongly to good luck than to bad.
  49
       In Section 7.1, we explore under which circumstances such externalities can justify regulation of executive
pay.

                                                         65
    Bertrand and Mullainathan (2001) document three instances of pay for luck  oil prices
a¤ecting the pay of oil CEOs, exchange rates a¤ecting pay in import-a¤ected industries, and
general industry shocks a¤ecting pay. They nd some evidence for asymmetry. Garvey and
Milbourn (2006) provide more evidence that positive shocks to industry performance a¤ect
CEO pay more strongly than negative ones. On the other hand, CEOs are more likely to
be red after bad industry or bad market performance, which indicates that some CEOs are
penalized for bad luck (Jenter and Kanaan, 2015).
    Bertrand and Mullainathan nd more pay for luck when the rm lacks an outside block-
holder who owns at least 5%, while Garvey and Milbourn nd more pay for luck when corporate
governance, measured by the Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2003) index, is weaker. These cor-
relations suggest that pay for luck is a means of rent extraction. However, Section 3.4 surveyed
several justi cations for the non-universality of RPE that are consistent with shareholder value
maximization. Moreover, rms controlled by private equity investors, usually viewed as rms
with better governance, do not use more RPE than other rms (Cronqvist and Fahlenbrach,
2013; Jackson, 2013; Leslie and Oyer, 2013), which suggests that it may not be universally
optimal.
Severance Pay. Departing CEOs frequently receive severance payments, also called golden
handshakes (see Section 2.2.2). Ex-ante separation agreements, signed when CEOs are hired,
are common and typically equivalent to two years of cash pay (Rusticus, 2006). The ex-
post payments made to departing CEOs are frequently higher than speci ed in the ex-ante
contract (Yermack, 2006b; Goldman and Huang, 2015). Their use is especially prevalent among
dismissed rather than retiring CEOs, and thus appears to reward CEOs for failure. The need
to bribe a poorly performing CEO to step down weakens ex-ante incentives and suggests that
CEOs have considerable power vis-a-vis their board of directors (Bebchuk and Fried, 2003).
    While golden handshakes are common, they are usually moderate in value, even though
large outliers exist. In a sample of U.S. large-cap rms from 1996-2002, Yermack (2006b) nds
mean discretionary (contracted) severance pay of $4.5 million ($0.9 million); the respective
maximums are $121.1 and $36.1 million. Critics of severance payments for CEOs usually quote
the size of the entire pay package received at departure. However, a closer look at the data shows
that much of this nal compensation is not severance pay, i.e., not compensation for loss of
employment, but instead items such as already vested and deferred restricted shares, vested
unexercised options, and accrued pension bene ts, which were promised and contractually
obligated to the CEO under any circumstances.50
    Severance payments are inconsistent with shareholder value models in which the threat
of termination alleviates moral hazard (see Section 3.7.2). To maximize ex-ante incentives,
  50
    For example, out of Henry McKinnells much-criticized $180 million severance package from P zer, $78
million was deferred compensation ($67 million contributed plus $11 million interest), $82 million was the
present value of his pension plan, and $8 million was from stock options. Thus, only an incremental $11 million
was due to the loss of employment. We thank David Yermack for this example.



                                                      66
the CEO should be given the lowest possible wage (typically zero) upon termination. However,
other shareholder value theories surveyed in Section 3.7.2 rationalize severance pay, for example
to induce CEOs to reveal negative information or to explore risky new technologies. It is an
open question whether these forces can justify the more extreme realizations of severance pay
observed in the data.
Pay For Acquisitions. CEOs appear to be rewarded simply for the act of undertaking
an acquisition, regardless of whether the acquisition creates value for shareholders. CEO pay
tends to increase after bank mergers, even if the acquirers stock price declines (Bliss and Rosen,
2001). Across all industries, acquirer CEOs receive cash bonuses for deal completion, and these
bonuses are unrelated to the acquirers deal announcement return, but positively related to deal
size and measures of CEO power (Grinstein and Hribar, 2004). For example, in 2000, Chase
Manhattan CEO William Harrison was paid a $20 million bonus for negotiating the acquisition
of J.P. Morgan, even though the negotiations only took three weeks, and Chases stock price
subsequently dropped by one third.
    CEOs also receive larger stock and option grants after an acquisition than before (Harford
and Li, 2007). For poorly performing acquirers with weak boards, new equity grants completely
o¤set the negative e¤ect of poor post-deal performance on CEO wealth. As a result, CEO wealth
is insensitive to bad post-deal performance, but remains sensitive to good performance.
Option Repricing. Some rms react to falls in their stock price by lowering strike prices of
previously granted executive options, or by cancelling and reissuing options with lower strike
prices.51 In a sample of U.S. public rms from 1992-95, Brenner, Sundaram, and Yermack
(2000) nd that 1.3% of executives with options experience such a repricing event per year.
In the vast majority of cases, the strike price is lowered to the current stock price, which appears
to reward executives for failure. This concern is reinforced by the observation that rms reprice
in response to poor rm-speci c performance, not just in response to poor industry or market
performance (Chance, Kumar, and Todd, 2000; Carter and Lynch, 2001). Moreover, implicit
agreements to reprice options upon a stock price fall make option packages more valuable than
reported to shareholders (see Section 4.3). On the other hand, the e¤ort incentives of deep
out-of-the-money options are weak, and repricing can restore incentives (Acharya, John, and
Sundaram, 2000). The evidence also suggests that option repricing is correlated with lower
subsequent executive turnover, consistent with increased retention e¤ects (Carter and Lynch,
2004; Chen, 2004).
    Following changes in the NYSE and Nasdaq listing standards in 2003, listed companies must
obtain shareholder approval of option repricings unless speci cally permitted by the underly-
ing plan. Plans that authorize repricing are rare, however, because Institutional Shareholder
  51
    In December 1998, the Financial Accounting and Standards Board imposed an accounting charge for repriced
options, but rms could circumvent the rule by cancelling options and reissuing new ones more than six months
afterwards. Indeeed, many rms canceled underwater options and reissued at-the-money options exactly six
months and one day later (Gulen and OBrien, 2017).


                                                    67
Services (ISS), the leading proxy advisory rm, recommends against shareholder approval
of such plans. As a result, option repricing has become less frequent and changed in nature.
Traditional repricings replace each option by a more valuable new option, while more recent
value-for-value exchanges replace underwater options by a smaller number of at-the-money
options of the same total value. Moreover, recent repricings explicitly exclude directors and
top-5 executives, again in accordance with ISS voting guidelines, and are less likely after poor
 rm-speci c performance (Gulen and OBrien, 2017). These changes suggest that the prior
practices were not in shareholders interest.
Incentive Rigging. Even if pay appears to be related to performance ex-post, this correlation
may arise because the executive opportunistically chose the performance measure on which
he appears the strongest. Morse, Nanda, and Seru (2011) argue that CEOs often know in
advance on which measure their performance will look best and use their inuence over the
board to slant incentive contracts.52 They measure incentive rigging by the sensitivity of
pay to the maximum of industry-adjusted return on assets and industry-adjusted stock returns,
controlling for the sensitivity of pay to these performance measures individually. The magnitude
of rigging is economically large and accounts for 10% to 30% of CEOs pay-performance
sensitivity. Rigging is positively correlated with CEO power, measured by the proportion of
inside directors, the proportion of the board appointed by the CEO, and the CEOs ownership
of stock and exercisable options, and negatively correlated with shareholder rights as measured
by Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2003).
Hedging. A signi cant number of executives uses derivatives to hedge at least some of the risk
in their stock and option holdings (Bettis, Bizjak, and Kalpathy, 2001, 2015; Jagolinzer, Mat-
sunaga, and Yeung, 2007). These hedging transactions are equivalent to short-selling company
stock and thus undo executives ownership incentives (Bebchuk and Fried, 2004). ISS has a
policy of voting for any shareholder proposal that prohibits executives from hedging company
stock, and many prominent rms have adopted such prohibitions (Bebchuk and Fried, 2010).
    Once grants have vested, a reduction in equity exposure can be achieved by simply selling
equity, which raises the question why executives use derivatives to hedge. One explanation
is that executives are trying to defer the capital gains taxes associated with an outright sale.
Alternatively, executives might use hedging to avoid the negative signal associated with a sale.
Hedging transactions, even though reported in the footnotes of annual reports, are more opaque
than outright sales.
    Using hand-collected data, Bettis, Bizjak, and Kalpathy (2001, 2015) and Jagolinzer, Mat-
sunaga, and Yeung (2007) show that executives who use hedges reduce their equity exposures by
about 30% on average. Hedge transactions are initiated prior to poor stock price performance,
which suggests that executives use them to opportunistically trade on inside information. There
  52
    For example, Home Depots 2004 proxy statement stated that CEO Robert Nardellis long-term incentives
would be based on 3-year stock returns, but after the stock price plummeted, the 2005 proxy stated that his
pay would now be based on earnings.


                                                    68
is no evidence that hedging is correlated with personal income tax rates, which suggests that
tax optimization is not the main motive (Bettis, Bizjak, and Kalpathy, 2015).


4.3.     Hidden Compensation
The rent extraction view predicts that rent extraction should occur through forms of pay that
are less observable or more di¢cult for shareholders to value. Bebchuk, Fried, and Walker
(2002) and Bebchuk and Fried (2004) argue that managerial rent extraction is constrained by
the level of outrage a pay arrangement generates among shareholders and other stakeholders.
Outrage causes embarrassment and reputational harm to executives and directors, and may
reduce the rms reputation among employees and customers. To avoid this outrage constraint,
  rms are expected to use pay practices that obscure the level of executive compensation.
    The use of stealth compensation is a challenge for the shareholder value view. If executive
pay were e¢ciently designed and competitive, there would be no need to disguise it from share-
holders.53 Even though most forms of compensation, including perks, pensions, and severance
pay, can be part of an optimal contract, hiding these compensation elements from shareholders
is suggestive of rent extraction (Bebchuk and Fried, 2004; Kuhnen and Zwiebel, 2009). Cam-
ouaging an optimal contract may, however, be optimal to avoid attracting negative attention
from politicians, the media, or other stakeholders who have motivations other than shareholder
value maximization.54
Option Compensation. Stock options can be a means of camouaging pay if directors or
shareholders do not fully understand their cost. Murphy (2002) and Hall and Murphy (2003)
argue that directors, shareholders, and possibly even executives themselves systematically un-
derestimate the cost of option compensation. When a company grants options, the economic
cost equals what outside investors would pay for the grant. However, the rm incurs no cash
outlay, and before U.S. accounting rules changed in 2004, there was no charge to accounting
earnings for at- or out-of-the-money options (see Section 5.2). These factors might have made
the perceived cost of option compensation much lower than its economic cost and allowed
executives to camouage their rent extraction.
    Several pieces of evidence are consistent with Murphys (2002) perceived cost hypothesis.
Until 2004, at-the-money options were the dominant form of equity compensation for executives
(see Section 2.2.1 and Murphy, 1999). It is di¢cult to conceive of an optimal contracting model
in which the optimal strike price always coincides perfectly with the current stock price and does
not vary with the contracting environment (Nohel and Todd, 2004; Chaigneau, Edmans, and
Gottlieb, 2017b). In fact, several models surveyed in Section 3.5 predict the use of restricted
stock, i.e., an optimal strike price of zero, in incentive contracts. However, under the pre-2004
  53
     Hidden compensation could be reconciled with value maximization if some shareholders are unaware of the
need to o¤er high pay levels to attract talented CEOs.
  54
     Negative press coverage of CEO pay appears to be associated with reductions in option grants (Kuhnen
and Niessen, 2012), but not with reductions in overall pay (Core, Guay, and Larcker, 2008).


                                                    69
accounting rules, both restricted stock and in-the-money options would have reduced reported
earnings. Hence, rms almost uniformly chose the lowest strike prices possible that did not
create an accounting charge.
    After U.S. accounting rules changed in December 2004, so did executive pay. The new rules
require options economic value to be expensed and e¤ectively put the accounting treatment
of options and restricted stock on an equal footing (see Section 5.2). Subsequently, the use of
option compensation fell (Hayes, Lemmon, and Qiu, 2012) and restricted stock has replaced
options as the most popular form of equity compensation (see Section 2.3.3). This suggests
that an important reason for the prior popularity of options was their favorable accounting
treatment.55
    Even after the change in accounting rules, there is evidence that the fair values of option
grants rms report and, after 2004, expense, are understated. Option valuation requires the
use of an option pricing model, and rms have considerable discretion over the choice of model
and model inputs. Even though rms can use this discretion to increase the accuracy of their
option valuations (Hodder, Mayew, McAnally, and Weaver, 2006), there is considerable evidence
that rms use it opportunistically to understate values (Aboody, Barth, and Kasznik, 2006;
Bartov, Mohanram, and Nissim, 2007). Observed opportunism is greater for rms with weaker
corporate governance and higher executive pay; it also increased after option expensing became
mandatory (Choudhary, 2011).
Spring Loading and Backdating Options. During the 1990s and early 2000s, rms inated
the value of executive option grants through widespread spring loading and option backdating.
Yermack (1997) shows that stock prices tend to rise right after option grants and concludes
that executives are awarded options before the release of good news (so-called spring load-
ing). Subsequent research suggests that rms actively manipulate the disclosure of information
around CEO option awards, delaying the release of good news and accelerating the disclosure
of bad news (Aboody and Kasznik, 2000; Chauvin and Shenoy, 2001).
    If the stock price increases after reported grant dates resulted from executives being awarded
options before predicted increases in stock prices, these increases should be idiosyncratic rather
than systematic  executives and directors can likely predict stock returns in their own company,
but not the overall market. However, Lie (2005) shows that the stock price increases are
systematic, inconsistent with spring loading but consistent with backdating  selecting the
grant dates ex post to minimize the strike price of at-the-money options and maximize their
value to executives (see also Heron and Lie, 2007; Narayanan and Seyhun, 2008).56 Such
  55
     The steep stock market decline in the early 2000s likely also contributed to the decline of option pay. For
behavioral reasons, managers appear to be more willing to accept options after the market has done well (Hall
and Murphy, 2003; Bergman and Jenter, 2007; Murphy, 2013).
  56
     Backdating constitutes both accounting fraud and tax evasion. Before FAS 123R became e¤ective in 2006,
 rms were required to expense options only if they were in the money; in addition, Section 162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code counts options against the $1 million tax deductibility threshold for non-performance pay only if
they are in the money. Thus, by disguising in-the-money options as being out of the money, rms avoided both



                                                       70
backdating appears to have been widespread, a¤ecting approximately 30% of rms from 1996
to 2005 (Heron and Lie, 2009).
    These practices are correlated with weak corporate governance. Bebchuk, Grinstein, and
Peyer (2010) show that opportunistic option timing is associated with a minority of independent
directors on the board, the absence of an outside blockholder on the compensation committee,
longer CEO tenure (a proxy for entrenchment), and higher overall CEO pay. Grants to inde-
pendent directors were also opportunistically timed, and opportunistic timing for independent
directors is associated with opportunistic timing for CEOs and also higher CEO pay. Moreover,
CEOs who bene t from opportunistic option timing are also more likely to engage in nan-
cial misstatements and earnings manipulation (Biggersta¤, Cicero, and Puckett, 2015). Hence,
option timing and backdating appear to be the result of more general governance breakdowns.
    The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 required rms to report option grants within two days of the
alleged grant date, which almost completely eliminates the scope for backdating. Subsequently,
the abnormal stock return patterns around option grants became much weaker, providing fur-
ther evidence that they were previously due to backdating (Heron and Lie, 2007). However,
more recent evidence suggests that rms continue to manipulate the disclosure of earnings and
other information around CEO option awards (Daines, McQueen, and Schonlau, 2016).
Performance-Based Equity. After 2004, performance-based equity grants have replaced
options as the most popular form of equity compensation (see Section 2.3.3). Their complexity
creates considerable scope for rent extraction. Determining the ex-ante values of performance-
based equity grants, especially of grants using accounting metrics, is di¢cult, which leaves
board members and shareholders in the dark about how much value is transferred to executives
(Walker, 2016). The heterogeneity of performance-based grants also hampers comparisons of
these plans across rms, making benchmarking executive pay more di¢cult. Firms report
varying levels of detail about performance metrics and payo¤ functions, with at least some
  rms making their grants almost completely opaque to outsiders.
    At this point, there is no evidence that rms use performance-based equity to understate the
level of executive pay. Bettis et al. (2016) apply their own valuation models to performance-
based grants. Even though they nd large discrepancies with the grant-date fair values reported
by rms, they also show that companies on average overstate values. Their analysis is, how-
ever, restricted to rms that reveal su¢cient information to value their grants, so their sample
might be biased towards less opportunistic rms. Given the evidence that rms understate the
values of conventional option grants, it would be surprising if the greater opacity a¤orded by
performance-based equity were not exploited.
Perks. Perks encompass a wide variety of goods and services provided to executives, including
corporate jets, club memberships, and personal security, and perks can be a signi cant portion
of CEO pay. They were largely hidden from shareholders until the SEC increased its disclosure
accounting and tax charges.


                                              71
requirements in 2006. Because of insu¢cient disclosure, perks (together with pensions and
severance pay) have often been labeled stealth compensation that may allow executives to
extract rents surreptitiously (Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Jensen, 1986; Bebchuk and Fried,
2004)
    The available evidence indicates that at least some perk consumption is a reection of man-
agerial excess. When rms rst disclose that CEOs use company aircraft for personal reasons,
their stock price falls by an average of 1.1%, and subsequently underperforms benchmarks by
4% per year (Yermack, 2006a). Firms that did not previously report perks reduced them by
34% once disclosure became mandatory in 2006 (Grinstein, Weinbaum, and Yehuda, 2015).
Perks appear to be a more general signal of weak corporate governance, as reductions in rm
value upon the revelation of perks substantially exceed their actual cost (Yermack 2006a; Grin-
stein, Weinbaum, and Yehuda, 2015). For example, the mean incremental cost of personal use
of company aircraft in Yermack (2006a) is $65,200, but the 4% per year underperformance
translates into $300 million annually.
    However, perks may also arise from optimal contracting. Providing perks is optimal if the
cost of acquiring goods and services that the manager desires is lower for the rm (Fama, 1980),
if perks allow the manager to consume out of pre-tax income, or if they aid managerial pro-
ductivity (Rajan and Wulf, 2006). For example, a corporate jet can ensure that a CEO arrives
at a meeting refreshed and thus able to negotiate e¤ectively. Rajan and Wulf (2006) provide
evidence that perks are used consistently with their productivity-enhancement hypothesis, e.g.,
to help the most productive employees save time. The extent to which some perks are justi ed
by the e¢cient mechanisms proposed by Fama (1980) or Rajan and Wulf (2006) or by tax
savings remains an open question.
Pensions. De ned bene t pensions are a signi cant portion of pay for many executives (see
Section 2.2.2). Because de ned bene t pensions tend to be unsecured and unfunded claims
against the rm, they can be justi ed as a form of inside debt that mitigates risk-shifting by
aligning executives with other unsecured creditors (see Section 3.6). However, in part because
SEC disclosure rules did not require rms to report the actuarial values of executive pensions
before 2006, Bebchuk and Fried (2004) argue that they are a form of stealth compensation.
    Studies based on hand-collected data and own estimates of value during the pre-2006 report-
ing regime suggest that de ned bene t pension claims were often large (Bebchuk and Jackson,
2005; Sundaram and Yermack, 2007). Since 2006, rms are required to disclose both the present
value of executives accumulated pension bene ts and its year-to-year change. Subsequently,
the use of de ned bene t pension plans declined from 48% of S&P 1,500 CEOs in 2006 to only
36% in 2012 (Cadman and Vincent, 2015). However, concurrent with the expanded disclosures
were the e¤ective dates of regulations requiring balance sheet recognition of pension plans and
increased insurance premiums for underfunded plans. It is therefore unclear whether the decline
in executive pension plans was caused by the expanded disclosure requirements.
    Using the newly-available pension data, Stefanescu, Wang, Xie, and Yang (2017) provide

                                              72
evidence that executives opportunistically game their de ned bene t pension plans to extract
more value. Executives with pension plans receive unusual one-o¤ increases in pensionable
bonuses one year before a pension plan freeze and one year before retirement. When executives
are eligible to retire, discount rates used to calculate lump-sum bene t distributions are lowered.
These changes are more likely in rms with weaker governance, suggesting that they are not in
shareholders interest.
Severance Pay. Section 4.2 surveyed the evidence for and against interpreting severance pay
as rent extraction. Additional support for the rent extraction interpretation comes from the
fact that rms frequently grant severance pay in forms that are di¢cult for outsiders to observe,
such as last-minute enhancements to pension plans and consulting contracts (Yermack, 2006b;
Goldman and Huang, 2015). The consulting contracts are often in the form of retainers, and
thus paid even if the former CEO provides no actual work for the rm. Some CEOs continue
to be provided with perks after their departure (Bebchuk and Fried, 2004), such as access
to corporate apartments, jets and cars, home security services, and nancial planning.57 If
severance pay were consistent with shareholder value maximization (see Section 3.7.2), it is
unclear why it would be given in these opaque forms.


4.4.     Corporate Governance
The rent extraction view predicts that executive pay will be higher and less sensitive to perfor-
mance in rms in which managers have relatively more power (Bebchuk and Fried, 2003). A
large empirical literature tries to show that compensation practices that seemingly favor exec-
utives at the expense of shareholders are most prevalent when corporate governance is weak.
The Achilles heel of this research program is that governance is itself the outcome of choices by
executives, directors, and shareholders, whose choices are a¤ected by (often unobservable) rm
and industry characteristics. If these characteristics also a¤ect CEO pay, then the observed
correlations between governance and pay are not causal. This does not mean that governance
does not have causal e¤ects on pay  it almost certainly does. However, it does mean that the
observed correlations are di¤erent from those e¤ects.
    To complicate things further, several of the shareholder value models surveyed in Section 3
imply that bad governance can be the optimal outcome of shareholder value maximization.
In Hermalin and Weisbach (1998), the board and the CEO negotiate over both CEO pay and
the identity of new directors. More able CEOs have more bargaining power and gradually ll
the board with less e¤ective directors. In several of the dynamic contracting models surveyed
  57
    In the rst year after Jack Welch retired as CEO from General Electric, he received approximately $2.5
million in perks, which included unlimited access to GE aircraft, exclusive use of a furnished New York City
apartment, unrestricted access to a chau¤eured limousine, a leased Mercedes Benz, o¢ce space in New York
City and Connecticut, the services of professional estate and tax advisors, the services of a personal assis-
tant, communications systems and networks at Welchs homes, and bodyguard security for various speaking
engagements.



                                                     73
in Section 3.7, the optimal pay pro le is back-loaded  the optimal dynamic contract e¤ectively
saves for the CEO. As a result, the CEO earns more than his outside option in later years.
The rm must ex-ante commit to overpay later, and allowing the CEO to gradually entrench
himself might be one way of doing so. Hence, forcing a governance improvement onto a rm
could, at least in theory, reduce its value.
Boards. A number of studies nd that various measures of board ine¤ectiveness are associated
with pay practices that favor the CEO (Hallock, 1997; Core, Holthausen, and Larcker, 1999;
Fahlenbrach, 2009; Armstrong, Ittner, and Larcker, 2012). The level of CEO pay tends to in-
crease in board size (negatively related to the pressure an individual director faces to monitor),
the number of outside directors serving on more than three boards (negatively related to their
capacity to monitor), and the number of outsiders appointed by the CEO (negatively related
to their independence). CEO pay also tends to be higher when the board is staggered (re-
ducing directors accountability), when the CEO is chairman of the board (and thus has more
power), and when there are board interlocks, where CEO A serves as director on the board
of CEO B and vice-versa. Consistent with ine¤ective large boards, CEOs wealth-performance
sensitivity decreases in board size (Yermack, 1996; Fahlenbrach, 2009). On the other hand,
the CEO wealth-performance sensitivity is higher when the CEO is chairman and with less
independent boards, consistent with monitoring and incentives being substitutes (Fahlenbrach,
2009). Studies of the link between pay levels and the structure of the remuneration committee,
especially the presence of non-independent directors, tend to nd no e¤ect (Daily, Johnson,
Ellstrand, and Dalton, 1998; Newman and Mozes, 1999; Vafeas, 2003; Anderson and Bizjak,
2003; Conyon, 2006, 2014).
    Several recent studies use three changes to board structures resulting from additions to
the NYSE and Nasdaq listing rules  that boards have a majority of independent directors
and that the nominating and compensation committees be entirely independent  as a quasi-
experiment to study a variety of outcome variables.58 Because the assignment of rms to the
control group ( rms already in compliance) and the treatment group ( rms that needed to make
changes) is not random, this research design hinges on the assumption that the two sets of rms
are not exposed to di¤erent shocks, which would be incorrectly attributed to the treatment.
The results for CEO pay are mixed: Chhaochharia and Grinstein (2009) nd that treated
 rms reduced CEO pay, that the e¤ect was particularly large for rms with low institutional
ownership concentration and no outside blockholders, and that the e¤ect was mostly driven
by the overall board independence requirement. Guthrie, Sokolowsky, and Wan (2012), on the
other hand, show that the overall reduction in CEO pay was almost entirely due to only two
outliers, and that the committee independence requirements in fact increased CEO pay once
the outliers are removed.
  58
    The changes were proposed in 2002, approved by the SEC in November 2003, and came into e¤ect in
2004. See, among others, Chhaochharia and Grinstein (2009), Duchin, Matsusaka, and Ozbas (2010), Guthrie,
Sokolowsky, and Wan (2012), Banerjee, Humphery-Jenner, and Nanda (2015), and Guo and Masulis (2015).


                                                   74
Blockholders and Institutional Investors. Outside blockholders, who can potentially mon-
itor the CEO (see Edmans (2014) and Edmans and Holderness (2017) for surveys), are associ-
ated with compensation practices that seemingly favor shareholders. CEO pay is lower in the
presence of an outside blockholder who owns a stake of at least 5% (Core, Holthausen, and
Larcker, 1999) or a stake larger than the CEOs (Cyert, Kang, and Kumar, 2002). The fraction
of equity compensation in total pay decreases with the total percentage stake held by outside
blockholders, which suggests that blockholders and incentive pay are substitute governance
mechanisms (Mehran, 1995).
    Institutional investors are likely to be better monitors than retail investors, as they typically
have greater expertise and large stakes that make monitoring worthwhile. Consistent with this
intuition, Hartzell and Starks (2003) nd that institutional ownership concentration predicts
both lower CEO pay levels and higher pay-performance sensitivities. Fahlenbrach (2009), on
the other hand, shows that wealth-performance sensitivities are decreasing in institutional own-
ership concentration and in the percentage of equity held by pension funds, and argues that
monitoring and incentives are substitutes.
    Private equity investors hold very large stakes, both as a percentage of company equity
and as a percentage of their own portfolios. They usually have board representation and take
an active role in corporate governance. Based on small and heavily self-selected samples (see
Section 2.5), the evidence suggests that private equity-controlled rms pay their executives at
similar levels as comparable public rms, but use more pay-for-performance and stronger equity
incentives (Cronqvist and Fahlenbrach, 2013; Jackson, 2013; Leslie and Oyer, 2013).
Anti-takeover Provisions and Shareholder Rights. If the threat of a hostile takeover
constrains rent extraction by executives, reducing this threat through anti-takeover provisions
should increase executive pay. Moreover, certain provisions, such as staggered boards, reduce
shareholder rights beyond the takeover context, leading to an even more positive e¤ect on pay.
Consistent with increased rent extraction, CEO pay levels rise after a rm adopts anti-takeover
charter amendments (Borokhovich, Brunarski, and Parrino, 1997). Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick
(2003) develop a broad index of anti-takeover provisions and restrictions on shareholder rights.
Their anti-takeover index is positively correlated with more asymmetric performance bench-
marking (Garvey and Milbourn, 2006), higher levels of CEO pay and lower wealth-performance
sensitivities (Fahlenbrach, 2009), and more rigging of incentive contracts towards favorable
performance metrics (Morse, Nanda, and Seru, 2011).
    Firms decisions to adopt anti-takeover provisions are endogenous, and hence the correlations
between provisions and pay are unlikely to equal their causal e¤ects. The staggered introduction
of laws restricting hostile takeovers across U.S. states between 1985 and 1997 generates more
exogenous variation in takeover threats.59 Bertrand and Mullainathan (1999) compare changes
  59
    So-called Business Combination Laws were adopted by 33 U.S. states and were upheld by the US Supreme
Court in 1987. Karpo¤ and Wittry (2017) discuss challenges in using these laws as source of exogenous variation
in takeover threats.


                                                      75
in CEO pay before and after the laws between rms incorporated in a¤ected states and rms
in other states. Firms without a blockholder show about a 5% increase in CEO pay after
anti-takeover laws are adopted, whereas rms with a blockholder show almost no increases in
pay but instead an increase in the sensitivity of CEO pay to accounting performance. This is
consistent with more rent extraction in rms without large shareholders, and with a substitution
of compensation incentives for takeover threats in rms with large shareholders.


4.5.    Peer Groups
A compensation peer group should be the set of rms with which a company is competing in
the executive labor market, which usually means rms in the same industry and/or of similar
size and complexity. The use of peer groups in setting executive pay has become both more
prevalent and more transparent in recent years. This can be consistent with shareholder value
if it helps to determine the market level of pay, rent extraction if boards choose highly-paid
peers to justify high pay at their rm, or neither if boards simply copy contracts at other rms.
     From 2006, the SEC requires U.S. rms to disclose the composition of any peer groups
used to determine pay. Before mandatory disclosure, Bizjak, Lemmon, and Naveen (2008)
select a random sample of 100 S&P 500 rms in 1997. Reading the compensation committee
reports, they nd that 96 rms used peer groups to set pay, but rms typically did not disclose
the identity of these groups. They thus estimate hypothetical peers using size and industry
benchmarks, and nd that, over 1992-2005, CEOs with pay below the median peer received
larger raises than CEOs above the median. This is consistent with benchmarking taking place,
but also with idiosyncratic shocks to CEO pay being reversed over time. Consistent with
shareholder value rather than rent extraction, they show that the likelihood that a below-
median CEO receives a pay increase is higher if the CEOs tenure is short and performance is
good (consistent with learning models), and if industry sales growth is high, unemployment is
low, and the rm is in a high-tech industry (consistent with a tight labor market).
     The SECs 2006 disclosure rules made it possible to study the actual peer groups chosen.
Even though peers appear to be selected mainly based on sensible criteria (e.g., of similar size
and in the same industry), there is evidence that some rms are opportunistic and choose
highly-paid peers (Faulkender and Yang, 2010; Bizjak, Lemmon, and Nguyen, 2011). There is
some disagreement about the exact mechanism  Faulkender and Yang (2010) argue that rms
choose peers with unusually high pay given their characteristics, while Bizjak, Lemmon, and
Nguyen (2011) argue that rms tend to choose larger peers that pay more to due to their size.
Both studies agree that the choice of peer group predicts pay: controlling for rm and CEO
characteristics, the median pay across peer rms has additional explanatory power. Notably,
almost no rm benchmarks to below the median of the peer group, with more than 30% of
  rms choosing a higher percentile.
     The high pay justi ed by choosing a highly-paid peer group (or a high percentile) could


                                              76
be consistent with either shareholder value (if high pay was necessary to attract or retain a
given CEO) or rent extraction. Consistent with the latter, the choice of highly-paid peers
increases in the CEOs tenure (used as a proxy for entrenchment) and the busyness of a rms
directors (the number of other boards they sit on), and is more prevalent if the CEO is also the
chairman (Faulkender and Yang, 2010). In contrast, Albuquerque, Franco, and Verdi (2013)
argue that the choice of highly-paid peers is a reward for CEO talent. They rst calculate
the pay di¤erence between actually chosen peers and a group of hypothetical peers matched
on rm characteristics. Next, they regress this di¤erence on proxies for CEO talent and poor
governance and nd that both predict the excess pay of the actual peers. Finally, they show
that the tted value from the talent proxies has better explanatory power for CEO pay than
the tted value from the governance proxies.
    The requirement to disclose peer groups after 2006 might have reduced opportunistic behav-
ior, especially since the rst set of disclosed peers was likely chosen before the more stringent
disclosure rules were announced. Faulkender and Yang (2013) study the change in peer groups
from 2006-09 and, contrary to expectations, nd that the selection of highly-paid peers increased
in rms with low institutional, director, and CEO ownership, busy and large boards, or where
shareholders had previously complained about pay. Such changes did not occur passively due
to peers becoming more highly compensated; instead, these rms actively added highly-paid
peers and dropped lowly-paid ones. If the strategic selection of peer groups is a result of rent
extraction, these results suggest that disclosure alone is insu¢cient to deter opportunism.


4.6.       Conclusion
There is little doubt that rent extraction describes individual cases of outrageous executive
pay. Systematic evidence consistent with the rent extraction view comes from observing that
(at least some) rms go to great length to hide pay from shareholders, that (at least some)
executives are rewarded for non-performance, and that executive pay tends to be lower when
corporate governance is stronger.
    A potent criticism of the rent extraction view is that it is unable to explain the large increase
in CEO pay since the 1970s. There is no evidence that corporate governance has weakened
over the past 40 years; instead, most indicators show that shareholders have been empowered
and governance strengthened over this period (Holmström and Kaplan, 2001; Hermalin, 2005;
Kaplan, 2008). It is, however, possible that the desire or ability of managers to extract rents
emerged only as social norms against unequal pay weakened. Piketty and Saez (2003) argue
that such a shift in social norms helps explain the rise in CEO pay and the widening income
inequality in the past three decades, and Levy and Temin (2007) relate this change in norms to
the dismantling of institutions and government policies that prevented extreme pay outcomes
from World War II to the 1970s.60 On the other hand, Kaplan and Rauh (2010, 2013) point out
 60
      However, Frydman and Molloy (2011) suggest that changes in the high tax rates prevalent during this period


                                                       77
that pay has increased even faster in other high-skill professions such as private equity, venture
capital, hedge funds and law, where pay is less disclosed, making social norms less important.


5.     Institutional Inuences
In addition to the shareholder value and rent extraction views, a third perspective is that legal
and institutional constraints and practices are important determinants of executive pay. These
include tax policy, accounting and disclosure rules, and the use of peer groups, compensation
consultants, and proxy advisors. Unlike the shareholder value and rent extraction views, which
contradict each other, institutional inuences overlay both views. Under the rent extraction
view, managers extract rents subject to an outrage constraint (Bebchuk and Fried, 2004),
and try to do so in ways that are hidden from shareholders due to accounting and disclosure
rules. Under the shareholder value view, boards set contracts that maximize value taking into
account, for example, the di¤erential tax treatment of di¤erent compensation instruments.
    This section explores some of the legal and institutional inuences on executive pay. Given
space constraints, we only discuss selected examples of how institutional forces have shaped
pay; for a more comprehensive discussion, we recommend Murphy (2013). The Appendix
presents a users guide to legislation, disclosure requirements, accounting treatments, and
tax treatments of pay.


5.1.     Legislation and Taxation
The starkest way in which governments can a¤ect executive pay is through outright banning of
instruments or practices. For example, executive options used to be banned in many countries,
with both Japan and Korea legalizing options only in 1997 (Kato, Lemmon, Luo, and Schall-
heim, 2005). In the U.S., the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 banned loans from companies to
executives, in part as a response to one high-pro le case: Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco forgiving
his own loan (Murphy, 2013). Independently of the merits of such bans, their introductions and
rescissions o¤er opportunities for empirical research on the costs and bene ts of the banned
practices.
    Changes in taxation have been the main channel through which the legislator has shaped
executive pay in the United States. In 1993, the Clinton administration implemented Section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which limited the tax deductibility of pay for top- ve
executives of public rms to $1 million per executive and year. Quali ed performance-based
pay was not subject to this limit. This tax change (combined with changes to disclosure rules
around the same time) appears to have had large e¤ects (Perry and Zenner, 2001): First, it
slowed the growth of salaries that were already above, at, or close to $1 million. Second, it
led to a substitution towards other compensation categories, with total pay actually increasing.
had at most modest short-run e¤ects on executive pay.


                                                    78
The categories that increased the most were those that counted as quali ed, for which the
law required that the compensation received must be based solely on an increase in the value
of the stock after the grant date.
    This rather arbitrary de nition had an apparently decisive e¤ect on rms choice of com-
pensation instruments. At-the-money options, formula-driven bonuses, and restricted stock
with performance-based vesting are typically counted as quali ed and came to dominate U.S.
executive pay during the 1990s and 2000s. In fact, the surge in executive pay between 1993
and 2000 is almost entirely a surge in at-the-money options (see Section 2.2.1).
    Simple restricted stock with time-based vesting does not count as quali ed under Section
162(m), since such stock still has value even if the stock price falls. This may explain why, after
new accounting rules made options less attractive from 2004 (see Section 5.2), options were
replaced by performance- rather than time-vesting equity (see Section 2.3.3). The de nition of
quali ed performance-based pay also o¤ers an explanation for the lack of indexed options or
options on indexed stock, despite the potential bene ts of relative performance evaluation (see
Section 3.4): Indexed options are not quali ed, since they may pay out without an increase
in the stock price, if the index falls.61


5.2.     Accounting
Firms choices of compensation instruments are also a¤ected by accounting rules. Holding the
economic cost of executive pay constant, rms tend to choose the instrument that minimizes the
charge to accounting earnings. Even though standard economics suggests that only actual costs
matter and accounting charges are irrelevant, there are several reasons why rms care about
reported earnings  executives might receive bonuses that increase in earnings, shareholders
might be confused about the distinction between economic costs and accounting charges, or ex-
ecutives and board members might themselves be confused (see the perceived cost hypothesis
discussed in Section 4.3).
    Arguably the most striking example of accounting a¤ecting pay is the treatment of options
in the U.S. From October 1972, APB Opinion No. 25 required the grant-date value of restricted
stock and the intrinsic value  rather than fair value  of options to be amortized over the vesting
period. Thus, there was no accounting charge for at-the-money or out-of-the-money options,
but a charge for in-the-money options and restricted stock. While FAS 123 (issued in October
1995) recommended that rms expense the fair value of options, this was not required, and
non-expensing rms only had to disclose them in a footnote. Thus, options remained free
from an accounting perspective, in that no accounting expense was incurred at either their
  61
    E¤ective from 2005, another tax rule (Section 409A), aimed at reining in improper tax-deferral of com-
pensation by executives, makes issuing in-the-money or indexed options even more expensive (Walker, 2015).
Income from most conventional at- or out-of-the-money options is not taxed until the option is exercised. Under
Section 409A, compensation from in-the-money or indexed options is taxed at vesting, instead of at exercise,
and is subject to an additional 20% penalty tax.



                                                      79
granting, vesting, or exercise.
    After long and contentious debates, FAS 123R, issued in December 2004, required rms to
expense the grant-date fair value of options over the vesting period (using an option pricing
model chosen by the rm), e¤ective for the rst interim or annual reporting period beginning
after June 15, 2005. This leveled the playing eld between restricted stock and at-the-money
options.62 The use of options fell from 39% of total CEO pay in S&P 1,500 rms prior to FAS
123R (2002-4) to 22% afterwards (2005-8) (Hayes, Lemmon, and Qiu, 2012). In addition, FAS
123R also required rms to expense options granted prior to June 15, 2005 that had not yet
vested, leading to one-third of rms accelerating the vesting of options (Choudhary, Rajgopal,
and Venkatachalam, 2009). This strongly suggests that rms care about the earnings impact
of executive pay, even if the economic cost is unchanged.
    The surge in option compensation during the 1990s thus came at a time when tax policies
made performance-based pay advantageous (see Section 5.1) and when accounting rules allowed
at-the-money options (but not restricted stock) to be granted without an earnings charge.
After the advent of option expensing in 2005, option compensation declined and was gradually
replaced by performance-vesting equity, which continues to receive more favorable tax treatment
than restricted stock (see Section 5.1). These developments support the view that changes in
tax and accounting rules have been the main driver of changes in the composition of U.S.
executive pay during the 1990s and 2000s.
    The non-expensing of at-the-money options prior to 2006 may have had further conse-
quences. Murphy (2013) argues that, because the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) did not require rms to expense the fair value of options and the SEC only re-
quired the number of options to be reported, many boards focused on the number of options
granted, rather than their value. As a result, many rms granted the same number of options
each year, even though the value of an at-the-money option is increasing in the stock price.
This led to a strong correlation between grant-date pay levels and the stock market (Hall and
Murphy, 2003). Shue and Townsend (2017b) argue that this rigidity in option grant numbers
can explain overall time trends in pay. When stock prices rise, the value of options increases,
which, together with downward rigidity in salaries and bonuses, might have led to pay levels
rising in the 1990s and early 2000s. After rms started to report and expense the grant-date
value of options, they were less likely to grant the same number each year, which may explain
why pay levels did not increase during the mid-2000s stock market boom.


5.3.     Compensation Consultants
Boards and their compensation committees often use consultants to guide them on the level
and design of pay. Critics contend that compensation consultants su¤er conicts of interest
  62
    Even though the accounting treatment of restricted stock and at-the-money options is similar after 2005,
at-the-money options continue to receive a more favorable tax treatment (see Section 5.1).



                                                    80
and contribute to the rise and alleged poor design of CEO pay (Bebchuk and Fried, 2004). For
example, they might recommend high pay to increase the probability of being hired again, or
to win mandates for other services, such as pension or tax advice. In the U.S., the SEC does
not require compensation consultants to be independent, but its 2006 disclosure rules required
  rms to disclose the role and identity of all consultants; in 2009 it expanded the rule so that,
if rms spend more than $120,000 on other services from their compensation consultants, they
must disclose the aggregate fees paid for compensation consulting and other services. The
Dodd-Frank Act (2010) stipulates that compensation committees can only hire consultants
after taking into account their independence, and required rms to disclose the nature of any
conicts and how such conicts are being addressed.
    The evidence on the relationship between consultants and pay is mixed. In the rst year after
the 2006 disclosure rules required U.S. rms to reveal the use of compensation consultants, 78%
of S&P 1,500 rms used at least one consultant (of which 17% use two or more), and another 9%
purchased compensation surveys prepared by consultants (Murphy and Sandino, 2010). While
using consultants is associated with higher executive pay, this di¤erence becomes insigni cant
when controlling for corporate governance (Armstrong, Ittner, and Larcker, 2012). Hence,
higher pay might be caused by di¤erences in rm characteristics, not by using consultants.
Consistent with this idea, rms with ex-ante higher and more complex CEO pay are more
likely to hire a compensation consultant (Murphy and Sandino, 2015).
    Looking directly for potential conicts of interest, neither Cadman, Carter, and Hillegeist
(2010) nor Armstrong, Ittner, and Larcker (2012) nd higher pay or lower pay-performance
sensitivities for clients of multi-service consultants, de ned as consultants that also o¤er other
services, such as pension and tax advice. However, using actual data on other services provided
by compensation consultants, Murphy and Sandino (2010) show that CEO pay is higher in U.S.
and Canadian rms if other services are provided, and that pay is higher in Canadian rms
when the fees paid to consultants for other services are large relative to those for compensation
advice. While this correlation is suggestive of conicts of interest, they also nd that CEO
pay is 13% higher in U.S. rms if the consultant works for the compensation committee rather
than management, inconsistent with the idea that consultants recommend higher pay to curry
favor with managers. In the UK, Conyon, Peck, and Sadler (2009), after con rming that
compensation consultants are associated with higher pay, nd no evidence that pay is higher
when consultants provide other services.
    The 2009 SEC rules, which require rms to disclose fees paid to consultants for both com-
pensation and other services, caused a restructuring of the consulting industry. Partners from
several large, multiservice consulting rms left and created new, specialized rms o¤ering only
compensation advice. Chu, Faasse, and Rau (2017) show that the market share of such special-
ist consultants increased from 35% in 2006 to 70% in 2012. Notably, the client rms most likely
to switch from a multiservice consultant to the related newly spun-o¤ specialist consultant are
  rms where CEO pay is high and the board is more likely to be under the CEOs inuence.


                                               81
5.4.     Proxy Advisory Firms
Another important institutional inuence on executive pay are the recommendations of proxy
advisory rms. Proxy advisors supply voting recommendations to institutional investors on how
to vote their shares on executive pay, director elections, mergers and acquisitions, and other
shareholder votes. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) is the largest proxy advisor and
a dominant player, with approximately 1,600 institutional investor clients in 2016, while Glass
Lewis (GL) is the closest competitor. The importance of proxy advisors for U.S. executive pay
increased in 2003, when the SEC required mutual funds to disclose the procedures behind their
voting behavior, and again in 2011, when the Dodd-Frank Act led to the SEC implementing a
non-binding say-on-pay vote (see Section 7.2). Proxy advisors typically provide a quantitative
and qualitative analysis of executive pay plans, structured around certain categories (e.g., pay
for performance, disclosures), assign a rating for each category, and issue an overall voting
recommendation (Ertimur, Ferri, and Oesch, 2013).
    Proxy advisor support has a large e¤ect on the likelihood of say-on-pay votes succeeding.
Before 2012, ISS used to only undertake a deeper analysis of compensation policies for rms
with 1- and 3-year total shareholder returns below the industry median. Malenko and Shen
(2016) exploit this rule for a regression discontinuity analysis: Falling narrowly below this cuto¤
led to greater scrutiny and a 15% increase (from 10% to 25%) in the probability of a negative
ISS recommendation. The negative recommendation in turn led to a 25% reduction in say-on-
pay voting support. This suggests that many institutional investors e¤ectively outsource their
voting decisions to proxy advisors.
    Proxy advisors have been criticized for blanket policies recommending or discouraging cer-
tain pay practices. For example, both ISS and GL recommend clawbacks and bonuses dependent
upon predetermined formulas (rather than discretion), and recommend against tax gross-ups
for golden parachutes, restricted stock without performance-based vesting, and single-trigger
change-of-control arrangements.63 While likely desirable in many settings, these practices are
unlikely to be universally optimal. Larcker, McCall, and Ormazabal (2015) show that rms
change their compensation policies prior to say-on-pay votes in a manner consistent with proxy
advisor recommendations, particularly if the rm is likely to receive a negative proxy advisor
recommendation in the absence of a policy change, if directors had received below-median sup-
port at the previous annual meeting, and if the rm has above-median ownership by dispersed
investors. Such changes are met by negative stock market reactions, suggesting that the de-
sire to win proxy advisor support leads rms to cater to their policies rather than implement
optimal pay structures.64
  63
      In such arrangements, acquisition or change of control leads to the executives stock immediately vesting.
The alternative is double-trigger, whereby stock only vests upon acquisition or change of control if the executive
is also terminated.
   64
      ISS has also been criticized for conicts of interest stemming from selling both proxy voting services to
investors and consulting services to corporate issuers (Li, 2017).



                                                       82
    In contrast, Ertimur, Ferri, and Oesch (2013) paint a more positive picture. They nd that
proxy advisor recommendations are not necessarily one-size- ts-all  the presence of certain
compensation policies does not automatically translate into negative recommendations; instead,
proxy advisors take into account the rationale provided by the rm, the severity of the issue,
and the quality of the overall compensation plan. Moreover, an against recommendation is
less likely to lead to a negative vote for shareholders with large holdings. This suggests that
large investors do their own research instead of blindly following advisors. Notably, there is
considerable heterogeneity in proxy advisors say-on-pay vote recommendations: among rms
with an against recommendation from at least one of ISS and GL, the proxy advisors agree
only 17.9% of the time.


6.    The E¤ects of Executive Compensation
Much of the debate about executive compensation focuses on the determinants of pay, in par-
ticular the extent to which it is driven by shareholder value or rent extraction considerations.
An arguably even more important question is the e¤ects of pay. Theory has relatively clear
predictions. The models of Section 3.2 suggest that higher incentives should increase rm value
gross of CEO pay. Section 3.5 predicts that, controlling for delta, options should cause CEOs
to take more risk, whereas Section 3.6 predicts that debt-like pay should cause CEOs to man-
age their rms more conservatively. Section 3.7 suggests that short-horizon incentives should
lead CEOs to take short-term actions. Moreover, setting any dimension of pay  the level,
sensitivity, stock vs. option mix, debt vs. equity mix, or horizon  closer to its optimum should
increase rm value net of CEO pay.
    However, while the theoretical predictions are relatively clear, empirically showing that
executive pay has causal e¤ects is extremely di¢cult. Compensation arrangements are the
endogenous outcome of a complex process involving the executive, board, compensation con-
sultants, and the managerial labor market. As a result, they are inevitably correlated with
a huge number of observable and unobservable rm, industry, and executive characteristics.
This makes it impossible to interpret any observed correlation between executive pay and rm
outcomes as a causal relationship. For example, CEO pay and rm performance may be cor-
related because pay a¤ects performance, because rm performance a¤ects pay, or because an
unobserved rm or CEO characteristic a¤ects both.
    Identifying causal e¤ects of pay on rm behavior or performance requires instrumental
variables or natural experiments that create quasi-random variation in executive pay. Given the
nature of the pay-setting process, there are very few valid instruments that a¤ect pay without
also a¤ecting the outcome variable of interest through some other channel (thus violating the
exclusion restriction). In this section, we discuss earlier observational studies that do not
show causality, and highlight a number of recent studies that identify causal e¤ects of pay
by exploiting regulatory changes, discontinuities, or institutional frictions in the pay-setting

                                               83
process. However, measuring the causal e¤ects of pay on behavior and performance remains
one of the most important challenges of this literature and an open question for future research.


6.1.    The E¤ects of Equity Incentives on Firm Value
The e¤ect of managers ownership incentives on rm value is one of the fundamental questions in
compensation research. A sizeable literature, going back to Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny (1988),
relates rm value, usually measured as Tobins Q, to executives equity incentives (McConnell
and Servaes, 1990; Mehran, 1995; Agrawal and Knoeber, 1996; Himmelberg, Hubbard, and
Palia, 1999; Demsetz and Villalonga, 2001; Habib and Ljungqvist, 2005; Kim and Lu, 2011).
The results are mixed. Most studies nd a positive correlation between executives equity in-
centives and rm values, at least at low levels of e¤ective ownership, with some evidence that
the correlation weakens or even turns negative at high ownership levels. One interpretation
of this pattern is that increases in managerial equity holdings initially improve incentives but
subsequently lead to managerial entrenchment (Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1988). However,
this pattern is not robust across studies, and several papers fail to nd any relationship be-
tween rm value and executives equity stakes (e.g., Agrawal and Knoeber, 1996; Himmelberg,
Hubbard, and Palia, 1999; Demsetz and Villalonga, 2001).
    These correlations are in any case di¢cult to interpret. Even though the models of Section
3.2 suggest that higher incentives should increase rm value gross of CEO pay, this does not
imply a positive cross-sectional relationship between equity incentives and rm values. If rms
set incentives optimally, the derivative of value with respect to incentives should be zero for
a particular rm. Cross-sectional di¤erences in incentives between rms are then caused by
di¤erences in the fundamental inputs to that optimization process  executive, rm, or labor
market characteristics  that themselves have e¤ects on rm value (Demsetz, 1983; Demsetz and
Lehn, 1985). As a result, any empirical correlation between equity incentives and rm values
is a mix of the causal e¤ect of incentives and of di¤erences in fundamentals. Observational
studies cannot distinguish between the two, and the observed correlations might even have the
opposite sign of the causal e¤ect.
    Unfortunately, valid instruments for managerial ownership are extremely di¢cult to nd,
because all known determinants of ownership likely either directly drive rm value or are cor-
related with other drivers of value. Take CEO age, which has been used as an instrument for
ownership. Even if CEO age does not directly a¤ect rm value, whatever drives cross-sectional
variation in age may do so. For example, poor governance may make it more likely that a rm
has an old CEO, and also reduce rm value; alternatively, trouble in the rms business model
may lead to a rm retaining an old CEO, and also reduce rm value.
    An analogy with lab experiments is instructive. In a lab experiment, the researcher controls
the variation in the treatment (e.g., ownership) and is able to randomize it at will. With an
instrumental variable, the instrument is supposed to achieve a similar randomization, but is


                                               84
not controlled by the researcher. It is therefore crucial to identify the mechanism that creates
variation in the instrument, to then argue that whatever moves the instrument does not a¤ect
the outcome variable, except through its e¤ect on ownership (the treatment). Papers often claim
validity of an instrument by arguing that it does not directly a¤ect the outcome of interest, but
this alone is insu¢cient, since what moves the instrument may also move the outcome variable.


6.2.     The E¤ects of Executive Pay on Behavior
A second set of studies investigates the relationship between executive pay and rm behavior.
We organize this section by the aspect of rm behavior examined.

6.2.1.   The E¤ects of Pay on Manipulation and Short-Term Behavior

Any incentive scheme creates incentives to manipulate the performance metric(s). Manipulation
often involves short-termism  inating current performance at the expense of long-term value
 but can also entail smoothing performance over time, especially if the incentive scheme is
concave. Even though any incentive contract is prone to be exploited, manipulation often stems
from nonlinearities and discontinuities in performance measurements or payo¤ functions (see
Sections 2.3.3, 2.3.4, and 3.7.1), which can also create opportunities for causal identi cation.
First, any incentive scheme that measures performance at one point in time, instead of over an
extended period, invites short-termism. Second, oors, caps, jumps, and other nonlinearities
in the mapping from performance into payo¤s create incentives to manipulate. Finally, even
without discontinuities and nonlinearities, incentive schemes based on performance metrics
di¤erent from long-term shareholder value (e.g., based on sales or pro ts) invite increases in
these metrics unrelated or negatively related to shareholder value (Kerr, 1975).
    Manipulation typically takes one of two forms. The less damaging type leaves the rms
operating and investment policies unchanged but manipulates the performance measure, for
example by overstating accruals, booking sales into a di¤erent period, or strategically timing
news releases. The more damaging type changes the rms operating and investment policies
to boost short-term performance, for instance by cutting R&D or advertising.
    A large literature examines the link between executives equity ownership incentives and
manipulation. Based on observational studies, there appears to be a positive correlation between
stock and option holdings and earnings manipulation (Cheng and War eld, 2005; Bergstresser
and Philippon, 2006; Burns and Kedia, 2006; Efendi, Srivastava, and Swanson, 2007; Peng and
Röell, 2008; Johnson, Ryan, and Tian, 2009). However, there is disagreement about which part
of CEOs equity incentives is the culprit, with some studies linking manipulation to option (but
not stock) holdings, others linking manipulation to stock (but not option) holdings, and again
others linking it to unrestricted (but not restricted) stock. Moreover, the evidence of a link
between equity incentives and accounting irregularities is not unanimous. Erickson, Hanlon,
and Maydew (2006) nd that executives equity incentives are unrelated to accusations of

                                               85
accounting fraud by the SEC, whereas Armstrong, Jagolinzer, and Larcker (2010) nd that
CEO equity incentives have, if anything, a modestly negative e¤ect on restatements, SEC
enforcement releases, and class action lawsuits. Interpreting these observational studies is
di¢cult  ownership incentives and manipulation are both endogenous choice variables.
    Theoretically, it is sensitivity to short-term performance that is most likely to induce manip-
ulation. A direct measure of CEOs short-term incentives is the quantity of equity scheduled to
vest in a given period, because CEOs sell a large chunk of equity when it vests (Edmans, Fang,
and Lewellen, 2017; Edmans, Goncalves-Pinto, Groen-Xu, and Wang, 2016). The quantity of
vesting equity depends on equity grants made several years prior and is thus likely exogenous to
the current contracting environment. Empirically, the amount of equity scheduled to vest in a
quarter is correlated with cuts in R&D and capital expenditure growth, positive analyst forecast
revisions, positive earnings guidance, and a greater likelihood that the rm announces earnings
that beat analyst forecasts by a narrow (but not wide) margin (Edmans, Fang, and Lewellen,
2017). This suggests that short horizons encourage CEOs to prioritize short-term earnings
over long-term investment. Moreoever, CEOs release signi cantly more news in months in
which equity is scheduled to vest, and reallocate it away from the prior and subsequent month
(Edmans, Goncalves-Pinto, Groen-Xu, and Wang, 2016). This increased disclosure arises for
discretionary (but not non-discretionary) news, and for positive (but not neutral or negative)
news.
    Achieving as-good-as-random variation in the length of vesting periods across rms or ex-
ecutives is usually impossible. However, Ladika and Sautner (2016) study the adoption of FAS
123R, which required U.S. rms to expense unvested options starting from either 2005 or 2006,
depending on their scal year end. To avoid a reduction in earnings, some rms accelerated the
vesting of outstanding options before the rule came into e¤ect, and the timing of this acceler-
ation depends on their scal year end, which is likely exogenous to investment opportunities.
Accelerated vesting, instrumented using scal year ends, led to a fall in both R&D and capital
expenditure. Accelerating rms stock prices initially rose but subsequently fell, consistent with
short-term stock price manipulation.
    Executives bene t from temporarily lower stock prices in periods in which they expect
to receive at-the-money options, because doing so reduces the options strike price. Aboody
and Kasznik (2000), Chauvin and Shenoy (2001), and Daines, McQueen, and Schonlau (2016)
exploit the fact that many rms grant options on roughly the same day each year, so the grant
date in a particular year is predetermined by last years date. Consistent with manipulation,
such scheduled awards are preceded by negative abnormal returns and the release of more
negative news, while more positive news is released after the award. A concern is that all
three studies use actual grants instead of predicted grants, even though rms endogenously
choose each year whether to remain on the xed schedule. Consequently, at least some of the
return and news patterns around grants may not be due to manipulation but due to rms
opportunistically changing the grant schedule.


                                                86
    Equity grants and holdings are far from the only source of manipulation incentives. The
payo¤ structures of performance-based equity grants (Section 2.3.3) and of conventional bonus
plans (Section 2.3.4) feature caps, oors, targets, and jumps that make manipulation likely.
Unsurprisingly, earnings-based bonus plans have been linked to earnings manipulation (Healy,
1985; Holthausen, Larcker, and Sloan, 1995; Guidry, Leone, and Rock, 1999). The intensity
and direction of the manipulation depends on where pre-manipulation earnings are relative to
the bonus schemes cap and oor. For cash and equity grants contingent on accounting metrics,
Bennett, Bettis, Gopalan, and Milbourn (2017) nd signi cant clustering of performance just
above both the target and the threshold performance levels. This is consistent with executives
taking short-term actions to meet their performance goals, but also going no further to avoid
ratcheting up future goals. Executives appear to use both accruals and cuts to discretionary
expenditures (R&D, SG&A) to meet their goals, and manipulation appears to be worse for
grants that pay o¤ in cash (i.e., for conventional bonus plans) than for performance-based
equity grants. For performance-based equity, Bizjak, Hayes, and Kalpathy (2015) nd evidence
of real earnings manipulation (cuts in R&D, advertising, and SG&A) in years in which earnings-
based grants expire.
    In closing, we note that virtually any incentive contract has unintended consequences and
causes manipulation of the performance measure. It is important to stress that this does not
imply that incentive contracts are worse than no incentive contract. The incentives to manipu-
late can be minimized by avoiding nonlinearities and discontinuities in both the measurement
of performance and in the mapping of performance into payo¤s.

6.2.2.      The E¤ects of Pay on Risk Taking

Virtually every element of pay a¤ects executives incentives to take risk. Even simple shares in
a levered rm are options on rm value and may increase risk, especially if the rm is close to
bankruptcy, or decrease it if the executive is su¢ciently risk-averse. Section 3.5 explained that
the e¤ect of options is similarly ambiguous: while an option has vega (positive sensitivity to
volatility), it also has delta (positive sensitivity to rm value), which may induce a risk-averse
manager to reduce volatility. Caps and oors and other nonlinearities in bonus schemes and
performance-based equity can either increase or decrease risk-taking incentives (see Sections
2.3.3 and 2.3.4), and debt-based pay reduces them (see Section 3.6).65
    Empirical studies typically measure a CEOs incentives to take risk using his equity vega 
the sensitivity of his stock and options to changes in stock return volatility. The equity vega
of a share is zero, so this measure collapses to the vega of his options. However, if managers
actions a¤ect overall rm values rather than equity values, the correct measure of risk-taking
incentives in a levered rm is the sensitivity to asset volatility (asset vega), which Chesney,
Stromberg, and Wagner (2017) measure. Finally, we are not aware of any attempt to measure
 65
      Johnson and Tian (2000) calculate the risk-taking incentives from performance-based options.



                                                      87
the risk-taking incentives that stem from non-equity pay; doing so may be a fruitful area for
future research.
    While pay-induced manipulation is typically negative for long-run value, pay-induced risk-
taking may either increase or decrease rm value. Diversi ed shareholders are unconcerned by
idiosyncratic risk and charge the market price for exposure to systematic risk. An undiversi ed
executive, on the other hand, may turn down positive-NPV projects that increase risk, in
which case an increase in risk-taking incentives would be positive for rm value. In contrast,
excessively convex schemes can cause executives to choose negative-NPV projects that increase
volatility.
    Observational studies typically con rm the theoretical prediction that stronger equity incen-
tives (higher delta) are associated with less risk-taking, while convex equity incentives (higher
vega) are associated with more (see, for example, Agrawal and Mandelker, 1987; DeFusco,
Johnson, and Zorn, 1990; Tufano, 1996; Guay, 1999; Rajgopal and Shevlin, 2002; Lewellen,
2006; Coles, Daniel, and Naveen, 2006; Armstrong and Vashishtha, 2012). However, it is again
di¢cult to interpret these correlations as causal. For example, rms whose business strategies
require executives to choose high risk will optimally compensate with convex instruments.
    Moving towards causal identi cation, Hayes, Lemmon, and Qiu (2012) exploit the fact that
FAS 123R required options to be expensed after 2005 or 2006. As predicted, after 2006, rms
across the U.S. used fewer options and reduced risk. However, since the regulatory change
a¤ected all rms, the reduction in risk could result from other economy-wide factors that
changed in 2006. Identifying regulatory changes that a¤ect only some rms within an economy
would be promising, as it would allow construction of both a treatment and control group.
    Studying changing incentives for the same executive over time, Shue and Townsend (2017a)
exploit the fact that options are granted according to multi-year plans. In xed number (value)
plans, the executive receives the same number (value) of options each year within a cycle. This
feature motivates two instruments. The rst uses xed value plans alone and exploits the fact
that, at the start of a new cycle, there is a discrete increase in the value of option grants,
on average. The authors thus use the predicted rst year of a new xed value cycle as an
instrument. The second uses both xed number and xed value plans. When stock returns
are high, the value of xed-number grants rises, but (by de nition) the value of xed-value
grants is una¤ected. They compare risk taking between xed number and xed value rms; to
ensure that stock returns are una¤ected by the CEO, they study industry returns. Using both
instruments, the authors nd that exogenous increases in options are associated with greater
risk-taking.66
  66
    Consistent with a positive causal e¤ect of options on risk taking, Gormley, Matsa, and Milbourn (2013) show
that rms reduce option compensation when shareholders desire a reduction in risky investments. Similarly,
Akins, Bitting, De Angelis, and Gaulin (2017) nd that, when creditors have control due to a loan covenant
violation, option compensation falls.




                                                      88
6.2.3.   The E¤ects of Pay on Policies, Pro tability, and Executive Retention

Other studies link executive pay to a variety of corporate policies, acquisitions, pro tability, and
executive retention. Early studies focus on accounting-based long-term incentive plans. The
introduction of such plans is followed by increases in capital investment (Larcker, 1983) and
pro tability (Kumar and Sopariwala, 1992). More recent studies investigate the correlation of
stock and option holdings with a variety of outcomes. Equity incentives have been associated
with better operating performance (Core and Larcker, 2002), more and better acquisitions
(Datta, Iskandar-Datta, and Raman, 2001; Cai and Vijh, 2007), larger restructurings and
layo¤s (Dial and Murphy, 1995; Brookman, Chang, and Rennie, 2007), and more voluntary
liquidations (Mehran, Nogler, and Schwartz, 1998). Options are also linked to lower dividends
(Lambert, Lanen, and Larcker, 1989) and to a shift from dividends to share repurchases (Fenn
and Liang, 2001; Kahle, 2002), likely because options are not usually dividend protected. Again,
these correlations do not imply causal relationships  for example, rms about to undertake
acquisitions or restructurings may increase equity pay to boost incentives.
    Turning to executive retention, shorter-duration contracts are correlated with more CEO
turnover (Gopalan, Huang, and Maharjan, 2015). Suggestive of a causal e¤ect of vesting
requirements on retention, CEO turnover increases after previously granted option or stock
grants vest. Further evidence of a causal e¤ect comes from Jochem, Ladika, and Sautner
(2016), who study accelerated vesting caused by the introduction of option expensing in 2005
and 2006 (similar to Ladika and Sautner, 2016). The accelerated vesting led to voluntary CEO
turnover rising from 6% to 19% per year.
    Shareholders sometimes submit proposals to the annual shareholders meeting that advocate
that a rm implement long-term incentives, either in the form of restricted stock, restricted
options, or long-term incentive plans. To estimate the e¤ects of such long-term incentives,
Flammer and Bansal (2017) use a regression discontinuity design that compares proposals
that narrowly pass to those that narrowly fail. Narrowly passing a proposal increases long-
term operating pro tability and sales growth. Performance declines slightly in the short-run,
consistent with a long-term orientation involving short-run sacri ces. The market reaction to
a successful proposal is positive, suggesting that the long-run bene ts outweigh the short-run
costs. Successful proposals are also associated with increases in innovation and measures of
corporate social responsibility.

6.2.4.   The E¤ects of Employment Contracts

Fixed-term employment contracts can a¤ect executive horizons and create discontinuous changes
in horizons around contract termination dates. Cziraki and Groen-Xu (2016) hand-collect em-
ployment contracts for S&P 1500 CEOs and nd that approximately one quarter are xed-term
(i.e., have an explicit termination date), with the remainder being at-will. Dismissing a CEO
before the termination date is more expensive than not renewing a contract; indeed, they nd


                                                89
that turnover odds fall by 30% from the year just before a renewal to just after, and the
sensitivity of turnover to performance also falls.
    Since the termination date is determined at the start of the contract, which is several years
in advance (modal length of 3 years, with some contracts lasting over 10 years), it is arguably
uncorrelated with current investment opportunities. However, if executives are concerned about
being let go at the end of the current contract, they might change their behavior as the termi-
nation date comes close. Consistent with this intuition, Cziraki and Groen-Xu (2016) nd that
an approaching termination date is associated with lower stock return volatility, lower idio-
syncratic risk, and lower investment. González-Uribe and Groen-Xu (2016) show that greater
time-to-expiry is associated with higher-quality innovation  one additional year remaining on
the CEOs contract is associated with 6.5% more annual citations per patent. Similar results
arise when using a 2002 U.K. regulation that shortened CEO employment contracts. In the
same vein, Liu and Xuan (2016) show that impending contract expirations are associated with
earnings manipulation and the withholding of negative news, but also with higher acquisition
announcement returns. Hence, approaching contract renewal dates might have both positive
and negative incentive e¤ects.


7.     Policy Implications
The perception that executive pay includes substantial rent extraction, or simply the percep-
tion that high levels of pay are unfair, has led to many commentators proposing either pay
regulations or changes to best practices. This section critically evaluates many of the policy
proposals that have been suggested and, in some cases, already been implemented (see the
Appendix).


7.1.    The Role for Regulation
Before evaluating speci c policies, we introduce a framework to identify the circumstances under
which regulation is desirable. Before deciding whether to intervene, we propose that regulators
ask the following questions:
What is the Market Failure? If shareholders (or their board representatives) are empowered,
informed, and motivated, if boards are acting in shareholders interest, and if shareholders
objective function is aligned with social welfare, there is no role for intervention. Because
shareholders bear both the direct cost of pay and the losses from ine¢cient incentives, they
should choose optimal contracts. Thus, regulation can only be bene cial when there are market
failures.
    The main cause of market failures is externalities, i.e., e¤ects of rms compensation choices
on third parties. One set of potential externalities is on rival rms competing for executive
talent. In Bénabou and Tirole (2016), competition causes rms to o¤er high incentives to

                                               90
attract able managers, but high incentives induce managers to shirk on unincentivized tasks. A
compensation committee will internalize the e¤ect of high incentives on the CEOs willingness
to undertake unincentivized tasks, but not how high incentives force rival rms to also o¤er
high incentives. Similarly, Acharya and Volpin (2010) and Dicks (2012) show that if one rm
overpays its executives (e.g., due to poor governance), other rms must do so also to remain
competitive, even if they are well-governed. Bereskin and Cicero (2013) nd evidence of such
contagion. Changes in Delaware case law around 1995 strengthened rms ability to resist
hostile takeovers, which in turn led to CEO pay rising by 33% in Delaware-incorporated rms
with a staggered board and no external blockholder. In turn, pay in non-Delaware-incorporated
industry rivals rose by 34%.
    A second set of potential externalities is on other stakeholders. Shareholders might inten-
tionally choose contracts that induce executives to improve shareholder value at the expense
of other stakeholders, for example by mistreating workers, expropriating bondholders via risk-
taking, or polluting the environment. Usually, costs imposed on others are charged back to the
  rm (and thus shareholders) through, e.g., higher wages or higher interest rates. In case of an
externality, this feedback mechanism is broken. For example, bondholders in too-big-too-fail
banks might not raise interest rates when executives are increasing risk because they expect
a (taxpayer-funded) bailout if the bank fails. Even though externalities on other stakeholders
can justify regulating pay, addressing the harmful actions directly (e.g., through restrictions on
bank risk taking) may often be more e¤ective.
    Social welfare depends not only on total surplus (e¢ciency) but also its distribution (equal-
ity). Thus, a third externality of high executive pay is on income inequality. However, given
that top executives are only a very small proportion of the total population, the e¤ect of their
pay on overall inequality is likely to be small. Kaplan and Rauh (2010, 2013) show that, in the
U.S. (the country where executive pay is highest), executive pay has risen more slowly than
pay in other occupations such as private equity, venture capital, hedge funds and law, and has
contributed little to the overall rise in income inequality. In the U.K., Bell and van Reenen
(2014) show that most of the gains at the top of the income distribution have gone to nance
professionals. Thus, to the extent that inequality is a concern, it may be better addressed by
an income or wealth tax, which is much broader than a regulation targeted at top executives
alone.
    In addition to externalities, a market failure also arises if shareholders or boards are unable
to implement the contract that maximizes shareholder value, for example because shareholders
are inattentive or ine¤ective. This makes excessive pay a symptom of a more general corporate
governance problem within the rm, which may manifest in many other negative outcomes.67
Thus, the optimal response may be to address the underlying cause of poor governance, such
as dispersed ownership or non-independent boards.
  67
    For example, Biggersta¤, Cicero, and Puckett (2015) nd that option backdating is a symptom of more
general corporate culture issues.


                                                 91
    Overall, it is unlikely that the textbook scenario in which shareholders are fully engaged
and perfectly aligned with social welfare, and boards are perfectly aligned with shareholder
value, holds in all cases. Market failures do exist. However, identifying the market failure
should still be a necessary condition before regulating pay, and will highlight the areas in which
a regulatory approach is likely to be e¤ective or counterproductive.
Are Pay Regulations the Best Response to Market Failure? Even if there is a market
failure, it is not clear that pay regulations will be able to address it. Regulators are typically
less well informed than boards and shareholders about the rm, the performance of the CEO,
and the managerial labor market in which the rm is hiring. If the problem is that boards are
captured by the CEO, or shareholders are dispersed, then strengthening governance through
board independence requirements or guidelines, or granting activist shareholders proxy access,
can be a better solution than regulating pay. If the problem is a divergence between shareholder
value and social welfare caused by externalities from CEO actions, it may again not be pay
that should be regulated. Changing executives behavior by regulating pay is often less e¤ective
than directly curtailing the activity that causes the harm to others.
Do the Bene ts of Regulation Exceed the Costs? While market failures inevitably exist,
regulation to address them may itself be costly and have unintended consequences. Regulation
is usually one-size- ts-all and cannot be adapted to a rms particular circumstances. As a
result, regulation may hamper well-intentioned boards more than it constrains captured ones.
For example, a ban on severance pay for top executives harms rms in which severance pay is
e¢cient (see Section 3.7.2).
    Regulations are also frequently circumvented, and doing so can result in even more ine¢cient
pay practices. Section 5 discusses several interventions (some implemented by regulators, others
advocated by shareholders) which, although well-intentioned, both increased the level of pay
and reduced its link with performance. Murphy (2012) describes how the history of executive
pay regulation is lled with unintended consequences and concludes that with few exceptions,
the regulations have generally been either ine¤ective or counterproductive.
    There are other ways to reform pay besides hard regulation. The government can set policy
guidelines rather than prescriptions, which can either be soft recommendations or hard
comply-or-explain principles. Under both forms, companies have the option to deviate from
the guidelines if doing so would be optimal for their particular circumstances. Introducing such
guidelines can still be valuable if benchmarking or standardization of contracts makes it other-
wise di¢cult to deviate from an ine¢cient status quo. Similarly, shareholders can themselves
issue guidelines for rms that they own stakes in, as is done by some large institutional investors
(e.g., the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund).

7.2.    Potential Areas For Reform
We now describe and evaluate several speci c regulations that have been proposed or imple-
mented, in part using the above framework.
Disclosure. Mandating greater pay disclosure aims to empower shareholders. Given detailed
information, shareholders can decide whether the current contract is optimal, and act against it
if appropriate. Another rationale is to name and shame rms that adopt suboptimal compen-
sation policies (typically interpreted as high CEO pay) and encourage customers, employees,
or other stakeholders to walk away from such rms.
    The required level of pay disclosure has been increasing over time (see the Appendix). The
U.S. requires publication of the main pay components for the three highest paid executives
of public rms since 1934. These disclosure requirements were expanded in 1978, 1992, 2006,
and 2010, usually in response to perceived abuses (Murphy, 2012). Other countries introduced
detailed disclosure requirements or comply-or-explain recommendations in the 1990s and 2000s
(Canada in 1993, the U.K. in 1995, New Zealand in 1997, Ireland and South Africa in 2000,
and Australia in 2003). In 2003, the European Commission recommended detailed executive
pay disclosure for public rms to its EU member states.
    The evidence on the e¤ects of disclosure on executive pay is mixed. Firms that lobbied
against the 1992 tightening of U.S. disclosure rules had positive stock returns when the new
rules were adopted, suggesting that the rules addressed a governance problem for these rms
(Lo, 2003). CEO pay tends to become more closely linked to performance following improved
disclosure (Park, Nelson, and Huson, 2001). However, if anything, pay levels rise (Park, Nelson,
and Huson, 2001; Balsam, Gordon, and Li, 2016; Gipper, 2016; Mas, 2016), potentially because
executives can more easily see what their peers receive. For example, the increased disclosure
of perks due to the SECs 1978 rules was followed by a marked increase in the use of perks.
Disclosure also means that CEO pay becomes a public matter a¤ected by politicians, the media,
and trade unions, who may have objectives far di¤erent from shareholder or stakeholder value
(Murphy, 2012).
Say on Pay. Say-on-pay rules empower shareholders by giving them a binding or advisory vote
on executive pay. The e¤ectiveness of say-on-pay depends on the prevalence of rent extraction
by executives, on how engaged and informed shareholders are, and on the details of the say-on-
pay rule (see the Appendix).
    The U.K. was the rst to adopt say-on-pay legislation, requiring in 2002 that rms hold
an annual non-binding vote on the directors remuneration report. From October 1, 2013, the
U.K. split the report into two parts. The rst is the forward-looking policy report, which
stipulates how the rm will determine pay in the future  for example, how pay will be linked
to performance metrics, and the existence of any exit payments. Here, companies are required
to adopt a binding vote at least once every three years. The second is the backward-looking
implementation report that describes how the board determined realized pay over the past

                                              93
year, for which the vote continues to be annual and non-binding. A negative vote on the
implementation report requires the company to have a binding vote on its remuneration policy
the following year. In the U.S., there is a single remuneration report. Section 951 of the
Dodd-Frank Act led to the SEC implementing a non-binding say-on-pay vote for executives
e¤ective from January 21, 2011. The Netherlands (2004), Australia (2005), Sweden (2006),
Norway (2007), Denmark (2007), and Switzerland (2014) have adopted binding votes. The
EUs Shareholder Rights Directive, approved in March 2017, requires a binding vote on the
policy report for executives every three years (article 9A), and a non-binding vote on the
implementation report every year (article 9B).
    Despite considerable public support, say-on-pay remains controversial (Larcker, McCall, Or-
mazabal, and Tayan, 2012). First, shareholders usually have less information than directors.
Awards are sometimes based on subjective performance measures, which may be business sen-
sitive or di¢cult to communicate to shareholders. Moreover, many shareholders have small
stakes and thus insu¢cient incentives to analyze nuanced features of pay; they may thus fo-
cus on headline gures such as pay levels that may be less important to rm value. Even if
shareholders recognize their relative ignorance, institutional investors may be pressured to vote
on pay decisions since such votes are publicly disclosed. As a consequence, boards may make
ine¢cient changes to executive pay to cater to ill-informed or inattentive shareholders. Consis-
tent with this concern, Kronlund and Sandy (2016) nd that, in years in which U.S. rms have
say-on-pay votes, they improve the optics of pay (reducing salaries and golden parachutes) but
worsen more hidden dimensions (increasing pensions), causing overall pay to be higher. Alter-
natively, shareholders may outsource their say-on-pay voting decisions to proxy advisory rms,
with potentially negative consequences for shareholder value (see Section 5.4).
    Second, say-on-pay may unintentionally increase pay levels to compensate for the risk that
shareholders overturn the contract that executives have agreed with the board. Third, say-
on-pay may divert monitoring away from other rm policies (e.g., innovation and corporate
social responsibility), which may have greater e¤ects on both shareholder value and society.
In particular, if say-on-pay votes are public and likely to be scrutinized, institutional investors
may overly focus on pay votes at the expense of less visible forms of monitoring.
    Despite these concerns, the evidence is supportive of say-on-pay creating shareholder value.
Cuñat, Giné, and Guadalupe (2016) study shareholder proposals to adopt say-on-pay in U.S.
  rms over 2006-2010, before it became mandatory in 2011. Their regression discontinuity design
shows that narrowly passing a proposal to adopt say-on-pay leads to a 4% increase in market
value and improvements in pro tability and labor productivity, although neither the level nor
structure of pay changes. Thus, the e¤ect of a positive vote may be to make executives realize
that their future behavior may be subject to discipline, rather than the vote itself constraining
pay.
    Turning to mandatory say-on-pay votes, the House of Representatives passage of the U.S.
say-on-pay bill was associated with positive event-study returns, but only for rms with high


                                                94
abnormal CEO pay and low wealth-performance sensitivity (Cai and Walkling, 2011). In the
U.K., Ferri and Maber (2013) nd positive event-study returns to the introduction of say-on-
pay legislation for rms with high abnormal CEO pay, particularly if this was combined with
poor recent performance. The law was followed by a rise in pay-performance sensitivity (they
do not study wealth-performance sensitivity) but no decrease in the level of pay.
    These earlier results are based on single-country analyses; since the say-on-pay law a¤ects
all rms, there is usually no clean control group. Correa and Lel (2016) improve on this with
a di¤erence-in-di¤erences approach using 38 countries over 2001-2012, of which eleven passed
say-on-pay laws during that period. The laws are associated with CEO pay levels falling by 7%,
pay-performance sensitivity rising by 5% (they do not study wealth-performance sensitivity),
and rm values increasing by 2.4%. Advisory say-on-pay laws are associated with greater pay
reductions and increases in pay-performance sensitivity than binding laws, although the authors
stress that these conclusions are tentative since the nature of laws classi ed as advisory or
binding di¤ers across countries. A potential explanation is that investors are more reticent
to vote against a pay package if a negative vote is binding and thus likely to cause greater
disruption in a rm, in particular if there is no clear remedy to a negative binding vote.
Pay Ratios. Concerns about income inequality has led politicians, regulators, and pressure
groups to focus on the pay gap between CEOs and rank-and- le employees. Section 953(b)
of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, implemented August 5, 2015 but placed on hold in February
2017, requires that U.S. rms disclose the total pay for the CEO, the total pay for the median
employee excluding the CEO, and the ratio of these two numbers.68
    There are several concerns with such a disclosure, which is likely to direct public anger at
the wrong rms and have a number of unintended consequences. First, even if executive pay
is set e¢ciently with no rent extraction, pay ratios vary widely across rms. The shareholder
value theories in Section 3.1 suggest that the ratios numerator  CEO pay  is determined by
the CEOs value added and his outside options. Hence, a high ratio might indicate a talented
CEO with a high market value.69
    The ratios denominator  median employee pay  depends on the labor market for rank-
and- le employees, which varies considerably between rms. For example, the pay ratio is lower
in investment banks than in supermarkets, not because investment bank CEOs are poorly paid
but because rank-and- le bankers are relatively scarce and thus well-paid. Median employee
pay varies even within an industry, as it depends on each rms capital-labor ratio, franchising
policy, and other strategic decisions. For example, it is lower in InterContinental Hotels than
in Hilton, because the former franchises its hotels while the latter does not. Hence, a low ratio
might indicate a rm that has outsourced its manual workers, or replaced them by machines.
  68
     The EUs Shareholder Rights Directive (passed in July 2015) initially proposed mandating a similar disclo-
sure, but this proposal was eventually dropped.
  69
     The limited available evidence suggests that within- rm pay inequality is positively correlated with operating
performance and rm valuations (Faleye, Reis, and Venkateswaran, 2013; Mueller, Ouimet, and Simintzi, 2017).



                                                        95
    Second, a focus on pay ratios, and social pressure to lower them, is likely to have a number
of unintended consequences. The numerator  CEO pay  can be lowered while preserving the
CEOs expected utility by, e.g., shortening vesting periods and making the CEOs pay safer and
less sensitive to performance. Such changes are likely to reduce shareholder value. In order to
avoid spikes in pay ratios, rms will have to further curtail CEO pay-performance sensitivities.
Median employee pay does not vary much with rm performance, so high pay-performance
sensitivities result in high pay ratios whenever performance is high.
    The denominator  median employee pay  can be arti cially increased by substituting capi-
tal for labor, outsourcing low-wage workers, or hiring part-time rather than full-time employees
if only the latter are considered in the ratio.70 Firms may also shift employee compensation
away from non-pecuniary forms (such as on-the-job training, extime working policies, and su-
perior working conditions) towards salary. Hence, social pressure to lower pay ratios is likely to
lead to more automation, more outsourcing, and less pleasant work environments for low-wage
employees.
Restrictions on Speci c Forms of Executive Pay. Regulators, politicians, and pressure
groups have proposed, and in some cases implemented, restrictions on speci c forms of executive
compensation, such as bonuses or stock-based pay. As a means to restrain the level of executive
pay, such restrictions are bound to fail. Boards can always substitute a di¤erent (and usually
less e¢cient) form of pay to provide the executive with the same level of compensation.71 As
a means to change executives incentives and behavior, the restrictions described below appear
to be ill-targeted and to have costly unintended consequences.
Restrictions on Golden Handshakes. On March 3, 2013, 68% of Swiss voters approved the
writing of the Abzocker (rip-o¤) reform into the Swiss constitution. Among other practices,
the reform bans all forms of compensation on departure (such as golden handshakes). Support
for the reform signi cantly increased after Novartis CEO Daniel Vasellas lucrative non-compete
contract upon departure was released in February 2013, suggesting that it was at least in part
a reaction to one particular case.
    Payments on departure can be a form of rent extraction, especially if they occur in forms
not easily visible to shareholders (see Section 4.3). However, in many cases, severance pay
can improve shareholder value by, for example, motivating CEOs to accept a valuable takeover
bid, innovate, or leave without putting up a ght (see Section 3.7.2). A blanket prohibition is
therefore costly. The bene ts are limited to at most the departure payment itself, which is a
  70
      In response to concerns that calculating the pay of the median employee is di¢cult for rms with many
business units and no centralized payroll system (Murphy, 2012), Section 953(b) of Dodd-Frank gives rms
discretion on how to calculate the median  including the option to exclude employees in countries in which
data privacy laws or regulations hinder gathering of compensation information  which in turn gives them
signi cant latitude to manipulate the ratio.
   71
      Israeli lawmakers went further and on March 29, 2016, passed a law that restricts executive compensation
in banks, insurance companies, and investment managers to 35 times the salary of the lowest paid employee.
Remarkably, the average announcement return for the 20 a¤ected rms appears to have been positive, consistent
with the law reigning in rent extraction (Abudy, Amiram, Rozenbaum, and Shust, 2017).

                                                     96
small percentage of rm value (see Section 2.2.2).
Restrictions on Stock-Based Pay. The EUs Shareholder Rights Directive stipulates that the
value of shares does not play a dominant role in the nancial performance criteria and that
share-based remuneration does not represent the most signi cant part of directors variable
remuneration, although exceptions are allowed where the remuneration policy includes a clear
and reasoned explanation as to how such an exception contributes to the long-term interests
and sustainability of the company (see the Appendix).
    Restrictions on stock-based compensation have a variety of motivations. First, stock-based
pay might cause executives to focus on short-term stock prices at the expense of long-term value
creation. However, this is not a problem of stock per se, but of insu¢cient holding requirements.
The solution is not to replace stock with xed salaries (which provide no incentives) or bonuses
(which incentivize only the performance measures being rewarded), but to extend the vesting
period of equity.
    Second, the stock price might be a poor measure of performance, either because it is not
directly controllable by the executive, or because it focuses too narrowly on shareholder value.
Neither concern is convincing. When assessing executive performance, boards already combine
stock prices with subjective performance evaluation and accounting metrics, which the executive
can more easily a¤ect. More importantly, the long-run stock price captures all of the channels
through which the CEO and other top executives improve shareholder value (e.g., pro ts,
growth, innovation, restructuring) or destroy value (Jensen, 2001; Edmans, 2016). Hence, the
generality of a stock price target is an advantage, not a disadvantage. Any narrow target (or
set of targets) will fail to capture the complexity of the CEOs job, and will lead to inattention
to non-targeted dimensions. The existence of an almost all-encompassing performance measure
is a critical distinction between CEOs and other workers (e.g., doctors and teachers), where
studies have shown incentive pay may back re due to lack of such a measure.
Lengthening Vesting Periods, Clawbacks, and Malus. The concern that pay contracts
may cause executives to focus on short-term performance at the expense of long-run value is
both widespread and theoretically justi ed (see Section 3.7.1). Several remedies have been
proposed and sometimes implemented, all with the goal of lengthening executives horizons.
To justify regulatory intervention, it must be that shareholders are unable (or unwilling) to
implement these changes themselves.
    One obvious remedy is to lengthen the vesting period of equity. The optimal vesting period
will vary between companies; for example, it will be higher in young companies in growing
industries, for which long-term investment is more important. Moreover, the vesting period
can be lengthened beyond the executives retirement, as suggested by equation (41) in Section
3.7.1.72 Such deferral may deter short-term manipulation, encourage the executive to take
  72
    There are two ways in which deferral of equity beyond retirement occurs in practice. The rst is through
equity vesting after the executives retirement (and no accelerated vesting at retirement). The second is through
introducing an additional requirement for an executive to hold a minimum amount of shares post-retirement.


                                                       97
long-term investments that will pay o¤ after his departure, and encourage succession planning.
Survey evidence indicates that many rms do not have a CEO succession plan (Heidrick and
Struggles, 2010), con rmed by the often haphazard succession processes after a CEO dies in
o¢ce (Jenter, Matveyev, and Roth, 2017). While lengthening vesting periods may require a
higher level of pay to compensate for the greater risk, this is likely to be vastly outweighed by
the bene ts of superior decisions. Note, however, that longer vesting periods may have other
costs, as discussed in Section 3.7.1.
    A second remedy is to claw back executives bonuses upon exceptional events. In the U.S.,
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 de ne these exceptional events
as accounting restatements.73 The rst SEC settlement forced William McGuire, the former
CEO and Chairman of UnitedHealth, to repay his employer $468 million after backdating op-
tions. In the U.K., these events can include fraud or other misconduct: in 2013, Barclays clawed
back £300 million in sta¤ bonuses following nes for Libor xing and mis-selling of payment
protection insurance. However, clawbacks are not triggered by general poor performance and
so do not deter non-fraudulent short-termist actions, such as cutting R&D to boost earnings.
Moreover, they may be more di¢cult to implement than lengthening vesting periods. For
example, the executive may have spent the bonus or transferred it to a relative, making the
clawback di¢cult.
    A third remedy is to implement bonus-malus systems, whereby bonuses are not immediately
paid out but held in escrow and subsequently forfeited if poor performance comes to light. Such
a system is easier to implement than clawbacks, since the bonus is not paid out prematurely,
but typically requires a discretionary decision for forfeiture to occur.74 In contrast, the value of
unvested equity automatically falls once poor performance comes to light.


8.      Directions for Future Research
We start with potential avenues for future empirical analysis, before turning to ideas for theo-
retical research. Some are shared with Edmans and Gabaix (2016).
Private rms, Non-US rms, and Other Employees. Most empirical studies have been
focused on top executives in public rms in the U.S., given the availability of the ExecuComp
and similar datasets. More research on the pay of executives in private rms who are neither
For example, Unilever requires its CEO to hold at least ve times salary in shares for one year after retirement,
and half that amount two years post-retirement. The current (April 2016) U.K. Corporate Governance Code
recommends that rms consider implementing this second approach.
  73
     More recently, the SEC has been enforcing clawbacks even if the executive in question was not personally
charged for the accounting fraud: in 2011, the SEC clawed back $2.8 million from Maynard Jenkins, the former
CEO of CSK Auto Corporation, even though he was not charged.
  74
     Hypothetically, forfeiture could be based on a non-discretionary formula (e.g., a performance measure falling
below a pre-speci ed threshold). However, in practice, this does not occur. Boards prefer to retain discretion
to apply malus in a wide range of events, such as misconduct, mis-statements, or reputational damage, which
may not necessarily trigger performance falling below the threshold.


                                                       98
owner-managers nor related to controlling shareholders would be particularly useful (see Section
2.5). Since private rms are likely closer to the shareholder value benchmark, due to the
presence of a concentrated shareholder, comparing them with otherwise similar public rms
might allow assessment of whether pay in public rms represents rent extraction. At the same
time, di¤erences in the contracting environment should create interesting di¤erences in optimal
contracts between public and private rms. For example, in a private rm, the controlling
shareholders ability to directly monitor the CEO may reduce the required level of incentive
pay.
    A second fruitful direction would be to study international data and analyze the determi-
nants of cross-country di¤erences in CEO pay (see Section 2.4). Countries di¤er widely in
corporate ownership, corporate governance, taxes, regulation, and executive hiring practices,
but relatively little is known about how these characteristics relate to executive pay. Conyon,
Core, and Guay (2011) and Fernandes, Ferreira, Matos, and Murphy (2013) are useful steps
in this direction. Moreover, while data on CEO wealth (an important determinant of both
risk aversion and the private bene ts from shirking) is typically unavailable in the U.S., it is
sometimes available in other countries (see, e.g., Becker, 2006).
    Third, most research on executive compensation studies the pay of the CEO only. Execu-
Comp and similar databases report the pay of the ve most highly-paid executives, allowing
some papers to compare the CEOs pay to the remainder of the top management team, although
such research is still relatively scarce.75 Fewer papers still have obtained proprietary pay data
for mid-level managers and rank-and- le employees (e.g., Mueller, Ouimet, and Simintzi, 2017;
Faleye, Reis, and Venkateswaran, 2013). This allows comparisons of pay levels and incentives
across the hierarchy within a given rm. The determinants of di¤erences in pay and incentives
within the top management team and across the corporate hierarchy are ripe topics for future
research.
Descriptions, Correlations, and Causality. Executive pay is a eld in which descriptive
statistics are often highly illuminating (see, e.g., Jensen and Murphys (1990a) and Hall and
Liebmans (1998) seminal work on quantifying CEO incentives). Much more descriptive works
remains to be done  on pay components not reported in compensation tables, on the details of
performance-based equity and cash grants, on the details of executive employment contracts,
and on pay practices in private rms, for executives other than the CEO, and in countries other
than the U.S.
    Even more can be learned by careful analyses of how endogenously chosen compensation
contracts di¤er across settings. We know surprisingly little about how pay practices vary across
industries, rms of di¤erent sizes, rms at di¤erent stages of their life cycle, and rms with
di¤erent technologies, organizational structures, and other fundamentals. Exogenous shocks
  75
     For example, Kale, Reis, and Venkateswaran (2009) study tournament incentives among top executives;
Bebchuk, Cremers, and Peyer (2011) use the CEOs pay relative to the top executive team as a measure of CEO
power, and Bushman, Dai, and Zhang (2016) study synergies within the top management team.


                                                    99
to the determinants of compensation contracts  e.g., shocks to technologies, competition, the
availability of information, or risk  allow us to observe how pay practices endogenously adapt
to changes in the contracting environment. This type of research is most useful when it is
  rmly grounded in the theories surveyed in Sections 3, 4, and 5 and when it confronts model
predictions with evidence.
    Identifying the causal e¤ects of executive pay on rm value, behavior, and performance
is both important and di¢cult (see Section 6). It usually requires instruments or natural
experiments that create as-good-as-random variation in pay practices. We have highlighted a
number of recent studies that cleverly exploit regulatory changes, discontinuities, or institutional
frictions in the pay-setting process to achieve identi cation. However, measuring the causal
e¤ects of executive pay remains one of the most important challenges of this literature.
Estimating Dynamic Incentives. Aside from the limited evidence in Boschen and Smith
(1995), very little is known about the e¤ects of current performance on the future path of com-
pensation and turnover. Studying such longer-run e¤ects might change our view of incentives,
in particular because the e¤ects of performance in di¤erent periods may well be interactive,
rather than additive. The increasing popularity of performance-based equity and cash grants,
which often feature payo¤s that are non-linear functions of multi-year performance, should have
made such interactions more important. A proper accounting for the dynamic e¤ects of current
performance on future pay and turnover might even change the commonly accepted view that
executives incentives are almost entirely driven by their stock and option holdings (Jensen and
Murphy, 1990a).
Testing Shareholder Value Models. Recent years have seen the development of new share-
holder value models of executive pay (see Section 3), often with predictions that have not yet
been tested. This is certainly the case for assignment models (Section 3.1.1), models of incen-
tives in market equilibrium (Section 3.3), and dynamic contracting models (Section 3.7). For
example, dynamic moral hazard models o¤er predictions for how the level of pay and incen-
tives evolve with tenure, how this evolution is a¤ected by risk, and how the optimal horizon of
incentives is determined.
Structural Estimation. Structurally estimating assignment, learning, or (dynamic) moral
hazard models allows researchers to study questions that are di¢cult to answer with reduced-
form approaches. For example, within the chosen model, a structural estimation allows quanti -
cation of important determinants of the optimal contract that are otherwise di¢cult to measure
empirically, such as the CEOs risk aversion, cost of e¤ort, ability to engage in manipulation,
and desire for consumption smoothing. Relatedly, it can permit counterfactual analyses, such
as the e¤ect on rm value of changes in these parameters, or how the possibility of manipulation
changes the contract.
    An advantage of reduced form approaches is that the data can be compared to the predictions
of several models. The advantage of a structural estimation is that it confronts one speci c

                                                100
model much more seriously with the data. However, the structural estimation must ignore any
forces that a¤ect the data but are not in the model. This is a serious concern in executive
compensation, as pay arrangements are likely the result of many forces  shareholders desire to
maximize value, executives desire to maximize rents, and the inuence of legislation, taxation,
accounting policies, and social pressures.
    It is nevertheless useful to model a subset of these forces and assess how well they alone
can explain the data. However, there likely is another combination of forces that could have
been modeled and would have t the data equally well, and there are likely aspects of the
data the current models cannot match. Formal tests of a models qualitative and quantitative
predictions can highlight where the theory fails, thus opening doors to future research.
       We now move to open theoretical questions.
Rent Extraction Theories. There is a striking lack of theories of the rent extraction view of
pay. Aside from Kuhnen and Zwiebel (2009), we are unaware of any models where the manager,
rather than shareholders, set pay. Writing such a model, and in particular studying the extent to
which it can quantitatively (as well as qualitatively) explain various features of the data, would
be valuable. Especially interesting would be a model that allows for a horse-race between the
rent extraction and shareholder value views.
Adding Frictions to Assignment Models. Most models of the assignment of executives
to rms are frictionless and perfectly competitive (e.g., Gabaix and Landier, 2008; Terviö,
2008). Taken literally, this would predict frequent reassignments of CEOs to di¤erent rms and
external poachings to be much more common than internal promotions. It would be fruitful
to extend these models to take into account real-world frictions, such as rm-speci c human
capital, imperfect competition, match-speci c surpluses, and turnover and search costs, and
then to calibrate such a model to study the extent to which an assignment model with frictions
can jointly explain both the high levels of pay and the relatively infrequent CEO mobility.
Dynamic Market Equilibrium Models. Most models of incentives in market equilibrium
are static. It would be useful to add a dynamic moral hazard problem where incentives can be
provided not only through contracts, but also by the threat of ring or the promise of being
hired by a larger rm. This would, among other things, analyze how contracting incentives
interact with hiring/ ring incentives. These di¤erent incentive channels may conict with as
well as reinforce each other. For example, the deferred reward principle, discussed in Section
3.7, argues that the reduction in CEO pay caused by poor performance should be spread out
over all future periods, to achieve consumption smoothing. However, the CEO may quit if
future expected pay is low, reducing consumption smoothing possibilities.76
Complementarities. Most theories of CEO pay are single-agent models, but CEOs work in
teams where complementarities between agents exist. As a result, their contracts a¤ect rm
  76
    The dynamic moral hazard models of DeMarzo and Sannikov (2006), DeMarzo and Fishman (2007), and
Biais, Mariotti, Plantin, and Rochet (2007) assume risk neutrality, and so consumption smoothing is a non-issue.

                                                     101
value not only directly through a¤ecting the CEOs e¤ort, but also indirectly because the CEOs
e¤ort level a¤ects the optimal e¤ort level chosen by workers. This consideration in turn a¤ects
the optimal contract for the CEO. Separately, a team setting allows the study of the relative
wages of the CEO and other employees.77
Combining Generality with Tractability. There has been substantial theoretical progress
on continuous-time agency models which allow for the contracting problem to be solved with few
assumptions. However, their empirical predictions are typically less clear, given the absence of
analytical solutions, and because numerical solutions depend on the parameters chosen. Future
research may be able to identify clearer implications of these models, in particular comparative
statics on how incentives and turnover-performance sensitivity should di¤er across rms.
Ex-Post Settling Up. Contracting models assume that the principal and agent decide on
the relevant performance measures and a contract at the start of the employment relationship.
However, there is evidence that the performance measures may be renegotiated ex post (e.g.,
Morse, Nanda, and Seru, 2011), and that more than half the CEOs of S&P 500 rms do not have
an explicit employment contract (Gillan, Hartzell, and Parrino, 2009). It would be interesting
to study the optimal contract if the CEO and rm wait until performance has been realized
before negotiating a sharing rule, and under what circumstances such an implicit contract can
be sustained.
Behavioral Theories. Most theories of CEO pay are rational. Incorporating behavioral con-
siderations has been successful in other elds of corporate nance and could be similarly fruitful
here. Baker and Wurgler (2013) divide the behavioral corporate nance literature into two elds
 managers who are irrational or have non-standard utility functions, and rational managers
exploiting ine¢cient markets. As an example of the former, Dittmann, Maug, and Spalt (2010)
argue that incorporating loss aversion can explain the observed mix of stock and options, while
standard utility functions cannot. As an example of the latter, Bolton, Scheinkman, and Xiong
(2006) show that contracts that emphasize short-term performance may be a rational response
to speculative markets. Other behavioral phenomena that could be incorporated into compensa-
tion models include bounded rationality, probability weighting, overcon dence (overweighting
private signals and underweighting public signals), and optimism (overestimating ones own
managerial ability or rm quality).78
       We nally turn to open questions for both theoretical and empirical research.
The Supply of CEO Talent. We now have quantitative theories for the level of pay and
demand side, given the supply of talent. However, we know relatively little on the supply
  77
     Edmans, Goldstein, and Zhu (2013) analyze these issues within a CEO setting; Che and Yoo (2001), Kremer
(1993), Winter (2004, 2006, 2010), and Gervais and Goldstein (2007) analyze contracting under production
complementarities in general principal-agent settings. Matveyev (2017) provides evidence of positive assortative
matching of executives by ability across rms.
  78
     Gervais, Heaton, and Odean (2011) and Otto (2014) show that, respectively, overcon dence and optimism
cause CEOs to overestimate future performance and to overvalue incentive compensation.

                                                     102
side. Given the substantial pay premium that executives command over other skilled professions
(e.g., medicine or law), it would be interesting to study empirically the extent to which this
premium results from limited supply, and if so, explore theoretically why supply remains so
limited  why more people do not enter the business profession. A related topic is to understand
better the nature of the scarcity of CEO talent, e.g., whether it stems from innate skills,
experience, lack of succession planning, and so on.
Combining Learning and Moral Hazard. While learning models (listed at the start of
Section 3.2 but otherwise outside the scope of this survey) have generally been developed and
tested independently of moral hazard ones, theories that combine both learning about ability
and moral hazard, or empirical studies that analyze the relative importance of learning versus
moral hazard for observed contracts, would be valuable.


9.    Conclusion
This paper has surveyed the theoretical and empirical literature on executive compensation.
Throughout the survey, we have attempted to emphasize the following three points. First,
executive compensation is likely driven by many factors  boards and shareholders attempts to
maximize rm value, executives attempts to maximize their own rents (perhaps in conjunction
with entrenched boards and inattentive shareholders), and institutional forces such as legisla-
tion, taxation, accounting policies, and social pressures. No one perspective can explain all of
the evidence, and a narrow attachment to one perspective will distort rather than inform our
view of executive pay.
    Second, the conclusions of an executive compensation study can be sensitive to assump-
tions. For theoretical models, the conclusions can hinge on seemingly innocuous features of the
modeling setup, often made for tractability or convenience; for empirical analyses, the conclu-
sions can hinge on the measure of incentives used, the time period studied, or the treatment of
outliers. Thus, researchers should think very carefully about these modeling and measurement
choices, and always explore robustness to alternative speci cations.
    Third, despite decades of research on executive pay, there are very many open questions,
making it a ripe area for future research. Even seemingly fundamental questions, such as the
causal e¤ect of pay on rm outcomes, and pay practices outside the U.S., in private rms,
and for executives below the CEO, remain largely unanswered. Executive pay interacts with
other topics such as board and shareholder structure, income inequality, and political economy,
and these interactions also open avenues for further investigation. The changing nature of
compensation practices, such as the recent rise in performance-vesting equity, new regulations,
such as say-on-pay, and recent disclosure requirements, such as on executive pensions, open
the door to new empirical studies. Ripe topics for theoretical research include incorporating
rent extraction, behavioral factors, additional frictions, and dynamics into market equilibrium

models. We hope that this review will help stimulate this research and look forward to learning
from it.

A.     Institutional Detail
This appendix provides an overview of institutional features that a¤ect executive compensation.
The main focus is on the U.S., but we also discuss the U.K. and Europe.


A.1.    U.S.
This section describes up to four institutional features that may a¤ect any given compensation
practice: legislation, disclosure requirements, accounting treatment, and tax treatment. Some
of the institutional details are taken from the excellent surveys by Murphy (2012, 2013) to
which we refer the reader for further detail. We do not aim to be comprehensive here, but to
describe the most important elements for economists (as opposed to lawyers or accountants) to
understand executive compensation.
    Before we start, we list the main laws, disclosure requirements, and bodies that pertain to
executive compensation:

    Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933 (Regulation S-K) lays out reporting re-
     quirements for various SEC lings issued by public rms.

    The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act) created the SEC to enforce U.S. federal
     securities laws. Section 14(a) of the 1934 Act requires a rm to le a proxy statement when
     soliciting shareholder votes, e.g., for the annual shareholders meeting. SEC regulation
     §240.14a-101 Schedule 14A stipulates the information required in a proxy statement; as
     a result, a proxy statement is often referred to as a Schedule 14A, and a de nitive proxy
     statement is led using SEC Form 14A. This information includes disclosure of executive
     compensation as required by certain items of Regulation S-K. The SEC subsequently made
     major amendments to its disclosure rules in 1978, 1992, and 2006, and minor amendments
     in other years (such as 2002 and 2009).

         Note that Section 14(a) of the 1934 Act is di¤erent from Section 14A of the same
          act, which was newly added by Dodd-Frank and concerns shareholder approval of
          executive compensation.

    The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley), e¤ective from July 30, 2002, was
     primarily focused on accounting reform, but contained some legislation relevant to exec-
     utive compensation.

    In August 2002 and October 2002, the NYSE and Nasdaq respectively proposed changes
     to their listing rules to the SEC, to strengthen corporate governance standards for listed
     companies. These rules were approved in November 2003.



                                             128
        The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-
         Frank) was primarily focused on Wall Street reform and consumer protection, but most
         of its executive compensation rules applied to all listed rms. The executive compensation
         items involved several additions to the 1934 Act, e.g., of Section 10C ("compensation com-
         mittees") and of Section 14A ("shareholder approval"). In turn, many of these additions
         required the SEC to increase listing and disclosure requirements.

        Accounting standards were initially set by the Accounting Principles Board (APB),
         which was replaced in 1973 by the FASB. The FASB issues Financial Accounting Stan-
         dards (FAS) for public and private companies and non-pro t organizations. E¤ective
         from July 1, 2009, the FASB established Accounting Standards Codi cation (ASC),
         which integrated the hundreds of existing accounting standards under 90 broad topics;
         thus, one new ASC typically integrates several FASs. The relevant ASCs for executive
         compensation are given below:

                        Table 1: Accounting Standard Codi cation Reference
 FAS                                       ASC Topic
 FAS     43                                ASC   710   Compensation     General
 FAS     112                               ASC   712   Compensation      Nonretirement Postemployment Bene ts
 FAS     87; 88; 106; 112; 132(R); 158     ASC   715   Compensation      Retirement Bene ts
 FAS     123(R)                            ASC   718   Compensation      Stock Compensation


        The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) is the domestic portion of federal tax law.

       General

        Disclosure:

            From 1934 to 1978, the SEC required publicly-listed rms to disclose the compensa-
             tion (including salaries, bonuses, stock, and options) of the three highest-paid execu-
             tives in the annual proxy statement.79 Starting in 1942, the SEC required companies
             to disclose some executive pay data in a table, rather than just in narrative form, and
             expanded the tabular disclosure in 1952. Proxy statements for rms with December
             year ends are typically issued in March or April, giving rise to Shareholder Springs
             where shareholders sometimes voice their opposition to compensation.
            The 1978 Disclosure Rules extended individual pay disclosure from the top-three
             executives to the top- ve (typically the CEO plus four other highest-paid executives)
             and expanded the information in the Summary Compensation Table (SCT).
  79
   There may be other, non-executive employees who are paid more than the three highest-paid executives.
An executive is de ned as an o¢cer in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function, or any other
o¢cer who performs a policy making function.

                                                    129
          The 1992 Disclosure Rules required an even more detailed SCT, summarizing the
           major components of pay received by the CEO, CFO and other top-three executives
           over the past three years. Separate tables are required for the number of awarded
           options and stock appreciation rights (SARs)80 , for exercises and end-of-year hold-
           ings of options and SARs, and for long-term incentive plans (LTIPs).
                Previously, compensation was disclosed mainly through narrative descriptions,
                 with only limited information in the SCT; the 1992 rules mandated much more
                 extensive tabular disclosure for clarity. Standardization of the tables aimed to
                 promote comparability between years and across rms.
                However, the value of options granted did not need to be disclosed, so there was
                 no total compensation number.
          The 2006 Disclosure Rules required:
                The SCT to contain the value of new option grants (plus changes in pension
                 value and any above-market interest or preferential dividends on non-quali ed
                 deferred compensation81 ), thus leading to a total compensation number for the
                  rst time.
                A new Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, describing the rms over-
                 all compensation policy and objectives.
                A new Pension Bene ts Table containing the present value of accumulated pen-
                 sion bene t, plus payments during the current year.
                A new Nonquali ed Deferred Compensation Table containing the value of accu-
                 mulated deferred compensation, plus contributions, earnings, and withdrawals
                 during the current year.
                A new Director Compensation Table, similar in format to the SCT but for
                 directors.
          Prior to 2006, rms separately reported annual bonuses and payouts from long-
           term performance plans. Under the 2006 rules, both annual cash bonuses from
           short-term incentive plans and long-term performance bonuses are considered non-
           equity incentive compensation if they are based on pre-established performance
           targets. If they are not based on pre-established targets, they are considered dis-
           cretionary bonuses.
  80
     A SAR gives an executive a bonus that depends on the increase in the stock price over a speci ed period
of time, similar to an option. They became popular after December 1976, when the SEC exempted SARs from
the short-swing rule (Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act), which required executives to return pro ts from trading
the companys shares within a period of less than six months. This e¤ectively required executives to hold shares
for six months after option exercise. In May 1991, the SEC allowed the six-month holding period to begin on
the option grant date, not the exercise date, and so SARs virtually disappeared.
  81
     An interest rate is deemed to be above-market if it exceeds 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate.
Dividends are considered to be preferential if they earn a higher rate than dividends on the companys common
stock.

                                                     130
                   The main e¤ects of Dodd-Frank, passed in 2010, on disclosure requirements were:
                                 Section 953(a) added Section 14(i) to the 1934 Act, which mandates the SEC
                                  to adopt rules requiring disclosure of the link between realized pay and nancial
                                  performance, including stock price performance. To implement it, the SEC
                                  proposed the addition of Item 402(v) to Regulation S-K on April 29, 2015. This
                                  rule has not yet been adopted.
                                 Section 953(b) led to the SEC adding Item 402(u) to Regulation S-K on August
                                  5, 2015. This rule requires rms to disclose the ratio of the CEOs total pay to
                                  the median total pay for all other employees.
                                 Section 955 added Section 14(j) to the 1934 Act, which mandates the SEC to
                                  adopt rules requiring the disclosure of whether company policies allow directors
                                  and employees to hedge any fall in the stock price. To implement it, the SEC
                                  proposed the amendment of Item 402(b) and the addition of Item 407(i) to
                                  Regulation S-K, on February 9, 2015. This rule has not yet been adopted.

   The main compensation tables that need to be disclosed following the 2006 Disclosure Rules
are as follows (Tables 2-8):

               excess of $1 million for the CEO and the four highest-paid executives other than
               the CEO is not tax-deductible for public rms. Quali ed performance-based com-
               pensation, which meets certain rules (e.g., payments contingent on the attainment
               of objective performance goals that were approved by shareholders) is not subject
               to this limit. This category generally includes shareholder-approved at-the-money
               options, out-of-the-money options, restricted stock with performance-based vesting,
               and formula-driven bonuses.
              In March 2015, the IRS required a per-employee limit (approved by shareholders)
               on the maximum number of stock options and SARs to qualify for this exemption.

                                                                             Stock and Options

   Legislation and Listing Requirements:

           The short-swing rule (Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act) requires executives to return
            pro ts from buying and selling (or selling and buying) the companys shares within
            a period of less than six months.
                     Stock. Any stock held for at least six months is therefore exempt from this rule.
                     Options. Prior to May 1991, the SEC counted the exercise of an option as the
                      date of stock acquisition, thus e¤ectively requiring executives to hold shares
                      for six months after option exercise. As a result, the executive pays cash on the
                      exercise date, but cannot recoup this cash (via stock sales) for six months. From
                      May 1991, the SEC counts as the stock acquisition date the grant date, rather
                      than the exercise date, thus e¤ectively removing the holding requirement.
           With e¤ect from July 2003, NYSE and Nasdaq listing rules require shareholder
            approval of all equity compensation plans (with certain exceptions). AMEX listing
            rules followed suit in October 2003.

   Disclosure:

           The 1992 Disclosure Rules required:
                     Stock. The SCT to contain the value of newly-granted restricted stock awards,
                      plus the aggregate value of shares held by the executive in a footnote. No
                      disclosure was required upon vesting.
                     Options:
                               The SCT to contain the number of options granted in the current year, but
                                not their value; as a result, there was no single number for total compensa-
                                tion.

                                                                                          133
                    An Option/SAR Grant Table to contain grant-by-grant information on the
                     number, maturity date, and strike price for options and SARs granted over
                     the year, plus either the Black-Scholes grant-date value or the potential value
                     of the options under the assumption that stock prices grow at 5% and 10%
                     annually. The company could choose which valuation method to use.82
                    An Option/SAR Exercise Table containing the aggregate number and value
                     of shares acquired under option and SAR exercises in the current year. It
                     also contains year-end option and SAR holdings, which include the aggregate
                     number and intrinsic value across all exercisable options/SARs, and the same
                     information across all unexercisable options/SARs, but not grant-by-grant
                     information. The SECs 2002 amendments also required the disclosure of
                     the weighted average strike price.
          The 2006 Disclosure Rules required:
               Column (e) of the SCT to report the fair value of new stock grants and column
                (f) to report the fair value of new option grants (as determined under FAS 123R,
                described below), with the assumptions underlying the calculations in a footnote.
                Both amounts are included in total compensation (column (j)), providing for the
                 rst time a single number for total compensation.
               A new Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End Table that includes the
                aggregate amount of outstanding unvested shares and grant-by-grant informa-
                tion on the number, strike price and maturity date of each outstanding option
                award. The vesting schedule and any performance-based hurdles are discussed
                in narrative disclosure following the table.
                    As for already-vested equity, Item 403 of Regulation S-K requires rms to
                     report total bene cial stock ownership (both vested and unvested) of o¢cers
                     and directors in the proxy statements (Item 6 of Schedule 14A).
               A new Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table that includes the number of new
                shares awarded, plus (to replace the old Option/SAR Grant Table) the grant
                date, number of options, strike price, and grant-date fair market value of each
                new option grant.83 The vesting schedule and any performance-based hurdles
                are discussed in narrative disclosure following the table. The table (and accom-
                panying narrative disclosure) also report:
                    The incremental value from any repricing of a previously-awarded option,
                     plus narrative description of the repricing.
  82
    Murphy (1996) found that two-thirds of rms chose the latter.
  83
    The original rules, approved in July 2006, did not require the grant-date fair market value of stock and
option awards, but the SEC amended the rules in December 2006 to add a new column to disclose this value
based on FAS 123R.


                                                    134
                     Additional columns disclosing (i) the closing market price on the grant date
                      if it exceeded the strike price, (ii) the date the compensation committee
                      approved the grant if di¤erent from the grant date.
                A new Option Exercises and Stock Vested Table that includes the number of
                 previously-granted shares that vested over the year and their value realized upon
                 vesting, plus (to replace the old Option/SAR Exercise Table) the number of
                 previously-granted options that were exercised over the year, plus their value
                 realized upon exercise.
          Section 403 of Sarbanes-Oxley amended Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act, requiring
           executives to disclose new stock and option grants, exercises, and repricings, within
           two business days. Previously, they reported new grants to the SEC on Form 5, due
           45 days after year-end, or Form 4, due 10 days after month-end.

     Accounting:

          Issued in October 1972, APB Opinion No. 25 requires the grant-date value of re-
           stricted stock and the intrinsic value of options to be amortized over the vesting pe-
           riod.84 Thus, there was no accounting charge for at-the-money or out-of-the-money
           options.
          Issued in October 1995, FAS 123 recommended, but did not require, rms to expense
           the fair market value of options granted over the vesting period. Non-expensing rms
           had to disclose this value in a footnote.
          Issued in December 2004, FAS 123R required rms to expense the grant-date fair
           market value of options over the vesting period (using an option pricing model chosen
           by the rm), e¤ective for the rst interim or annual reporting period beginning after
           June 15, 2005. The rule also required rms to expense options granted prior to June
           15, 2005 that had not yet vested, leading to many rms accelerating the vesting of
           options.

     Tax :

          Stock:
                Restricted stock is taxable as ordinary income for the executive and tax-deductible
                 for the rm upon vesting (Section 83(a) of the IRC).85
  84
     It also required equity with performance-based vesting conditions to be marked to market (variable account-
ing), with additional charges in each reporting period reecting changes in the stock price. FAS 123(R) (now
subsumed by ASC 718) removed this mark-to-market requirement, with all equity grants now being subject to
 xed accounting.
  85
     However, Section 83(b) allows the employee to choose to be taxed upon granting (rather than vesting) of
the stock, in which case the employer can also obtain the tax deduction upon receipt.


                                                     135
                 Unrestricted stock is taxable for the executive and tax-deductible for the rm
                  upon granting.
                 Upon subsequent sale of the stock, the executive pays capital gains tax on the
                  di¤erence between the stock price upon sale and the stock price upon vesting.
                  He pays the long-term capital gains tax rate if he sells more than 12 months
                  after vesting, else the short-term rate.
            Options:
                 Most options are unquali ed and taxable upon exercise (not upon vesting).
                  The gains from exercise (di¤erence between the stock price and strike price) are
                  taxable as ordinary income for the executive and tax-deductible for the rm.
                 The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 created a class of Incentive Stock
                  Options (ISOs, often referred to as quali ed or statutory stock options)
                  which carry certain restrictions.86
                     Gains from ISOs are taxed as capital gains when the stock purchased upon
                      exercise is eventually sold; the gain is calculated as the di¤erence between
                      the sale price and the strike price
                     Since the capital gains tax rate is typically lower than the income tax rate,
                      ISOs are tax advantageous for the employee, but not tax deductible for the
                      employer. They are common for middle management (where the $100,000
                      limitation is not binding) and for rms without taxable pro ts, but very rare
                      for top executives.

                                              Severance Pay

        Legislation and Disclosure:

            The 2006 Disclosure Rules require rms to disclose all contractual severance pay-
             ments in the event of any form of termination (e.g., dismissal, retirement, change of
             control) and how the payment di¤ers by termination event.
            Section 951 of Dodd-Frank added Section 14A(b) to the 1934 Act. This rule requires
               rms soliciting votes to approve a merger, going-private transaction, or third-party
             tender o¤er to disclose any golden parachutes (severance payments that apply upon
             the above changes of control) and, in certain circumstances, conduct a non-binding
             shareholder vote. The SEC implemented the new disclosure requirements by adding
             Item 402(t) to Regulation S-K on January 25, 2011.
  86
    For example, they are limited to $100,000 per executive per year (calculated as the stock price multiplied
by the number of options on the grant date). To maximize tax bene ts and qualify for the long-term capital
gains tax rate, the executive needs to hold the stock for at least one year after the exercise date and two years
after the grant date.

                                                      136
 Accounting. FAS 88, FAS 112, and FAS 146 (now subsumed by ASC 712) stipulate
  that a voluntary termination bene t must be recognized when the employee accepts the
  termination o¤er. An involuntary termination bene t must be recognized once it becomes
  probable.

 Tax :

     Section 280G of the IRC stipulates that, if a golden parachute exceeds three times
      base compensation, the excess above base compensation (not three times base com-
      pensation) is non-deductible to the employer. Base compensation is de ned as the
      executives average taxable gross income received from the rm over the most recent
       ve years (and thus includes gains from option exercises).
     If a golden parachute exceeds three times base compensation, Section 4999 of the
      IRC imposes a 20% excise tax (in addition to income tax) on the excess above base
      compensation (not three times base compensation), payable by the recipient.
     All severance payments are subject to income tax by the recipient.


                                      Pensions

 Legislation: The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) has es-
  tablished reporting obligations and minimum standards for participation, vesting and
  funding for both de ned bene t (DB) and de ned contribution (DC) pension plans.

 Disclosure: The 2006 Disclosure Rules require the following for both DB and DC pensions:

     Column (h) of the SCT discloses the annual increase in the present value of pension
      bene ts (aggregated with any above-market interest or preferential dividends on non-
      quali ed deferred compensation). This amount is included in total compensation
      (column (j)). Previously, these changes did not need to be disclosed.
     An additional Pension Bene ts Table that includes, plan by plan, the present value
      of accumulated bene ts and the payments during the year under each plan.

 Accounting: For DC plans, rms are required to expense the annual pension contribution.
  For DB plans, rms are required to expense the pension cost, which incorporates the
  service and interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service
  cost, and actuarial gains and losses. The relevant FASs (87 and 158) are now subsumed
  under ASC 715.

 Tax :

     Executive pensions comprise two components:

                                         137
           For the quali ed component, the annual contribution is tax-deductible for the
             rm and taxable for the executive only upon payment. Section 401(a) of the
            IRC sets out the requirements for quali ed pension plans, and Section 415 gives
            the limits on the annual bene ts and annual contributions. Due to these limits,
            the bulk of executive pensions are non-quali ed.
           For the non-quali ed component (known as the Supplemental Employee Retire-
            ment Plan or SERP), Section 409A of the IRC stipulates that the pension
            bene ts are tax-deductible for the rm only upon payment, in contrast to quali-
             ed plans (where it is immediately tax-deductible). Bene ts are taxable for the
            executive upon payment, similar to quali ed plans.

                               Deferred Compensation

 Disclosure: The 2006 Disclosure Rules require the following:

      Column (h) of the SCT discloses any above-market interest or preferential dividends
       on non-quali ed deferred compensation (aggregated with the increase in the present
       value of pension bene ts). This amount is included in total compensation (column
       (j)). Previously, these earnings were included in Other Annual Compensation, ag-
       gregated with items such as perks.
      An additional Nonquali ed Deferred Compensation Table that includes executive
       and company contributions, earnings, withdrawals, and the year-end balance of any
       deferred compensation.

 Accounting: Since 1967, APB Opinion No. 12 has required deferred compensation ex-
  penses to be amortized over the period until which the employee is fully eligible to receive
  the bene ts.

 Tax :

      Deferred compensation is non-quali ed, and thus typically neither tax-deductible for
       the rm nor taxable for the employee until payment.
      Section 409A of the IRC restricts withdrawals from deferred compensation accounts
       to pre-determined dates or events (such as death, disability, change in control, or
       emergencies), prohibits the acceleration of withdrawals, and prevents executives from
       receiving severance-related deferred compensation until six months after termination.
       If a deferred compensation plan satis es the Section 409A requirements, an executive
       is taxed when plan distributions are made. If it does not, the executive pays tax
       when the deferred amounts vest (even if they are not distributed until a subsequent
       year), plus an additional excise tax of 20% and interest on the amount payable.

                                     Clawbacks

 Legislation and disclosure:

     Section 304 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires rms, in the event of a nancial restatement
      due to misconduct, to claw back CEOs and CFOs bonuses, equity-based pay and
      pro ts on stock sales over the last twelve months.
     Section 954 of Dodd-Frank added Section 10D to the 1934 Act. To implement it, the
      SEC proposed Rule 10D-1 on July 1, 2015, which forces national securities exchanges
      and associations to establish listing standards that require listed companies to adopt,
      disclose, and implement a clawback policy. The proposed rule broadens clawback
      policies to all executives, and stipulates the terms and amount of clawbacks. Upon a
        nancial restatement due to a material error, an executive must repay that portion
      of any incentive compensation received during the three prior years that would not
      have been received based on the restated accounts. The clawback is to be no fault,
      i.e., apply regardless of whether the executive was responsible for the restatement,
      and even if there is no misconduct.


                                        Perks

 Legislation: Section 402 of Sarbanes-Oxley amended Section 13 of the 1934 Act to prohibit
  all personal loans to executives and directors. Other forms of perks are generally not
  prohibited.

 Disclosure:

     The 1978 Disclosure Rules rst mandated the disclosure of perks. If total perks
      exceeded $10,000, the total amount had to be reported as a column in the SCT (ag-
      gregated with other types of additional compensation, such as insurance payments),
      but individual perks did not need to be disclosed.
     The 1992 Disclosure Rules changed the disclosure threshold to the lower of $50,000
      or 10% of the executives salary plus bonus. Perks were again aggregated with other
      additional compensation items in the Other Annual Compensation column. Firms
      must identify and quantify any individual perk that exceeds 25% of total perks in a
      footnote.
     The 2006 Disclosure Rules lowered the threshold from $50,000 to $10,000. If total
      perks exceed $10,000, rms must identify each perk, regardless of its amount; perks
      that exceed the greater of $25,000 or 10% of total perks must be quanti ed in a
      footnote.


                                          139
        Accounting: APB Opinion No. 28 requires that rms expense perks.

        Tax : The IRC of 1954 stipulated that executives report perks as income. However, few
         executives did so, because rms did not disclose perks, and so the Internal Revenue Service
         (IRS) was unable to enforce their taxation. The 1978 disclosure rule helped the IRS to
         enforce taxation.


                             Say-on-Pay and Shareholder Proposals

        Legislation and Disclosure:

            Prior to 1992, the SEC had prohibited shareholder proposals on executive pay from
             being included in rms proxy materials, on the basis that executive pay was part
             of a rms ordinary business (the ordinary course of business exemption). The
             SECs de nition of ordinary business has changed over time, and in 1992 it an-
             nounced that proposals about executive compensation would no longer be automati-
             cally disallowed. Also in 1992, the SEC amended its proxy rules to make it easier for
             shareholders to communicate with each other and to publish their voting positions
             on shareholder and management proposals.
            From 1992, shareholders are allowed to propose non-binding resolutions on execu-
             tive pay, and rms are required to include submitted proposals in their proxy state-
             ments.87
            Section 951 of Dodd-Frank added Section 14A(a) to the 1934 Act. Starting with the
              rst annual shareholders meeting on or after January 21, 2011, rms are required
             to conduct a non-binding shareholder vote on executive compensation at least once
             every three years, and an additional non-binding frequency vote at least once
             every six years to determine whether the say-on-pay vote will occur every one, two,
             or three years. Section 14A(a) also requires rms to disclose the outcome of both
             votes, and whether such votes are binding (as Item 24 in the proxy ling). Because
             of Dodd-Frank, the SEC also added Item 402(b)(1)(vii) to Regulation S-K, requiring
              rms to disclose whether and how they have considered the results of the most recent
             say-on-pay vote in determining current compensation.


                Compensation Committees and Compensation Consultants

        Legislation and Disclosure:
  87
    This is di¤erent from a say-on-pay vote, which automatically occurs at a given frequency and is to approve
a pay report. Instead, a shareholder resolution is an action initiated by shareholders. See Ertimur, Ferri, and
Muslu (2011) for a study of such resolutions.




                                                     140
            Legislation does not require compensation consultants to be independent, as long as
             any conicts are taken into account when selecting consultants and disclosed (see
             below).
            The NYSE listing rules, approved in November 2003, required rms to have a com-
             pensation committee that comprises solely of independent directors.88 The Nasdaq
             listing rules, also approved in November 2003, were similar but less stringent: If there
             was a separate compensation committee, it had to be fully independent, but rms
             were not required to have compensation committees  if there was none, compensa-
             tion can be determined by a majority of independent directors. A 2013 change to
             the Nasdaq listing rules requires rms to have a compensation committee consisting
             of at least two independent directors.
            The 2006 Disclosure Rules required rms to disclose the role and identity of all con-
             sultants who provided advice on director and executive compensation, and whether
             they were engaged directly by the compensation committee or by management.
            In 2009, the SEC expanded the disclosure requirements through Item 407(e)(3)(iii)
             of Regulation S-K. If rms spend more than $120,000 on other services from their
             compensation consultants, they must disclose the fees paid for both compensation
             and other services. However, they were not required to disclose the nature of these
             other services.
            Section 952 of Dodd-Frank added Section 10C to the 1934 Act, which expanded the
             de nition of compensation committee independence, stipulated that compensation
             committees can only hire consultants after taking into account their independence,
             and added disclosure requirements relating to consultants potential conicts. To
             implement the latter, the SEC added Item 407(e)(3)(iv) to Regulation S-K on June
             20, 2012, requiring rms to disclose the nature of any conicts of interest with
             compensation consultants (e.g., the consultant providing other services) and how
             the conict is being addressed.

                                            Peer Groups

        Disclosure:

            The 1992 Disclosure Rules required rms to include a line graph comparing the
             companys 5-year stock return with the returns on both a broad market index and an
             industry or peer group index. However, rms had exibility to report whether they
             used peer groups to determine pay, and were not required to disclose the composition
             of any peer group used.
  88
    Sarbanes-Oxley required the audit committee to be independent, but imposed no requirement on compen-
sation committees.

                                                  141
     The 2006 Disclosure Rules required rms to disclose whether they engaged in any
      benchmarking of any material element of compensation, identify the benchmark and,
      if applicable, its components (including the composition of peer groups).
     Section 953(a) of Dodd-Frank added Section 14(i) to the 1934 Act, requiring disclo-
      sure of the relationship between executive compensation and rm nancial perfor-
      mance. To implement it, the SEC proposed the addition of Item 402(v) to Regulation
      S-K on April 29, 2015. This rule, not yet adopted, requires a rm to report its total
      shareholder return and that of its selected peer group in a table.


                               A.2.     The U.K.
                                      General

 The Companies Act of 2006 applies to all U.K. rms, although it sets out di¤erent rules
  for di¤erent rms (e.g., private and public rms).

 The Financial Conduct Authority applies additional requirements for rms listed on the
  London Stock Exchange (LSE).

     The LSE has two markets:
          The rst is the Main Market, where two listings are possible: for a Standard
           listing, rms need only meet EU harmonized standards; for a Premium listing,
           they need to meet the U.K.s listing rules.
          The second is the Alternative Investment Market, which has a simpli ed regu-
           latory environment and is targeted at smaller rms.
     Premium listed rms must also adhere to the U.K. Corporate Governance Code,
      which was rst introduced in 1992 by the Cadbury Committee and is now produced
      by the Financial Reporting Council. This code is comply or explain  rms have
      the option not to comply with certain elements, but they must disclose why.

 Legislation:

     From 2002, Section 241A of the Companies Act 1985 (which was superseded by
      Section 439 of the Companies Act 2006) required U.K.-incorporated rms listed
      on the LSE Main Market (or in a state in the European Economic Area, on the
      NYSE, or Nasdaq) to hold an annual non-binding say-on-pay vote on the directors
      remuneration report.
     From 2013, Section 421 of the Companies Act 2006 required the directors remuner-
      ation report to contain a separate, forward-looking section on remuneration policy,
      and Section 439A mandated rms to hold a binding vote on this policy report

                                         142
       at least once every three years. Firms continue to have to hold an annual, non-
       binding vote on the other, backward-looking parts of the remuneration report (the
       implementation report).
     The Financial Conduct Authority Listing Rule 9.4.1 requires that directors share
      schemes and long-term incentive plans must be approved by shareholders in a binding
      resolution at the annual general meeting. Unlike say-on-pay, which applies to the
      entire pay policy, this rule speci cally applies to directors share schemes.
     The U.K. Corporate Governance Code (Provision D.2.4) recommends a binding
      shareholder vote on approval of new long-term incentive schemes and signi cant
      changes to existing schemes.
     Section 188 of the Companies Act 2006 requires a shareholder resolution to approve a
      provision that guarantees a directors employment for more than two years (reduced
      from ve years under the Companies Act 1985, Section 319).
     Section 217 of the Companies Act 2006 mandates shareholder approval of termination
      payments (payments for loss of o¢ce), except payments that the company is legally
      required to make due to existing obligations and pensions under Section 220.
     Section 226C of the Companies Act 2006 requires that no payment for loss of o¢ce
      may be made to a director of a U.K.-quoted rm, unless the payment is consistent
      with the approved directors remuneration policy, or was approved by a shareholder
      resolution.

 Disclosure:

     Under the Companies Act 1985, rms had to report the sum of salary and bonus
      of the highest paid UK director (but not his identity), the total emoluments all of
      directors, and the number of directors within various pay bands.
     Following the inuential Greenbury Report (1995), the London Stock Exchange
      amended its listing rules in December 1995 to require more detailed disclosure of
      director compensation. The new listing rules also required that the boards remu-
      neration committee consist exclusively of non-executive directors.
     The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (which amended the Compa-
      nies Act 1985) required all U.K.-incorporated rms listed on the LSE Main Market
      (or in a state in the European Economic Area, on the NYSE, or Nasdaq) to include
      a detailed report on directors remuneration in the annual report. This regulation
      was subsequently replaced by Section 420 of the Companies Act 2006, which requires
      the same level of disclosure.

 Article 9a and 9b of the Shareholder Rights Directive 2007/36/EC were amended on July
  8, 2015, proposing that member states adopt rules for the directors remuneration policy
  and directors remuneration report, respectively.

 Article 9a proposes the following:

     Shareholders shall have a binding vote on the directors remuneration policy at least
      every three years, and rms shall pay only in accordance with this policy. Upon a no
      vote, the rm may pay according to its existing policy (or, if no such policy exists,
      existing practices) for up to one year while the new policy is being reworked.
          Member States may change the votes to advisory.
     The remuneration policy shall explain:
          The nancial and non- nancial performance criteria (including, where appropri-
           ate, corporate social responsibility) used to determine pay
          How the pay and working conditions of employees were taken into account when
           determining the policy on director pay
          The duration of contracts and any termination payments
          Deferral periods, vesting periods, post-vesting retention periods, and clawback
           provisions
     Share-based remuneration shall not represent the most signi cant part of directors
      variable pay, except where remuneration policy includes a clear and reasoned ex-
      planation as to how such an exception contributes to the long-term interests and
      sustainability of the company.

 Article 9b proposes the following:

     Firms shall disclose, in their directors remuneration reports:
          Total compensation, how it is linked to long-term performance, and how the
            nancial and non- nancial performance criteria were applied.
          The relative change in executive director pay over the last three years, and its
           relation to both general company performance and the change in the average
           employee pay over the same period.
     Shareholders shall have an annual advisory vote on the remuneration report.

The figure shows the median level of total compensation and uses Frydman and Saks's (2010) data on the
three-highest paid executives in the 50 largest firms in 1940, 1960, and 1990. Firms are selected according
to total sales in 1960 and 1990, and according to market value in 1940. Compensation data is hand-
collected from proxy statements for all available years from 1936 to 1992; the S&P ExecuComp database
is used to extend the data to 2005. Total compensation is composed of salary, annual and long-term bonus
payments, grants of restricted stock, and stock option grants (valued using Black-Scholes). The CEO is
identified as the president of the company in firms where the CEO title is not used. “Other Top Executives”
include any executives among the three highest paid who are not the CEO. All dollar values are in inflation-
adjusted 2014 dollars.

Figure 4: Comparing CEO to Non-CEO Top Executive Pay
The three diagrams show the median and average ratio of CEO pay to average non-CEO top executive pay
within the same firm from 1992 to 2014 in S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and S&P SmallCap firms, respectively.
The calculations use ExecuComp data. Non-CEOs are any executives among the three highest-paid who
are not the CEO. Annual compensation is the sum of salaries, bonuses, payouts from long-term incentive
plans, the grant-date values of option grants (calculated using Black-Scholes), the grant-date values of
restricted stock grants, and miscellaneous other compensation.

Figure 5: The Structure of CEO Compensation from 1936 to 2005
The diagram shows the average composition of CEO pay in the 50 largest firms in 1940, 1960, and 1990
(for a total of 101 firms) and is based on Frydman and Saks's (2010) data. Firms are selected according to
total sales in 1960 and 1990, and according to market value in 1940. Compensation data is hand-collected
from proxy statements for all available years from 1936 to 1992; the S&P ExecuComp database is used to
extend the data to 2005. The figure depicts the three main components that can be separately tracked
over the sample period: salaries and current bonuses, payouts from long-term incentive plans (including
the value of restricted stock), and the grant-date values of option grants (calculated using Black-Scholes).

Figure 9: CEO Incentives from 1992 to 2014
The diagrams show the median equity incentives of CEOs in S&P 500 (Panel A), S&P MidCap (Panel B) and
S&P SmallCap (Panel C) firms from 1992 to 2014 and are based on ExecuComp data. Effective percentage
ownership is calculated as (number of shares held + number of options held * average option delta) /
(number of shares outstanding). Option deltas and holdings are computed using the Core and Guay (2002)
approximation. Effective dollar ownership is the product of effective percentage ownership and the firm’s
equity market capitalization. All dollar values are in inflation-adjusted 2014 dollars.

Figure 10: Performance-Vesting Stock and Performance Shares
The figures depict a typical performance-vesting stock grant (Panel A) and a typical performance-share
grant (Panel B). Each grant uses only one performance metric. The mapping from performance into the
number of securities delivered at vesting, depicted as the bold line, is given by the terms of the grant. The
dollar payoff, depicted as the dotted line, depends on the stock price at vesting. The figures assume that
the stock price increases linearly with performance.

Figure 11: Bonus Plans
The figure depicts a typical bonus plan (that uses only one performance metric). No bonus is paid until
performance reaches a lower threshold, at which point the payoff jumps to the “hurdle bonus”. On the
upside, the bonus is capped at a second threshold. In the “incentive zone” between the lower and upper
threshold, the bonus increases in performance. This increase may be linear, as shown in the figure, but
may also be convex or concave. In the middle of the incentive zone is a “target” performance level at
which a “target bonus” is awarded.

Figure 12: The Structure of CEO Compensation by Country
This diagram shows the average composition of CEO pay in 11 countries from 2002-2009. The U.S. data is
from ExecuComp and the non-U.S. data is from BoardEx. First-year CEOs, firms that cannot be matched
to Worldscope, and firm-years with incomplete compensation data are dropped. Bonus includes all non-
equity incentive payments, Stock & Options include grant-date values of stock options and restricted stock
(including performance shares), and Other includes pensions and other benefits.

Table 1: Compensation Levels from 1992 to 2014
The two panels show the median and mean annual pay for CEOs (Panel A) and non-CEO top executives
(Panel B) from 1992 to 2014 in S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and S&P SmallCap firms. The calculations use
ExecuComp data and include the CEO and the three highest-paid executives for each firm-year. Non-CEOs
are any executives among the three highest-paid who are not the CEO. Annual compensation is the sum
of salary, bonus, payouts from long-term incentive plans, the grant-date value of option grants (calculated
using Black-Scholes), the grant-date value of restricted stock grants, and miscellaneous other
compensation. All values are in inflation-adjusted 2014 millions of dollars.

Table 2: Cross-Sectional Variation in CEO Pay
The table shows panel regressions of annual CEO pay on firm and CEO characteristics using ExecuComp
data from 1992-2014 for S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and S&P SmallCap firms. Annual compensation is the sum
of salary, bonus, payouts from long-term incentive plans, the grant-date value of option grants (calculated
using Black-Scholes), the grant-date value of restricted stock grants, and miscellaneous other
compensation. Firm value is market value of equity + (book assets - book equity - deferred taxes). Volatility
is the standard deviation of monthly log returns over the previous 60 months, requiring that at least 48
months of returns are available. If more than one class of stock is traded, returns are the capitalization-
weighted average return. Column (6) includes only CEOs with at least 5 years of tenure. Industries are the
48 Fama and French (1997) industries. Total pay, firm value, and volatility are winsorized at the 1% level,
and all nominal values are in inflation-adjusted 2014 dollars. Standard errors are clustered at the firm
level. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at the 5%, 1%, and 0.1% levels, respectively.

Table 3: Managerial Incentives and Equity Holdings from 1936 to 2005
The table shows median effective percentage and dollar equity ownership and median stock and option
holdings of the three-highest paid executives in the 50 largest firms in 1940, 1960, and 1990 and is based
on Frydman and Saks's (2010) data. Firms are selected according to total sales in 1960 and 1990, and
according to market value in 1940. Compensation data is hand-collected from proxy statements for all
available years from 1936 to 1992; the S&P ExecuComp database is used to extend the data to 2005. Each
column shows the median across all executives in each decade. Effective percentage ownership is
calculated as (number of shares held + number of options held * average option delta) / (number of shares
outstanding). Option deltas are computed using the Core and Guay (2002) approximation. Effective dollar
ownership is the product of effective percentage ownership and the firm’s equity market capitalization.
The value of stock holdings is the number of shares owned at the beginning of the year multiplied by the
stock price. The value of option holdings is the Black-Scholes value calculated at the beginning of the year.
All dollar values are in inflation-adjusted 2014 dollars.

Table 4: Cross-Sectional Variation in CEO Ownership Incentives
The table shows panel regressions of CEOs' effective percentage ownership (Panel A), effective dollar
ownership (Panel B), and annual changes in firm-related wealth (Panel C) on firm and CEO characteristics
using ExecuComp data from 1992-2014 for S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and S&P SmallCap firms. Effective
percentage ownership and effective dollar ownership are calculated as in Table 3. Annual changes in firm-
related wealth are the sum of annual flow compensation plus annual stock returns times the CEO's
beginning-of-year effective dollar ownership. Firm value is market value of equity + (book assets - book
equity - deferred taxes). Volatility is the standard deviation of monthly log returns over the previous 60
months, requiring that at least 48 months are available. If more than one class of stock is traded, returns
are the capitalization-weighted average return. Dollar volatility is percentage volatility times equity
market capitalization at the start of the year. Column (4) of Panels A and B includes only CEOs with at least
5 years of tenure. Industries are the 48 Fama and French (1997) industries. Volatility is winsorized at 1%,
and all nominal values are in inflation-adjusted 2014 dollars. Standard errors are clustered at the firm
level. +, *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, 1%, and 0.1% levels, respectively.

 Table 5: CEO Compensation Across Countries
 The table shows the level and composition of CEO pay in 11 countries from 2002-2009. The U.S. data is
 from ExecuComp and the non-U.S. data from BoardEx. First-year CEOs, firms that cannot be matched to
 Worldscope, and firm-years with incomplete compensation data are dropped. All non-US compensation
 numbers are converted to U.S. dollars using annual average exchange rates. Bonus includes all non-equity
 incentive payments, Stock & Options include grant-date values of stock options and restricted stock
 (including performance shares), and Other includes pensions and other benefits.
