Optimal Tariffs and Trade Policy Formation: U.S. Evidence from the Smoot-Hawley Era

                                           ABSTRACT

This paper examines the political economy of U.S. trade policy around the time of the Smoot-
Hawley tariff of 1930, a period when policy was unconstrained by trade agreements. We consider
a model of politically-optimal trade policy for a large country that can influence its terms of trade
and where workers and firms lobby for protection. The predictions of the model hinge on import
demand and export supply elasticities, which we estimate using detailed U.S. import data from
1927-35, as well as industry lobbying data. We find that tariff levels are largely determined by
firm lobbies, but about about 5 percentage points of the tariffs are explained by terms of trade
considerations. Decomposing the politically-optimal tariff in 1931 reveals an intensification of
demand for protection by workers in the Smoot-Hawley tariff.

1    Introduction

What objective is a government trying to achieve in setting import tariffs? The answer
hinges in part on whether a country bases its policy on purely domestic factors (in a non-
cooperative setting) or negotiates with other countries to reach agreements on tariffs (in a
cooperative setting). Since World War II, the United States, the European Community, and
other leading countries have bound their tariffs in cooperative trade agreements through the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Bagwell and Staiger (2011) view these
agreements as a way of escaping a terms-of-trade driven prisoner's dilemma in which, in
the absence of cooperation, each country would impose optimal tariffs and reduce trade to
suboptimal levels. An alternative hypothesis by Maggi and Rodríguez-Clare (2007) is that
governments sign such agreements to commit themselves to lower tariffs in the face of special
interest lobbying. Of course, as Grossman and Helpman (1995) suggest, governments may
be responding to both terms-of-trade considerations and domestic interests in negotiating
trade agreements. Although it is difficult to pierce the veil of negotiations to understand the
motivations driving trade agreements, some progress has been made in understanding the
bargaining process (Bagwell et al. (2020)).
    But what factors would drive government behavior in the absence of such agreements
when countries have complete autonomy in setting tariff rates? It could be for purely do-
mestic reasons, partly based on social welfare and partly based on industry influence, as in
the Grossman and Helpman (1994) "protection for sale" model. Or it could be the desire
to impose optimal tariffs that maximize the national advantage through terms-of-trade ma-
nipulation. It is difficult to answer this question because the existence of cooperative trade
agreements in recent decades does not allow us to observe unconstrained, non-cooperative
trade policies by major countries such as the United States that might have both a terms-
of-trade motive for tariffs and also be susceptible to producer and consumer interests. For
example, Goldberg and Maggi (1999) test the protection-for-sale model on U.S. data (using
non-tariff barrier coverage ratios from the 1980s because tariffs were set cooperatively) but
do not take into account market-power considerations. Broda et al. (2008) estimate trade

elasticities and calculate optimal tariffs for a small sample of countries that were not mem-
bers of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and hence formally unconstrained in their
tariff setting. They find surprisingly high estimated optimal tariffs, given that their sample
consists of small developing countries, but they do not fully explore political economy fac-
tors, only including the inverse import-penetration ratio in some of their analysis as a proxy
for such effects. Similarly, Bagwell et al. (2020) look at a sample of small countries (China
being an exception) that had unconstrained policies prior to their WTO membership to see
how accession changed their tariff structure, but they do not focus on the underlying deter-
minants of those pre-negotiation tariffs. By contrast, Ossa (2014) provides data-based (2007
benchmark) simulation evidence for countries that are more plausibly "large," suggesting
that the non-cooperative U.S. tariff would be 60 percent based on terms-of-trade factors and
57 percent based on terms-of-trade and domestic lobbying factors combined. In sum, it is
difficult to find large countries today that would have a strong terms-of-trade motive for
optimal tariffs and yet are not members of the GATT/WTO and hence unconstrained in
their ability to set tariffs as they please.
    This paper seeks to shed light on non-cooperative tariff setting in a large country by
looking at the United States in a unique historical period when its tariff policy was uncon-
strained by international agreements and was therefore set purely for domestic reasons, not
in multilateral negotiations. We focus on the late 1920s and early 1930s, around the time
of the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, a period when tariffs were the only major instrument of
trade policy (import quotas were not yet employed) and industry lobbying was fairly trans-
parent as revealed in the Congressional hearings on the tariff schedule. At the same time, as
the world's largest economy, the United States was likely to have had market power vis-a-vis
imports and therefore may have benefited from an optimal tariff in the absence of retalia-
tion.1 The availability of highly detailed import data allows us to estimate trade elasticities
at what today would be considered the 4-digit level. Thus, in this historical period when the
U.S. policymakers (members of Congress) had complete discretion in setting tariffs, we can

     Although the US did not anticipate it, Mitchener et al. (2021) shows that there was significant foreign
retaliation against the Smoot-Hawley tariff.

examine whether tariffs were set on the basis of market power (trade elasticities) or domestic
political factors (industry lobbying) and to determine the relative weights placed on both.
    This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a basic framework for thinking
about optimal tariff setting for a large country that also faces domestic political pressure to
protect certain industries. What we call the political-optimal tariff takes into account terms
of trade effects (the standard optimal tariff), domestic political economy considerations (firm
and worker lobbying), and social welfare (consumer well-being). Section 3 describes the trade
data and the method of estimating elasticities that provides the basis of our analysis. The
combination of detailed elasticity estimates allows us to calculate the optimal tariff at a the
4-digit industry level. We find that the median (inverse) export supply elasticity implies
a median optimal tariff of 14 percent and that there is a weak but positive relationship
between the implied optimal and actual applied tariff. In Section 4 we introduce lobbying
and find that these political-economy determinants of tariffs slightly dominate the terms
of trade factors in explaining the pattern of tariffs across goods. We also decompose the
applied tariffs into lobbying and terms of trade components, suggesting that about half of
the tariff level is due to firm lobbying with the remainder split between worker lobbies and
terms-of-trade factors.2


2       Optimal Tariffs and Lobbying: Theory

We focus on a particular historical period in which the United States (i) had complete
autonomy in setting its tariff (i.e., policymakers were unconstrained by any cooperative
agreements on tariff levels), (ii) was likely to have had substantial market power in trade,
and (iii) had domestic producers and workers lobbying for tariffs on particular products.
To frame our discussion, we consider a trade policy model in the spirit of Grossman and
Helpman (1995) where an importing country has market power and industry lobbies make

    This paper will not discuss the historical background to the Smoot-Hawley tariff except insofar as it
bears upon the issues analyzed in this paper; for further details, see Irwin (2011) and Irwin (2017).

contributions for protection.3 First, we assume a fraction of workers (l ) receive specific
factor rents (k ) and decide how much to contribute to a local lobby. Imports from country
i of good k are denoted by xk , and total consumption of good k by dk . A worker in industry
k thus obtains welfare that is the sum of their wages (normalized to unity), distributed tariff
revenue (r(k )) and consumer surplus (s(k )),


                   Wl,k = 1 + l,k + l          (k - 1)pk xk + u(dk (pk )) - pk dk ,               (1)
                                           k

                                                   r (k)              s(k )




where k are tariffs levied on product k such that the consumption price (pk ) is the product
of shipped prices (p                            
                    k ) and the tariff: pk = k pk .


   In addition to worker organized lobbies, all domestic firms decide to pay a portion of their
excess profits to fund a lobby representing firm interests. We treat the payoff to firms as a
portion of their fixed costs less contributions. That is to say, firms' payoffs are determined
by their excess profitability used to cover fixed costs and political contributions. Denoting
firms' total fixed costs by F Cf and the fraction of excess profits paid by the firm as f yields
the payoff function,


                            Wf,k = F Cf - (1 - f )[pk qf,k - f,k - 1],                            (2)


where qf,k is firm output, such that qk =          qf,k is industrial output and dk = xk + qk is total
                                               f
consumption. We will assume domestic firms are identical in terms of marginal costs and
compete under monopolistic competition. Consequently firm prices and output are identical.
However, we allow for the possibility that fixed costs are firm specific such that a subset of
firms can afford to contribute to the lobby.
   The government payoff is then the sum of worker earnings, tariff revenues, consumer
   3
     As already noted, Grossman and Helpman (1994) considers industry lobbying but in a small country
context.

surplus, and firm profits across all goods:


            WG = 1 +        k + r(k ) + s(k ) +                            pk qk - f,k - 1 - F Cf       .      (3)
                        k                                  k       f



In order to determine the politically-optimal tariff policy we follow Grossman and Helpman
(1995). A social planner thus chooses the tariff that maximizes the objective function,


                                  = aW G +             Wl,k +                  Wf,k ,                          (4)
                                                   l                   f




where a  [0, ) is the importance of the government payoff relative to workers and firms.
We will assume that each product enters independently such that the planner chooses an
optimal tariff good by good. Choosing the tariff that maximizes the planner's problem for
good k is then,

    In essence, what we refer to as the politically-optimal tariff is a combination of two
components, the term-of-trade factor (captured by the foreign export supply elasticity) and
the political-economy factor (which depends on lobbying by firms and workers, the import
demand elasticity, import penetration, and the government's weight on social welfare). Our
equation (5) is essentially the same as Grossman and Helpman (1995) equation (16) except
that we have firm lobbies as well.
    An empirical assessment of this framework requires estimates of the elasticity of import
demand k , the elasticity of (inverse) foreign export supply k , and indicators of whether
                                                     L      F
workers and firms lobby the government over policy, Ik and Ik , respectively. The next
section provides details on these matters.


3    Trade Data and Elasticity Estimates

The key to providing a structural estimate of the model presented above is data on imports
and domestic production at the product level along with estimates of demand and supply
elasticities. Estimates of the elasticity of (domestic) import demand and (foreign) export
supply require detailed data on the price and quantity of imports by source country. The
annual volumes "Foreign Commerce and Navigation of the United States," published by the
Department of Commerce, provides such data. We digitized section 4 of these reports for
the years 1927-1935, covering the years around the Smoot-Hawley tariff change. In each
year, this table reports the value of imports for a particular commodity or good by country,
along with the quantity imported by country (at what today would be roughly the 4-digit
level; e.g., raw silk from Japan, perennially the largest US import in our data, is code 3702).
This allows a unit-value price to be calculated for each product in question. The section
also reports the ad valorem tariff equivalent for each product category in each year. (Many
import duties at this time took the form of specific duties.) As dictated by the theory,
we also require domestic production data at the product level in order to construct import
penetration measures. These data are only available every other year through the Census of
Manufactures and the Census of Agriculture.


                                              7
   Table 1 reports the summary statistics of the combined trade and production data every
other year from 1927-1935. The value, volume, and unit value of imports fall considerably
after 1930 with the onset of deflation and Great Depression. The median tariff also rises
after 1929, a combination of the higher rates in the 1930 legislation and the lower import
prices acting on specific duties (Irwin (1998)). The average number of imported goods is
between 650-750 and the average number of varieties is between 9,000-14,000 (representing
the average number of countries from which the United States imports a particular good).
The average number of varieties falls during this period, which has implications for the
welfare gains from trade.

However, Soderbery (2015) demonstrates that there are significant biases in these methods.
He develops a hybrid estimator that corrects for small sample biases and constrained search
inefficiencies and finds that the standard methods tend to overstate the median demand
elasticity. Overestimating import demand elasticities carries a host of implications in quan-
tifying welfare. Most relevant in our setting is that high import demand elasticities imply
low optimal tariffs.

    This paper uses the Soderbery (2015) method to estimate trade elasticities using the
import data from 1927-35. At this point, we give specific functional forms to consumer pref-
erences and export supply, with the goal of maintaining consistency with the literature and
facilitate quantification. A representative consumer in each country maximizes her utility
by choosing imports and domestic consumption. Following the standard in the literature
in a way that is consistent with the lobbying model, assume consumers aggregate over the
composite domestic (D) and imported (X ) goods. The subutility derived from the com-
posite imported good will be given by a CES aggregation across imported varieties with a
good-importer specific elasticity of substitution given by k . Note that we suppress importer
subscripts as the United States is our sole focus. Imports of the particular variety of good
k from country j are denoted by xjk . Import demand is also augmented by a variety spe-
cific taste parameter bjk . Consumers purchase a numeraire, c0 from the policy side of the
model, and aggregate their consumption through a Cobb-Douglas function.4 Under these
assumptions, the utility obtained by a representative consumer can be written as:
                                                                               -

The importer consumes fixed shares D and X of domestic and imported goods, respectively.
Furthermore, the imported composite is formed by consumption of fixed shares of each
imported good given by Cobb-Douglas parameters k . The separability of utility allows us
to focus on prices and consumption of imported goods in the estimation.5 This specification
also implies that trade policy affects goods independently, which was assumed in the trade
   4
      The numeraire abstracts away from quantifying wage effects in order to focus on trade flows and policy
as well as product elasticities. Our preferences also rule out income effects in the model. Both assumptions
prevail in the literature (c.f, Broda, Limão and Weinstein (2008)) but none are necessary for estimation.
The structural assumption facilitating estimation is the CES form of the imported variety nest.
    5
      Finally note, the form of the domestic consumption nest is also irrelevant for estimation as long as it is
independent from the import nest. This assumption is induced by data availability. If we observed prices and
quantities of domestic sales we would include them in the import nest and estimation. Unfortunately such
data (specifically quantities and prices) are not available in this time period and we are forced to assume
they are separable (Cobb-Douglas being the most convenient).

policy component of the theory and is consistent with what we know about Congressional
tariff-setting at the time.
   Foreign varieties are exported following the iso-elastic export supply curve proposed by
Feenstra (1994):


                                      pjk = exp(jk )(xjk )
                                                          k
                                                            ,                                    (7)


where k is the inverse export supply elasticity, j,k is a technology parameter, pjk are shipped


prices and xjk are total imports from country j .
   In terms of estimation, we follow the Soderbery (2015) modification of Feenstra (1994).
We apply the heteroskedastic estimator of supply and demand that relies on time series
variation in imported prices and quantities. The methodology addresses unobservables by
first- and reference-country differencing; consistency depends on independence of supply (jk )
and demand (bjk ) error terms.
   To estimate supply and demand, we use detailed U.S. import data from every year 1927-
1935. Although detailed tariff data are only available every other year from 1927-1935, our
method of reference differencing eliminates the need for those data at an annual frequency,
as the tariffs were applied uniformly across importers within the year.6 This allows us to
apply the estimator to the full sample of trade data and incorporate the tariff data with the
elasticities when we examine optimal policy.
   This approach yields estimates of two key parameters: k (the elasticity of import de-
mand) and k (the inverse elasticity of foreign export supply) for each good k . Table 2 reports
the mean, median, and inter-quartile range of the estimates for each year. The distribution
of estimates across products has a long tail which explains the large wedge between the mean
and median estimate; other researchers have also found the estimates of the export supply
elasticities to be quite noisy across products. The mean estimated (inverse) export supply
elasticity is about 7 whereas the median estimate is 0.175, implying the median optimal

import tariff (on terms of trade grounds) is 17.5 percent. Remarkably, this magnitude is also
very close to Nicita et al. (2018), who estimate the median (inverse) export supply elasticity
facing the United States to be 0.14, implying an optimal tariff of about 14 percent, based on
detailed import data from 1988-2007. By contrast, using a simulation model benchmarked
on 2007 data, Ossa (2014) calculates the optimal U.S. tariff to be about 60 percent.

   Table 2 also reports the estimated import demand elasticities. The median import de-
mand elasticity (in absolute value) is roughly 2.9 and is also fairly consistent across years.
Notice that since import demand and export supply elasticities are themselves constant,
variation in their statistical moments reflect churning in goods over time. The mean elastic-
ity of import demand k is about 6 which is slightly larger than the mean of 5.2 estimated
for 1993-2007 as reported in Table 4 of Soderbery (2015).
   Figures 1-4 present four ways of showing the relationship between the actual applied tariff
and the implied optimal tariffs on terms of trade grounds. (For now, we are setting aside
lobbying motives and assume that policymakers give zero weight to political contributions
                                           F
and firm lobbies are unorganized, a   and Ik = 0, implying   =  .) Figure 1 presents
the median applied and optimal tariff across industries for the different years. At a first
pass, the applied and optimal (terms of trade) tariffs seem to be surprisingly closely related,
even before lobbying is considered. In general, the applied (non-cooperative) tariffs fall
below the optimal level as suggested by the export supply elasticity. To summarize Figure

1, Figure 2 uses a lowess to fit a curve through the raw medians. The major deviations of
the inverse export supply elasticity and applied tariff are for products 26 (tobacco products),
83 (industrial chemicals) and 94 (toys and sporting goods). According to these results, the
applied tariffs in these categories are much lower than the implied optimal (terms of trade)
tariffs ­ we can see from Figure 1, these differences a mostly attributed to a relatively high
inverse export supply elasticity estimate.

   A substantial number of the applied tariffs are close to zero; about 25 percent of the tariff
lines/categories were given duty free treatment (about 65 percent of the value of imports)
both before and after the passage of the Smoot-Hawley tariff. The duty free list included
many goods not produced at home, such as coffee and tea, tin and bananas. For these goods,
the United States probably faced a non-infinite export supply function and hence would have
benefited from an optimal tariff. In such cases, consumer welfare seems to have mattered
more to Congress than any possible terms-of-trade gain and there was no domestic firm or
worker lobby to press for these tariffs. What the Smoot-Hawley tariff revision did (by and

the kernel density of the difference between the applied and optimal tariff is still roughly
symmetric. The pattern across years in both series is very similar, although the year 1931,
the first full year after the tariff change, variation in tariff rates increases in comparison to
the late 1920s.

We now introduce domestic lobbying to our empirical analysis to see how it influences the
determination of tariffs at this time. Recall that the politically-optimal tariff from equation

of our sample. Our lobbying indicators come from testimony before the House Ways and
Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee in 1929, as reported in the published
hearings. We have separately classified testimony from industry associations and individual
firms as well as labor unions and worker representatives. Lobbying testimony will serve as an

   Our estimates of import demand and export supply provide the elasticities  and  .
Finally, we will allow for the possibility that policymakers weight tariff revenue (by  > 0)
differently than other sources of income. This assumption is salient in this time period as
tariff revenue was about 15 percent of federal revenue in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

on by the Senate.

   Our empirical implementation also draws parallels with Lashkaripour and Lugovskyy
(2021). Their model differs from ours as it is a general equilibrium model of trade with
scale economies and no lobbying. However, they find an optimal tariff formula with similar
                                              
characteristics. Matching notation, they show k = (1 + ¯)k + ¯, where ¯ is the average
tariff across sectors in the importing country. Introducing a coefficient in front of the export
supply elasticity echoes the mediation of terms of trade effects in general equilibrium shown
by Lashkaripour and Lugovskyy (2021). Additionally, firm and worker lobbying data absorbs
a portion of the average tariff control they propose. Effectively, we are controlling for general
equilibrium effects in the data through our observed lobbying channels.
   Table 4 presents the estimates of equation (8) in which the dependent variable (the
applied ad valorem tariff) is regressed on the terms of trade and political influence factors.
The first column estimates the relationship between applied tariffs and the inverse export
supply elasticities, i.e., just a regression with the terms of trade factor  , which is positively
but weakly related to the applied tariff, comparable reduced form analysis such as Broda et
al. (2008). Stepping through the channels underlying the optimal tariff, the second column
removes terms of trade motives and adds the import penetration-demand elasticities term
to look solely at worker lobbying, a specification that mirrors Goldberg and Maggi (1999)
and Matschke and Sherlund (2006) who also emphasize the importance of labor groups in
tariff determination. Drawing parallels is challenging given the differences in time periods,
but our estimates suggest a stronger role of worker lobbying in the 1920s and 1930s than is
evident in modern US data.

   In column 3 we estimate the model controlling for both terms of trade effects and worker
                                                              F
lobbying but still assuming there is no firm lobbying (e.g., Ik = 0). The coefficient estimate
1 suggests that worker testimony in industries with strong import competition results in a
much higher applied industry tariff than those where there is no such appearance before the
Congressional committees. Given the coefficient estimates we can back out the fraction of
workers in the lobby (L ), which is L = 0.231.
   The fourth column estimates the full model taking into account terms of trade, worker
and firm lobbying. The coefficient estimate 2 is also positive (and statistically significant)
but the magnitude is slightly smaller than that of the worker indicator, suggesting that
firm lobbying is not quite as influential as worker lobbying. Controlling for firm lobbying
increases the estimate of L to 0.802, which is now nearly identical to Goldberg and Maggi
(1999). We can see the importance of accounting for all of the channels proposed in the
full model. The preceding three columns illustrate the contributions of the key channels
across industries. Specifically, the importance of worker lobbying falls as terms-of-trade and
firm-lobbying motives are included in the model.

                                                    17
   Table 4 also reports the underlying parameters backed-out from the estimated coefficients.
In the full model, the government's weight on terms-of-trade factors ( ) is 0.115. The implied
government weight on social welfare () is 0.181. These parameters are roughly comparable,
indicating that tariff levels represent a somewhat greater weighting of social welfare factors
over terms of trade factors. This ranking allows us to make sense of the fact that, as noted
earlier, many imported goods were given duty-free treatment (benefiting consumers with
no direct harm to producers) when there might have been an unexploited terms-of-trade
advantage in having a tariff on such goods.
   It is difficult to compare our results with those in other papers. One comparable estimate
conceptually is government's weight on welfare.8 Goldberg and Maggi (1999) estimate a
government weight on welfare around 0.98. Our model is different along key dimensions,
but if we were crudely match functional forms, our estimate  = 0.181 implies a government
weight in their framework of 0.15. The specification in column 2 is the same as Goldberg
and Maggi (1999), and suggests a higher government weight than the full model, but it is
still only 0.27. This is still a significant level difference, but we find it is sensible given the
different time period. Goldberg and Maggi (1999) are estimating a bargaining model for the
United States at a time when trade barriers were relatively low (i.e., 1983) and constrained
by the GATT, and in which potential terms-of-trade motives for barriers are not considered.
It is credible that, given the importance of tariff revenue to the government at the time,
the government weight assigned to social welfare (e.g., consumer surplus) relative to welfare
generated from sources such as tariff revenues and lobby contributions in the 1930s would
be considerably less than the 1980s.
   Goldberg and Maggi (1999) do not estimate our  as they move export supply elasticities
to the right hand side of their specification. But our estimate of the fractions of workers
belonging to the lobby, L = 0.802, is quite similar to their estimates (L ), which range
from 0.84 to 0.88. However, we will show these similarities fade after the passage of the
Smoot-Hawley tariff in 1930.
   8                                                                                                
       Our parameter a is equivalent to the Goldberg and Maggi (1999) estimate of they denote as   1- .




                                                    18
   Other papers also have results that are suggestive in comparison with ours. Ossa (2014)
finds that the introduction of lobbying reduces that optimal U.S. import tariff from 60% to
56%, whereas we find tariffs are higher than optimal as a result of lobbying. Nicita et al.
(2018) find that three-quarters of the tariffs set by WTO members are set non-cooperatively.
This is somewhat related to our point that about 25 percent of tariff lines/categories are
duty free, implying 75 percent of tariffs are set non-cooperatively. (As noted earlier as well,
our estimate of the optimal tariff is very similar to theirs.)

                            Figure 5: Optimal Tariff Comparison




   Figure 5 provides a visual comparison of the models from Table 4. Here we predict
the optimal tariff for each of the specifications for every industry in the data. We then
plot the average predicted politically-optimal tariff against the average applied ad valorem
tariff over time. The importance of controlling for lobbying and terms of trade is evident,
especially post-Smoot Hawley. Pre-Smoot Hawley, worker lobbying appears to reasonably
explain applied tariffs, but cannot match the dramatic increase in protectionism following
Smoot-Hawley without accounting for terms-of-trade effects.
   Table 5 explores this differences across time periods empirically and reveals some inter-
esting patterns in separating the estimates by pre- and post-Smoot Hawley. The weight on
the term-of-trade impact of tariffs is roughly similar in the two periods, but the coefficient


                                               19
on the worker indicator increases, much more so that the firm indicator. This makes sense in
that the Smoot-Hawley tariffs were finalized as the United States had begun to slip into the
Great Depression, when unemployment was rising and political sensitivity to labor was prob-
ably higher. The indicator on import penetration is also lower, as foreign competition was
declining as imports fell faster than GDP with the onset of the Depression. One interesting
finding is that the government's weight on social welfare (profits, wages, revenue) is much
higher after Smoot-Hawley than before; in fact, the weight more than doubles. This suggests
that the Smoot-Hawley tariff was not imposed for terms-of-trade reasons (the weight on the
terms of trade does not change much, as noted) but for other reasons.

   To shed some light on this idea, Figure 6 decomposes the tariff into the terms of trade
component and the worker and firm lobby components. In other words, we take the param-
eter estimates and the implied lobbying parameters for year and calculate the contribution
of each factor to the political-optimal tariff of that year. Panel (a) shows the levels of the

of each factor. Before and after the imposition of the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, about
20% of the tariff level is accounted for by terms of trade considerations. This makes sense
in that there was a weak but positive correlation (+0.1) between  and the applied tariffs.
Prior to 1930, most of the tariff level ­ about three quarters, according to these calculations
­ is determined by firm lobbying, consistent with the discussion in Schattschneider (1935)
and Irwin (2011). However, after 1930, the proportion of the tariff that is accounted for
by firm lobbying declines and that accounted for by worker lobbying increases. As men-
tioned earlier, this could be explained by an increase in Congressional sensitivity to worker
concerns with the onset of the Great Depression. Thus, the changes in the tariff rates in
the Smoot-Hawley legislation were not dictated by new terms-of-trade considerations, which
were relatively constant during this period, but by firm and worker lobbies. Both firm and
worker lobbying taken individually are more important than terms of trade factors in the
setting of rates. Many of the existing factors that affect tariff setting were already built
into the base rates; the changes appear to have been driven from increased consideration to
lobbying from labor groups.

5     Conclusions

This paper has provided an integration study of tariff setting that incorporates terms-of-
trade motives and political economy factors during a period in which the United States had
complete discretion in setting tariff rates, unconstrained by cooperative trade agreements.
We find that both terms-of-trade and political-economy factors were at work in determining
the tariff schedule in the late 1920s and early 1930s, although political-feconomy consider-
ations dominate. The standard optimal tariff of the United States was around 14 percent
(median) but such factors only account for about 20 percent of the tariff level. After 1930,
lobbyists representing labor groups were more important sources of tariff setting, as one
might have expected with the onset of the Great Depression.
