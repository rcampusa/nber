A Rehabilitation of Monetary Policy in the 1950s

                                                ABSTRACT

        Monetary policy in the United States in the 1950s was remarkably modern. Analysis of Federal
Reserve records shows that policymakers had an overarching aversion to inflation and were willing to
accept significant costs to prevent it from rising to even moderate levels. This aversion to inflation was
the result of policymakers' beliefs that higher inflation could not raise output in the long run, that the level
of output that would trigger increases in inflation was only moderate, and that inflation had large real
costs in the medium and long runs. Furthermore, both narrative and empirical analysis indicates that
policymakers were not wedded to free reserves or other faulty indicators in their implementation of
policy. Empirical estimates of a forward-looking Taylor rule show that policymakers in the 1950s raised
nominal interest rates more than one-for-one with increases in expected inflation, and suggests that
monetary policy in the 1950s was more similar to policy in the 1980s and 1990s than to that in the late
1960s and 1970s. One implication of these findings is that the inflation of the late 1960s and 1970s must
have been the result of a change in the conduct of policy.

I. INTRODUCTION


        American monetary policy in the 1950s has typically been either criticized or ignored. In

the 1960s and 1970s, economists tended to portray monetary policy in the 1950s as inept and

unsophisticated. Monetarists, such as Brunner and Meltzer (1964), argued that a mistaken focus on

free reserves led the Federal Reserve to misjudge the stance of policy and hence to make policy

mistakes. Friedman (1960) emphasized the stop-go nature of policy in the 1950s, which in his

opinion led to volatile output and bouts of inflation. Keynesian economists, such as Blinder and

Goldfeld (1976), argued that the Federal Reserve of the 1950s targeted output below the natural rate

and therefore unnecessarily restrained output growth.

        More recent studies of postwar monetary policy have tended to ignore developments in the

1950s. While the inflationary policy of the 1960s and 1970s has received detailed study, the

possible continuity and change from the 1950s has received scant attention. One exception to this

pattern is a study by Calomiris and Wheelock (1998), which endorsed the Brunner and Meltzer

view that policy in the 1950s is best characterized as a continuation of the 1930s' misguided policy

of targeting free reserves.

        The tendency of researchers to criticize or ignore monetary policy in the 1950s seems

strangely at odds with economic performance in this decade. Inflation, measured using the GDP

deflator, averaged less than 2.0% per year between 1952 and 1960, and never went above 3.3% in a

single year. Real GDP over the same eight-year period grew at an average rate of 2.9% per year and

the unemployment rate averaged 4.7%. While there two recessions during this decade, that in 1954

was exceedingly mild and that in 1958 was sharp, but very brief. And, even in the worst year of the

decade, 1958, the unemployment rate was just 6.8%. While this unquestionably good economic

performance is not proof that monetary policy was similarly good in the 1950s, it is certainly

suggestive. At the very least, it implies that those who would criticize or ignore monetary policy in

this decade are left with a mystery: why was performance so good if monetary policy was poor or
                                                                                                          2

inept?

         This paper suggests an alternative view of monetary policy in the 1950s, and hence a

possible solution to the mystery of the 1950s' outstanding economic performance. We show that

monetary policy in the 1950s was actually quite sophisticated.             Narrative evidence on the

motivation of monetary policymakers and their understanding of the economy shows that the

Federal Reserve of the 1950s was remarkably similar to the Federal Reserve of the 1990s. In

particular, the Federal Reserve in the early postwar era showed the same overarching concern about

inflation that is the hallmark of post-Volcker monetary policy orthodoxy. We also find that the
                                                                                                      1
Federal Reserve of the 1950s was not wedded to faulty indicators in its implementation of policy.

         Empirical analysis of the behavior of the federal funds rate confirms the view that the

Federal Reserve of the 1950s was in many ways more modern and successful than is usually

portrayed. Estimation of a forward-looking Taylor rule suggests that monetary policymakers in the

1950s responded much more aggressively to expectations of inflation than did policymakers in the

1960s and 1970s.




II. NARRATIVE EVIDENCE


         Given that the time period is short, it is likely to be hard to test statistically whether the

Federal Reserve of the 1950s was blessed with good sense or good luck. For this reason, it is most

useful to analyze narrative evidence. The records of the Federal Reserve, specifically the Minutes
of the Federal Open Market Committee and the testimony of Federal Reserve Chairman William

McChesney Martin, can reveal both the motivation behind policy actions and the prevailing


  1
     Friedman and Schwartz (1963, Chapter 11) endorse the view that monetary policy was admirable in
the 1950s, but they suggest that the steady growth of the money supply was due more to good luck and
political pressures than to an improved understanding of the economy and a clear sense of the appropriate
goals of monetary policy.

framework used to understand the macroeconomy. The narrative record can also provide evidence

on the role that particular indicators, such as free reserves and nominal interest rates, played in

policymaking.



A. An Overarching Concern About Inflation
         The most obvious and significant belief revealed by the Minutes is a fundamental

abhorrence of inflation by virtually all members of the FOMC. Indeed, in reading the FOMC

Minutes for the mid- and late 1950s, one periodically has to double-check the data on inflation.

The discussion was often so fervent and the predictions so dire that it is hard to believe that

inflation was actually very low. The overarching concern about inflation is revealed most clearly in

the statements the members made and the actions they endorsed during the times when inflation

began to accelerate, if only modestly, in the mid- and late 1950s. For example, in mid-1955 the

economy was quite well recovered from the recession of 1953-54 and there were fears that prices

were about to rise. Many members of the FOMC spoke eloquently about the need to act decisively

to prevent inflation. In August, Chairman Martin said in one of his rare prepared statements to the

FOMC: "Inflation is a thief in the night and if we don't act promptly and decisively we will always

be behind" (Minutes, 8/2/55, p. 13). In November, Mr. Robertson said, "I feel that there are

inflationary pressures present which should be checked now by a firmer monetary policy -- one firm
enough to curtail spending and thus dampen price pressures" (11/16/55, p. 20, emphasis in the

original). In response to these concerns about inflationary pressures, the discount rate was raised by

a full percentage point between April and November, and other contractionary measures were

taken.

         The dislike of inflation and the desire to fight it were even more obvious in 1958. The

economy suffered a recession beginning in the fall of 1957. Almost as soon as the trough was

reached in the spring of 1958, the FOMC began to worry about inflation. The members felt that

they had not reacted soon enough in 1955, and they were willing to risk another slowdown and

Congressional anger to keep inflation from rising. Chairman Martin said: "he did not think that the
                                                                                                4

System had faced in recent years anything like the present problem, whether it be called an

inflationary psychosis or inflationary psychology. He did not know how to deal with the specifics

of the problem except by moving in the right direction within the System" (8/19/58, p. 59). In

doing so, however, the System would have "to have courage to assume the risks that were involved"

(8/19/58, p. 58). As in 1955, this concern over inflation led the FOMC to tighten significantly.

Indeed by September 1958, interest rates had risen back to their 1957 peak level and Vice Chairman

Hayes expressed concern that further action "could lead to interest-rate levels so high as to be

harmful to the economy and so high as to place the System in political jeopardy" (9/9/58, p. 12).

His concern, however, was not shared by most other governors. Chairman Martin responded that

"If the System should lose its independence in the process of fighting for sound money, that would

indeed be a great feather in its cap and ultimately its success would be great" (9/9/58, p. 53).

Governor Vardaman also expressed the view that fighting inflation was of paramount importance.

He said: "the country was going to have inflation and . . . there must be serious shock treatment"

(9/9/58, p. 27).

        The concern over inflation and the desire for tight policy continued for most of 1959. In

February Mr. Leedy summarized his view of the role of monetary policy: "The System, of course,

wanted growth as well as stability, but if temporarily there had to be a choice between growth and

arresting inflationary psychology he would favor the latter course" (2/10/59, p. 22). In late May,

Vice Chairman Hayes announced that: "In the light of these threats to our economy, I am

convinced that the time has come for a decisive signal of the Federal Reserve System's

determination to do its part to check inflationary trends" (5/26/59, p. 17). In June, Governor

Szymczak said simply that the System "must not provide reserves to such an extent as to lead to

inflation" (6/16/59, p. 30).

        While concern over inflation was clearly a key motivating force among monetary

policymakers in the 1950s, it was not the only concern. The FOMC also expressed concern over

unemployment and output growth on many occasions. As the evidence presented above makes

clear, the FOMC was often willing to overlook this concern about unemployment and growth if
                                                                                                       5

inflation was high or rising. This sense that the output goal was subservient to the goal of

controlling inflation is also evident from a statement by Vice Chairman Hayes, who was one of the

more pro-growth members of the FOMC.              In January 1959 Hayes summarized his view of

monetary policy as follows: "as long as unemployment remains a problem, economic policy must

aim at expansion, provided additional employment does not produce an inflationary situation by
                                                                                                   2
pressing against limited capacity of facilities and inelastic supplies of materials" (1/6/59, p. 7).



B. Model of the Economy
        The narrative record also provides crucial evidence about why monetary policymakers in

the 1950s disliked inflation so. Their model of how the macroeconomy operated contained both a

remarkably modern view of the causes of inflation and a firm belief that the output costs of inflation

were large and imminent. As a result, they firmly believed that in fighting inflation they were

encouraging both short-run stability and long-run growth.

        A central characteristic of the model of many members of the FOMC was a sensible view of

capacity or full employment. Most policymakers appeared to believe that inflation began to rise

when there was still significant unemployment.              For example, in July 1955, when the

unemployment rate was 4.0%, Vice Chairman Sproul said that the economy was "nearer than we

have been since early 1953 to full utilization of plant, equipment, and manpower; prices which have

been stable, in the aggregate, for two years may be about to get a push on the up-side due to

pressure from costs and from anticipation of price rises by businessmen, purchasing agents, and

consumers" (7/12/55, pp. 26-27). At the next meeting, Mr. Bryan said that "the apparent present

trends in the economy simply extend themselves to over-reach comfortable capacity and that,

accordingly, an inflation is inevitable" (8/2/55, p. 23). Mr. Irons clearly subscribed to the same

view a few months later, saying: "The economy was moving nearer capacity in many respects, and

  2
    In addition to these two goals about overall economic performance, the FOMC was also quite
concerned with generally maintaining stability in the bond market and especially with avoiding tightening
around times of large Treasury refinancing operations.
                                                                                                  6

as this point approached less efficient means of production would be utilized and prices would tend

to rise" (10/4/55, p. 8). Again in 1959 when the unemployment rate was 5.0%, Mr. Thomas, the

chief economist, said: "The economy is approaching the limits of resource utilization" (6/16/59, p.

6).

       The members of the FOMC and the Board staff were certainly aware that there was a short-

run trade-off between inflation and output. However, they were united in believing adamantly that

there was not a positive long-run trade-off. Indeed, by far the most common view was that if

excessive demand resulted in inflation, output would actually fall in the long run. This view is

similar to those of many current monetary policymakers, such as Alan Greenspan (see, for example,

Greenspan, 1997).

       This was clearly Chairman Martin's view. Martin said in 1958: "If inflation should begin to

develop again, it might be that the number of unemployed would be temporarily reduced to four

million [from the current level of 5 million], or some figure in that range, but there would be a

larger amount of unemployment for a long time to come. If inflation should really get a head of

steam up, unemployment might rise to ten million or fifteen million" (8/19/58, p. 57). Martin

repeated this view in Congressional testimony in 1959, saying: "If total demands tend to run ahead

of the output potential, the general price level will begin to rise and this, in turn, will have an

adverse impact both on growth of demands and on means of financing increased and improved

capacity. It will also have adverse effects on the efficiency with which resources are utilized"

(Martin, 1959a, p. 118).

       Two features of this framework are noteworthy. The first is that the level of inflation at

which Martin and others felt these negative effects were likely was very low. No one was

contemplating rates of inflation of more than 5 percent when making the dire predictions of long-

run consequences. Second, the negative effects of inflation were thought to occur quite quickly.

Indeed, inflation could actually cause a recession. Martin expressed this view very clearly in

Congressional testimony in 1959. He stated: "I happen to believe, Mr. Patman, that the 1957-58

recession was a direct result of letting inflation get substantially ahead of us" (Martin, 1959b, p.
                                                                                                  7

1285). Mr. Thomas, the chief economist, expressed a similar view and described the mechanism in

some of his presentations at the start of each FOMC meeting. In September 1959, Thomas said:

"Increasing demands after mid-1955 resulted in relatively small increases in output but marked

advances in prices. . . . Distortions such as undue inventory accumulation, too hasty capital

expansion in some areas, too rapid a rise in debt burden, and consumer resistance to price increases

undermined the prevailing high activity and led to the recession of 1957-58" (9/22/59, p. 8).

         While the view that low inflation has rapid negative effects on output is not widely held

today, the belief in the absence of a long-run (positive) trade-off is certainly much more modern

than the simplistic Keynesian model that held sway in the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, many of the

statements made by FOMC members in the 1950s could be inserted into the narrative record for the

1980s and 1990s without notice. That the Federal Reserve had this model in the 1950s suggests

that the passionate statements about the dangers of inflation were not mere window-dressing.

Rather, they were part of a coherent view that placed predominant emphasis on keeping inflation in

check.



C. Implementation of Policy
         Brunner and Meltzer (1964), Calomiris and Wheelock (1998), and other authors argue that

an important source of monetary policy mistakes in the 1950s and 1960s was a focus on free

reserves (total reserves less required reserves less borrowed reserves). And there is no doubt that

free reserves played an important role in monetary policy in the 1950s. For example, most FOMC

meetings ended with some discussion of a target for free reserves.

         However, we find no evidence that this focus on free reserves was predominant or led to

persistent mistakes. Most FOMC members and the Board staff seemed to view free reserves targets

not as ends in themselves, but as merely the form in which instructions to the open-market manager

were couched. Following one of the frequent discussions of the deficiencies of this measure as a

target, Chairman Martin said in 1958: "these comments pointed up the problem of using free

reserve target figures at all. However, they had to be used as an indication, for that was the
                                                                                                      8

framework within which the Account Management had to work" (5/6/58, p. 52). Mr. Leedy

expressed a similar view at the next meeting, saying: "He was not too happy about using the free

reserve position as a benchmark but in the absence of something better it seemed to him that it must

continue to be used" (5/27/58, p. 23).

        Furthermore, the FOMC also paid close attention to interest rates and goals for key interest

rates were often used as a supplement to instructions about free reserves. A very common

instruction was that the Account Manager should pay close attention to the "color, feel, and tone of

the market" (9/30/58, p. 46). To a large degree, this instruction meant that he was to watch short-

term interest rates. And often the role of interest rates was more explicit. For example, in January

1955, when Vice Chairman Sproul gave a detailed summary of what various terms such as "active

ease" or "restraint" meant, the behavior of interest rates was central (1/11/55, pp. 10-12). In March

of the same year, "Mr. Earhart said that he found it difficult to think of credit policy merely in terms

of the amount of reserves taken from the banks or furnished to them, or of the amount of excess

reserves or free reserves; to him, it was more definite to think also in terms of money rates" (3/2/55,

pp. 18-19). Toward the end of the decade, Mr. Bopp expressed exactly the same sentiment, saying:

"He would give more consideration to sensitive rates, such as the Federal funds and bill rates, and

to other indicators of the tone of the market than to the level of net borrowed reserve figures"

(5/5/59, p. 20).

        There is also evidence that the Account Manager often followed the interest rate guidelines

over the free reserve targets. In June 1958, Mr. Irons said: "by de-emphasizing the statistic of free

reserves and being concerned more with the feel of the market and short-term rates, it [the Account

Management] had brought about a better situation" (6/17/58, p. 33). Again three months later Mr.

Irons commented: "Disregarding the volume of free reserves but watching rate movements,

particularly rates in the short-term market, he felt that the results of open market operations were

not too much out of line with what the Committee has anticipated" (9/9/58, p. 41).

        Finally, the FOMC almost always discussed the implications of its free reserve target for

interest rates, and often chose the target for free reserves to try to attain a particular interest rate
                                                                                                    9

outcome. In January 1955, for example, Martin asked the Account Manager what "operations . . .

might be followed for the System account to provide a minimum disturbance to the market during

the immediate future [that is, to keep interest rates steady]" (1/25/55, p. 9). The Account Manager

responded by suggesting a range for free reserves that would be consistent with that goal, and the

FOMC adopted a target within that range. And when the Committee expected a shift in the

relationship between free reserves and interest rates, it typically changed the reserves target. In

March 1955, for example, the FOMC expected that without open market operations, temporary

factors would cause a large fall in free reserves with only slight upward pressure on rates. Since the

Committee felt that some rise in rates was desirable, it decided to allow the large decline (3/29/55,

pp. 5-9).

        These considerations suggest that while targets for free reserves were important in the short-

run implementation of policy, nominal interest rates were predominant over longer horizons. And,

since inflation varied little in the 1950s, a focus on short-term nominal interest rates provided a

good indication of tightness in credit markets. Furthermore, many FOMC members showed a clear

understanding of the distinction between real and nominal interest rates. Mr. Bryan, for example,

said in July 1958: "There has been continuous, pervasive, and increasingly convincing propaganda

to the effect that inflation is inevitable. That propaganda now carries almost universal conviction.

Such an almost universal conviction means that the increase of yields on fixed income obligations

is destined to be greater than would be likely as an uncomplicated response to economic recovery"

(7/29/58, pp. 17-18). In 1959 Mr. Bopp said simply: "One reason for the present level of interest

rates is the anticipation of further inflation" (10/13/59, p. 15).

        The FOMC was also acutely aware that the lags associated with monetary policy

necessitated a focus on future rather than current inflation. The members of the FOMC often

worried that inflation, while currently low, was about to take off. For example, in September 1958,

Mr. Leedy said, "the System should not postpone the matter of looking at the possibility of inflation

ahead of it. There were signs of recovery on every hand, and if the System should wait until there

was recovery beyond any shadow of a doubt it seemed to him that the System would have lost its
                                                                                                    10

opportunity to do the kind of a job that it was supposed to be doing" (9/9/58, p. 32). Similarly, in

September 1959, Governor Robertson "expressed the view that the System ought to adopt an

affirmative position of restrictiveness in order to keep on top of the potential inflationary situation

ahead. Otherwise, the System would get behind the game and might never catch up -- repeating the

mistakes of a few years ago" (9/1/59, p. 21). Perhaps the best evidence that many FOMC members

put great store in forecasts of inflation can be seen by the criticism levied against them by a member

who did not. Governor Mills said in November 1959: "The most active proponents of this theory

lay greatest emphasis on the importance of formulating a monetary and credit policy that will act as

a backfire against an anticipated outburst of inflationary pressures, and in practice are apparently

prepared to take the risk that the policy actions which they support may miscalculate the future and

induce deflationary pressures" (11/4/59, p. 46).




III. STATISTICAL EVIDENCE


        The narrative analysis indicates that the FOMC of the 1950s certainly talked much like the

FOMC of the 1980s and 1990s. To see if policymakers in the 1950s backed up their words with

actions, as the FOMC has in recent decades, one needs to supplement the narrative analysis with

statistical evidence. To this end, we look at how the federal funds rate responded to developments

in the macroeconomy in the 1950s and compare those responses with the responses in other
        3
periods. Because the 1950s sample period is inherently limited and the variation in inflation in this
decade is small, this empirical analysis must be viewed as a suggestive check on the narrative

analysis rather than as a conclusive test.

     Taylor (1999) shows that the response of the federal funds rate to economic variables provides a
sensible description of policy even in eras when the Federal Reserve was more directly targeting some
other variable.
                                                                                                     11

A. Specification and Data
        The particular specification that we consider is a forward-looking Taylor rule (see, for

example, Clarida, Gali, and Gertler, 2000). In its simplest, descriptive form, a Taylor rule shows

how the Federal Reserve chooses the federal funds rate in response to inflation and the deviations

of output from trend. A forward-looking Taylor rule takes into account the fact that the monetary

authority typically responds to expectations of these variables. As discussed above, this forward-

looking behavior was an important feature of monetary policymaking even in the 1950s.

        The forward-looking Taylor rule that we consider is simply:


                                                               _
                                    it = α + βEtπt+1 + γEt(Y - Y)t+1,                               (1)



where i is the federal funds rate, π is inflation, and Y - Y is the deviation of output from trend.

Time is measured in quarters. To implement this specification, we regress the federal funds rate on

the leads of actual inflation and the deviation of output from trend, instrumenting with information

known at time t. For instruments, we use (in addition to the constant) the contemporaneous and

two lagged values of inflation and the contemporaneous deviation of output from trend. We use

multiple lags of inflation because the quarterly series tends to fluctuate substantially. The deviation

of output from trend, in contrast, is quite smooth, so the contemporaneous value is an excellent
predictor of next period's value.

        Data on the quarterly average of the federal funds rate for 1954:1 to 2000:4 are taken from
                                                                                       4
Citibase. We extend this series back to 1950:1 using data from Martens (1958).             We measure

inflation as the quarter-to-quarter change in the log of the GDP deflator (at an annual rate). The

deviation of output from trend is calculated as the difference between the log of real GDP and a log

trend. The trend series is estimated using the Hodrick-Prescott filter applied to the period 1952:4-

     The data in Martens (1958) are reported only in graphical form. After deducing the numbers from
the graph, we checked and calibrated our deductions in a period of overlap between the series in Martens
and that from Citibase.

2000:4.

          We estimate the rule over four samples. The 1950s sample is 1952:1 to 1958:4. We start

two years into the decade because the Federal Reserve was unable to pursue independent monetary

policy until the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord, which took place in 1951. We stop at the end of

1958 for reasons discussed below. The second sample corresponds roughly to the late 1960s and

the 1970s; it runs from 1964:1 to 1979:3. The third and fourth samples are the Volcker and

Greenspan eras: 1979:4 to 1987:3 and 1987:4 to 2000:4, respectively.



B. Results
                                                         5
          The coefficient estimates are given in Table 1. The most important result is that the weight

put on expected inflation in the policy rule in the 1950s is quite similar to that in the Volcker and

Greenspan eras and noticeably larger than that for the 1960s and 1970s. In both the 1950s and the

last two decades of the twentieth century the point estimate is greater than 1, indicating that in

response to a rise in inflation the Federal Reserve raised the nominal funds rate by enough to also

raise the real funds rate. In the late 1960s and 1970s the coefficient is below 1, indicating that the

Federal Reserve reduced the real funds rate when inflation rose.

          The weight on expected inflation is estimated less precisely in the 1950s than in other

decades. However, the point estimate and the narrative evidence presented in Section II tell a very

similar story. The Federal Reserve of the 1950s was deeply concerned about inflation and acted

aggressively to control it on several occasions. This can be seen in Figure 1, which shows the

federal funds rate and expected inflation (measured as the fitted values of the regression of the lead

of actual inflation on the instruments) during the 1950s. This figure shows that there is a close and

strong relationship between the two series for much of the decade.

  5
    We also run the regressions using the 3-month Treasury bill rate as the indicator of policy stance and
the deviation of quarterly industrial production from trend as the measure of the output gap. Neither of
these changes affects the results appreciably.
                                                                                                   13

       Part of the imprecision of the estimation is the result of the Federal Reserve being

particularly concerned about expected inflation in the late 1950s. Figure 1 shows that while

expected inflation derived from the first stage regression rose slightly in 1958, its rise was small

relative to the response of the Federal Reserve. As a result, this looks like a time when the Federal

Reserve was not responding to expected inflation.         (Furthermore, because expected inflation

derived from the first-stage regression falls in 1959, if one continues the estimation through the end

of 1959 the coefficient estimate on inflation in the Taylor rule falls considerably and is measured

even more imprecisely.) But, as described in Section II, the main reason for the tightening by the

Federal Reserve was its conviction that inflation was about to rise. In this context, it is useful to

note that the Federal Reserve was not alone in fearing inflation at the end of the 1950s. The

Livingston survey of expectations for the CPI six months ahead rose steadily from mid-1958
                          6
through the end of 1959.      Thus, the Federal Reserve was acting out of concern about inflation,

even if that concern is not captured by our regression estimates.

       The coefficient estimates reported in Table 1 show that the weight put on the expected

output gap varied substantially from era to era. Both in the 1960s and 1970s and in the Greenspan

era, the weight is positive and significant, indicating that the Federal Reserve acted in a

countercyclical fashion. In both the 1950s and the Volcker era, the coefficient is essentially zero

and very imprecisely estimated.

       For the 1950s this apparent lack of concern about output may be part of the general

imprecision of the estimates. Figure 2 graphs the expected output gap (that is, the fitted values

from the regression of the output gap at t+1 on the instruments) and the federal funds rate in the

1950s. The obvious positive correlation between the two series does not show up in the multiple

regression because of correlation between expected inflation and the output gap.

C. Policy Implementation
         Data on key policy indicators can be used to supplement the narrative evidence on the

implementation of policy. Figure 3 shows monthly averages of the federal funds rate and free
                        7
reserves for the 1950s. One obvious characteristic of the free reserves series is that it is extremely

volatile. This is consistent with the narrative evidence that the FOMC often adjusted the target for

free reserves substantially to achieve a desired behavior in nominal interest rates. It is also

consistent with the discussions cited above that suggest that the Account Manager sometimes chose

to follow the interest rate goals and allow large swings in free reserves.

         Figure 3 also makes clear that there is a strong negative correlation between free reserves

and the funds rate at longer horizons.        That is, while there is much short-run noise in the

relationship, over quarters and especially over years the two series consistently move in opposite

directions. This same relationship holds just as strongly if one uses data on the real funds rate

(calculated by subtracting off the measure of expected inflation graphed in Figure 1). This suggests

that in the 1950s a focus on free reserves did not lead to systematic misjudging of credit market

conditions and hence is unlikely to have been an important source of sustained policy mistakes.

         The only prolonged period when the funds rate and free reserves are positively correlated

was 1956. During this year both the funds rate and free reserves rose substantially. This episode is

important for what it reveals about the relative importance that the FOMC attached to interest rates

versus free reserves. There is no evidence that the Federal Reserve thought it was easing over this

period. Throughout the year, the "Record of Policy Actions" describes the System's overall stance

as "a policy of restraint" or "restrictive" (Board of Governors, 1956, pp. 18-46). Indeed, the Federal

Reserve felt that it was increasing the degree of restraint over the course of the year. While there is

some variation in the strength of the stated commitment to restraint, overt decisions to tighten

further were considerably more common than overt decisions to loosen. The meetings in late

March, April, and August, which were followed by large increases in interest rates with little

                                                                                                   15

change in free reserves, are particularly clear in this regard. The "Record of Policy Actions" for the

March 27th meeting states that the Committee felt that "the System would be derelict in its duty if it

did not exercise additional restraint." On April 17th, the Committee "agreed that there should be no

relaxation of pressures." At the August 7th meeting, it moved "to strengthen credit restraint." And

on August 21st, "The Committee felt that credit policy should be made somewhat more restrictive"

(Board of Governors, 1956, pp. 26, 28, 36, and 37). The rise in free reserves, therefore, was

evidently an accommodative move taken to achieve a desired behavior of interest rates in the face

of shifts in the normal behavior of reserves.




IV. CONCLUSION


       Like central bankers of the 1990s, monetary policymakers of the 1950s had a deep-seated

dislike of inflation and acted to control it. Their dislike of inflation was rooted in a model of the

economy that emphasized the costs of inflation and the absence of a positive long-run trade-off

between output and inflation.

       These findings may provide important insights into the performance of the economy in the

1950s. One key reason that inflation was low and steady in this decade was almost surely that the

Federal Reserve was working to achieve those goals. And one likely reason that recessions were

brief and mild is that inflation never got seriously out of hand. As a result, the Federal Reserve

never had to undertake a disinflation of the magnitude of those of the 1970s and 1980s.

       This rehabilitation of monetary policy in the 1950s may also provide insight into the policy

mistakes in the late 1960s and 1970s. If monetary policymakers in the 1950s had figured out the

essence of sensible policy, the mistakes of the 1960s and 1970s cannot just have been the result of

continuing ineptitude or misunderstanding. Rather, something must have changed. One obvious

candidate for what changed is the model of the economy. De Long (1997), Mayer (1999), and

Taylor (1999) all suggest that a naive Keynesian model with an exploitable trade-off between
                                                                                                  16

output and inflation, and later a natural rate hypothesis with an unrealistically low estimate of the

natural rate, was the key source of the inflation of the late 1960s and the 1970s. Our finding that

these models are so different from that in the low-inflation 1950s and post-Volcker 1980s and

1990s adds credence to this view.
