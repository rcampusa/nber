                                             ABSTRACT



       This study investigates the economic consequences of parental leave mandates using data for

16 European countries over the 1969 through 1988 period.         Since women use virtually all of the

family leave in most nations, men constitute      a reasonable    comparison   group and the natural

experiment in most of the analysis involves examining how changes in leave entitlements affect the

gap between female and male labor market outcomes.        The employment-to-populations      ratios of

women in their prime childbearing years are also compared to those of older females, as a function

of changes in leave regulations.     Parental leave mandates are associated with increases in total

employment    but appear to have a more modest effect on weekly work hours and there is some

evidence that women pay for entitlements to extended leave by receiving lower relative wages.     The

econometric estimates are sensitive to the inclusion of controls for time-varying country effects and

sex-specific within-country   time-trends.

                   The Economic         Consequences         of Parental Leave Mandates:

                                              Lessons From Europe

          Despite widespread       international     implementation,    little is known about the economic

effects of government      policies requiring companies to allow their employees            to take time off

work during the period surrounding           the birth of a child,l    Proponents   believe that parental leave

results in healthier children and improves the position of women in the workplace.                 Opponents

counter that the mandates,         by restricting    voluntary exchange between workers and employers,

reduce economic      efficiency    and may have a particularly         adverse effect on women,

          This study investigates     the labor market consequences          of parental leave policies using

data for 16 European      countries over the 1969 through 1988 period.z The dependent                variables

include employment-to-population            (EP) ratios, weekly work hours (HOURS),         and hourly wages

(WAGES).       Since women use virtually all of the family leave in most countries,            men are likely to

provide a reasonable      comparison        group and the “natural” experiment       involves examining      how

changes     in leave entitlements     affect the gap between female and male outcomes.             Limited

analysis is also undertaken        contrasting      the EP ratios of 25-34 year old women to those of their

counterparts    aged 45-54.       The younger cohort are in their prime childbearing         years and so

should be strongly affected by leave mandates.               Conversely,   virtually all of the older women

have completed      their fertility and so they may provide a useful comparison           group.   In both

cases, time and country effects are also controlled for to provide

“difference-in-dif ference-in-difference”        (DDD) estimates,

     By 1991, over 100 countries had passed some form of parental leave policies, with most
assuring at least two to three months of paid job absences (Kamerman, 1991).
2 A distinction is sometimes made between “maternity leave”, which is granted to mothers for
a limited period around the time of childbirth, and “parental leave” which permits additional time
off work to care for infants or young children. Both types of entitlements are included in the
definition of parental leave (also referred to as family leave) used below.

                                                         Page 1
          To preview the results, parental leave entitlements         are associated   with increases   in the

female employment-to-population          ratio, while having a weaker and less certain impact on

weekly work hours,      Conversely,    there is some evidence that women pay for rights to extended

time off work by receiving lower relative wages.          These results are somewhat       sensitive to the

choice of specifications    and, in particular,    it is important to include controls for country-specific

time effects and sex-specific      time-varying    country effects.

          European data are particularly     useful for investigating    the effects of parental leave.     All

Western     European countries     currently offer at least 3 months of paid maternity benefits;

however, many of the policies have been instituted or revised during the last 25 years, resulting

in substantial   variation, over time and across countries,       in the type and duration of the

entitlements.     Conversely,    the United States did not require employers       to offer family leave until

the 1993 passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).3

          Obtaining a better understanding        the effects of parental leave mandates     is important     in

both the European and U.S. contexts.          Europe has been grappling       with the question of whether

extensive   social protections    inhibit economic flexibility and are a cause of low rates of recent

employment       growth.4 These concerns have Ied a number of countries            (e.g. Finland, Denmark,

and Sweden) to reduce payments           provided during the leave period, at the same time that other

nations (e.g. Austria, Germany,       and Norway) have increased them (Organization            for Economic


3 The FMLA mandates companies with more than 50 workers to allow 12 weeks of leave
following the birth or adoption of a child or to care for seriously ill relatives. Health insurance
contributions must be continued during the period but the leave is unpaid. Firms may exempt
the highest paid 10% of their workforce and persons employed less than 1250 hours during the
previous year. Klerman & Leibowitz (1995) estimate that these restrictions limit coverage of the
law to 31% of working women, Ten states (and the District of Columbia) legislated
job-protected work absences prior to the FMW and 8 others provided limited rights to parental
leave, without guaranteeing the reinstatement of employment (Waldfogel, 1994). Most of the
state laws were enacted in the late 1980s or early 1990s and included numerous exemptions.
4 Blank (1994) summarizes a series of investigations of the effects of social welfare policies in
Europe and the United States, The general conclusion is that differences in the policies are
unlikely to explain much of the disparity between U.S. and European experiences.

Cooperation     and Development,         1995).   Conversely,   advocates    (e.g. the Carnegie Task Force

on Meeting the Needs of Younger Children,              1994) have argued for broadening          the US. law to

include small employers      and provide payment during the time off work,

                           1. The Economics          of Parental Leave Mandates

        In a competitive    spot labor market with perfect information          and no externalities,

mandated     benefits such as parental leave reduce economic efficiency by limiting the ability of

employers     and workers to voluntarily      select the optimal compensation         package,    Instead, firms

are required to provide the entitlements          even when the costs exceed the benefits of doing so.

Since these expenses       will be passed on to workers, the decrease           in effective compensation

results in a deadweight     efficiency    loss.   If firms are constrained   in their ability to reduce pay

(e.g. by minimum wages), the employment              reductions   and efficiency    losses maybe      larger still.’

        Supporters    of leave entitlements       often argue that they will improve the health and

well-being   of children (e.g. see Zigler, Frank, & Emmel, 1988; Carnegie Task Force on Meeting

the Needs of Younger Children,           1994).   This might occur if the benefits represent       externalities

which are not adequately      valued by agents negotiating         labor contracts.    For example,      the gains

might not be fully taken into account if workers have inadequate              information   concerning     the

advantages     of staying at home with infants or if they pay only a podion of the costs of their

children’s medical care (as with most types of health insurance).              Undervaluing      might also occur

if parents have higher than socially optimal discount rates, since some of the benefits occur far

in the future, or if the welfare of children receives a relatively low weight in their utility function.~

Employers     may also be less aware or supportive          of the advantages      of family leave to

dependents     than of corresponding       benefits to the workers themselves.         Previous research


5 See Summers (1989), Mitchell (1 990), or Krueger (1994) for detailed discussions of the
effects of mandated benefits.
‘   Conversely, parents could overvalue the benefits to children, leading to excessive parental
leave.

                                                       Page 3
provides little indication of whether this type of externality         actually leads to serious

underprovision     of voluntarily    supplied leave.

          Proponents    also frequently     assert that parental leave mandates       place women on a more

equal footing with men in the workplace           (e.g. see Kamerman,       1988; Bookman,      1991; Bravo,

1991; Trycinski,    1991).      Without such entitlements,      they argue that females experience       high

rates of unemployment           and losses of firm-specific    human capital because they must frequently

change jobs if they wish to spend time at home with infants and young children.                  Lacking some

source of market failure, this equity argument          is unconvincing.     Firstl employers   and workers

can always voluntarily       negotiate   maternity   leave, thus mitigating the joblessness      and retaining

the specific investments.         Second, with competitive      labor markets, the groups most likely to use

parental leave will pay for it by receiving lower wages,             Hence, females of childbearing     age will

continue to obtain lower (and possibly reduced) compensation                if the benefit is mandated.’

Third, entitlements    which allow substantial       time off work may lead employers       to limit women to

jobs where absences are relatively less costly, thereby increasing occupational                 discrimination,a

          Adverse selection under asymmetric           information    provides a potential source of market

imperfection,     Individuals    have better information      than firms concerning the likelihood     of using

parental leave.    A company voluntarily        offering leave will therefore attract a disproportionate

number of “high-risk”     employees       and be forced to pay lower wages,        Persons with small

probabilities   of using the benefit avoid these firms and so will do without even socially optimal

leave,’   A government       mandate eliminates      the incentive for this type of sorting behavior and

has the potential to raise welfare,10


7 See Gruber (1994) for an excellent discussion of the effects of group-specific mandates.
a Stoiber (1990) claims that the exceptional degree of sex discrimination of the Swedish labor
force is partially the result of the extensive family leave entitlements in that country.
‘   This is analogous to Rothschild & Stiglitz’s (1976) argument for market failure in insurance
markets. Aghion & Hermalin (1 990) raise the possibility that socially optimal parental leave will
not be voluntarily provided to any workers. In their model, low-risk individuals signal this to

                                                       Page 4
        U.S. data for the pre-FMLA          period indicates that companies       voluntarily   provided explicit

paid leave relatively infrequently.       Although maternity leave was available to 37% of full-time

employees      in medium and large establishments          (greater than 100 workers)       in 1991 and 18% of

those working for small employers          in 1992, just 2% and 1%, respectively,        of the job-holders

were entitled to time off work with pay (U.S. Department            of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics,

1993, 1994).      These low coverage rates suggest that market imperfections               may limit the

unregulated     provision of parental leave and particularly       of paid work absences.ll        Alternatively,

most workers may believe that the costs of the entitlements             exceed the benefits.

        Although      parental leave statutes might be expected to increase the time away from work

by mothers of young children, Klerman & Leibowitz (1995) demonstrate                   that the effect is

actually ambiguous.        The intuition of their argument can be summarized           as follows.    Let L,

represent the amount of leave which will be taken in the absence of a mandate (where L. is a

function of leave benefits, reemployment          wages etc.).    Next impose a leave guarantee          of L~. If

L~ > L,, the entitlement       will either have no effect on or will increase the duration of the work

absence.      In particular,   the latter may occur if the statute sufficiently   reduces the costs to the

worker of additional      time off the job. Conversely,     consider the case where        L~ < L,.    The



employers by agreeing to contracts with no (or limited) leave provisions. High-risk workers
sometimes do better by mimicking their counterparts (by taking positions without leave) than by
revealing their propensity towards absenteeism.     Another reason why socially optimal leave
might not be provided is that large firms may set compensation policies according to the
preferences of the median worker, who may obtain little benefit from rights to parental leave.
10 The potential inefficiency of privately negotiated labor contracts under asymmetric
information has been demonstrated across a variety of contexts. For example, McGuire &
Ruhm (1993) indicate that employer-drug testing is likely to be excessive, whereas Levine
(1991) and Kuhn (1992) show that just-cause employment security regulations and advance
notice of job terminations will generally be underprovided.
11 Some women are able to take short-periods of time off work even when formal leave
policies do not exist (i.e. through the use of accumulated sick leave and vacation or tempora~
disability policies), Klerman & Leibowitz (1994) estimate that, between 1979 and 1982, 5% of
women with one month old children were on paid leave and 10% were using unpaid leave, By
the time the children were 4 months old, the percentages had fallen to 1YO and 2°/0 respectively.

                                                      Page 5
worker must now decide between taking L,or L~ weeks of leave.                 The decision will be to choose

L~ if U(L~) > U(L,), where U(. ) shows the utility associated with the specified amount of leave.

This condition will be fulfilled if the gains from returning to the old employer         (e.g. higher wages,

increased job security) exceed the costs of reducing the leave period by the amount L, - L~.

The key point to note is that by permitting      return to the old job after a work absence of L~, the

marginal cost of additional time off work (beyond L~) increases and it may become worthwhile

to reduce the duration of leave.       If this effect dominates,    the mandate will raise, rather than

lower, the employment         of women with infants.’z

            Next consider the effects of parental leave statutes on all women, rather than just those

with young children.      Some previous researchers       (e.g. Gruber & Krueger, 1991; Gruber, 1994;

Anderson       & Meyer, 1995) have evaluated the efficiency consequences            of similar group-specific

mandates       by examining whether firms pass the associated          costs through to employees     by

reducing wages,       To illustrate, consider Figure 1, which shows the market demand and supply

curves for the specified group (e.g. women).          The mandated       benefit shifts the supply curve to

the right and the demand curve to the left, since total compensation             rises at given wage levels.

Complete      pass-through     occurs if workers value compensation       equally in the form of wages or

benefits,     This corresponds    to a change in the labor market equilibrium       from point B to E,

whereby      employment      and total surplus are unchanged       (with the latter shown by the identical

triangles ABC and DEF) and wages fall by the cost of the benefit (C). Conversely,                if workers

place a lower (higher) value of compensation         in the form of the mandated       benefit rather than

wages, the supply curve shifts to the right by less (more) than Sz, implying that wages fall by a

smaller (larger) amount than the increase in benefit costs and that total surplus declines (rises).



12 Some individuals may also increase their labor supply prior to having children, in order to
meet the qualification conditions for parental leave. Mortensen (1977) makes an analogous
point with regard to unemployment insurance.

                                                     Page 6
        Although     cost-shifting     provides a reasonable    metric for evaluating     static efficiency

effects when firms pay for the mandated            benefit (either directly or through payroll taxes),

changes in employment          may be more informative       when dynamic considerations             are introduced

or if the benefits are financed out of general government           revenues.      For example,        it is

frequently    asserted that parental leave raises levels of firm-specific          human capital, by allowing

women to return to their old jobs after having children.          This elevates the marginal revenue

product of workers, causing a rightward shift in the demand curve,                 For simplicity,     assume that

the increase in human capital returns the demand curve to D,, with the new equilibrium

occurring    at point G. Whereas efficiency was unchanged            in the static analysis, the long-run

effect of the entitlement      is to boost the sum of producer and worker surplus to AGF.                  Notice that

the final wage reduction (W1-Wa) is less than the cost of the parental leave benefit, erroneously

suggesting     an efficiency   loss when using the pass-through        criteria.   Conversely,       employment           is

raised by mandates which increase either static or dynamic efficiency .13

        Alternatively,    assume that benefits are paid out of general tax revenues,                 as with parental

leave in many European countries.            If firms do not bear any costs of the entitlements,               the

(static) demand     curve remains unchanged          at D1.14 If the financing is by nondistortionary                taxes,

the supply curve will again shift to S, and total surplus will increase from ABC to AGF.

Efficiency   and employment          continue to be positively related while wages fall by less than the

cost of the benefit, with the result that the pass-through         criteria once again erroneously

suggests     a decline in total surplus.     The more realistic case of financing       by distortionary         taxes



‘3 A mandate which reduces productivity (e.g. because the lengthy period away from work
results in the depreciation of human capital) will cause the demand curve to shift to the left of
D,. This decreases both employment and total surplus, and leads to an additional fall in wages.
14 More frequently, firms will continue to incur some costs, even when payments to workers
are provided by the government (e.g. expenses associated with hiring and training temporary
replacements).    In this case, the demand curve will shift to the left of D,, although by a lesser
amount than if benefits were paid directly by employers.

                                                       Page 7
would be represented       by additional movements     of the supply or demand curves.           For instance,

higher personal (corporate)       income taxes are likely to shift the supply (demand)         curve to the

left, reducing employment       compared    to the case of nondistortionary    taxation.   If these shifts are

sufficiently   large, total surplus and employment     may fall. Thus, across a wide variety of

situations,    parental leave mandates which increase (decrease)         economic    efficiency will result in

higher (lower) levels of employment,        while having less predictable     effects on wages. ”

                                            2. Previous Research

         Early studies by Dalto (1989) and Spalter-Roth         & Hartmann     (1990) indicate that women

are out of work for less time and receive higher wages, following the birth of a child, if their

employers      vo/untari/y provide maternity leave than if they do not. However, it is not clear

whether these advantages         are actually caused by the entitlements      or if they result from

nonrandom       selection into jobs providing the benefit.

         Waldfogel     (1994, 1995) partially circumvents    this problem by estimating        first-difference

and fixed-effect     models (which control for time-invariant    individual characteristics)      using U.S.

and British data from the Nat;ona/ Longitudinal       Suweys and the National Child Development

Study respectively.      Mothers returning to the same firm within twelve months of childbirth              are

shown to experience       substantially   faster wage growth than those switching companies,              with

preservation     of job tenure playing an important role in explaining      the superior performance.

However, data limitations      require Waldfogel   to restrict most analysis to the effects of rejoining

the same employer,       rather than focusing directly on parental leave.      Thus, women taking no

time or just a few days off work are grouped with those using extensive            maternity     leave.




15 There may also be distributional consequences.         For instance, a leave benefit which is
financed by personal income taxes may raise the welfare of women while reducing that of men.
In such cases, it is difficult to determine whether efficiency rises or falls.

        Three studies provide evidence on legislated parental leave entitlements.              Klerman &

Leibowitz (1995) examine the effects of state maternity leave mandates,               using 1980 and 1990

census data for the United States. ” Their findings, although somewhat                ambiguous,   indicate

that rights to time off work have employment            effects which range from slightly negative to

substantially     positive.lB Waldfogel    (1996) investigates      the impact of the Family and Medical

Leave Act utilizing data from the 1992-1995            March Current Population Surveys.      She uncovers

little evidence    of a wage effect but concludes that the FMLA has modestly increased

employment.        This last finding is sensitive to the model estimated,       however, with some

specifications     indicating a negative or inconsistent         impact of the law,19 Finally, Ruhm & Teague

(1995) study the impact of changes in federal leave legislation using data for 17 nations over

the 1968-1988       period.   After controlling    for country and year effects, they find that short to

moderate    durations    of parental leave (through at least one year) are positively related to per

capita incomes and labor market outcomes,              whereas lengthier entitlements    have less beneficial

effects or negative impacts.         However, they do not clearly identify the direction of causation         (i.e.




‘G In particular, Waldfogel (1995) finds that mothers with the option of taking maternity leave
but not doing so experience faster wage growth than corresponding mothers without coverage.
This suggests that women with relatively steep wage profiles disproportionately   work in
positions offering the leave.
‘7 No states had adopted mandates by 1980, whereas six (Minnesota, Rhode Island, Oregon,
Wisconsin, Maine, and Washington) had done so by 1990.
‘G The ambiguity occurs because mothers of somewhat older children, who should be less
affected by maternity leave provisions, experience higher rates of employment growth when
states institute parental leave entitlements than do women with infants.
19 For example, the employment of women with children under one year of age increased
faster, after passage of the FMLA, in states that already had a maternity leave mandate in
place than in those that did not, even though the federal legislation would be expected to have
a stronger impact in the latter states.

overestimate       of the benefits of leave.20

                                    3, Parental Leave Policies in Europe

            Legislated    maternity benefits have a long history in Europe.        The German     Imperial

Industrial Code of 1891 set maximum work hours and prohibited                   the employment    of women

within four weeks of childbirth.        Amendments      to the code in 1903 and 1911 increased           the leave

period to six weeks and supplied women with paid time off work in the two weeks before

delivery.     By turn of the century there was discussion        of providing maternity    insurance     in many

European       countries.21    Most early legislation was paternalistic    in its concern for the health of the

child and mother.         Prenatal and postnatal leave was typically compulsory          and supplementary

income support or job-protection          seldom provided,      For example, the 1919 and 1952

International     Labor Organization     Maternity Profecl~on Conventions         recommended      that women

not be perm;fled         to work during the six week period following confinement.22

            The pronatalist    rationale became explicit in social policies across Europe after the end of

World War Il. Many nations which had recruited women into previously male-dominated

occupations      wished to return them to the home (Moeller,          1993).    The motivation   for policies

related to family allowances,        protective legislation,   and family-law    reform was often to restore

women to their “proper” roles as mother and wife (Frank and Lipner, 1988).                  During the




20 Furthermorel Ruhm & Teague uncover little evidence that the entitlements have stronger
impacts on females alone than for men and women together. Since females are the main users
of family leave, and so should receive the majority of any benefits, this suggests that concerns
about dual causation may be warranted.
21 See Frank & Lipner (1988) for a detailed discussion of early maternity leave policies.
22 The 1919 convention advocated a 12 week period away from work, payment during the
duration of the leave, and job-reinstatement upon return to employment.     The 1952 conference
recommended a cash benefit equal to at least two-thirds of previous earnings, compared a
previously suggested unspecified amount “sufficient for the full and healthy maintenance of the
working mother and her child” (International Labor Office, 1984).

post-war period some countries             (e.g., Denmark, Finland, Greece, the Netherlands,         and France)

mandated       compulsory      pregnancy    leave but failed to prohibit dismissal from jobs,

          By the late 1960s, the concept of maternity leave began to evolve from a prohibition                     on

employing      women during the period surrounding           childbirth to one of job-protected    time off work

to care for newborns         and young children.     Portugal, Spain, and Finland instituted employment

reinstatement       provisions    during the 1969-1971     period; France and the Netherlands        passed

similar legislation     in 1975 and 1976; as did Denmark, Ireland and Greece between 1980 and

1984. Other nations (e.g. Switzerland            and the United Kingdom) inaugurated          regulations    which

provided for job-protected         maternity leave during this time span.      Nonetheless,     vestiges    of

protective     legislation   persist in some countries.     Postnatal leaves remain compulsory,           rather

than voluntary,      in Austria, Finland, Francel Germany,        Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland;

Austria, France, and Italy continue to require prenatal leave (Brocus, et. al., 1990).

          Income support is provided during at least a portion of the work absence throughout

Western      Europe.    Wage replacement        rates often exceed 80% and payments are usually

supplied through social insurance,           although some nations (e.g. Belgium, Germany,           Italy, and

the United Kingdom)          require an employer contribution.      A few countries have recently reduced

benefit replacement          rates, however, the overall trend has been towards longer paid and total

leave periods, with fathers increasingly          gaining rights to time off work (Organization      of

Economic       Cooperation       and Development,    1995). The European Community            Social Charter

recently established         a minimum standard leave period of 14 weeks, with pay no less than the

individual would receive if absent from work because of sickness (Addison & Siebert, 1993).

          Even where parental leave extends to fathers, mothers take the vast majority of actual

time off work.      For instance,    males accounted      for 7V0 of total absences   in Sweden in 1988 but a

dramatically     smaller proportion     of weeks in other European countries (Organization           of



                                                       Page 11
Economic Cooperation          and Development,     1995).23 There are a variety of reasons why men use

the leave so sparingly.       In addition to cultural norms and differences     in earnings     capacity, the

entitlements      are generally restricted to mothers during the period immediately           surrounding

confinement       and fathers can frequently    subsequently   take time off work only if the mother

qualifies for but waives her rights to it.

                                                    4. Data

           This analysis uses aggregate     data for 16 European countries      (Austria, Belgium,

Denmark,       Finland, France, Germany,       Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands,    Norway, Portugal,

Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,         and the United Kingdom) over the 1969 through 1988 period.                   The

information      on family leave is a subset of that utilized by Ruhm & Teague (1995) and was

originally    compiled from the International     Labour Office’s Legjs/a/ive   Series, their 1984 global

survey on “Protection       of Working Mothers”,     and from .Socia/ Securiiy Programs        Throughout        the

Wor/d, which is published approximately          biennially by the U.S. Social Security Administration.

           Parental leave is defined to include entitlements      to time away from work to care for

infants or young children with dismissal        prohibited during pregnancy     and job-reinstatement

guaranteed       at the end of the leave.24 Employment-protection       is required because it is a key

characteristic     of family leave policies which are viewed as a benefit from the perspective              of

workers.      As discussed,   many nations which had previously enacted compulsory              “maternity

protection”      laws added job-security   provisions during the period covered by the data.




 23 For example, fewer than 1YO of Germans receiving family leave benefits                in 1989 were men
 (Der Bundesminister fuer Jugend, Familie, Frauen und Gesundheit, 1989).                  I thank Katharina
 Spiess for providing me with and translating this information.
24 Ruhm and Teague (1995) coded Spain as providing 156 weeks of total                  leave beginning           in
 1970, as compared to 52 weeks in the present analysis. This change was                made because
job-protection is guaranteed for only one year, although women are entitled             to preferential
reinstatement if they return within a three year period.

         Paid leave refers to supplements        which are directly related to previous earnings,          as

opposed to social insurance         payments available to individuals    independent      of their employment

histories,    A distinction   is made between paid and total leave entitlements,         where the latter

include rights to unpaid time off work.        In practice, however, it may be difficult to distinguish

between unpaid leave which is guaranteed            by law and similar work absences which are granted

by employers      but not mandated.       Furthermore,   the actual use of lengthy leave entitlements            may

be quite limited when payment is not provided.           For these reasons, the analysis focuses

primarily on rights to paid time off work.       Finally, no attempt is made to model wage

replacement      rates or to separately    account for leave available only to the mother, as compared

to that which can be taken by either parent.

         The leave durations       apply to persons meeting all eligibility criteria.    This overstates

actual time off work, since some individuals will not fulfill the employment            requirements     while

others will use less than the entire allowed absence.25 In most countries,              qualifying   conditions

either have not changed or have loosened over time and increased labor force participation

should allow more women to meet given employment                history requirements.      Thereforel    a

greater proportion      of females are expected to qualify for benefits at the end of the period than at

the beginning,     implying that the secular increase in family leave entitlements          is understated.z’

         The dependent        variables are (natural logs of) employment-to-population          ratios, weekly

work hours, and hourly wage rates,          Data on EP ratios are from various issues of the OECD

publication    Labour Force Statistics.     Those on hours and wages are from several volumes                   of

the ILO Yearbook of Labor Statistics.         Work hours refer to manufacturing         employment,     with

information    disaggregated     by sex available for 9 of the 16 countries.z’     Gender-specific       wage

workers .28 Nominal wages were deflated by purchasing             power parities, using OECD Nafiona/

Accounts      data, and by the U.S. Consumer       Price Index. Age-specific     information   on the EP

ratios of women aged 25-34 and 45-54 was also obtained for 9 nations.2g Finally, population                       (of

 civilians aged 15-64) and birth rate (per 1000 resident population)           data were obtained from

various issues of Labor Force Sfalisfics.

        The data are not always completely         comparable     either between or within countries.            For

example,      purchasing   power parities provide the best method of adjusting nominal wages but

are unlikely to supply exactly equivalent     information     across time and place.     Similarly,     nations

sometimes      alter their methods of collecting   or aggregating    the data. The estimation         strategy

was designed to minimize biases resulting from such noncomparabilities,                In paflicular,    after

including vectors of country and year dummy variables,            most of the analysis focuses on gender

differences    in labor market outcomes.     This automatically     accounts for the effects of breaks in

data series which affect the information      on men and women equally.          To insure that this

condition is met, the ratio of (the log of) female to male outcomes          was examined      for periods

immediately     preceding and following each interruption       in series,   In the few instances where a

disproportionate     impact was observed,    missing values were entered for the period either before

or after the break.30

and to manufacturing employees for Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands,
Norway, Sweden and the UK. Information is missing for Austria, Italy, Portugal, and Spain.

observations were deleted for the period with no change (or less change) in leave durations.

                             5. Time-trends      and Correlates    of Parental   Leave

         Parental leave entitlements      increased     sharply between 1969 and 1988, Weighting

observations     by the country’s working age population,         the average duration of total leave rose

from 15 to 57 weeks and that for paid leave increased from 10 to 32 weeks (see 2a).

Conversely,     as shown in figure 2b, the (weighted)       percentage    of the population   employed

declined slightly (from 64% to 62Yo), as a moderate             increase for women (from 45°A to 50Yo) was

more than offset by a substantial       decline for men (from 86°/0 to 73 Yo).3’ As expected,       wages

rose dramatically    over time (see figure 2c). More importantly,         the gender gap in log earnings

fell rapidly at the beginning     of the period (from ,43 in 1969 to .31 in 1977) but relatively     little

thereafter    (declining to .29 by 1988),

        Table 1 details the parental leave provisions effective in 1988, the last year of the data.

At that time, the 16 countries offered a minimum of 10 weeks of paid leave, with 12 nations

mandating     entitlements    of 12 to 18 weeks and 3 (Finland, Germany,         and Sweden) requiring

rights to more than a year off work.          Over half the nations allowed additional   absences    without

pay, although in only 5 countries (Austria, France, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom)

was the unpaid leave substantial,32           Fathers were eligible to a portion of the time at home in 9 of

the 16 countries.33 The conditions        required to qualify for leave varied but persons with more

than a year of service were usually covered.




31 The fall in EP ratios partially results from the secular increase in European unemployment.
32 Unpaid leave, when provided, is always in additional to paid entitlements.      Thus, durations
of paid and total leave are virtually identical at short or moderate durations of the latter, with
substantial divergences occurring only when total leave allowances exceed six months.
33 Leave durations have continued to lengthen since the end of the sample period. For
instance, in January 1995, the entitlement was three years in Finland, France, and Germany
and two years in Austria (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 1995).
Ondrich, et. al. (1995) analyze the effects of recent changes in German leave regulations on
the return to work after childbirth.

        Table 2 provides information           on the levels and changes in total and paid leave in each

country across time.      The number of nations providing some type of parental leave entitlement

rose from 8 in 1969 to 13 in 1979, with all 16 doing so in 1988.                  Most countries supplying family

benefits in 1969 extended them during the sample period, with the result that the dispersion                          of

leave durations     increased   over time.34 Some nations lengthened                entitlements    more than once

during the 20 years while others did so in a single increment.

        The correlates      of parental leave were briefly examined              by estimating     the equation:

        (1)                                    L,, = X,(a + &j,,

where L is the number of weeks of leave in country j at year t, X a vector of covariates                      (hourly

wages, birthrates,     total and female EP ratios, total and female unemployment                    rates), E a

disturbance     term, and observations        were weighted to adjust for heteroscedasticity             using the

procedure     discussed   in the next section.       Ceteris paribusl        leave durations were increasing       in

wages, the percentage        of women employed,          and female unemployment            rates while declining

with overall EP ratios and joblessness,            Birth rates were positively correlated          with total leave

durations     but either negatively    related to or independent        of paid time off work.35

                                              6. Estimation        Strategy

        Labor market outcome Y (measured                in natural logs) for group i in country j at year t is

assumed to be determined         by:

        (2)                           Y,j, = ai) + b,, + Cj,+ Lj(di + eu,,


34 The standard deviation of weighted total (paid) durations was 16.6, 34.8, and 57,9 (8.7,14.2,
and 22.4) weeks in 1969, 1979, and 1989, respectively. The difference between minimum and
maximum entitlements was 65, 120, and 108 (36, 54, and 62) weeks in the same years.
35 A table showing these results is available upon request. The findings are consistent with
family leave being a normal good, which is restricted when overall job competition increases but
becomes more available when women account for a greater proportion of the labor force and
have particular diticulties exiting unemployment.    The negative relationship between birthrates
and paid leave may reflect pronatalist strategies during periods of slow population growth,
whereas the positive coefficient for total leave could indicate political pressure to lengthen the
entitlements when many women are having children.

m and f hereafter       denote males and females.

         Since women use almost all weeks of family leave, it is assumed that leave entitlements

only affect female labor market outcomes               (i.e. d~=O). Thus, we obtain:

         (3a)                          Y~i,= a~j + b~, + Cjt+ e~j,,

         (3b)                          Yo,= ah + bfl + ciL+ Lj~dr+ e~,l.

Difference-in-difference         (DD) models of the form:

         (4)                           Yil = aij + ~il + Lj~6i+ EiL,

investigate     within-country    changes in the dependent          variable as a function of variations          in leave

durations.       8 provides an unbiased        estimate of the leave effect if Eli,and L,, are uncorrelated.

Since Ci,,= Cjt+ eij,, this requires Litand Cj[to be orthogonal.              Bias is introduced      if time-varying


country effects are correlated         with changes in parental leave (e.g. if the political process leads

countries      to increase entitlements      when employment           is rising),35

         If d~=O, this bias can be easily eliminated.              Notice that:

        (5)          YOt- Y~j, = (at + bfi + cj[ + Li~dl + efi,) - (a~j + b~l + cj[ + e~jl)

or equivalently

        (5’)                          AYjl = Aai + Ab, + Lj~d, + Aei,

Since Cj,has been difference            away, consistent      estimates     of the parental leave parameter             are

obtained from difference-in-difference-in-difference               regressions         of the form:

        (6)                           AYjl = aj + ~t + Lj/5 + Eii.

The DDD estimates          measure how growth in the gender gap in labor market outcomes                        varies as

a function of changes in leave entitlements,

36 A direct estimate of the bias caused by time-varying country effects can be obtained from
the parental leave coefficient in the DD model for male labor market outcomes.

           If family leave also influences male outcomes               (d~ + O), the DDD estimate of ~ supplies a

consistent        estimate of (d, - d~), rather than of d,. Thus, if dfand d~ have the same sign, the


regression        coefficient   provides a downwards         biased estimate of d,. Since men account for only

a tiny fraction of the time taken off work in most countries,                 however, the resulting bias is likely to

be small.         For instance, if d, and d~ are proportionate        the weeks of leave used by each sex, the

understatement          will be approximately        8°\0 in a country (such as Sweden) where men use 7°\0 of

the leave and 2% in a nation where males account for 2% of total weeks.37 Conversely,                            d[and

d~ have the opposite sign (e.g. if companies                or households       respond to lengthened      entitlements


by substituting        employment     away from females and towards males).”                 In this case, & provides


an upper bound estimate of d~.


           The DDD procedure          above accounts for all time-varying           factors whicl     affect both sexes


equally.     However, the estimates             may still be inconsistent   if there are sex-specific     time-varying

effects.    This can be seen by replacing the c,, term in (2) with cij~. Equation (5’) then becomes:

           (5”)                         AYj, = Aaj + Abl + Acji + Lj~df + Aejt,

where AC), = Cw,[-cmj(; ~, obtained from (6), is then biased if E(Lj,lACj,) # O.

           Omitted explanatory        variables represent       a potentially    important potential source of

sex-specific        time-varying   factors.’g     This source of confounding       can be reduced by estimating

models which include a vector of country-specific                 time-trends     (T;) of the form:

           (7)                          AYjt = ai + ~1 + Tj’y + L,(5 + Ejl.




37 Let the p and 1-p represent the proportion of weeks of leave taken by men and women
respectively.  By assumption, d~=ndf, for n=p/(1 -p), which implies that df= 8/(1-n), Thus, if
p=.07, n=.0753 and l/(1-n) = 1.0814. Similarly, if p=.02, n=.0204 and I/(l-n) = 1,0208,
‘a Similarly, firms might replace women of childbearing ages with older females.
3’ For instance, if the education of women rises relative to men, in countries extending leave
durations, parental leave could be positively related to (relative) female employment and
earnings due to the increases in schooling, rather than because of the leave mandates.

characteristics,     to the extent the latter follow the specified time trend,

        To adjust for heteroscedasticity        resulting from differences       in population    sizes, the

models are estimated          by weighted least squares.      The weights used are equal to the (square

root of the) inverse of the predicted values obtained from regressions                 of the squared OLS

residuals on a constant term and the reciprocal of the working age population                    for the specific

country-year       observation.40

                                7. DDD Estimates:         An Illustrative    Example

        The advantages         of the DDD methodology         can be illustrated with the following example.

Countries   are placed in the experimental        (nonexperimental)         group at time t if they have (have

not) increased the duration of paid leave since the previous year. Average                  EP ratios, with

observations       weighted   by country-year   working age populations,         are then compared      for period

t-1 (before the potential change) and t+l (after it). This descriptive             analysis corresponds        to the

econometric    estimates      which follow with two exceptions.         First, the experiment     examines

whether or not countries        have modified leave entitlements         but does not account for the size of

any adjustments.        Second, changes in employment            rates are calculated    over just two time

periods, rather than for multiple years.

        The top panel of Table 3 displays DD results for males and females together,                      EP ratios

decline by 0.428% in the nonexperimental           countries,     between t-1 and t+l, but grow by 0,300%

in the experimental       nations.   This suggests that increases       in paid leave are associated       with a

0.728% rise in the percentage-of         the-population     employed.       However, as illustrated in the

bottom panel of the table, the higher employment              need not be caused by the extension            in leave


40 As shown by Blackburn (1995), this procedure is more efficient than weighting by (the
square root of) population size if there is a common group effect (or group-time interaction)
across individuals in a country. The significant constant term obtained in virtually all of the
regressions on squared residuals confirms that such group effects are important.

                                                       Page 79
but rather could result from unobserved                confounding     factors.     Notice that the increase in

relative job-holding     is greater for men (0.977Yo) than for women (0.494 ?/0),even though parental

leave policies are expected to have little or no effect on the male labor market.                      Calculating        the

“true” parental leave effect as the difference             between changes in female and male outcomes

provides the DDD estimate of -0.483Y0 (0.494Y0 - 0.9770/0). This suggests that increases                             in

paid leave reduce female EP ratios and that countries extend the entitlements                        during periods of

rising relative employment.

                                             8. Econometric            Results

            Table 4 displays econometric        estimates of the relationship           between parental leave and

the three labor market outcomes.             Vectors of country and time dummy variables                are included,

so these represent       difference-in-difference         estimates,     The equations      are estimated    separately

for males and females, with the samples restricted to cases where data on the dependent

variable are available for all specifications.            Observations      are weighted      as discussed   above to

adjust for heteroscedasticity.         The parental leave regressor               in the top (bottom) panel of the

table is weeks of total (paid) leave divided by 100.

            The leave coefficients     are of roughly similar magnitude              for men and women in all models

and durations      are statistically   significantly    related to ma)e labor market outcomes            in two of the

six cases (i.e. paid leave on EP ratios and work hours).                   In only one specification    (total leave on

work hours) is a significant       effect obtained for women but not men and, even in this case, the

disparity    in the estimated    effect is small.       These results further suggest that countries           extend

rights to paid leave during periods of robust employment                   growth and that bias is introduced             if

this source of confounding         is not accounted       for.”   To the extent that the regressions         on male

outcomes       pick up the effects of unobserved           confounding     factors, they indicate that family leave



41 Klerman & Leibowitz          (1 995) obtain similar results for state mandates              in the United States.

                                                           Page 20
entitlements    have a smaller (in absolute value) impact on women’s employment                   and work hours

than are implied by the DD estimates        in the first row of each panel.       Therefore,     the remainder         of

the analysis focuses on DDD specifications,        which include a comparison          group (men) whose

labor market outcomes      are expected to be largely unaffected         by changes in leave legislation.

8.1 DDD Estimates

        Table 5 summarizes       a first set of DDD estimates      examining the effects of paid leave.                In

each equation, the dependent       variable is the difference     between (the log of) female and male

labor market outcomes.       PAID indicates weeks of paid leave (divided by 100), with a quadratic

term included to allow for nonlinearities     in the estimated     effect.    The P-Value refers to the null

hypothesis     that all of the parental leave variables included in the specified model (PAID and its

square in these regressions)      are jointly equal to zero.     All equations    include vectors of year and

country dummy variables.       The lower panel of the table shows the estimated                impact of specified

entitlements    to paid leave on the dependent     variable, compared         to the case of no mandate,

        Specification   (a) is the basic DDD model.      The birthrate is included as an additional

covariate in model (b), to allow for the possibility that the number of children influences                 labor

market involvement      and is correlated   with leave entitlements.         However, since some countries

use parental leave policies as part of a strategy to raise the birthrate, the latter may be

endogenous      and its inclusion as an explanatory    variable problematic,        Parental leave mandates

could also influence    labor market outcomes with a lag.42 To allow for this, specification                (c)

includes controls for paid leave (and its square) at year t-1, as well as at time t, with the table

displaying   the sum of the coefficients    at t-1 and t, along with the corresponding           standard     error.




42 Most obviously, this may occur because policy changes often take effect in the middle of
calendar years. Since this study uses annual data, only a portion of the total impact will
therefore be observed during the year of enactment.

                                                   Page 21
        These regressions       provide little evidence that paid leave is related to either EP ratios or

hourly wages.      Although the point estimates suggest that intermediate            durations   modestly

increase female employment         while rights to extended work absences            reduce relative wages,

neither effect approaches       statistical significance,      By contrast, paid leave is strongly positively

associated     with weekly work hours.       For instance, legislation guaranteeing       nine months off work

with pay is predicted to increase hours by 2Y0.43

        These results are relatively unaffected         by the inclusion of controls for birthrates        or

lagged leave durations.       As shown in specification        (b), the addition of birthrates   reduces

(increases)    the predicted effect of paid leave on EP ratios (hourly wages), but the change is

small in both a statistical and an economic sense, while having essentially               no impact on work

hours.44 Likewise, the predicted parental leave effects are robust to the inclusion of lags.                    For

instance, the differential    associated     with 20 weeks of paid leave, compared         to no entitlement,         is

0.8Y0, 1.3Y0, and -0.7% for EP ratios, work hours, and hourly wages, when lags are included in

the model (column (c)), versus 0.9%, 1.3%, and -0.4Y0 when they are not (specification                     (a)).45

Given these findings, birthrates      and lagged durations are excluded from the econometric

estimates     presented   in the remainder     of the paper.

8.2 DDD Estimates         With Time-trends

        The DDD estimates        above may be biased if there are sex-specific           time-varying

country-effects    which are correlated      with changes in leave entitlements.        The models presented

in Table 6 reduce this potential source of confounding             by adding a vector of country-specific




43 However, as shown below, this finding is not robust to the addition to the model of
country-specific time-trends.
44 Birthrates are significantly negatively related to employment, hours, and wages.
45 To avoid reducing the sample size, leave data for 1968 are also used in specification (c), I
also estimated models with leave at year t, t-1, and t-2 controlled for. The second lag was
never statistically significant and the results were similar to those with just a one year lag.

                                                     Page 22
time-trends     to the set of covariates.       Other than this change, specification    (a) is identical to

column (a) of Table 5.

         The inclusion country-specific         time-trends   dramatically   alters the estimated    impact of

parental leave mandates,           The predicted effect of paid leave switches from small and

insignificant   to substantially     positive and statistically   significant when considering      EP ratios and

from significantly    positive to having no impact for work hours.           For example, rights to 36 weeks

of paid leave increase predicted female employment                by 5.3°/0 and hours by -0.2°/0 in

specification    (a) of Table 6, as compared to 0.9% and 1.9% in model (a) of table 5.46

         These findings suggest that countries raise paid leave entitlements              in periods when the

relative employment       rates (work hours) of women are trending down (up). When combined                      with

the DD estimates       summarized       in Table 4, they show that the adoption or extension          of parental

leave guarantees       is endogenous       and follows a fairly complicated     pattern -- leave durations     are

typically lengthened      when overall employment         is rising (relative to other countries)    but women’s

job-holding     is falling (relative to men).

         Continuous      regressors     may poorly capture the effects of the parental leave mandates,

even when quadratic        or higher order terms are included.”’        For example, the effect of legislating

entitlements     to short work absences could have substantial           effects, while further extensions       of

the leave period could have little or no additional impact.48 The models above would then be



4’ I experimented with including a vector of quadratic country time-trends in the model. The
results obtained were quite similar to those using a linear trend. As an additional specification
check, the models were estimated with parental leave (and its square) at year t+l controlled for.
The lead leave variables never approached statistical significance in the specifications which
included country time-trends but were jointly significant for the hours equation in their absence.
This last result provides a further indication of the importance of including controls for
country-specific   time-trends.
47 The equations were also estimated using cubic leave specifications.          These yielded results
which were generally very similar to those discussed above.
“a For instance, this might occur if women strongly desire to be at home for a short period
following childbirth, with rapidly diminishing marginal utility of additional time off the job.

                                                       Page 23
misspecified      since they restrict the consequence        of an initial (arbitrarily     short) period of leave to

be small, relative to that of longer durations.         To permit this type of “step” effect, the dummy

variable ANYPAID was added to the models displayed in specification                        (b) of Table 6. ANYPAID

takes the value one if the country has enacted a leave mandate and zero otherwise,                        It

therefore     indicates the impact of paid job absences of arbitrarily short duration.”               In these

specifications,    PAID and its square then show the effects of extending                  an existing leave

mandate.

         The coefficient     on ANYPAID      is highly significant for EP ratios and work hours and is of

substantial    size and has a T-statistic     exceeding     one for hourly wages.          The point estimates

indicate that legislation    requiring employers      to offer minimal amounts of paid leave raise the

relative employment,        hours, and wages of women by 2.5Y0, 2.8Y0, and 1,7°/0 respectively.                   The

predicted impact of further extending          the leave period is summarized             in the lower panel of Table

6 and is detailed in Figure 3. Interestingly,        whereas EP ratios are predicted to increase through

approximately      the first year of paid leave, fairly sizable declines in expected work hours and

wages are observed at longer durations.             For instance, entitlements       to 10 weeks away from

work change predicted employment,             hours, and wages by 3.4Y0, 1.1 Yo, and O.l O/O,while the

corresponding      impact of 36 weeks of paid leave is 4,6Y0, -2.0°/0, and -1 ,8V0, Also notice that the

effect on hours is highly significant,      in contrast to the results in column (a), while that on wages

still does not quite reach statistical      significance.

        Table 7 provides results for additional specifications            which include categorical       leave

variables.     In column (a), the only leave regressor        is ANYPAID, the dummy variable

distinguishing     between no leave entitlement        and rights to some time off work with pay. Model

(b) contains dichotomous        variables   indicating paid leave in the ranges of 1-13, 14-26, and >26


4’ Since the initial period of leave is paid for all countries in this sample, this variable is
identical to one which distinguishes between some versus no total leave.

                                                       Page 24
weeks, with O weeks the excluded reference category .50 Finally, specification                (c) incorporates

dummy variables        indicating the same three duration categories           as column (b) but controlling     for

total (paid and unpaid) rather than just paid leave.

        The findings of the table can be summarized              as follows.   First, parental leave has a

positive effect on women’s employment,           with somewhat       larger gains for rights to intermediate       or

long than for short periods away from the job. These estimates                 are similar to those obtained

previously.      For instance,   1-13, 14-26, and >26 weeks of paid leave lead to 2.7Y0, 4,3%, and

4.6% increases       in the predicted female EP ratio (see model (b)), as compared             to 3.4Y0, 4.1 Yo,

and 4,6% changes for durations of 10, 20, and 36 weeks in column (b) of Table 6.

        Second, there is some indication that brief leave entitlements              increase work hours but

little evidence    of effects at longer durations.     This contrasts with a negative impact of rights to

lengthy leave in column (b) of Table 6. However, there is some reason to suspect that the

specification     in the earlier table may be preferred.51       More generally, the sensitivity   of the

findings to the choice of models implies that the results for work hours should be interpreted

cautiously,

        Third, the categorical      specifications    suggest that rights to short work absences       may

raise (and certainly do not reduce) predicted wages, whereas women pay for lengthy paid

entitlements      by receiving lower earnings.       Thus, 1-13, 14-26, and >26 weeks of paid leave are

associated      with wage differentials   of 1, 1°/0, -1 .50A, and -2.9V0, compared to the reference        group,

with the null hypothesis      of no wage effect strongly rejected.       There is also some indication that

short periods of total leave raise wages relative to either no entitlement             or rights to a longer

period off work (see column (c)).


50 The results are not sensitive to changing the ranges of the categorical variables.
51 These include the relatively high standard errors on the leave coefficients in Table 7 and the
higher adjusted R-Squared in column (b) of Table 6 than for any of the three models shown in
the subsequent table.

8,3 DDD Estimates         For Women of Different Aqes

         Up to this point, men have been used as the comparison                  group, to account for

time-varying     country-specific     factors which may be correlated         with parental leave durations,

The inclusion of country time-trends          provided one method of reducing potential biases which

might result from sex-specific         time-varying    country effects (e.g. those introduced        if nations

increase leave durations during periods of slow growth in relative female employment).                        As a

complementary         approach,     this section compares the EP ratios of 25-34 year old women to

those of their counterpafls         aged 45-54.52 Since 25-34 year old females are in their prime

childbearing     years, they are expected to be directly and strongly affected by parental leave

mandates.       Conversely,   45-54 year olds have completed            virtually all of their fertility and so may

be less influenced      by the statutes.     Thus, the natural experiment        involves contrasting     changes

in the percentage       of the younger and older cohorts of women employed,               as a function of

variations   in leave entitlements.

        Table 8 summarizes           the econometric      estimates.   The dependent     variable in all models

is the difference     in (the log of) the EP ratio of 25-34 year old females versus those of women

aged 45-54.      Vectors of time and year dummy variables are also included, to provide DDD

estimates,     as are country-specific     time-trends.     Observations      are weighted to correct for

heteroscedasticity,      using the procedure      discussed above.        The five specifications     correspond       to

the models estimated        in Tables 6 and 7. Thus, column (a) shows results for the quadratic                   in

weeks of paid leave (divided by 100); model (b) adds the leave/no leave dummy variable;

ANYPAID      is the only parental leave regressor          in specification   (c); and columns      (d) and (e)

include controls for categorical        variables indicating ranges of paid and total leave durations.




52 Age-specific data on female work hours or wages are not readily available,                    precluding
analysis of these outcomes.

         The table confirms that parental leave entitlements               raise the employment      of young

women.        The large and significant      coeticient     on ANYPAID     in model (b) implies that regressions

which include only continuous            leave variables are misspecified       and indicates that leave

legislation    of even short duration substantially         increases relative EP ratios.     Thus, in column (c),

the existence      of paid leave legislation     is predicted to raise the percentage        of 25-34 year old

women employed          by 9.OYO,relative to 45-54 year olds. Conversely,             there is no consistent

prediction     concerning   the additional effect of more extended leave entitlements              -- the impact is

estimated      to be positive in specifications     (a) and (b), negative in model (e), and with no clear

pattern in column (d) -- with all of the effects estimated             imprecisely,

8.4 Discussion

         The preceding       analysis indicates that parental leave legislation          increases the

employment-to-population             ratios of women, especially those of childbearing         age. However,        the

data also raise the possibility that firms respond to lengthy leave entitlements                 by reducing the

work hours of females and more strongly suggest that women pay for rights to extended                          paid

leave by receiving      lower earnings.       This pattern of results makes sense.         Short periods of

parental leave are likely to impose few costs on employers                 but could confer substantial     benefits

to workers, with the consequence             that employment        increases without negative wage effects.

For instance, firms may be able to temporarily               reassign individuals to fulfill the responsibilities      of

absent employees        and rights to brief time away from the job, by allowing return to the old

position following     childbirth,    may increase the ability of women to retain firm-specific

investments.      Conversely,        lengthy entitlements    are likely to be costlier to companies      but may

fail to provide sufficient compensatory           benefits to workers and could lead to the depreciation              of

human capital, with the result that wages decline.




                                                          Page 27
        One issue deserving       mention is that many European         countries count individuals    on

parental leave as “employed        but absent from work”, rather than “not employed”.            Reported     EP

ratios will therefore   rise when countries expand leave entitlements,         to the extent that the work

absences    of “employed”    persons increase.     Some indication      of the relative size of this effect

can be obtained by noting that 0.9% of women’s “employment”                in 12 EC countries was

accounted    for by maternity    leave in 1983 (OECD, 1995).53 By comparison,           leave mandates        are

predicted above to raise EP ratios by 4% to 5%. Thus, the estimated               effects of the legislation

are large compared      to the number of women counted as employed             but actually on maternity

Ieave.m Moreover,       the estimated    impact rises only marginally    with the duration of leave, in

contrast to the more substantial        increase which would be expected       if the observed

“employment”     effect were actually caused by changes in leave-taking.

        The predicted wage reductions,         ranging from 1.5% to 3°A for laws mandating          lengthy

(i.e. six months or more of) paid leave, are quite large given that only a limited proportion            of

women are absent from work for this reason at any one time and since a substantial                 fraction of

the leave benefits are paid by the government,         rather than the employers,      in most countries.

Nevertheless,    impacts of this magnitude      may be plausible for several reasons.        First, only five

countries (Denmark,      Finland, Germany,     Italy, Sweden) had legislated rights to paid leave

exceeding   six months, during the sample period, and each had relatively high rates of work

absence due to maternity        leave or personal/family   reasons.     Second, the expansions      in leave


53 Similarly, 0,6% of female “employment” consisted of absences for other family or personal
reasons, including extended parental leave. The 12 EC countries include Belgium, Denmark,
France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugall Spain, and the
United Kingdom.
54 Work hours could also be overstated to the extent that individuals take part-time parental
leave. However, only a few countries provide a legal right to partial absences and, even when
provided, parents seldom take it. For example, among 11 countries (Belgium, Denmark,
France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United
Kingdom) for which 1988 data were available, part-week absences due to maternity leave were
only observed in Britain (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 1991).

                                                    Page 26
typically occurred relatively late in the time period and coincided with increased                 use of maternity

leave.55 Third, employers          may incur substantial     nonwage costs when the leave entitlements               are

extremely      lengthy,   For example, it may become much harder to schedule                 replacement

workers,      given considerable      uncertainty   regarding the actual leave period and the possibility

that the individual will ultimately choose not to return to the same job.5’ These difficulties                 may

be magnified      by national regulations which limit the duration of temporary              work on fixed-term

contracts.      Finally, when leave durations exceed one year, women having multiple children

relatively    close together may be away from their jobs for several years consecutively,                  or with

just brief spells of intervening       employment,     causing substantial    depreciation     of human capital,

                                                    9. Conclusion

           Virtually all industrialized    countries currently provide women with rights to job-protected

maternity     leave during the period surrounding          childbirth.   Some nations (e.g. Germany)         have

allowed lengthy paid absences for many years whereas others (e.g. the United States) have

only recently mandated           entitlements   to limited periods off work without pay. Despite the

widespread       international    implementation,    there has been relatively little research investigating

the economic       consequences       of parental leave.     This study helps to fill this gap by examining

how leave mandates          affect labor market outcomes.          One important   innovation    is the focus on

differences     between female and male values of the dependent               variables,     Since women use



55 Denmark extended paid leave durations by 18 weeks in 1981 and 10 weeks in 1987;
Finland by 6, 8, and 26 weeks in 1979, 1983, and 1985; Germany by 18, 25, and 9 weeks in
1979, 1986, and 1988; Italy by 26 weeks in 1979; and Sweden by 12 weeks in 1979 and 18
weeks in 1985. In 1992, 4.10A, 3,70A, and 3.1 YOof women’s “employment” in Denmark,
Germany, and Italy was accounted for by maternity leave or absences for other personalifamily
reasons, as were 5.5°/0 of weeks for maternity or parental leave in Sweden, in the same year,
(Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 1995). These are lower-bound
estimates, since some persons on leave do not report themselves as having jobs and so are
not included in the employment figures,
56 For instance, less than half of German job leavers return to work at the end of the leave
period (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 1995).

                                                       Page 29
virtually all parental    leave in most countries, changes in entitlements             are likely to have little or

no effect on men, making them a natural comparison                   group.   Limited analysis is also provided

of how the employment           of women of childbearing          ages varies, relative to that of older females,

as a function of parental leave.

         Rights to paid time off work raise the percentage               of women employed,          with a substantial

effect observed      for even short durations       (i.e. less than 3 months) of guaranteed            work absence.

Based on the preferred          econometric     specifications,    a reasonable    estimate is that leave

legislation   increases    the employment-to-population            ratio of all females by around 4% and of

women of childbearing           age by approximately      9Y0, with up to a quarter of this change resulting

from increased      leave-taking     by “employed”      women.       By contrast, the mandates        have weaker

and less consistent       effects on work hours.       More generally, the econometric          estimates     exhibit

considerable      sensitivity   to the choice of models, with evidence presented            of the importance           of

controlling   for both time-varying      country effects and sex-specific         within-country     time-trends.

This fragility highlights the importance         of choosing the “right” specification        and points to

potential shortcomings          of much of the previous related research.

         A second issue addressed             is whether employers       pass the costs of the (largely

group-specific)     leave benefit through to women in the form of lower relative wages.                    Short

periods of leave are found to either have no effect on or to raise female earnings.                      Conversely,

lengthier paid entitlements        are associated     with substantial     wage reductions,    with predicted

decreases     in the range of 1.5% to 3“A for durations of six months or more.                 Extended      parental

leave is sometimes        justified on the grounds that, even if it decreases          efficiency,    it is desirable

because it improves the position of women in the workplace.                   However, the evidence that

females pay for the rights through reduced wages raises questions                    about this equity argument.




                                                         Page 30
            To summarize,     the employment      of women appears to be increased      by even relatively

short (less than 6 months) durations          of paid leave, whereas their relative wages may fall with

more extended       entitlements.     This suggests that the work absences      currently guaranteed       in

many European         countries   may be so lengthy as to reduce the earnings of females.         Conversely,

there is little indication that substantial      costs would be incurred, in the U. S., if the period of

parental leave were modestly extended or if payment were provided.”

            These conclusions     should be viewed as tentative for a variety of reasons.       First, the

sample sizes are relatively small, resulting in imprecise estimates           of parental leave effects in

some models.        Second, the data on leave are incomplete.         A more comprehensive       investigation

would include information         on the percentage    of workers in each country qualifying for the

benefit, the “take-up       rate” among qualified individuals,   and details on the structure   of paid

entitlements.     Third, other efficiency    benefits or costs may be associated     with the mandates.

Most significantly,     it is often argued that parental leave improves the health and well-being            of

children.     This represents     an important   area for future research.




57 However, as noted above, no European country offers unpaid leave, except as an addition
to an initial period of paid time off work, making it dificult to apply these results to the United
States which, under the FMW, mandates only unpaid leave.

Note: See notes on tables 4 through 6. The dependent variable is the difference in the natural
log of EP ratios between 25-34 and 45-54 year old women. All regressions include vectors of
country and time dummy variables as well as country-specific time-trends.       The categorical
leave durations in specification (d) refer to paid entitlements while those in column (e) are for
total (paid and unpaid) parental leave. The sample contains 160 observations.
