       Taxation and Pricing of Agricultural and Industrial Goods

                                    ABSTRACTS



       This paper presents an analysis of price reform and of optimal

pricing and taxation of agricultural and industrial goods in modern—

day LDCs. Our analysis is based on a general equilibrium paradigm

with a multitude of goods and income groups. It is consistent with

several alternative institutional structures within the agricultural

and the industrial sectors, as well as with alternative hypotheses con-

cerning unemployment and migration of labor across the two sectors.

This approach differs substantially from the standard tax literature

with   regard to the structure of the economy and the set of admissible taxes.
       The rules of price reform which we derive are quite simple to
implement, requiring only the knowledge of observable parameters   such as

price elasticities of demand and supply. The determination of optimal

prices (and taxes) requires, in   addition, the relative welfare weights
on individuals' incomes and on investment. We show    that it is desirable,

in   general, to levy import and export taxes. Among new results are those
presenting conditions under which all of the goods belonging to certain

categories (such as all purchased agricultural inputs or all agricultural

outputs   which are not consumed) should be either taxed or stibsidized.

                                 I. INTRODUcTION




     In   most LDCs, governments play an active role in setting the food prices

received by farmers and the prices paid by city dwellers. They do this

through a variety of mechanisms, such as agricultural marketing boards, which

often have a monopoly on the purchase of certain goods from farmers and their

sale to consumers, price regulation authorities, which control the prices at

which private traders can sell, explicit food subsidies, sometimes accompanied

by rationing, and by export and import taxes and subsidies.' Their objectives

in attempting to alter the prices which would emerge in the absence of

government intervention are several. In the present paper we focus on the

following of their objectives:

  o They seek to increase the income of peasants who are often among

    the poorest in the economy.

  o They seek to subsidize the poorer city dwellers. In most LDCs

    direct   income subsidies are not feasible, and food subsidies may   be
    thought to be an effective way of helping the poor.

  o They seek to tax the agricultural sector to capture resources for

    investment, and for public goods creation.2

  o They seek to attain some level of self—sufficiency in specific

    goods, to avoid excessive dependence on the international market.3

  o They seek to use taxation and pricing to counteract the effects of

    rigidities in the economy, such as the shortage and surplus in

    labor and goods markets and the country's lack of access to a free

    international trade and borrowing environment.4


                                      —1--
    Often, the stated objectives of governments seem at variance with the

policies which they adopt. Though they may claim that the food subsidies to

city dwellers     are meant to help the urban poor, the government in   fact may not

subsidize   the   grain consumed by the poor (millet, for example), but rather the

grain consumed by those relatively better off (rice, for example).        In other

cases, the government may fail to achieve its objectives due to corruption and

incompetence. Though the intended objective of marketing boards' bureaucrats

is to help producers and consumers, in some cases they iay actually harm both

groups by running excessively costly and inefficient operations, and by

collecting rents for themselves.

     Moreover, in many cases, there appears to be some confusion in the

objectives of the government. It attempts to subsidize everyone, to increase

the prices received by farmers and to lower the prices paid by city dwellers,

without articulating who is paying for the subsidies, and indeed, without a

clear view of the full incidence of the complicated set of taxes and subsidies

which are levied. This confusion is further compounded in those countries in

which many different agencies set prices of different goads. Often these

agencies act independently of one another, under contradictory assumptions

concerning what the society's objectives are, and what the constraints on the

economy are.5

     Different agricultural pricing policies have markedly different effects

on the welfare of farmers and city dwellers, and on the revenue available to

the government for investment. These effects can be assessed only within a

general equilibrium model, in which the demands and supplies of different

groups in the economy, and how these demands and supplies are altered by


                                          —2—
changes in pricing policy, are taken into account, and in which the overall

constraints facing the economy —   its   balance of trade constraint, the

government's revenue constraint, etc. — are also taken explicitly into

account. We develop here a model within which the effects of pricing and

taxation policies can be evaluated, which enables us not only to identify

circumstances in which changes in a pricing policy can make all of the major

groups in the society better off, but also to characterize the qualitative

aspects of the optimal pricing policy.6

     We begin our analysis with an exceedingly simple model. This model has

the advantage that it focusses our attention on the critical trade—off s

involved in pricing decisions. Moreover, as we shall see, it is surprisingly

easy to extend this model to deal with more complex situations. We present

many important extensions. The number of possible extensions which can be

explored, however, is enormous, and we have not attempted to be

comprehensive.   It is necessary, therefore, to bring to bear the detailed

knowledge of the particular country under study to arrive at the formulation

which is most appropriate.




                              II.. A SIMPLE MODEL



     Consider an economy in which there are two commodities and two sectors:

food and related products, produced in the agricultural sector (Sector 1) and

a generalized industrial good, which can be used either for consumption or for

investment, produced in the industrial sector (Sector 2). Both goods are

freely traded; international price of the agricultural good in terms of the
industrial good is denoted by P.

      turalctor Agricultural land is owned equally among peasants;
they decide on how much labor to supply, on the basis of the prices at which

they can sell their surplus. We denote this price (in terms of the industrial

good) by p. Clearly, the level of utility which they attain is a function of

this price; we write the utility level of a representative peasant by

V'(p).7 Some of the agricultural goods are consumed within the agricultural

sector; we shall be concerned with the surplus quantity Q   which each peasant
sells to the industrial sector or abroad. This quantity is a function of the

price the peasants receive. We denote the price elasticity of the surplus by



(1)          —   lnQ
                 ____



      Although economic theory puts no constraints on the sign of       (there

may be a backward bending supply schedule of the marketed output of peasants),

we focus here on the case where an increase in the price increases the

marketed surplus. There appears to be some empirical evidence in support of

this hypothesis8.

      We assume that the government has very few policy instruments to control

peasants' behavior. In particular, the government can not directly control

the output, consumption and the surplus of peasants. This, we believe, is the

correct representation of most LDCs, since much   of the farming in these
economies is done In numerous small plots, and the ability of the government

to monitor the actions of any peasant seems sufficiently limited that only

indirect incentives are administratively feasible. This view is also

supported by the past experience of some of the socialist economies in which


                                      —4—
the attempts to control agricultural quantities have not been particularly

successful. In any event, our present analysis does not deal with a

collectivist agriculture or with an agriculture based on government managed

parastatals.

     Common experience also suggests that complex incentive schemes are

usually infeasible. For example, if the government attempts to implement non-

linear pricing, that is, schemes in which the price (per umit) paid to

peasants depends on the amount they sell, then peasants wcu1d have an

incentive to establish underground (unaccounted) markets. We therefore,

restrict ourselves to the simplest incentive structure, which is a piece rate

system entailing a common price to all peasants regardless of the quantities

they transact.

     Industrial Sector: In contrast to the agricultural sector, we assume

that there exist enough policy instruments in the industrial sector so that

the distinction between direct and indirect control can be virtually

ignored. This is partly because the government is often a large, if not the

overwhelmingly large, industrial employer in developing eccmomies. In

addition, the governments can tax corporate profits and coratrol producers'

prices and quantities. Also, the factory system enables the employer to

monitor their workers relatively more easily.

     For simplicity, we ignore the intra—sectoral income distribution at

present, and assume that the number of hours which industrial workers work is

fixed9; the government takes the wage, w, it pays workers as given; the

marketing board controls the price, q, that it charges for food in the

industrial sector. Thus, we write the welfare of an industrial worker as
 2
V (q, w).


                                      —5—
      Given their income w and the price q, industrial workers decide on how

much food to consume. If x2 denotes this quantity, then x2 = x2(q,            w). We
let        denote the price elasticity of the demand (as a positive nuniber) of
      xq
the urban consumption of food:



(2)              =— aznx2
            xq      3Lnq



      Investnt: We can calculate the amount available to the government for

the industrial wage payments; plus the net revenue of the zrketing board:'°



(3)        I =   N(Y   — w) + (P —   p) N1Q + (q — P) N2x2


where N' is the number of peasants and N2 is the number of industrial

workers. Y is the output per industrial worker.



                                     III.   PRICING POLICIES



      Price Ref orR: There are three identifiable groups in our model, the
peasants, the industrial workers,           and the government (representing future

generations      through its   control of investment). For each value of p and     q, we
can calculate the feasible combinations of Vi, v2, and I (see Figure 1).
      We first show that: certainp                   hanes can make all groups in society

better off.

      Note that an increase in rural food price makes the peasants better off,

but it does not affect the industrial workers. Also, investment increases


                                               —6—
with an increase in p if11



(4)     r    < P1(1   +
                          l/Qp)

Thus, if the price of food in the agricultural sector is less than p ,   then an
increase in it is unequivocally desirable, since it will increase the surplus

available to the government f or investment, and it will also improve the

welfare of peasants, while leaving the situation of industrial workers

unchanged.

      Similarly, a decrease in the urban food price makes the industrial

workers better off, and it does not affect the peasantse Also, it increases

investment if 12

                                   Figure 1




         The utility possibilities schedule gives the  imum value of
investment consistent with any level of utility of peasants and industrial
workers. If the existing prices are at inefficient poirts such as Z, then a
change in prices can make every group in the society better off.




                                —8—
Thus, if (5) is satisfied then a decrease in the urban food price is

unequivocally desirable for the society.

       The above rules of price reform, therefore, identify a lower limit of

what the rural food price should be, and an upper limit of what the urban food

price should be. A highly useful feature of these rules is that they can be

applied with very little information. Apart from the world price, the only

data required to use them are the demand and supply elasticities.

       What is additionally attractive about these rules of price reform is that

their valdty s not restricted to the specific model considered above. The

only conditions required for the two rules of reform, (4) and (5), to hold are

that




(6)       —   >   0, andav2—   < 0,



respectively. Now, interpret V1 and V2 as representing the aggregate welfare

of the entire group of peasants and industrial workers, respectively. Then

(6) implies that the aggregate welfare of peasants increases if the price of

their output is increased, and that the welfare of industrial workers

decreases if the food price they face is increased. So long as these (rather

mild) conditions are satisfied, our rules of price reform will hold.

       For instance, the rule for reform In the urban food price holds

regardless of the distribution of income among Industrial workers. Similarly,

the rule for reform in the rural food price holds no matter how agricultural

land is distributed among peasants, so long as not many peasants are

significant net buyers of food. Also, the same rules of reform apply (with

slight modifications) even when there is migration between the two sectors.


                                       —9—
      Optiial Pricing Policies: We showed above, how, In a variety of

circumstances, only the knowledge of the supply and demand elasticities is

sufficient for one to weed out inefficient pricing policies. But still, there

are numerous pricing policies which are efficient. A choice among these

policies necessarily entails trade—off s; between the interests of peasants,

industrial workers, and future generations (investment). In this section, we

show how one can attempt to think systematically about the nature of these

trade—off s. First, we express the aggregate social welfare as




(7)      H N1W(V1) + N2W(V2) + 61,


in which 6 is the social value of marginal investment.13 H gives the value of

social welfare as a function of the welfare of peasants and industrial

workers, and the level of investment. Conceptually, this allows us to draw

social indifference curves, i.e., those combinations of Vi-, V2, and I among

which the society is indifferent. The government, then, should choose that

point on the utility possibilities surface (Figure 1) which is tangent to the

social indifference curve.

      This point of tangency, representing the optimal pricing scheme, can be

expressed as:



(8)      p=          "1             ,and
              1 + (1 -
                         f)    L
                              CQp




                         2

              1-(1-F)-
                                           —10—
where A1 is the private marginal utility of income to a worker in sector i,

and     = x1aw/av1 is the social (weight) marginal utility of income to a

worker in sector i.'4 We have thus obtained explicit expressions of a

remarkably simple form for the optimal prices in terms of the welfare

weights and the price elasticities.

       Qualitative Results: Our formulae are not only simple, but       also    their

prescriptions are intuitively understandable. The optimum price in the

agricultural sector depends only on the social weight on the income of

peasants (relative to investment) and on the price elasticity of agricultural

surplus; similarly, the optimum price in the industrial sector depends only on

the social weight on the income of industrial workers and their price

elasticity of demand for agricultural goods.15

       In the (normal) case where investment is socially valued more than

consumption, peasants receive less than the international price of food and

city dwellers pay more than the international price of food. Also, a higher

elasticity of agricultural surplus corresponds to a higher price paid to

peasants; a higher demand elasticity of food in the industrial sector

corresponds to a lower price charged to city dwellers (this is because when

government raises the price, it loses more intra—marginal tax revenue as a

result of the decreased demand). Further, the smaller the social weight on

peasant's income, the lower the price in the agricultural sector; the smaller

the social weight on city dwellers' income, the higher the price paid by them.

       lplicit Tax   Rates:   The optimal pricing formulae derived above can be

usefully restated in terms     of the commodity taxes. Let t = (P   —   p)/p.     Then t

is   the tax rate on the output of peasants; it can also be interpreted as the


                                        —11--
rate of subsidy on their consumption. Denote the food output and the

consumption of a peasant by X and x respectively. Then,



(10)      Q=X—x1

Further, define


                                                      1
                     LnX        and    =       3Lnx

                            ,




as the price elasticities of food output and consumption of a peasant.'6 Then

the surplus elasticity, can be expressed as                       =   (1 + a)c + uc
                                                             Qp             Xp        xp
                1
where     =         is   the ratio of peasants' consumption to their marketed

surplus. Using these definitions, the optimal tax rate is obtained from (8)

as


                            1
                                           1
(12)          t =        — f)         c)cXp +    ac
                                                   xp


        The tax rate in the present case has some features in common with the

traditional tax literature, but there also are some differences. According to

(12), the magnitude of the tax rate is inversely proportional to the price

elasticities of output and consumption. This dependence is heuristically the

same as the one which was posited in some of the earliest writings on

taxation, i.e., those by Frank Ramsey (1927) and by A.C. Pigou.'7

        However, there is a basic difference between the present policy problem,

and the standard taxation problem in which production and consumption

decisions are made by corporations and consumers respectively. In the latter


                -
                                                      —12—
case, the relative roles played by output and consumption elasticities depend

very much on the government's corporate tax policy; the output elasticity does

not appear in the tax formula, for example, if the corporate profit is

entirely taxed away.18

      In the present policy problem, in contrast, it   is   nearly impossible for

the   government to be able to administratively distinguish between producers
and consumers within the agricultural sector;    since peasants are
simultaneously   producers as well as consumers. The key elasticity therefore

is the elasticity of marketed surplus. Even though this elasticity can be

restated in terms   of   output and consumption elasticities, as in (12), it is

the combined effect that matters.



                                   IV. EXTENSIONS



      The simplicity of the above model has enabled us to obtain results which

are intuitive. We now extend our analysis in many ways. Our approach here Is

to study one extension at a time; this facilitates clearer insights into the

considerations which are most relevant in the determinati of optimal prices.



      A. Many    Incou Groups
      The formulae derived earlier can be used in the case of many income

groups by simply interpreting B as the "average" social weight on the incomes

of individuals in a sector.

      To see this, consider an agricultural sector in which there is a

continuum of land ownership ranging from large landlords to landless

workers.19 Denote an individual by the superscript h, whose marketed surplus


                                        —13—
is Qh (which can be negative) and whose net labor supply (i.e., the labor

hours supplied by this person minus the labor hours used on his farm) is Lh.

Denote the rural wage per hour by w. Since this wage is determined in the

rural labor market, it depends on the price of agricultural surplus, p. We

define



                3Znw'
(13)      c
           wp   3Znp



as the elast1cty of rural wage with respect to p. Further, let Q denote the

average marketed surplus, i.e., Q   = Qh/l•
                                      h
       Then it is easily verified that (8) is still the optimal pricing rule,

with the modification that now



(14)             1hh +   1h      )/   Qh




where 81 is the social weight on the income of individual h. The inter-

pretation of      as the average social weight on rural incomes is obvious.

Expression (14) defines a weighted average of the social weights on the income

of different individuals. The weight for an individual is his surplus plus

his gain (or loss) due to price induced change in the rural wage.20

       Two points are worth noting here. First, the average social weight we

have derived above takes into account the general equilibrium effects of

prices on wage incomes. Similar social weights developed in the earlier tax

literature have typically ignored such effects.21 Second, our pricing formula

is largely independent of the specific form of economic organization within

the agricultural sector. Specifically, it does not depend on the nature of



                                          —14—
the labor market (for example, on whether the labor market is competitive or

not). We further discuss the organization of the agricultural sector in a

later section.

       The same approach applies to the industrial sector. With wage (income)

differences among city dwellers, (9) is the optimal pricing formula, with a

modification that



(15)
           2
               =E 2h
                  x 2h/Zx 2h
                 h           h


where 82h is the social weight on the income of the city dweller h, who

consumes 2h units of food. Once again, it is obvious from (15) that B2 is

the average of the social weights on the incomes of different city dwellers.22



       B. Disaggregation of goods

       The multitude of goods with which the agricultural sector deals can be

divided into some distinct categories. Among the goods produced in the

agricultural sector, for example, are those which are consumed by peasants and

also sold to outsiders (like food grains), those which are inputs to

agricultural production itself (like manure and irrigation wells), and those

which are produced solely for selling them to outsiders (like rubber and

fibers). Similarly, the agricultural sector buys some goods from outside for

consumption (like textiles, transistor radios and movies) and other goods for

their use as inputs in production (like fertilizers and tractors).23

       All of these goods can be incorporated within our earlier model. What

one needs to do is to interpret Q as a vector, of which an element Q

                                          —15—
or negative, depending on whether peasants are net sellers or buyers of this

good. For those goods which are produced and utilized solely within the

agricultural sector, Q1 is zero. We assume that the government can influence

the prices of only those goods which cross the border between the two

sectors.24 Stated differently, the taxation of those goods for which Q j

zero is not feasible.25

       Naturally, p, P and t are now vectors. From (3) and (7) one can obtain a

characterization of the optimal prices.26 For a unique interior optimum, the

optimal prices are solutions to the following set of equations.


                                 3Q.                  1

supply of good j with respect to a (hypothetical) lump sum transfer of income

to a peasant.

        Expression (17) generalizes the Ramsey tax rule to the context in which

individuals are simultaneously producers, consumers and traders.28

Heuristically, it states that the percentage change due to pricing in the

 (compensated) net supply of each good with which the agricultural sector deals

should be the same; regardless of whether the good is a surplus consumption



                                                           —16—
good, a purchased farm input, a farm output to be sold as an industrial input,

or a good which serves several different purposes.

          Now consider a somewhat hypothetical situation in which the cross price

effects on the uncompensated net supplies are negligible. Denoting the

That is, the optimal pricing rule obtained in the sinipler case of one

aggregate agricultural good, (12), holds in the present case for each of the

goods traded by peasants.

          The above expression provides some useful insights into the problem of

pricing. What (18) says is that if cross price effects are negligible, and if

the own price elasticity has the same sign within a category of goods, then

each member of this category should have the same sign of tax. That is, if

one good in the category is taxed, then all goods should be taxed; or, if one

good in the category is subsidized, then all goods should receive a subsidy.

          Consider, now, the category of goods consisting of agricultural

production inputs which peasants buy from outside, like fertilizers and

tractors. In the standard case of a farm household facing a fixed rural wages

we know that              < 0 for all production inputs. In the present case, there

is an indirect effect of prices on the rural wage (or imputed wage) which in

turn might affect the quantity of input. For the standard sign to be

reversed, however, the indirect effect would have to be not only positive, but

also large enough so that it dominates the standard effect. Assume for a



                                                 —17—
moment that this is not so, i.e. ,   the direct own price effect prevails. The
expression (18) then implies that, In the normal case, all purchased

agricultural inputs should be priced higher than their international prices.

     A similar argument applies to the category of goods which peasants

produce solely for selling them to outsiders (like rubber and fiber

products). In this case,       > 0    ,   provided the indirect price effect
(through wage) does not reverse the direct response. Then, in the normal

case, the prices of goods in this category should be lower than their

international prices.

     What is additionally interesting about the above results is that they do

not depend on what income distribution exists within the agricultural sector,

provided the induced price effects are not significant.

     The above results are important not because we believe that the cross

price effects are negligible, or that the indirect effects of price changes

are either negligible, or are of a nature that the standard responses are

preserved. These results are important because we have isolated the reasons

why the sign of taxes might differ among goods belonging to specific

categories. By the same token, if these reasons do not exist then, for many

goods, we can prescribe what the sign of taxes should be.

     Specifically, we often see in practice that the above prescriptions are

violated. For example, we find that a fertilizer is being subsidized, while a

pesticide is being taxed, or vice—versa. Or, that cotton is being subsidized

while jute is being taxed. It is obvious from our analysis that the

justification for such taxation must      lie   in the presence of large cross price

effects   or in the presence of such induced effects (through rural wage

changes) that the standard price responses are reversed. If it is found from



                                          —18—
empirical analysis that such is not the case, then a violation of the above

prescriptions would suggest that the existing tax structure is not optimal and

that it can be improved upon.

    This analysis also raises some doubts on an oft given advice that, on the

grounds of equity, some agricultural inputs (like tractors) should be taxed

since they will be used primarily by rich farmers, while other inputs (like

fertilizer) should be subsidized since they could be used by poor as well as

rich farmers. The above analysis suggests that such policies might not be

ustfied on the ground of equity alone; the primary justfcat1on for them

should come from the importance of cross price effects and of the effects of

prices on rural wage.29



     C. Allocation of Public    lnvestient
    An important part of policy making in the early phases of economic
development   is the decision on how investment (and public goods creation)

should be allocated between the two sectors. Though a full discussion of this

allocation problem will take us too far afield, a few comments might be

useful. First, recent development experiences have shown that the capital

allocation decisions need to be visualized in broader terms than the simple

choice between industrial plants versus tractors; as it was in much   of   the

earlier literature on economic   growth.3° One needs to consider public
investment in human capital formation, in raising land's productivity, in
technology development, and in fostering the adoption of newly developed
inputs and techniques.
     Second, it   is apparent that many of the possible public investments in

the agricultural sector do not require a shipment of industrially produced



                                       —19—
goods tothe agricultural sector, but in fact entail creating public goods

(such as irrigation and transportation networks) using inputs drawn primarily

from this sector itself.

      Formally, the model with disaggregated goods presented earlier is easily

enlarged to incorporate the production and the allocation of investment

goods. What we need to specify additionally is the extent to which (and the

mechanism through which) the government collects fees from the potential

beneficiaries of public investments. As an example, we need to know what the

irrigation water charges are, and whether they depend on the quantity of water

used or whether they are flat fees depending on the proximity of users to the

water source. At a more general level, of course, the choice of fee schedules

for   the use of publicly created goods should in itself be determined
concurrently with the pricing and the investment allocation policy.
      The nature of pricing rules would not however, undergo a substantial
revision   in the presence of allocation decisions, except that they would now

correspond to a situation in which public investments are optimally allocated

and also that the pricing rules will now include their effects on the revenue

collection from public fees. For example, in the basic model, if the

government allocates the capital good to the two sectors, then the expressions

(8) and (9) continue to represent the optimal pricing rules, provided there is

no public fee.3'



       D. International Trade Environment

       Some researchers, like Newbery (1972), have argued that the correct model

to describe the present—day LDCs is that of a small open economy. This might

be a rather extreme position, since the access of many   LDCs to specific trade


                                       —20—
markets is often limited (a fact reflected in the routine bilateral and

multilateral quantity negotiations, like those between EEC and LDCs). Also,

the objective of self—sufficiency is prevalent in many economies, and this

objective is often reflected in restrictions which are imposed on the

quantities of certain imports.

      A better approach, therefore, is to examine the issue of pricing within a

general framework in which the sensitivity of pricing decisions to the

characteristics of the international trade environment can be explicitly

assessed. This Is what we have attempted to do In Sah and Stgltz (1983b).

For brevity, however, we limit ourselves here to a discussion of certain

limited aspects of this more general approach.

      Self—sufficiency Objective: Suppose that the government wishes to

achieve a certain degree of self—sufficiency in the agricultural good (a self—

sufficiency objective for industrial good can be treated in parallel

manner). One way to express this objective is as a constraint that the

quantity   of food imported can not exceed a certain pre—specified fraction of
its   urban consumption. Obviously, such a constraint influences pricing

decisions only when it is binding. But once it is binding, the two prices (p

and q) can not be varied independently of one another.

       Further, the self—sufficiency objective may result in higher food prices

for both the peasants and the city—dwellers. This is because the government,

with self—sufficiency in mind, may use the price policy to increase the

surplus from peasants, and also to curtail urban food consumption. In this

case, then, peasants would be relatively better—off, and the city—dwellers

relatively worse—off, compared to a situation in which there are no self--

sufficiency objectives.



                                      —21—
    Forei Sales Constraints:     Quantity    constraints on a country's exports

can be treated in a manner similar as above. We need to consider only those

cases in which the foreign sales constraints are binding. If the agricultural

good is being exported, then a constraint on its foreign sale might lead to a

lower (optimal) price to both the peasants and the city dwellers, since one of

the reasons to pay a higher price to peasants, and to charge a higher price

from city dwellers is to increase the export quantity of this good. This

reason does not exist any more when the foreign sales constraint is binding.

     Non—Traded Goods: Many of the goods discussed earlier are non—traded

goods, such as infrastructure and inputs into human capital formation. In

addition, a large number of ordinary consumption and industrial goods produced

in LDCs have virtually no international markets, because of their low quality,

even though these goods are traded domestically.32 In fact, many of these

goods do not have a market even in the intra—LDC trade. For the purpose of

policy making, therefore, these goods must also be viewed as non—traded goods.

     The treatment of a traded versus a non—traded good entails a difference

which is conceptually simple. The shadow price for a traded good is its

international price, whereas the shadow price of a non—traded good is

determined endogenously (and contemporaneously with the determination of

optimal prices) based on its social scarcity value. 33

     Despite this difference, our earlIer discussion of the qualitative

properties of optimal taxation remains valid for non—traded goods as well.

For traded goods, we had defined taxes as the differences between the

international prices and the prices faced by consumers and producers. Taxes

for non—traded goods can be defined correspondingly with respect to the shadow

prices. This redefinition, however, does not change the expressions for the



                                      —22—
optimal tax rates. Our discussion on taxation thus holds for non—traded goods

as well.34



        K. Migration and Unemployment

        Recent   development economics literature has focussed on the importance of

labor mobility across sectors. In particular, it has been pointed out that

migration from the agricultural to the industrial sector might increase

industrial unemployment indirectly, because only some of the migrants can find

industrial employment. This possibility has important consequences for public

policy. The following extension of the basic model incorporates some of these

consequences in the context of pricing.

        Consider three population groups: peasants, industrial workers and

unemployed workers. One would expect that, for those peasants who are net

sellers of food, a lower rural food price will decrease the attractiveness of

living in the agricultural sector, compared to living in the industrial

sector. The same effect would arise if the urban food price is lower.

Further, if peasants are migrating to the industrial sector, for one reason or

another, then the level of unemployment in the sector will increase which, in

turn,   will   discourage further migration.

        The modification required in the analysis of pricing policy, then, Is

that we need to calculate the consequences of the induced migration. First,

we need to redefine the elasticity of agricultural surplus to take into

account the fact that the rural population itself is sensitive to prices.

Second, an outward migration from the agricultural sector reduces the

population pressure (congestion) on agricultural land which, in turn,

increases the welfare of those living in this sector. Also, a change in the

congestion influences the government revenue from taxation by affecting the


                                         —23—
quantity of the marketed surplus. Third, migration has direct welfare effect

as well, since workers move from one group to another which, in general, have

different levels of utility.

       In a highly general model of migration which we have proposed

elsewhere,35 the formula for the optimal rural food price is obtained as36



                                       ,   where
(19)                         1
              1 + (1 —
                       f-)
                                 EQp
(20)           =   BLiQ) 1




is the redefined price elasticity of agricultural surplus (taking into account

the effect of price on rural population), and                 represents the welfare

effects of price—induced migration.37 Under plausible circumstances, it

appears that         exceeds                and that      is positive.38

       Now compare the above expression for the optimal price, (19), to the

corresponding expression (8) when there is no migration. The effect of

migration in the normal case is to increase the numerator and decrease the

denominator. Heuristically, this Implies that the effect of migration is to

increase the price paid to peasants for their surplus. This uiakes some

intuitive sense since by paying a higher price to peasants, the government can

reduce the pressure of migration to cities and can, thus, curtail the

resulting urban unemployment which otherwise will cause loss of society's

welfare. This insight appears to be particularly relevant to some cities in

LDCs (for example, Bangkok, Cairo and Mexico city) in which the in—migration

 from the rural sector has led to serious social degradation in urban areas.

       In an Important special case of the above formulation, migration

 continues to the point where the expected utility of the marginal migrant


                                                   —24—
(taking into account the probability of being unemployed) is equal in the two

sectors, and where the marginal productivity of a worker in the   rural   sector
is fixed. Then our pricing formula becomes39



(21)
                        N 6

where recall that A' is the private marginal utility of income to a rural

worker.

       This has an interesting implication. In the early stages of development,

when the social weight on investment is expected to be quite large and when

the fraction of the population in the agricultural sector is large, then the

price paid to peasants should be less than the international price. But as

the economy develops, the price paid to peasants should increase, and it is

quite possible that it should even exceed the international price.40



       F. Organization of The Industrial Sector



       Public Control in Industrial Sector: Though we have assumed thus far

that the government can exercise direct control in the industrial sector, our

analysis remains essentially unchanged even if the industrial sector is

decentralized. Consider, for example, an industrial sector consisting of

public sector firms. If the government instructs its public sector managers

to maximize profits (based on whatever prices they face) then the optimum

described earlier can be implemented in a decentralized manner by setting

excise taxes at appropriate levels.

       The same approach also holds, with slight modification, in an industrial

sector consisting of both private corporations as well as public sector


                                      —25—
enterprises. In this case, the main additional effect one needs to consider

is the impact of pricing on the tax revenue from private corporations, and on

the allocation of post—tax profits of these corporations.    In the polar case

in which 100 per cent profit tax is imposed on private corporations, our

earlier formulae apply without any change.

      Determination of Industrial Wage: Clearly, our earlier assumption that

industrial wage is fixed (in terms of industrial goods) was made solely for

simplicity. There are many hypotheses in the literature concerning industrial

wage determination. Some recent hypotheses, for instance, have postulated

relationship between industrial wages, industrial output and the level of

unemployment in the economy. According to these theories,the output of an

industrial firm (net of hiring and training costs) depends on the wage that it

pays to its workers, since this wage has effects on workers' productivity,

quality and turnover.41 Employers (public or private), therefore, take into

account these effects while determining the wages they pay, which in turn

determine the level of employment.

      Elsewhere, we have developed a unified framework for industrial wage

determination which can not only be specialized to many of the new theories

(as   well as to the traditional approaches to industrial wage   determination),

but which also takes into account the interaction between the wage setting

mechanism and migration.42 For brevity, we do not present this general

approach     here and, instead, discuss a few highly special cases.
       (i)    If the government can control the industrial wage, then (under our
 assumption that labor supply in the industrial sector is Inelastic) a
 reduction in the optimal wage is equivalent to a lump. sum tax. Thus,    it Is
 not surprising that the wage should be set such that the marginal social
 weight on the income of industrial workers equals the social weight on

                                        —26—
investment, i.e.,       =   . Accordingly,      there should be no comnodity tax in

 the industrial sector, i.e.



 (22)      q = P.



The formula for the optimal price   in   the agricultural sector   remains
unchanged.

        (ii) Suppose that the trade union demands are such that they impose a

constraint on the level of welfare which the government provides to its

members; that is, unions do not suffer from money illusion; they know that an

       in the price of food represents a worsening of their welfare in the
increase

same way that a reduction in their wage would. Then, Pareto optimality
entails the government lowering (or raising) w to satisfy the union demand,
while maintaining (22) for pricing. The substitution of a lump       su tax for
equal utility discortionary tax generates increased revenue for the
government.
     (iii) Alternatively, if the wage productivity hypothesis holds, that is
the wage rate affects workers productivity, then efficiency may entail paying
high wages in the industrial sector, and also real wages may be relatively
insensitive, for instance, to the unemployment rate. In the existing models
based on wage—productivity effects, relative prices are taken as fixed; but
here, we are concerned with the determination of relative prices. A natural
hypothesis then is that the productivity of a worker is a function of his wage
as well as the relative prices he faces. That is43

(23)       Y Y(q, w).


                                         —27—
In this case, the government will take into account the fact that as it

increases q, productivity will decline; this will decrease the optimal price

in the industrial sector. The optimal price is given by


                         P
(24)                         2
              1 — (1 —           + b)/Cxq

Where, b F/x2 K 0 captures the effect of price on output.44 Not

surprisingly, if we can control both industrial wages and prices, we again do

not want to impose a distortionary tax in the industrial sector, but we do

want to take into account the effect of an increase In inco          on the

productivity of industrial workers.



                                  V. REMARKS AND DISCUSSION



       Though we have analyzed many important extensions, they clearly do not

represent the entire range of circumstances one might encounter in different

countries. But, then, an analytical study of the present kind —          with   its

emphasis on identifying critical trade—off s —       is   probably not the best

approach to examine every possible detail. What we do in this section,

therefore, Is to take another look at the assumptions made in this study, and

to see how the qualitative features of the analysis might change if these

 assumptions are modified. At the same time, we point out some of the

 important questions we have not addressed in this paper.

       Structure of the Economy: The major components of the economy in our

 analysis are: the organization of the agricultural sector and the industrial

 sector, the migration mechanism, and the international trade environment.45

 As regards the agricultural sector, we began our analysis with a basic model


                                             —28—
consisting of homogeneous land-owning peasants, which we   then   generalized to

heterogeneous    land ownership, and an endogenous determination of agricultural
wage.
        The formula which we obtained earlier for the heterogeneous agricultural

sector [expressions (8) and (14)1 also applies to other forms of organization

within agriculture. For example, in a sharecropping agriculture, all we need

to   do is to interpret Qh as the net surplus of an individual after paying the
landlord's    share, or after receiving the share from the tenant. Further, if

the share contract is endogenously determined, then the individuals' surplus

elasticity will be based in part on the elasticities of eqmiuibrium shares

with respect to price.

        Another aspect of sectoral organization which deserves our attention is

the internal composition of households. This aspect, though ignored in much

of the standard tax literature, is highly important since we know that the

households in any econoiny have heterogeneous demographic characteristics. Its

significance in LDCs should be obvious; not only do we observe that extended

households constitute an important institution, but also we find that often

there are systematic differences in the demographic characteristics of

households in different regions (rural and urban, for example), and in

different income groups. Its primary implication on pricing formulae, like

(8) and (14), is as follows. The social weights Bth would now be determined

not only by the income of the households and by the social aversion to

inequality, but also by the demographic composition of the households.

Moreover, the computation of households' response to prices would now be based

on a model of households which explicitly takes into account the intra—

household allocation.46

        Rigidities in the Economy: The particular rigidity on which we have


                                        —29—
focussed is the one in the labor market. Our approach posits that the wage

has an effect on the output (through labor productivity and other effects),

and that migration decisions are based on expected utilIty (which includes a

probability of remaining unemployed). The equilibrium market wage (that is,

the wage which employers would pay at their optimum) is, therefore, such that

there is unemployment.

    An important consequence of this approach is that the market wage would

change if the tax policy changes (as we explained earlier, our use of the

assumption of fixed industrial wage in many parts of this paper is solely for

brevity in exposition). A related consequence is that the government would

not, in general, be able to eliminate unemployment through taxes and

subsidies.47

    Two other points concerning rigidities are as follows.. First, an obvious

extension of rigidity in the labor market is to some other markets (of goods

and factors) which do not clear. This, of course, has been an issue of study

in the recent literature on temporary Keynesian equilibria,48 and it might

have significant implications in the context of taxation and pricing in LDCs.

    Second, our present analysis has abstracted from the possibility that the

adjustments in the economy, particularly in the labor market, might be

lagged. In such a case, there are possible Intertemporal consequences of

taxation policies, and a myopic taxation policy (based on this period's

consequences alone) might be different from the one in which the dynamics of

adjustment is taken into account.49

    Feasibility and Efficacy of Tax Instruments: Often there is a tendency

among policy analysts to borrow results from the standard tax literature and

prescribe them to LDC conditions, without examining the premises of the

former. Such an approach overlooks what we consider to be a fundamental


                                      —30--
difference between LDCs and industrial economies, namely, which tax

instruments can the government use, and which instruments it can not use.

Furthermore, among the central issues which the recent tax literature50 has

attempted to understand are: (1) what are the constraints on the government's

ability to tax, (ii) how are these constraints related to the information and

transaction costs, and (iii) how are these constraints related to the design

of tax policy.

       In the context of peasant agriculture, for example, it is virtually

impossible to tax labor input. This inability to tax can be viewed as an

information problem: though the              of labor income IS   a   perfectly well
defined economic concept, .L           smmustbe
which are quantitatively ascertainable by an outside                  The importance of
this constraint can be seen in the following.

       Our formulae seem to contradict the oft quoted result of Diamond and

Mirrlees (1971) that the producers' prices should be the same as the shadow

prices. Any     rural tax   or subsidy, that is any difference between p and P,

violates this result. How do we reconcile our results with theirs?

       The answer is quite simple. The Diamond-Mirrlees model assumes that the

government can levy taxes on all factor inputs. In contrast, as we argued

above, a labour input tax     is   nearly impossible to implement in LDCs. As a

consequence, the Diamond—Mirrlees result does not hold in the present case; it

is incorrect, therefore, to borrow this result out of its context and use it

as   a basis for agricultural pricing.
      There   are other differences as well between the policy problem examined

in this paper and the standard tax literature. First, as we pointed out

earlier, it is quite difficult to implement different producers' and

consumers' prices for food in the peasant sector (since peasants are both


                                          —31—
consumers and producers), unlike in the standard tax model in which the

government can differentiate between the two sets of prices.

     Second, all consumers face the same price in the standard tax model,

whereas we have analyzed in this paper an economy in which the city dwellers

face different prices from what peasants face. The case where the government

can not (or does not wish to) maintain a tax border between the agricultural

and the industrial sectors can be analyzed in a parallel nner; the detailed

results would obviously be different.5'

     Third, all prof Its are taxed away in the standard tax model, itS

counterpart in the agricultural sector Implies that the government can impose

a 100 percent tax on land rent. For obvious reasons (e.g., government's

inability to distinguish returns from land and labor), such a tax is rarely
           52
imposed.

     The issue of land tax, in fact, provides a good example of the

constraints on tax instruments. This tax has been most highly recommended by

conventional theory since David Rlcardo.53 A major constraint on the use of

land tax, however, is as follows. If land tax is based on land area,

Irrespective of quality, then it is viewed as unfair. On the other hand,

basing   land tax on land quality is Inherently difficult, since the effect of

land quality from that of other inputs is not easily disentangled. It is not

surprising therefore that negligible use is made of the land tax in most of

today's LDCs and, moreover, its use has steadily declined over time (probably

because the use of coercion required to administer such a tax is less feasible

today than It was In earlier times).

    More generally, what we have attempted to argue here is that for a tax

analysis to be   relevant,   it must be   based on only those instruments which are
feasible, which in turn depends on the information and transaction costs which


                                          —32—
different instruments entail. In particular, it should not be surprising that

much of the taxation in LDCs is based on indirect instruments and, indeed, it

is these instruments which should form the core of analysis in developing

economies. Further, these economies often employ a variety of non—price

instruments (such as various kinds of rationing and queuing schemes) which

have yet not been investigated sufficiently in the public economics

literature.

     Taxation   and the Use of Markets: A key characteristic of most tax

instruments is that the tax is actually imposed on the (formal) market

transactions (for example, on a consumer's purchase of a good from a trader,

or an employer's payment of wage to his.employee). What is often ignored in

the conventional tax analysis is that transactions also take place (to varying

degree) outside the formal market in which middlemen's services are employed

to a substantially lesser extent.

     The formal market   is   costlier than the informal market since it entails

middlemen's Cost, but the former also economizes on large transactions.

Clearly then, the use of markets would shift from one to another depending on

the tax policy. Moreover, this shift would be different for different

individuals; this in turn, has efficiency and equity effects which have thus

far not been examined in the literature.

     This issue is important in LDCs for at least two reasons. First, a large

proportion of transactions take place informally because formal markets are

often nonexistant in many areas (due perhaps to the small size of

transactions). Second, the widespread prevalence of corruption and tax

avoidance can be viewed as an additional division of the formal market into a

regular and an irregular (underground) market. The latter market, while

economizing on transactions and entailing middlemen's costs, avoids taxation,


                                        —33—
often with the connivance of the tax bureaucracy. Presumably, however, it has

some disadvantages over the formal regular market, otherwise everyone would

switch to the irregular market and no tax revenue would be collected.

Clearly, then, a full analysis of taxation in LDCs needs to take into account

the shifts among these various markets.

    Political Economy of Pricing and Taxation Often the most important

rationale which governments provide for their pricing policies is the

redistribution from rich to the poor... On the other hand, actual public

policies sometimes seem to do just the opposite. This apparent contradiction

raises some issues which need to be clarified.

    Assume, for a moment, that redistribution is indeed a key government

objective. A basic question we then need to answer is: how much      redistribu-
tion is possible, given a set of policy instruments? Note that this is a

positive question rather than a normative one, and that it can be posed

quantitatively by devising several possible ways of measuring

redistribution.

    Much of the tax literature has focussed on a normative question, namely,

what are the analytical properties of optimal redistributive taxes, given a

set of tax instruments. Surely, this is an important question and its answer,

as is well known by now, depends on the society's aversion to inequality and

on the nature of responses of individuals.

     An   exclusive   concern with the latter question, though, can create an

incomplete picture. Suppose it turns out that very little redistribution can

be achieved, say, through pricing of goods (which happens to be the only

instrument a government can employ). Then, the discourse on tax policy is

modified In at least two ways. First, the redistributlve objective of

government loses its practical consequence (given the set of available


                                        —34—
instruments), since very little redistribution can be achieved regardless of

what the stated objectives of the government are.55 By the same token, it

becomes clear that if the government indeed wants redistribution, then it must

enlarge the set of instruments.

       The question of how much redistribution is possible has been examined by

Sah (1983) in the context of a simple model with heterogeneous individuals, in

which   the   only instruments available to the government are taxation (pricing)

of goods. The analysis shows that, under certain plausible conditions, the

redistribution that can be achieved is meager. The analysis clearly needs to

be extended to more general models such as the present one, in which not only

do consumer groups face different prices but also there are significant

rigidities in the economy.

       Now, assume that redistribution is not the objective of taxation;

instead, taxation is used by the more powerful groups in the society for their

own   advantage.   It is obvious that the analytical apparatus developed in this

paper applies to this case as well. For example, if the city dwellers control

the political system and they maximize their own   welfare,   then the prices they

will set will correspond to the formulae we developed earlier, where the

social weight on income of peasants is set at zero.

      Empirical studies have hitherto not provided much guidance on which one

of these two polar assumptions concerning the governments objective is more

correct or what particular combination of these two cases is most realistic.

More casual observation suggests nevertheless that the latter objective (in

which tax policies are employed by some groups against others) might be

playing an important role.

      Some of the most important historical conflicts, for example, have been

associated    with one group of individuals attempting to use discriminatory


                                        —35—
policies against other groups. Among the landmarks are: the conflicts

associated with corn laws in England, the discord between the North and the

South in the United States leading to the civil war, and the conflicts between

the advocates of peasants versus those of industrial workers in the pre—

collectivization USSR.

     It is quite plausible, then, that the domination of one group by another

is an important factor determining present—day pricing policies (specially in

countries with significant regional specialization in crops). Therefore,

whether an analysis such as the present one would serve to improve the equity

and efficiency in an economy, or whether it will used by some groups of people

to discriminate against others, is a question of some concern to us.
                                    FOOTNOTES



1.   Pricing and taxation of goods appear to be, by far, the most important

     policy instruments employed by the governments in LDCs as well as In many

     socialist economies. For some details on the magnitudes involved, see

     Bale and Lutz (1979).



2.   There is a long tradition, cutting across ideological boundaries, of

     viewing the agricultural sector as the desirable source of public

     revenue. In the Marxist tradition, this approach was advocated by many

     leaders of the October Revolution in what came to be known as the Soviet

     Industrialization Debate". Our paper on price scissors (1984) clarifies

     and corrects a number of positions advanced in this debate and it also

     analyzes the issue of price scissors in the context of present day

     LDCs. In the classical laissez faire tradition, on the other hand, the

     agricultural   sector has been viewed as the ideal source of    public   revenue
     ever since David Ricardo claimed that the land tax is the      best   form of
     taxation.




3.   Economists are typically reluctant to deal with so—called 'non—economi&

     objectives   such as self—sufficiency. The fact of the matter is that in
     many countries   (for example, in   India and South Korea), a drive towards
     self—sufficiency is an unambiguously       stated national policy. A useful

     approach, therefore, is   to include these objectives in policy analysis,
     while   also pointing out the economic costs of pursuing such objectives.



4.   Among other objectives are, for example, to stabilize prices faced by


                                         —37—
     consumers and producers [see Newbery and Stiglitz (1981)], and to

     redistribute inco away from middlemen towards consumers and producers.



5.   Price intervention is extremely widespread in industrial economies too.

     Son of the bitterest controversies among the EEC members, for example,

     arise due to their disagreements on farm pricing policies. Many of the

     objectives   of these governments are similar to those discussed earlier,
     but some of them are different. The U.S. government, for example,
     sometimes    pays its farmers to reduce their output.



6.   Despite the importance of these questions, they have not received much

     attention    in the literature. Among the exceptions are Dixit (1969,

     1971), Dixit and Stern (1974) and Newbery (1974). Also, some researchers

     have analyzed agricultural pricing using approaches based on consumer

     surplus; for example, Tolley, Thomas and Ming (1982). See Sah (1982b)

     for a discussion of the limitations of this approach.



7.   We are abstracting from migration and capital flows. With migration, as

     we shall see later, the utility of the peasant is also a function of the
     number of peasants in the agricultural sector. If there is capital flow,
     then the utility is also a function of the interest rate at which they
     can borrow and    lend.




8.   See Sah and Stlglitz (1984)    for a brief discussion of this evidence.


9.   This assumption can be easily relaxed by modelling endogenously
     determined labor hours.

                                        —38--
10. Here we assume that the quantities of the agricultural and industrial

     goods traded with the rest of the world change in response to the
                                                                                              change
     in domestic prices. The situation in which this is not the case can be

     worked out according to the methodology developed in Sah and Stiglitz

     (198 3a).

    instantaneous value of the time discounted additive social welfare.



14. The expressions (8) and (9) are the first order conditions of optimality

    with respect to p and q. To obtain these we have made use of workers'

    budget constraints and of the investment equation (3). Also, we have

    used Roy's formula:




       —AQ ,and    1           3V2         22


    Clearly, one needs to verify that the second order conditions are

    satisfied; they can not be taken for granted [see Atkinson and Stiglitz

    (1980, p. 374)], An internal optimum might be particularly problematic

    for q, since It requires (in the present model) B2/ > i —                              which
    need not be satisfied, for example, j                    + 0,    and        (   1.   In part,



                                            —39—
    this unrealistic possibility arises because (for simplicity) we have          not
    as yet taken into account some important constraints, such as those due

    to the wage—productivity relationships. We return to this issue later.



15. These and other conclusions presented in this paper hold at any point in

    time. A separate issue is to trace the time path of prices and other

    variables; this is beyond the scope of the present paper.



16. Recall, however, that the choice of peasants' labor hours is endogenous

    in the present problem, and also that the value of their output is

    influenced by a change in p. These elasticities, c            and
                                                             Xp          xp
    therefore, are not the standard partial elasticities.

19. Differences in the ownership of assets other than land can           be

     incorporated     by building in the markets for these assets. Also, we

     consider here a single type of agricultural labor. Its generalization to

     a multitude of skill types is straightforward.



20. The sum of weights in the numerator adds up to the denominator since,

     from the rural labor market clearing condition,              = 0.   Obviously,
                                                         h
           = 0, in the special case in which everyone is identical.




                                         —40—
21. See the weights proposed by Feldstein (1972), Diamond (1975) and Atkinson

    and Stiglitz (1976). The difference arises because these papers assume

    that the government can impose wage taxes, so the wages received by

    individuals need not depend on commodity taxes.



22. Further, by contrasting (14) and (15), note that the wage elasticity term

    does not appear in (15). This is simply because at present we are

    assuming that industrial wages are fixed.     In more general models, such

    as those discussed later in Section IVF, there would be wage elasticity

    terms in the expressions analogous to (15).



23. At present we are abstracting from the differences between capital inputs

    and intermediate inputs and between traded and non—traded goods. We

    return to these issues later. Also, note that the same good sometimes

    belongs to more than one category; for example, tractors are employed in

    agricultural production as well as in personal transportation.



24. In practice, there are some ambiguities in the precise geographical

    definition of such a border, since agricultural activities are sometimes

    undertaken on the fringe areas of cities which fall under cities' tax

    jurisdiction.



25. This somewhat overstate the constraints on the government. The

    government can (and frequently does) attempt to impose taxes and

    marketing controls on intrasectoral transactions. One of the

    implications of such intervention is to encourage individuals to avoid

    making use of formal markets, so that the taxes can thus be avoided.



                                    —41—
    This implication is discussed later in Section V.



26. In (3), Y would now denote the value of the entire set of industrial

    outputs, measured at the international prices. Also,   the   numeraire good

    here is any one of the pure consumption goods produced in the industrial

    sector, of which the quantity consumed by a peasant is y'. The expansion

    of x2 and q as vectors should be obvious.



27. The superscript U denotes that the quantity under consideration is a

    compensated quantity. The Slutsky relationship in the present



    context        Q1   =   Qi    — Q•   ____
              is
                   p.       3p.      j aM



28. It can be further extended to deal with the intra—sectoral income

    distribution by following the approach discussed earlier.



29. Obviously, one also needs to take into account the functioning of credit

    markets. In the presence of a rental market for agrictiltural machinery,

    however, it is not obvious that the conclusions advanced here would be

    necessarily changed.



30. In fact, ixj..ich of the growth economics literature focussed exclusively on

     the industrial sector, implicitly ignoring the possibility of investing

     in the agricultural sector. [Among the exceptions are: Dixit (1969),

     Newbery (1972) and Stern (1972)]. The prevalent notion in these

     approaches was that the potent'ial for investment in agriculture is small,

     if not negligible, compared to that In industry. Such a view is



                                            —42—
    apparently not supported by the historical experience. Kuznets (1961),

    among others, shows that the investment in agriculture was in fact larger

    than that in industry in certain phases of the development of the

    present—day industrial economies.



31. Some other consequences of pricing are also worth noting. For example,

    if some   of   the investment goods in the agricultural sector are non—traded

    goods produced within the agricultural sector (such as labor intensive

    road construction), then the government would have to take into account

    the effect of its pricing of agricultural inputs and outputs on the costs

    of such investment goods. Similarly, if some of the Investment decisions

    are made by peasants, and if the government's evaluation of the benefits

    from these decisions differs from that of the peasants, then the

    government would have to take into account the impact of its pricing

    policies on these private investment decisions.



32. The importance of quality differences, though obvious to those who buy

    and sell goods, has not received sufficient attention from economists,

    particularly in the context of policy making. In the extreme case, there

    are countries (like Nepal and Bangladesh) in which most of the

    potentially tradeable consumer goods are of sufficiently low quality that

    there is virtually no external trade in theni. If, in addition, it

    happens that these countries face foreign sales constraints in other

    tradeable goods (like primary    agricultural   commodities), then the actual

    traded quantities would be nearly insensitive (at the margin) to pricing

    policies. In determining optimal prices, therefore, such countries must

    necessarily be treated almost like closed economies.



                                       —43—
33. Specifically, those elements of the vector P which correspond to non—

    traded goods, will be replaced by the vector r/c5, where elements of the

    vector n are the Lagrange multipliers to the market clearing conditions

    of different non—traded goods.



34. Further, those non—traded goods which are not taxed are treated in the

    same manner as agricultural labor which, of course, is a non—traded, non—

    taxed commodity.



35. In Sah and Stiglitz (1983a, 1983b), we develop not only a general model

    of   migration but also a general model of industrial wage determination.
    These models    can be specialized to various hypotheses concerning

    migration (such as no migration, free migration with no unemployment, and

     the Harris—Todaro migration hypothesis in which the expected utility of

     the marginal migrant is equal in the two sectors), and to alternative

    hypotheses concerning industrial wage determination (such as the

     conventional hypothesis of marginal productivity, and those hypotheses

    which entail wage effects on labor productivity, labor quality and labor

    turnover).



36. In (19), the industrial wage is fixed in terms of industrial goods.

    Also, the level of Industrial employment is fixed, since it is derived

     from an equalization of the wage and the marginal product of labor.

    These assumptions are being made here solely for brevity, as should be

     obvious from the previous footnote. Further, for simplicity, we have

     ignored   the consumption of unemployed workers.



                                       —44—
37.     =   [w(v')   — W(VU) —
                                 'PXaa1mp/6Q     c
      where Vu is the utility of an unemployed worker, a is the agricultural

      land per peasant, Xa =           is   the marginal output (per peasant) with
                                   3ZnN
      respect to a, and m                   is the elasticity of rural population with

      respect to the rural price. We assume V > V > V $            i.e.,    industrial

      workers are better off than peasants, who in turn are better off than

      those who are unemployed. We also assume agricultural land is not too

      congested. Specifically, the last assumption means that aX is

      small, and that CQ =                  (which is the elasticity of agricultural
      surplus per peasant with respect to the land per peasant) is smaller than

      one. Now, note in the expression for             that the square bracket

      represents the net welfare gain if one unemployed worker iigrates to the

      agricultural sector. This net gain is positive due to the above

      assumptions.



38. This follows from the previous footnote, and from



       CQ =          + (1 —
              CQp             cQa)mp


      in which it is assumed that the agricultural population increases if the

      price of agricultural surplus is higher, i.e., m > 0.                This assumption

      is automatically satisfied under the Harris—Todaro migration hypothesis

      which we discuss in a moment.



39. This is the well known Harris—Todaro migration hypothesis. For



                                               —45—
      simplicity, we assume here that the social welfare function is

      utilitarian, i.e.,        = A1     The main implication of the Rarris—Todaro

      hypothesis then is that: H = NV1 + 51, instead of (7). The

      corresponding result holds, therefore, in all those circumstances in

      which the government is concerned with the rural welfare alone.



40.   Pricing in    the industrial sector in the presence of   endogenous migration
      can be   analyzed in the same manner as above. Also, it is worthwhile

      noting   here that the   rules   of price reform derived earlier in   the paper

      hold   with   some modifications in the present case as well. For example,

      the rule for reform in rural price, (4), holds in the present case        if
             is replaced by
       CQp



41. See Stiglitz (1976, 1982a).



42. See footnote 35.



43. This representation is consistent with a hypothesis that the productivity

      depends on the level of worker's utility. It is also consistent with a

      hypothesis that the productivity may be more closely related to food

      consumption than to the consumption of other goods.



44. Expression (24) points out that the urban food price should not be

      increased beyond a point (even if the government does not care about the

      welfare of industrial workers), since the resulting decline in workers'

      productivity will make it unattractive to do so. Also, the possibility

      of a corner solution (in which the optimum urban food price is

    excessively high) is remote when effects such as that of consumption on

    productivity are taken into account (in contrast to the basic model in

    which these effects were ignored; see footnote 14).



45. See footnote 35 on the extensions in the modelling of the industrial

    sector and the migration mechanism. Further, in Sah and Stiglitz

    (1983b), we analyze pricing under a more general international trade

    environment than the one in this paper.



46. See Sah (1983b) for a methodology for analyzing intra—household

    allocations.



47. This point has been missed in some of the earlier literature which has

    concluded that there always exist government policies which would result

    in an elimination of unemployment. This conclusIon, in turn, has

    sometimes led to a belief that since the government can eliminate

    unemployment, it would do so. Consequently, unemployment must

    necessarily be a short run phenomenon which can be ignored in a long run

    policy analysis. These views are clearly misleading if the endogenelty

     of wages is taken into account.



48. See Solow and Stiglitz (1968) and Benassy (1975), for example.



49. For example, suppose that the employment in the present period can be

     substantially reduced through tax instruments but this leads, in the

     future periods, to a significant difference between the market wage and

     that wage which would have cleared the market. Leaving the present



                                       —47—
      unemployment unaltered, on the other hand, leads to market wage clearing

      the market in the future periods. Then there is a trade—off between the

      social costs of present high unemployment versus that of distortions in

      the future periods.

51. This is the problem of price scissors. In this case, there is only one

      relative price (of agricultural and industrial goods) in the economy.

      For an analysis of price scissors in a closed economy, see Sah and

      Stiglitz (1984). Its extension to an open economy is straightforward, as

      can be seen in Sah and Stiglitz (1983a).



52.   In any event, the nature of tax problem remains essentially unchanged

      even in a hypothetical situation in which land rents could be entirely

      taxed away. For comments on this issue, see Sah and Stiglitz (1983b).



53. For a modern analysis of some of the classical views on the land tax, see

      Feldstein (1977).



54. See Sah (1982a).



55.   In Figure 1, this would be the case if the economy is already on the

      utility possibilities frontier, and if the projection of the frontier on

      the (V1, V2) plane is 'small'. Further, the conclusions drawn in the

      paper would also hold if a significant redistribution requires such

      taxation (nearly infinite tax rate on luxuries, for example) that the

      government would not adopt It.
