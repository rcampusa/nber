                                              ABSTRACT

This paper estimates the impact of armed conflict on subsequent health outcomes using detailed geographic
information on households’ distance from conflict sites—a more accurate measure of conflict exposure—
and compares the impact on children exposed in utero versus after birth. The identification strategy
relies on exogenous variation in the conflict’s geographic extent and timing as well as the exposure
of different birth cohorts while in utero or after birth. Results show that war-exposed children subsequently
have lower height-for-age Z-scores, and impacts using GPS information are 87-188% larger than if
exposure is measured at the imprecise regional level. Effects of in utero and after birth exposure are
comparable in magnitude, and children in the war instigating and losing country (Eritrea) suffer more
than the winning nation (Ethiopia). Results are robust to including region-specific time trends, alternative
conflict exposure measures, and addressing potential bias due to selective migration.

1. Introduction
Environmental and economic shocks experienced in utero and during early childhood have been

shown to be especially harmful not only because they may affect health outcomes in the short-

term but also because they may influence health and economic outcomes in adulthood (see

reviews by Strauss and Thomas, 2008; Currie and Vogl, 2013).1 However, determining the

causal effects of early life shocks on subsequent outcomes in a convincing manner has proven to

be challenging, due partly to limitations in available data and suitable identification strategies.

        The possibility that early-life growth disturbances might affect future health outcomes is

particularly relevant in sub-Saharan Africa, where armed conflict has occurred with greater

frequency than in other regions of the world. Nearly 70 percent of all countries in sub-Saharan

Africa have experienced an armed conflict since 1980 (Raleigh et al., 2010). In many cases,

particularly in Africa, the conflicts are started or exacerbated by territorial disputes.2 Despite the

casualties and destruction caused by conflicts and the potential for such shocks to affect various

indicators of well-being, the impacts of conflict on health have only recently started to receive

attention in the literature.3 One challenge in this literature has been that most datasets are

imprecise in identifying which households were exposed to conflicts.



1
  Research exploring the impact of shocks has focused on different adverse events including malnutrition (Case et
al., 2005; Maluccio et al., 2009; Maccini and Yang, 2009; Almond and Mazumder, 2011), famine (Dercon and
Porter, 2010), conflict (Bundervoet et al., 2009; Akresh et al., 2011; Akresh et al., 2012; Mansour and Rees, 2012;
Akbulut-Yuksel, 2014; Valente, forthcoming), diseases and epidemics (Almond, 2006; Bleakley, 2007; Bhalotra and
Venkataramani, 2012), natural disasters and extreme weather events (Currie and Rossin-Slater, 2013; Aguero, 2014;
Caruso, 2014a, 2014b; Rosales-Rueda, 2014), and pollution (Currie et al., 2009; Nilsson, 2009).
2
  The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook (2014) lists over 187 regions in the world that have disputes
over international land or sea boundaries or have resource or resident disagreements; 50 of these are in Africa.
3
  Seminal work on conflict focuses on understanding the causes and spread of war and its role in reducing growth
(Collier and Hoeffler, 1998; Miguel et al., 2004; Do and Iyer, 2010; Harari and La Ferrara, 2013; Burke et al.,
2014). The magnitude of conflicts long-term negative economic consequences are debated in the literature (see
Davis and Weinstein (2002) for Japan; Brakman et al. (2004) for Germany; Bellows and Miguel (2009) for Sierra
Leone). A growing literature examines the relationship between conflict and education outcomes (Akresh and de
Walque, 2008; Miguel and Roland, 2011; Shemyakina, 2011). Research focusing only on soldiers finds negative
impacts on their earnings, and soldiers exposed to more violence face a harder time reintegrating into civilian
society (Angrist, 1990; Blattman and Annan, 2010).


                                                                                                                 2
         This paper studies the effects of the 1998-2000 Eritrea-Ethiopia conflict on the future

health status of children by using survey data from both countries that contain information on the

geographic location of households and taking advantage of variation in the timing of the conflict

with respect to when children were born. By using geographic location data, the paper identifies

the effect of conflict exposure in a more accurate way than previous work. Moreover, the paper

compares the health effects of in utero versus early childhood exposure to the conflict, thereby

assessing the relative importance of growth disturbances during these two critical periods. Lastly,

the paper explores several plausible mechanisms by which the conflict may have affected child

health, focusing in particular on the role of health-seeking behaviors such as antenatal care.

         The 1998-2000 Eritrea-Ethiopia conflict was based on a territorial border dispute

between the two countries.4 When Eritrea, formerly a province of Ethiopia, became independent

in 1993 following a long guerrilla conflict, sections of the new border were never properly

demarcated. Full-fledged fighting began in May 1998 over these areas, which have been

described as desolate and inconsequential. More than 300,000 troops were dug in and

deadlocked on both sides of the border. Most of the conflict’s casualties were soldiers, since

most civilians left the conflict-torn areas, leaving the armies to fight over empty villages. The

availability of Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data that were collected in both countries

in the years following the conflict (Eritrea in 2002; Ethiopia in 2000 and 2005) provides a unique

opportunity to study the effects of this conflict on subsequent health outcomes of children. The

primary outcome that we study is the height-for-age Z-score, which is likely to capture lingering

effects of any growth disturbances that may have occurred earlier in life during the conflict.

4
  In the past 35 years, border wars were fought in Africa (Djibouti and Eritrea in 2008, Mauritania and Senegal
starting in 1989, Burkina Faso and Mali in 1985, Ethiopia and Somalia in 1982), Asia (Cambodia and Thailand in
2008, India and Bangladesh in 2001, Israel and Lebanon starting in 2000, India and Pakistan in 1999, Thailand and
Laos starting in 1987, India and China in 1987, Pakistan and India starting in 1984, Iran and Iraq starting in 1980,
Vietnam and China starting in 1979), and South America (Ecuador and Peru in 1995, Ecuador and Peru in 1981).


                                                                                                                       3
         This paper makes two main contributions to the literature on the impacts of shocks on

children’s welfare and goes significantly beyond previous research that examined the effects of

the Eritrea-Ethiopia conflict but only on child outcomes in Eritrea (Akresh et al., 2012). First, to

identify the impact of conflict-related shocks, the paper addresses the traditional difficulty in

correctly classifying a child’s exposure. Whereas a typical approach is to compare large regions

that did and did not experience fighting, in this paper we use global positioning system (GPS)

data on the distance between survey villages and conflict sites to accurately measure the likely

exposure that a child had to the conflict. With this approach, in Eritrea, 24% of households

within 100 kilometers (km) of the conflict sites had been previously coded as being in non-war

regions, while in Ethiopia, 28% of households within 100-300 km of the conflict sites had been

previously coded as being in non-war regions and 2.2% of households that were more than 300

km from the conflict sites were coded as being in a war region. We show that this approach

makes a difference in the estimated effects of conflict, with households living closer to conflict

sites having 87-188% larger impacts than if imprecise regional measures of exposure are used.5

         Second, because of the fortuitous timing of the household survey data collection, we are

able to explore whether effects of the conflict differ between children who were in utero at the

time of the conflict and those who were in early childhood. Much of this research on the fetal

origins hypothesis follows seminal work by Barker (1995). There are a number of reasons why in

5
  The contributions highlighted here are also the key differences between our paper and the most closely related
prior work by Akresh et al. (2012) who explore the impact of this same war on health outcomes but only for children
in Eritrea. In particular, being able to accurately locate a child’s household due to GPS data ensures that we correctly
measure the child’s war exposure and address the shortcomings in previous research. While that previous research
found that correcting for a household’s war-time migration across regions led to estimated negative impacts that are
13% larger, we find that taking into account how far the household is from the conflict leads to estimated negative
impacts of war exposure that approximately double in Eritrea and triple in Ethiopia in magnitude. Due to data
limitations, it is unfortunately not possible to correct for both the war-time migration across regions and the GPS
distance to the conflict, but it is clear that the GPS correction is significantly larger. In addition, the current paper
measures the welfare impacts for both sides involved in the conflict, thereby providing a more comprehensive and
robust understanding of how winning or losing such conflicts affects children’s well-being. We are able to examine
whether conflict-exposed individuals in Ethiopia, which won the conflict, suffer smaller health consequences than
conflict-exposed individuals in Eritrea.


                                                                                                                       4
utero exposure may be harmful to child health. These include poorer maternal nutrition due to

disruptions in food supply or income shocks, a lack of adequate antenatal care, and the

possibility that the conflict reduced the number of deliveries in the presence of trained providers.

Our paper examines the relative importance of exposure during these two critical time periods,

something that has not been done in previous research on the effects of armed conflicts. Contrary

to other recent papers that report no later-life effects of shocks experienced in utero (Endara et

al., 2009; Maccini and Yang, 2009; Fletcher, 2014), a notable result in our paper is that

Ethiopian and Eritrean children exposed to the war in utero do have significantly lower heights.

       Our results indicate that several years after the conflict ended, there was a significant

reduction in the height-for-age Z-scores of children who resided in conflict-affected regions at

the time of the conflict. This effect increased with the number of months of conflict exposure; in

Eritrea, each month of exposure (in utero and after birth) resulted in a significant reduction in the

Z-score of -0.039 standard deviations while the corresponding effect in Ethiopia was -0.017

standard deviations. Based on the average number of months that children in the DHS samples

for the two countries were exposed to the conflict, these estimates translate into overall

reductions of 0.73 and 0.26 standard deviations, respectively. Classifying conflict exposure

based on GPS distance from conflict sites reveals that children nearest to the conflict sites

suffered even larger effects (1.37 and 0.76 standard deviations in Eritrea and Ethiopia,

respectively), and the negative impact diminished as distance from the conflict increased. These

results highlight the importance of measuring exposure to shocks with detailed geographic

information rather than region-based indicators. Lastly, results indicate that each month of

exposure in utero or after birth negatively impacts child height-for-age Z-scores and the

magnitude of the effects during both critical periods are comparable in size.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the

history of the Eritrea-Ethiopia conflict and sketches the spatial and temporal event data for the

most recent war. Section 3 describes the survey data used in the analysis and explains the key

variables. Section 4 describes the empirical identification strategy and Section 5 presents the

main results as well as robustness tests. Section 6 concludes.

2. Background on the Eritrean-Ethiopian conflict

The Eritrean-Ethiopian conflict lasted two years starting in 1998 and stemmed from a border

dispute. The two countries had a long history of conflict with each other prior to 1998. The post-

World War II period saw the former Italian colony of Eritrea become a region of Ethiopia, but

growing dissatisfaction with Ethiopian occupation led to a prolonged period of armed struggle by

the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front (EPLF) against the Ethiopian Marxist government. The

conflict against Ethiopia ended in 1991 and coincided with the end of the Ethiopian civil war in

which a coalition of rebel groups, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front

(EPRDF), overthrew the government and came to power under the leadership of Meles Zenawi.

Following a referendum in Eritrea in May 1993, the sovereign nation of Eritrea was formed with

the EPLF leader Isaias Afwerki as President (EPLF was later renamed the People's Front for

Democracy and Justice). The immediate period following Eritrean independence saw generally

friendly relations between Eritrea and Ethiopia, in part because the governments had fought

together against the previous Marxist government that formerly controlled Ethiopia.

       At the time of Eritrean independence, both countries claimed sovereignty over three

border areas: Badme, Tsorona-Zalambessa, and Bure (see Figure 1 for a regional map of Eritrea

and Ethiopia highlighting these three areas). Continued disputes in these three border areas

combined with larger conflicts over trade and other economic issues proved to be a major




                                                                                                    6
obstacle to maintaining peace between the two countries.6 In May 1998, fighting broke out

between Eritrean and Ethiopian soldiers and security police in the Badme area, which was under

Ethiopian control.7 Within a week, the Ethiopian Parliament declared war on Eritrea. Both

countries devoted substantial resources to growing their armies, augmenting their military

equipment, and fortifying their borders, which included digging extensive trenches. After the

initial period of intense conflict, heavy fighting resumed in February 1999 as Ethiopia

succeeded, despite high casualties, in retaking the border town of Badme, but the battles around

Tsorona-Zalambessa were not conclusive. Both sides initially rejected efforts by regional groups

to mediate an end to the conflict, but eventually a Cessation of Hostilities agreement was

brokered on June 18, 2000 and a 25-kilometer-wide demilitarized Temporary Security Zone was

established along the 1,000 kilometer Eritrea-Ethiopia border and patrolled by United Nations

peacekeeping forces. A final comprehensive peace agreement was signed December 12, 2000.8

         The exact timing and location of the conflict plays a key role in our empirical strategy for

identifying the effects of the conflict on child health. The conflict intensity varied across areas

within Ethiopia and Eritrea. Distance from the conflict sites was an important determinant of

conflict intensity. Areas far from the border zones experienced little or no fighting; whereas the

most intense clashes took place in the border areas near Badme, Tsorona-Zalambessa, and Bure.

While exact figures of the number of casualties due to the conflict are difficult to ascertain, most

estimates of the total number of fatalities, mainly among soldiers, range from 70,000-100,000

(Human Rights Watch, 2003).

6
  Eritrea’s independence in 1993 meant Ethiopia became a landlocked country, with implications for its trade and
economic organization.
7
  The Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission (2005) states, “The areas initially invaded by Eritrean forces…were all
either within undisputed Ethiopian territory or within territory that was peacefully administered by Ethiopia and that
later would be on the Ethiopian side of the line to which Ethiopian armed forces were obligated to withdraw in 2000
under the Cease-Fire Agreement of June 18, 2000.”
8
  The empirical analysis in this paper treats this as the date the war ended, but our results are consistent if we treat
June 2000, the date when the Cessation of Hostilities agreement was brokered, as the time when the war ended.


                                                                                                                       7
         Even though most casualties were soldiers, thousands of civilians were displaced and this

represented a central mechanism through which conflict may have affected child health.

Displaced households suffered large reductions in food production, asset losses, and had limited

access to clean water or health infrastructure. By late 1998, estimates suggest approximately

250,000 Eritreans had been internally displaced and another 45,000 Ethiopian citizens of Eritrean

origin were deported from Ethiopia (Global IDP Project, 2004a). The Eritrean government and

other observers estimate that during the conflict nearly 1.1 million Eritreans were internally

displaced, although this number declined substantially by the conflict’s end (Global IDP Project,

2004a). The Ethiopian government estimates that by December 1998, 315,000 Ethiopians were

internally displaced, with the two regions that border Eritrea (Tigray and Afar) having the

greatest number of internally displaced persons (IDPs). The United Nations Ethiopia Country

Team estimates that by May 2000 the number of IDPs in Ethiopia had risen to 360,000 (Global

IDP Project, 2004b).9 By most accounts, households directly affected by the conflict and those

that were internally displaced tended to be located closest to the areas of the clashes.

3. Data

3.1 Demographic and Health Surveys in Eritrea (2002) and Ethiopia (2000 and 2005)

Our analyses make use of three different waves of data from the DHS conducted in Eritrea and

Ethiopia. The DHS are nationally representative cross-sectional surveys that gather information

on demographic topics such as fertility, child mortality, health service utilization, and nutritional

status of mothers and young children. The 2002 Eritrea DHS collected detailed information on



9
  This level of conflict-induced displacement is typical, as currently 27.1 million individuals worldwide are IDPs
due to conflict. For example, during the last decade in Africa, the number of IDPs due to conflict reached 3.5 million
in Angola, 633,000 in Burundi, 200,000 in Central African Republic, 180,000 in Chad, 150,000 in Congo-
Brazzaville, 750,000 in Côte d’Ivoire, 3 million in Democratic Republic of Congo, 359,000 in Guinea, 600,000 in
Kenya, 450,000 in Liberia, 550,000 in Nigeria, 600,000 in Rwanda, 70,000 in Senegal, 1.3 million in Sierra Leone,
1.5 million in Somalia, 6.1 million in Sudan, 1.7 million in Uganda, and 1 million in Zimbabwe (IDMC, 2010).


                                                                                                                    8
the date of birth, GPS location, and height of 5,139 children under five born before, during, or

after the conflict with Ethiopia. The 2000 Ethiopia DHS collects similar information for 9,619

children under five, all of whom were born before or during the Eritrea conflict. To have a

control group of children in the conflict regions of Ethiopia who were not exposed to conflict, we

also use the 2005 Ethiopia DHS that has information for 4,217 children under five. Our analyses

rely on DHS data for information on health outcomes (described below) as well as other

individual and household characteristics of children including geographical information on their

residence at the time of the survey and in some cases during the time of the conflict.

3.2 Health outcomes

Since child height (conditional on age and gender) can be sensitive to past growth failures due to

malnutrition or illness, it is generally accepted as a good way to capture long-term health

disturbances (World Health Organization, 1995). Using anthropometric information contained in

the DHS for children 0-60 months of age, we compute Z-scores for each child’s height-for-age,

where the Z-score is defined as the difference between the child’s height and the mean height of

the same-aged international reference population, divided by the standard deviation of the

reference population. Our analysis also examines other information on health behaviors and

health outcomes to better understand mechanisms by which conflict may influence height-for-

age Z-scores. In particular, we examine data on hospital deliveries, maternal postpartum

amenorrhea, self-reported birth size, and vaccinations.

3.3 Measures of conflict exposure

We construct three measures of a child’s exposure to the Eritrea-Ethiopia conflict. The first is a

continuous measure of the number of months of conflict exposure and is defined at the region-

birth cohort level. This allows us to exploit variation across two dimensions: spatial (variation




                                                                                                     9
across regions in exposure to the conflict) and temporal (within a given region, the timing of

whether a child was in utero or early childhood during the conflict period). Specifically, we use

information on a child’s region of residence and date of birth to calculate the number of months

the child was exposed to the conflict in utero (defined as 9 months prior to the date of birth) and

the number of months a child was exposed to the conflict after birth. The exposure measure is set

to zero months if the child resided in a region that was not affected by the conflict. As we

discussed in Section 2, the fighting was centered on the border regions near the three towns of

Badme, Tsorona-Zalambessa, and Bure, so in Eritrea, the conflict regions are defined as Gash

Barka, Debub, and Debubawi Keyih Bahri, while in Ethiopia they are Tigray and Afar.

       Since conflict-induced displacement was an important mechanism through which the

conflict impacted child health, we also incorporate direct measures of the number of IDPs in

each region to proxy for the conflict’s intensity. The IDP data come from the United Nations

Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) in Eritrea and Ethiopia. All of

the IDPs are clustered in the three conflict regions in Eritrea and the two conflict regions in

Ethiopia (Global IDP Project 2004a, b). Specifically we use the number of IDPs in each region

as a proportion of the region’s pre-war population as a measure of conflict intensity.

       Lastly, to address potential measurement error that would wrongly misclassify children as

conflict-exposed because they live in a region that experienced fighting even if their village was

far from the conflict sites or would wrongly misclassify children as non-conflict exposed because

they live in a non-war region but were actually close to the conflict sites, we construct a third

measure of conflict exposure using GPS information on the residence location of children at the

time of the survey. Specifically, we calculate the distance from each survey village to the nearest

conflict site and classify exposure based on different distance bands of 0-100 kilometers (km),




                                                                                                    10
100-200 km, 200-300 km, and greater than 300 km. In creating this measure, we use distance to

the nearest conflict site even if it crosses region boundaries. The distance bands are then

interacted with the number of months of exposure to create the third conflict exposure measure.

4. Empirical Identification Strategy

Our approach to determining the effect of the Eritrean-Ethiopian conflict on child health relies on

an examination of how height-for-age Z-scores of children vary as a function of different

durations of exposure to the conflict and variation in the degree to which their area of residence

was affected by the conflict. We begin by estimating the following regression that includes

region and birth cohort fixed effects:

(1)

where HAZijt is the height-for-age Z-score for child i in region j who was born in period t, j are

region fixed effects, t are year of birth cohort fixed effects, Total Months of War Exposureijt

measures the total number of months a child was alive or in utero during the conflict period and

living in a war region (it equals zero for children in regions unaffected by the war), and ijt is a

random, idiosyncratic error term.10 The regression also includes household and individual level

controls (Xij), such as child gender and household head schooling. In addition, to address the

potential for differential time trends in height-for-age Z-scores across regions, the regressions

include region-specific time trends (          ). The coefficient 1 measures the effect of an additional

month of exposure to the conflict on children’s height-for-age Z-scores. It is important to

emphasize that identification of the effect of the conflict in this model comes from variation in

the duration of exposure (conditional on adjustments for age cohort effects) rather than a simple

comparison of conflict and non-conflict regions.

10
  Using pre-war poverty data for all regions in Eritrea and Ethiopia, we also confirm that the results in the paper are
similar when non-war regions are limited to those with similar pre-war poverty levels as the war regions.


                                                                                                                    11
       We also examine if the conflict effect differs based on how long a child was exposed

while in utero or after birth. We estimate the following regression building on Equation (1):

(2)



where Months War Exposure In Uteroijt measures the number of months a child was in utero

during the war period and living in a war region and Months War Exposure After Birthijt

measures the number of months a child was alive during the war and living in a war region.

       Residence in a conflict region alone does not capture the size of the disruptions caused by

the conflict. To address this, we consider an alternative definition of conflict exposure that

measures the number of IDPs in each region as a proportion of the region’s pre-war population.

As war-induced displacement was likely an important channel through which conflict impacted

child health, this measure will proxy for the war’s intensity in that region. The war intensity

variable is interacted with total months of war exposure described above. Identification comes

from variation across regions with different numbers of IDPs as well as variation in the duration

of exposure to the conflict. We estimate the following regression incorporating IDP data:

(3)



We also estimate modified versions of Equation (3) in which the effect of the conflict varies

based on the number of months of exposure in utero and after birth.

       In defining conflict exposure based on living in one of the three regions in Eritrea or two

regions in Ethiopia where fighting took place – or even on the basis of the number of IDPs in

each region – there is a potential for wrongly classifying villages far from the conflict sites as

conflict exposed (and vice versa in the case of villages in non-conflict regions that are



                                                                                                     12
nonetheless close to conflict sites). This can result in biased estimates as some regions extend

many kilometers from the conflict sites (see Afar in Ethiopia and Debubawi Keyih Bahri in

Eritrea). Likewise, we might be excluding households close to conflict sites that may have been

affected by conflict but were actually in a non-conflict defined region (see Semenawi Keyih

Bahri in Eritrea). To more accurately measure a child’s conflict exposure, our empirical strategy

takes advantage of information on the distance of each survey village to the conflict sites. We

test for the effect of each additional month of exposure to the conflict in three different distance

categories (with a fourth category, greater than 300 km, serving as the reference group):

(4)                                                                                           0    100

                                                                 100      200

                                                                                    200     300

where Total Months War Exposure 0-100 km measures the number of months a child was alive

or in utero during the war period and living within 0-100km from the conflict sites, with the

other exposure variables defined similarly but for different distances from the conflict sites.11

        Our empirical analysis includes several extensions to the regressions above as well as

robustness checks. Since the main regression results are based on a child’s residence at the time

of the survey, there is a possibility of bias due to children having resided elsewhere during the

time of the conflict. We take two approaches to addressing this issue. First, all children from

households that reported having lived elsewhere during the war are reclassified as residing in a

war region.12 This is a conservative approach to dealing with the bias due to endogenous

migration as some of these children who moved during the war and currently reside in a non-war

11
   In robustness checks discussed in Section 5.2 and Appendix Table 4, we also examine a child’s war exposure that
is based on a continuous distance measure and results are consistent.
12
   This involves reclassifying 10.9% and 5.9% of children in Eritrea and Ethiopia, respectively. In Eritrea (but not
Ethiopia), we have data on the region of residence at the time of the conflict, and we can tell that only 3.9% of
children should have been reclassified instead of 10.9%.


                                                                                                                 13
region might have been living in another non-war region during the war. Second, in Eritrea, we

use actual information contained in the survey on the region of residence at the time of the

conflict and examine what happens to the results when this re-classification is done.

5. Empirical Results

5.1 Difference-in-Differences Estimation (War region and Geospatial location)

Table 1 provides summary statistics for the children in the analysis broken down by whether the

child lived close to the conflict sites (0-100 km) or farther away (more than 100 km). In Ethiopia

and Eritrea, children residing close to conflict sites have lower Z-scores than those residing

farther away, although the difference is statistically significant only in Ethiopia. Children near

the conflict sites are also worse off in other ways, as indicated by the lower schooling attainment

of household heads. Since the regions affected by the conflict tended to be worse off even prior

to the conflict, it is important to not simply compare the height-for-age Z-scores of children in

war-affected and war-unaffected regions when seeking to determine the impact of the conflict.

         The results from our initial attempt to examine the impact of the conflict after including

region fixed effects and controlling for age, individual, and household characteristics are

reported in Table 2. Specifically, we present the results of estimating Equations (1) and (2) for

Ethiopia (panel A) and Eritrea (panel B).13 In the first two columns, each child's residence is

classified according to the region of residence at the time of the DHS. In columns 3 and 4, the

child's residence is classified as the potential region of residence at the time of the conflict,

whereby any child who moved during the conflict is assigned to the conflict regions. In columns


13
  In all of the regressions, we include child age fixed effects, region fixed effects, region-specific time trends, DHS
round fixed effects (for Ethiopia), child gender, and the following household characteristics: household head’s
gender, age, years of schooling, mother’s height, number of members in the household, number of children in the
household under age 5, and whether the household resides in an urban area. Correlation among the error terms of
children living in the same local environment and experiencing similar health shocks might bias the OLS standard
errors downward, so in all regressions we cluster the standard errors by enumeration area, which corresponds to
local clusters of villages (Moulton, 1986).


                                                                                                                     14
5 and 6, using data that is only available for Eritrea, the child's residence is classified as their

known region of residence at the time of the conflict to accurately capture conflict exposure.

Column 1 of Table 2 shows that for children exposed to the conflict in utero or after birth, each

additional month of exposure results in a significant reduction of height-for-age Z-scores (by

0.017 in Ethiopia and 0.039 in Eritrea). When children’s exposure is classified on the basis of

their potential residence at the time of the conflict (column 3), the effects on height-for-age Z-

scores remain similar (-0.014 in Ethiopia and -0.040 in Eritrea) and continue to be statistically

significant. This indicates our results are robust to an extremely conservative adjustment for

migration during the conflict. In Eritrea, the results based on classifying residence as the region

in which the child resided at the time of the conflict (column 5) also shows a similar effect size

to that obtained when residence is classified as the region of residence at the time of the survey.

        Another important result in Table 2 pertains to the distinct effect of exposure to the

conflict in utero as opposed to early childhood. In both Ethiopia and Eritrea, we find that the

effects of exposure after birth are larger (reductions in the Z-scores of 0.019 and 0.047 for each

month of exposure in Ethiopia and Eritrea, respectively), although we cannot reject equality in

Eritrea. In Ethiopia, there is no statistically significant effect on height-for-age Z-scores of in

utero exposure to conflict. In contrast, in Eritrea, in utero exposure does result in a significant

reduction of Z-scores, by 0.034 for each month of exposure. In summary, Table 2 (focusing on

exposure at the region level) provides evidence that exposure to the conflict after birth is

associated with significant negative effects on height-for-age Z scores. To interpret these results

more easily, it is helpful to consider as an example the effects of children exposed to the conflict

for 9 months in utero or 9 months after birth: a child in Eritrea exposed to the conflict for 9




                                                                                                       15
months in utero experienced a reduction of 0.306 in their height-for-age Z-score whereas a child

exposed to the conflict for 9 months after birth experienced a reduction of 0.423 in their Z-score.

         An alternative measure of conflict exposure that we discussed in Section 3 is the intensity

of the conflict in the child’s region of residence. Estimating a model based on this measure

(Equation 3) produces results in Table 3 that are largely consistent with those reported in Table

2. It is in the regions most affected by the conflict – as measured by the proportion of IDPs – that

children experience the largest setbacks to their growth. Each month of exposure reduces the

height-for-age Z-scores of children, and this impact increases as a function of conflict intensity

in the region. The main results, based on residence at the time of the survey, indicate that an

increase of 1 percent in the IDP proportion of a region’s population reduces the height-for-age Z-

scores by 0.0017 and 0.0015 for each month of total exposure (in utero and after birth) in

Ethiopia and Eritrea, respectively.14 The effects are similar when residence is based on

classifying all children who migrated as having been in conflict regions. When the effects of the

conflict are allowed to differ as a function of exposure in utero and after birth (column 2), we

find statistically significant effects of exposure after birth in both countries.15

         Using geospatial data on the proximity of each household to conflict sites enables a more

careful examination of the ways in which the conflict affected children’s subsequent health

outcomes. Estimating regression models that use distance from conflict sites as the measure of

conflict exposure (Equation 4), we find that an additional month of exposure in utero or after

14
   These impacts are large and meaningful, especially when considering the number of IDPs in each country. In
Ethiopia and Eritrea, respectively, 8.6% and 21.1 % of the population in the war regions were IDPs. In Ethiopia, the
mean number of months of exposure for children in the DHS sample was 15.5; in Eritrea it was 18.8. Thus, a child
who experienced the conflict for the mean number of months in a region experiencing the average war intensity
would have 0.23 or 0.60 standard deviations lower height-for-age Z-scores in Ethiopia and Eritrea, respectively.
15
   It is also possible that households experiencing negative shocks sent out children to live with other relatives (see
Akresh (2009) for evidence on the link between negative shocks and child fostering). Although we do not have any
information in the survey about this, we are unable to tell which direction, if any, this might bias the results
depending on whether the most healthy or the least healthy child was fostered, but most of the child fostering
literature finds the rate of fostering for children under five to be extremely low.


                                                                                                                    16
birth significantly reduces the height-for-age Z-scores of children nearest to conflict sites by

0.049 in Ethiopia and by 0.073 in Eritrea (Table 4a, columns 1 & 2). Table 4a shows exposure at

any distance within 300 km of the conflict sites (relative to the reference group of children living

more than 300 km from the conflict sites) is negatively related to worse child outcomes.

Importantly, it also shows that within 300 km of the conflict sites, there is a decreasing gradient

in the effect of conflict as a function of distance from the conflict sites. The gradient is most

noticeable and statistically significant in Ethiopia, a much larger country than Eritrea and one in

which distance from the conflict sites is likely to have been more relevant for whether economic

and nutritional conditions – and consequently children’s health status – would be affected. As the

p-values at the bottom of Table 4a show, in Ethiopia the effect of being within 100 km of the

conflict sites is significantly larger than the effect of being 200-300 km away. This is not the case

in Eritrea, as the effect of conflict does not appear to decline as much with distance from conflict

sites. These results showcase the importance of geographical data for further illuminating the

effects of conflicts and accurately measuring the size of these effects.16

         In Table 4b, we separately examine the effect of exposure in utero and after birth and

results indicate that in the areas closest to conflict sites, both types of exposure result in negative

impacts on height-for-age Z-scores. This is true in both Ethiopia and Eritrea. Effects of in utero

and after birth exposure are roughly comparable in magnitude. While the estimates for Ethiopia

indicate smaller negative impacts in utero compared to after birth, we cannot reject equality of

the coefficients with p-values of 0.23, 0.29, and 0.81 for the three distance ranges, respectively.


16
   It is important to note the migration data in the DHS surveys is only at the region level. Therefore, to estimate the
regressions in columns 3 and 4 based on potential residence at the time of the war, we make the strong assumption
that any child who moved during the war is reassigned to the closest distance to the conflict sites (0-100 km). In
Ethiopia and Eritrea, respectively, 56% and 13% of the children within 0-100 km were reclassified as being close to
the war sites for columns 3 and 4 compared with columns 1 and 2. Results in Eritrea based on potential residence are
comparable as only a limited number of children were reclassified. In Ethiopia, negative impacts close to the conflict
sites are still statistically significant but are much smaller, since a larger fraction of children were reclassified.


                                                                                                                    17
        While the evidence so far suggests there are large and significant reductions in height-

for-age Z-scores as a result of conflict exposure, an important public policy and intra-household

resource allocation question is whether boys and girls are affected differently. With this in mind,

the results in Table 5 are noteworthy because they show remarkably similar negative impacts of

conflict exposure in both countries for boys as well as girls. The magnitude of the impact is

slightly larger for girls in Ethiopia and slightly larger for boys in Eritrea – but in neither case are

the differences statistically significant. The distance gradient within 300 km for conflict impacts

is noticeable for boys in both countries and girls in Ethiopia.

        As part of our analyses, we pool the Ethiopia and Eritrea data to directly compare the

effects of the conflict in the two countries. Specifically, we estimate a fully interacted model,

including interactions of all variables with an indicator variable for Eritrea. The results in

Appendix Table 1 indicate children from conflict regions in Eritrea – the war-instigating and

losing country – have significantly lower height-for-age Z-scores than children from conflict

regions in Ethiopia (in column 1, there is an additional impact of -0.023 in Eritrea for each

month of combined exposure in utero and after birth). This result holds even when we classify

residency based on potential residency during the conflict (column 3). When we examine the

separate effects of exposure in utero versus after birth (column 2), we again find that children in

Eritrea are more affected by the conflict. They have significantly lower height-for-age Z-scores

as a result of in utero exposure (0.043 lower for each additional month of conflict exposure) and

due to early childhood exposure (0.028 lower for each additional month of conflict exposure).

        A similar pattern emerges in the pooled data when we examine the effects of the conflict

based on distance from conflict sites. Appendix Table 2a shows that for each category of

distance from conflict sites, children in Eritrea have more negative effects on height-for-age Z-




                                                                                                     18
scores than children in Ethiopia. When we classify residency based on residence at the time of

the survey (column 1), the effect of each month of conflict exposure (in utero or after birth) on

the height-for-age Z-scores of children closest to the conflict sites in Eritrea is 0.024 larger than

in Ethiopia. Among children at intermediate or farther distances from conflict sites, the effects on

children in Eritrea are also significantly more negative.17

5.2 Robustness Checks

To determine whether the conflict effects are robust to a range of possibilities that could generate

biased results, in Appendix Tables 3-6 we present additional analyses. In Appendix Table 3, we

include mother fixed effects in the regression, which allows us to control for characteristics of

the child’s mother that do not vary across siblings. Identification is driven by comparing children

of the same mother, each of whom experienced different months of conflict exposure. In the

sample of households with multiple children under five, results indicate significant negative

effects for each month of conflict exposure for both Ethiopia and Eritrea for most distances from

the conflict, although the distance gradient is not as evident as before. Also in contrast to the

Table 4a results, the magnitude of the effects is smaller in both countries. In Appendix Table 4,

we define households’ proximity to the conflict sites on the basis of the relative distance within

the sample rather than the absolute distance.18 The results indicate that relative proximity – or

closeness –results in larger reductions in the height-for-age Z-score. The effect of relative

proximity is found for in utero exposure as well as exposure after birth.

         Another concern regarding the validity of the main estimates relates to the possibility that

fertility and mortality patterns may be different in areas that were exposed to the conflict with

17
   In Appendix Table 2b using pooled data, we highlight the different impacts for children exposed in utero and after
birth. Children exposed in utero experience larger negative impacts on height-for-age Z-scores in Eritrean than
Ethiopia for each of the proximity categories, but the effects of exposure after birth are similar in the two countries.
18
   Specifically, proximity is defined for each country as the maximum distance from the conflict site minus the
household’s actual distance to the conflict site.


                                                                                                                     19
varying severity. We examine fertility patterns by comparing characteristics of women based on

whether they had children during the conflict and their region of residence (Appendix Table 5).

There is relatively little evidence that women who had a child during the conflict and reside in a

war region are systematically different than other women. In Ethiopia, there is evidence that

taller women were more likely to have children in war regions during the conflict (an effect that

would only bias our main results downward). In Eritrea, there is evidence of an effect on the age

of women who had children, but this effect is likely to be too minor to influence the main results.

         In Appendix Table 6, we use DHS data on child mortality to examine whether conflict

exposure resulted in increased mortality. The results generally do not indicate a significant effect

on mortality, with the exception that in Ethiopia children exposed after birth and residing less

than 100 km from conflict sites had significantly higher mortality. This overall lack of

relationship between conflict exposure and mortality should be understood in the context of an

environment with already extremely high under-5 mortality (pre-war under-5 mortality rates in

Ethiopia and Eritrea are 162 and 105 deaths per 1000 live births, respectively). As deceased

children were likely those with poorer health (and possibly from poorer households), such a

result would only lead to a downward bias in the main results reported in the paper.19

5.3 Conflict Impact Mechanisms

Identifying specific reasons for the negative effects of conflicts on child health can be useful for

interpreting the main results of this paper and also developing better policies to prevent such

negative effects in the future. Displacement of households might be a key channel by which

children’s health status is affected, but the absence of detailed survey information on the

19
   An additional factor that could bias our results is also worth discussing briefly. Mismeasurement of a child’s age
would likely make our estimates lower bounds of the true impact, as parents would probably underreport the age of
short children making their malnutrition seem less severe than it is. Since the household roster collects the exact
birth date of all children in a household under five and misreporting on one child would be more difficult as it would
influence the birth dates of the household’s other children, such mismeasurement may be somewhat less likely.


                                                                                                                   20
movement of households limits our ability to examine this issue thoroughly. Many families were

internally displaced in both countries due to the conflict. Due to this, households could have been

directly worse off through loss of harvests and assets, disruption of businesses, and reduced

access to medicines, health clinics, and clean water. While the DHS data lack detailed

information on some of these reasons, in Table 6 we assess the impacts of the conflict on

relevant health-seeking behaviors and outcomes that are observed in the DHS data.20

        One possibility is that access to health services was reduced during the conflict. We

examine the conflict’s effects on the likelihood that children were delivered at a formal health

clinic or hospital where the risk of infections is lower and availability of personnel capable of

managing complications is higher. The results (column 1) indicate that in Ethiopia the conflict

had a negative impact on the likelihood of such delivery taking place. In Eritrea, the impacts are

negative but not statistically significant (though in regressions based on war regions, the impacts

are of the same magnitude and statistically significant). A second possibility is that prenatal

factors (including nutrition and maternal stress) were affected by the conflict and led to reduced

birth weight. Mothers were asked during the survey about the size of the child at birth, and we

examine an indicator reporting if the child was “very small.” In Ethiopia, children who were in

households close to conflict sites are more likely to have been very small at birth. In Eritrea,

however, we find no evidence of an effect on birth size. This is puzzling in light of the generally

larger impacts of the conflict on height-for-age Z-scores in Eritrea. Additional evidence that

mothers exposed to the conflict might have had worse nutrition or suffered more stress can be

seen in column 3, which shows that conflict exposure led to greater durations of postpartum

amenorrhea in mothers; these impacts were found in both Eritrea and Ethiopia (Aguirre, 1996).


20
  There could also be effects on children who were not displaced by the conflict but resided in areas with many
displaced individuals (Baez, 2011).


                                                                                                                  21
Finally, there is suggestive evidence that in Eritrea, children exposed to the conflict receive

fewer vaccinations in their first year of life. Overall, disruptions in the health care environment

(reductions in deliveries at clinics and reduced vaccination coverage) combined with greater

maternal stressors (higher amenorrhea and increased low birth weight children) are potential

mechanisms that could explain negative health effects observed for conflict-exposed children.

6. Conclusion

This paper quantifies the medium-term health consequences of the Eritrea-Ethiopia conflict

using a variety of different methods and conflict exposure measures. The findings show large

negative effects of the conflict on the height-for-age Z-scores of children exposed to the conflict.

Since children and households in a number of other resource-limited settings have been exposed

to conflicts that feature internal displacement and disruptions of health services, this paper has

relevance for the larger literature on the medium- and long-term effects of armed conflicts.

       The empirical methods used in this paper overcome several challenges to identifying the

causal effect of conflict exposure. We compare children exposed to the conflict for varying

durations and at different stages (in utero and after birth). We also classify children’s conflict

exposure on the basis of the geographical coordinates of their residence. We find the effects of in

utero and after birth exposure to the conflict are similar in magnitude, and children in the losing

country (Eritrea) suffer more than the winning country (Ethiopia). Focusing on the estimates of

children’s conflict exposure based on GPS distance from conflict sites indicates that the Eritrea-

Ethiopia conflict led to overall reductions of 0.76 to 1.37 standard deviations (approximately 1 to

2 inches) in Ethiopia and Eritrea, respectively, and the negative impact was reduced as distance

from the conflict sites increased. These effect sizes of conflict exposure defined in terms of

distance from conflict sites are approximately three- and two-fold higher (for Ethiopia and




                                                                                                      22
Eritrea, respectively) than the effect sizes of conflict exposure defined on the basis of politically

defined subnational units, which is the standard approach taken in much of the literature

examining impacts of conflict. As height-for-age Z-scores are considered important health

indicators of children and are associated with health and employment outcomes later in life, the

results in this paper offer insight on the likely long-term effects of the conflict. Using available

estimates of the effect of early childhood height on school attainment and wages, the results in

this paper suggest that the conflict may lead to reductions in adult wages of about 8% and 14% in

Ethiopia and Eritrea, respectively.21

        Understanding the detailed mechanisms by which conflicts affect the health of children

remains a challenge that future research will need to address. By examining several health-

seeking behaviors as well as indicators of maternal stressors, we found suggestive evidence that

conflict exposed children were less likely to be delivered at hospitals and received fewer

vaccinations in their first year of life, overall indicators that health service delivery might have

been compromised in the conflict areas. Furthermore, conflict exposure led to children being

more likely to be very small at birth and mothers being more likely to experience amenorrhea.

These disruptions in health care delivery and added maternal stressors are potential mechanisms

that could explain the negative height effects observed for conflict exposed children. From a

policy standpoint, these results suggest households may not have adequate coping mechanisms

for conflicts that disrupt economic conditions and lead to displacement, even if the number of

civilian casualties is limited. The results also reinforce the importance of considering medium-

and longer-term health consequences when designing and implementing post-conflict services.



21
  We base this rough back-of-the-envelope calculation on the estimate that a one standard deviation reduction in
height correlates with 0.678 fewer grades completed in Zimbabwe (Alderman et al., 2006) and that the return to an
extra year of school in Ethiopia is 15% (Krishnan et al., 1998).

residence at the time of the survey. In columns 3 and 4, the child's place of residence is based on the
potential region of residence at the time of the war, whereby any child who moved during the war is
reassigned to a war region regardless of residence at the time of the survey (i.e. for every child who
moved during the war and is currently residing in a non-war region, we reassign exposure status as if the
child had been living in a war region during the war). This is a conservative approach to dealing with the
bias due to endogenous migration as some children who moved during the war and currently reside in a
non-war region might have been living in another non-war region during the war. In columns 5 and 6, the
child's place of residence is based on the region of residence at the start of the war (information which is
only available in the Eritrea data). The war regions in Ethiopia are Tigray and Afar. The war regions in
Eritrea are Gash Barka, Debub, and Debubawi Keyih Bahri. “Total months of war exposure” measures
the number of months a child was alive or in utero during the war period and living in a war region.
“Months of war exposure in utero” measures the number of months a child was in utero during the war
period and living in a war region. “Months of war exposure after birth” measures the number of months a
child was alive during the war period and living in a war region. Data source: 2002 Eritrea and 2000 and

household characteristics. In addition, interactions of all of these variables with Eritrea were also included
in the regressions. In column 1, the child's place of residence is based on the region of residence at the
time of the survey. In column 2, the child's place of residence is based on the potential residence at the
time of the war, whereby any child who moved during the war is reassigned to the closest distance (0-100
km) regardless of residence at the time of the survey. “Months of war exposure in utero” measures the
number of months a child was in utero during the war period and living within 0-100 km, 100-200 km,
200-300 km, or more than 300 km respectively from the conflict sites. “Months of war exposure after
birth” measures the number of months a child was alive during the war period and living within 0-100
km, 100-200 km, 200-300 km, or more than 300 km respectively from the conflict sites. The reference
group is children living more than 300 km from the conflict sites. Data source: 2002 Eritrea and 2000 and
