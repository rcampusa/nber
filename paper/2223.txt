  Household Saving and Permanent Income in Canada and the United Kingdom




                                 ABSTRACT




     Recent theoretical research in open-economy macroeconomics has emphasized

the connection between a country's current account and the intertemporal

savings and investment choices of its households, firms, and governments. In

this paper, we assess the empirical relevance of the permanent income theory

of household saving, a key building block of recent theoretical models of the

current account. Using the econometric approach of Campbell (1987), we are

able to reject the theory on quarterly aggregate data in Canada and the

United Kingdom. However, we also assess the economic significance of these

statistical rejections by comparing the behavior of saving with that of an

unrestricted vector autoregressive (VAR) forecast of future changes in

disposable labor income. If the theory is true, saving should be the best

available predictor of future changes in disposable labor income. We find the

correlation between saving and the unrestricted VAR forecast to be extremely

high in both countries. The results suggest that the theory provides a useful

description of the dynamic behavior of household saving in Canada and Britain.

 1.    Introduction

       Recent theoretical research in open-economy macroeconomics has emphasized

 the connection between a country's current account and the intertemporal

 savings and investment choices of its households, firms, and governments

 (Buiter (1981), Sachs (1981, 1982), Dornbusch (1983), Frenkel and Razin

 (1985), Persson and Svensson (1983)). To the extent that national savings and

 investment patterns reflect forward looking behavior on the part of households

and firms which optimize in the absence of liquidity constraints, expectations

about future economic variables can significantly influence the magnitude and

persistence of current account deficits and surpluses observed in the present.

      The objective of this paper -is to assess the empirical relevance of the

permanent income theory of household saving, a key building block of recent

theoretical models of the current account. According to the permanent income

hypothesis, consumption is proportional to permanent income; it thus tends to

be above current income when current income is relatively low and expected to

rise, and to be below current income when current income is relatively high

and expected to fall. This intuitive observation has the striking and until

recently ignored econometric implication that household saving should be the

best available predictor of future changes in disposable labor income. Using

the econometric methodology developed in Campbell (1987), we test this

implication of the permanent income hypothesis on Canadian and British

quarterly aggregate data and compare our findings to those obtained by

Campbell for U.S. data.

      Our approach is to test cross-equation restrictions on the coefficients

of a bivar-iate vector autoregression (VAR) comprised of saving and changes -in
                                      —2—


disposable labor income. Thus, by contrast with most of the recent literature,

we do not directly test the consumption martingale property emphasized by Hall

(1978).

     In both the Canadian and British data, we find that saving Granger causes

changes in disposable labor income and that it is significantly negatively

correlated with the subsequent change in disposable labor income. This is

exactly what one would expect if the permanent income hypothesis is true,

since saving occurs because labor income is expected to decline in the future.

However, we are able to reject statistically the cross-equation restrictions

implied by the permanent income hypothesis. In the case of Canada, the

statistical rejection of the theory appears to result from the fact that the

mean of the unrestricted forecast of future changes in labor income differs

substantially from the mean of Canadian saving. In the case of Britain,

violations of the cross—equation restrictions implied by the theory are more

pervasive.

     To assess the economic significance of these statistical rejections of

the theory, we compare the behavior of saving in each country with that of the

unrestricted VAR forecast of future changes in disposable income. If the

permanent income hypothesis is true, saving and the unrestricted VAR forecast

should have identical standard deviations and should be perfectly correlated.

In fact, we find that the correlation between saving and the unrestricted VAR

forecast of future changes in disposable labor income is extremely high in

both countries, exceeding .89 in the British data and .99 in the Canadian

data. While the sample standard deviation of saving is somewhat less than the

standard deviation of the VAR forecast, time series plots of the two series
                                                        —3-


 for each country reinforce the impression conveyed by the correlation results

 that a substantial fraction of the forecastable variation in disposable labor

 income is incorporated in Canadian and British household saving behavior.

 Thus, even though it -is possible to reject the permanent income hypothesis at

 conventional levels of statistical significance, our results suggest that the

 theory provides a useful description of the dynamic behavior of household

 saving -in Canada and Britain. Our findings correspond quite closely to those

obtained by Campbell in              his   test of the permanent income hypothesis on U.S.

data.




2.        The Permanent Income Hypothesis




                                               EEy)
          Following Flavin (1981), we write the permanent income model as


(1)            Ct =   ''p ''kt
                             =             +



where c is real per capita consumption, y is permanent income, y is real

per-capita capital income, Yft is real per capita labor income, r -is the

expected real interest rate, and -y is the propensity to consume out of

permanent income. The model assumes that y and r are constant and that y                     1.

          Permanent income is defined as the Hicksian income generated by nonhuman

and human wealth. The Hicks-ian income from human wealth is r times the

present discounted value of expected labor income. The Hicksian income from

nonhuman wealth, W, is just kt =                   rW.    Wealth evolves according to
      =
          (1+r)W_1
                      +
                          y1     —
                                     c_1       +   so that capital income obeys


(2)           ykt -
                          (1+r)yk1
                                       —
                                           r[y21    —
                                                         c1] rrt;
                                                              =
                                                   —4-


where          represents unanticipated capital gains and is unforecastable as of

time t-1. Note that in general the conditional variance of                      will be

positively related to the level of wealth

        Our interest is in ascertaining and testing the restrictions which the

permanent income hypothesis places on saving behavior. Define transitory

income Tt as the difference between total disposable income,                         kt +
and permanent income                   which is defined in equation (1). Define saving, s,

as the difference between total disposable income and consumption:

           -
                   c.    If y =   1, so that consumption is equal to permanent income,
equation (1) can be rearranged so that it becomes a statement about saving.


                            -      =       = _(j                     -
(3)                s =                                                   yft]

                                           =   - E()'Etyjt+
where      denotes a standard backward difference.

        Equation (3) says that saving equals transitory income, which in turn can

be expressed as the expected present value of future declines in labor income.

It follows from (3) that


                                               =
(4)                s — '2t - (1+r)s_1

where          =
                    [h/(1)]1E0
                                   [1/(1+r)]'EEy1+. -     EtiYIt+]       is the unforecastable

revision from t—1 to t in the expected value of human wealth. Equation (4) is

not immediately intuitive, stating that a linear combination of the change in

labor income, current, and lagged saving is unforecastable. However,
                                            -5—



subtracting (4) from (2) and using the definition of s, we obtain Hall's

(1978) celebrated result that consumption is a random walk:


(5)         c —   c1 r[fl
                     =        +



      If y < 1, the above analysis needs to be modified. We can define a new

                         -
variable     as
                             c/y.     Equations (3) and (4) now apply to   rather

than s and we have


                                  =     +
(6)         s. s +                          (l-y)y.

Equation (6) says that people save their transitory income, and a fraction

(1—y) of their permanent income. Our approach is to evaluate the model by

examining

      Although tests of the permanent income hypothesis usually focus on the
consumption martingale implication given by equation (5), we shall adopt the

econometric methodology developed by Campbell (1987) which uses the

restriction on savings behavior given by equations (3) and (4) to assess the

empirical relevance of the theory. There are two main reasons for this

choice.

      First, the random walk behavior of consumption is only one implication of

the permanent income hypothesis. A time series can follow a random walk and

yet not be determined by permanent income (although such a series will not

obey the intertemporal budget constraint). Equations (3) and (4) directly

examine the relation between consumption and income.

      Secondly, the restriction on household saving behavior given by equation

(3) can be used to characterize the fit of the permanent income model. In the

context of the recent theoretical work in open-economy macroeconomics, it is
                                         -6-


worthwhile to investigate the extent to which the movements of household

saving incorporate forecastable variations in income, even        -- or   perhaps

especially --   if   the theory is statistically rejected.



3.   Econometric Methodology

     In this section we explain the econometric concepts and techniques which

we use to evaluate the permanent income model. We begin by discussing the

stationarity of the different variables in the model; then we show that the

model implies an intuitive set of restrictions on a stationary VAR; and

finally we discuss the estimation of nuisance parameters.

     If the permanent income hypothesis holds with y = 1 and changes in labor

income are stationary, then equations (2), (3) and (5) imply that consumption

and capital income are also stationary in first differences but that saving is

stationary in its level. This is because the theory restricts saving to equal

the discounted present value of expected changes in labor income; these

changes are stationary and thus so is saving.

     More formally, define the vector x = Evktl              ci]'. Each of the

elements of x. is stationary in first differences but a linear combination of

the elements, s. = El 1 -l]xt is stationary in its level. The vector x is

said to be cointegrated.


Definition (Granger and Engle, 1987). 4 vector x is said to be cointegrated

of order d,b denoted x CI(d,b) if (i) all components of x are integrated of

order d (stationary in d'th differences), and (ii) there exists at least one

vector     0) such that z. =    a'x   is integrated of order d - b, b >     0.
                                         —7—


      The vector a is called the cointegrating vector; it is unique up to a

scalar normalization and, in the present example, is proportional to

[1 1 -1]'. Stock (1987) proves that if there is a single unknown element of

a, a variety of methods provide estimates with a standard error which goes to

zero at a rate proportional to the sample size T (rather than 1/1).

Intuitively, all linear combinations of the elements of x other than

a'x have infinite variance because variables in a CI(1,1) vector share a

common stochastic trend (a Unit root) while exhibiting stationary deviations

from one another in the short run. The practical implication of this result

is that an unknown element of a may be estimated in a first-stage regression

and then treated as known in second stage procedures, whose asymptotic

standard errors will still be correct.

      If the propensity to consume is known --   or   assumed --   to   equal unity and

the economically relevant measure of consumption is observable, all elements

of a are known a priori. However, in the context of the permanent income

hypothesis, the relevant measure of consumption is consumption of nondurables,

services, and the services yielded by the existing stock of durable goods.

The latter is unobservable, and in what follows we shall postulate that

consumption, c, is proportional to the observed consumption of nondurables

and services,       so that c = Acnt.    In this case, the vector

x =    [y   y Cnt]' is CI(1,1) and the scale factor A can be estimated from

the cointegrating vector (1 1 -A] using Stock's theorem.

      If the permanent income hypothesis holds with '    < 1,   then from equations

(2) and (5), both kt and ct are explosive rather than stationary in first

differences and the vector     no longer satisfies the formal definition of
                                                  —8-



cointegration. However,                 still exhibits the key property that a linear

combination of its elements, s,, =            l   I. -A/y]x, is stationary. This follows

from equations (1) and (2) and the assumption that c =                     The linear

combination            can still be estimated precisely in a first stage regression

since it is the only linear combination with asymptotically finite variance.

Note, however, that with data only on                   the cointegrating vector identifies

only the ratio A/y. In the discussion which follows, we shall refer to

                -
      =
           y.       (X/y)c   as saving. If in fact the theory holds with

equals the difference between current saving and the fraction (1-y) of

permanent income; i.e.,                =   =s     -


          As we have seen the permanent income hypothesis implies that saving is

equal to the discounted present value of expected future declines in labor

income. Campbell (1987) shows that this can be tested as a set of

cross-equation restrictions on a bivariate VAR comprised of saving and changes

in disposable labor income. The test of restrictions on the VAR is, in fact,

equivalent to a single-equation regression test of equation (4), but the VAR

easily generates an optimal unrestricted forecast of future changes in labor

income. Because the VAR includes saving as a variable, the unrestricted

forecast should equal saving if the model is true; this can be used to

characterize informally the fit of the permanent income hypothesis.

          Consider the following VAR:

                          a(L) b(L)                     u1
(7)                   =

                5nt       c(L) d(L)                     u2

which can be rewritten in "companion" form as z. =                    + v. Note that, for
                                                               Azt1
all i, EEZt+iIHt) =                  where Ht is the information set (zt z_1, ...), a
                             A'zt,
                                               —9—


 proper subset of agents' information set I. As is common in empirical

 research, we take conditional expectations to be linear projections on

 information.

       If the theory is correct, 5nt is an optimal forecast of future changes in

 income conditional on the full information set               A weak implication is that

 Srt will have incremental explanatory power for future labor income changes if

 agents have information useful for forecasting labor income beyond the history

of that variable. 5nt must Granger cause                  unless agents have no useful

 information beyond the history of labor income, in which case Snt is an exact

 linear function of current and lagged changes in labor income.

       Projecting equation (3) onto the information set             and noting that the

left hand side is unchanged because s, is in Ht, we obtain the following set

of cross-equation restrictions on the matrix A.


(8)         g' =   -[1/(1+r)1h'A]

where g' and h' are row vectors with 2p elements, all of which are zero except

for the (p+1)5t element of g' and the first element of h'. These non—linear

cross-equation restrictions are in fact equivalent to the restriction that the

linear combination of the change in disposable labor income, current, and

lagged saving derived in equation (4) is orthogonal to lagged Yft and

       To see this, note that the right hand side of equation (8) can be

expressed as -h'1/(1+r)jA{I —           [1/(1+rflA)1.    Postmultiplying equation (8) by
(I -   [1/(1+r)]A),   we obtain


(9)        g'(I —     [1/(1+r)]A)   =   —h'[l/(l+r)]A.
                                                  -10-


Using the structure of the A matrix, the cross-equation restrictions defined

by equation (9) can be written as follows: a1 =
                                                                  c1,...,       a =   c,   d1 - b1 =

(1+r),       b2 =   d2,..., b = d.     Subtracting the              equation of the VAR from

the Snt equation, we obtain nt -                    = (c1—ai)y2,t_1         +   ...÷
                       +
                           (di_bi)Sn,t_i
                                           +
                                               (d2b2)Sn,t_2
                                                              +   . . . + (dpbp)sn,t_p          +


u1
       —
            u2.     Thus, if the theory is true, 5nt -               — (1÷r)s,_1           is

orthogonal to lagged               and s,. The implication is that a single-equation

regression test of equation (4) is equivalent to a test of (9). However,, the

VAR can be used to generate optimal unrestricted forecasts (conditional on

lagged              arid sot) of the discounted present value of future changes in labor

income. These forecasts can be compared with Snt to characterize the fit of

the permanent income model, since the theory predicts that the unrestricted

forecast and Snt should have identical standard deviations and should be

perfectly correlated.

           A weaker version of the permanent income hypothesis which allows for a

"transitory consumption" error in equation (2) can also be tested in this

framework, provided that the error is assumed to be orthogonal to all lagged

information. In this case, the theory restricts the conditional expectation

of saving, one period ahead, to equal the discounted present value of expected

future declines in labor income

consumption is zero. Equation (3') can be tested by regressing Snt -                                '.Qt

       There are at least two methods available for estimating the

conintegrating vector [1 1 -A/y]. The first is a "levels regression" of

total income     on non—durables and services consumption c, while the second

is an "error-correction regression" of Ayt on lagged changes in and levels of

     and c,. In the levels regression, the estimate of A/y is the coefficient

on cat, while in the error—correction regression the estimate is given by the

ratio of the coefficient on lagged consumption to that on lagged income. The

residual from the levels regression can be used to test the hypothesis that

     and y are not cointegrated. In particular, Granger and Engle (1987)

develop an "Augmented Dickey-Fuller" test in which the change in the residual

is regressed on one lagged level of itself and at least one lagged change.

Based upon the Monte Carlo work of Granger and Engle, a t-statistic on the

coefficient of the lagged level exceeding 2.84 is sufficient to reject the

hypothesis of no cointegration at the 10 percent level; a t-statistic

exceeding 3.17 is sufficient to reject at the 5 percent level.



4.    Data and Empirical Results

      Quarterly data on real per capita consumption, disposable income, and

disposable labor income in Canada and Britain are used in the empirical work.

All data are seasonally adjusted quarterly series for the period

1955:1-1984:4. Canadian data are from Statistics Canada, while the British

data are from the Central Statistical Office. Following Blinder and Deaton

(1985), the disposable labor income series are constructed as follows.

Proprietor's income and personal income taxes are attributed to labor and

capital according to their overall factor shares; social income contributions
                                          —12—


are deducted from labor income; obviously, income from dividends, rent, and

interest is not included in the disposable labor income series. Nominal,

aggregate magnitudes are converted to a real, per capita basis by dividing by

total population and the consumer spending deflator for each country. Annual

population figures are from International Financial Statistics; quarterly

population series are constructed by interpolation.

        As a preliminary diagnostic, in Table 1 we test for a unit root in the

disposable labor income process in Canada and the U.K. The VAR methodology

described in the previous section relies on the presence of a unit root in

labor income. We also test f or unit roots in total income y, nondurables and

services consumption Cnt and "saving" 5nt =      t   -
                                                         (X/y)ct   where the parameter

X/y is estimated in Table 2. We expect to be unable to reject the unit root

hypothesis for y and         (although strictly speaking these variables have

explosive rather than unit roots if y < 1), and to reject strongly for              (in

fact, the test in Table 1 is biased towards rejection because it ignores the

fact that A/' must be estimated -- a test which takes this into account is

presented in Table 2).

        The test statistics in Table 1 have recently been proposed by Phillips

(1986) and Phillips and Perron (1986). To test the null hypothesis that a

series X has a unit root (perhaps with drift), against the alternative that

it is stationary around a linear trend, one runs the regression

    =      +   t +      +       Fuller (1976) and Dickey and Fuller (1981)

tabulated critical values for the t statistic on a, ta, and the F statistic

testing (H0: a=O, =O),      , but   these are correct only if         is serially

uncorrelated. We present Phillips and Perron's modified statistics, Zt& and

        which make a nonparametric correction for serial correlation in
                                          —13-


     The results in Table 1 are generally consistent with our prior

expectations. For Canada, there is no evidence at even the 10 percent level

against the hypothesis that 2t'          and c have unit roots; but the

hypothesis that        has a Unit root is rejected at the 1 percent level.

Results for the U.K. are similar except that the unit root hypothesis for

   is rejected at the 10 percent level by the statistic ZP3.

     Table 2 presents estimates of ,k/y and the tests for no cointegration.

In the Canadian data, the parameter Al)' is estimated at 1.698 by the levels

regression and 1.720 by the error-correction regression; in the British data,

Al)' -is estimated at 1.801 by the levels regression and 1.802 in the

error-correction regression. Recall that, since the consumption of services

given by durables is unobservable, we postulate that c =                 While the
                                                                  ACnt
cointegrating regressions do not identify the A parameter, we note that, if

the propensity to consume out of permanent income is assumed to be unity, the

estimates of A/-y   imply   a share of nondurables and services in total

consumption of 59 percent in Canada and 55 percent in Britain. These implied

shares seem somewhat low, suggesting that the value of y is less than unity.

Evidence on the value of -y, along with an assessment of the robustness of our

findings, is presented in the next section. Finally, we note that the

hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected at the 5 percent level in the

Canadian data, while in the British data it can only be rejected at the

10 percent level.

     We next construct time series for saving, Snt =          -
                                                         yt       (A/Y)Cnt,   in each

country, estimate the bivariate VARS given by equation (7), and use the

estimates to evaluate the permanent income hypothesis. The Akaike Information

Criterion is used to select the VAR lag length: four lags are selected for

the British VAR, and one lag is selected for the Canadian VAR. (The

robustness of the results to alternative choices of lag length is discussed in

the next section.) In computing standard errors, we allow for conditional

heteroskedasticity by using White's (1984) heteroskedasticity-consistent

estimate of the variance-covariance matrix of the VAR coefficient estimates.

This is given by (X'X)1X'VX(X'X, where V is a diagonal matrix with squared

residuals on the diagonal.

     Tables 3 and 4 present the empirical results for Canada and Britain

respectively. In each table there are four columns of regression coefficients

(sums of coefficients in the British case, to reduce the complexity of the

table). Column (1) reports the regression of AyH on the lagged change in

labor income and lagged saving. Column (2) reports the regression of 5nt on

these variables. The two columns together make up the VAR system. Column (3)

is the regression of         —         - (l+r)sn,t_i   on the VAR explanatory

variables; recall that, if the permanent income hypothesis is true, all

coefficients should be zero in this regression. Column (4) is the regression

                        -
with 5n,t+1 -
                2,t+1       (l+r)snt   as the dependent variable; this tests the

hypothesis that the permanent income model holds except for serially

uncorrelated transitory consumption. A fifth column reports the coefficients

of the optimal unrestricted VAR forecast of the present value of labor income

declines, which we write s,,_1. If the permanent income hypothesis is true,

we should have s'     =     s
                n,t—1        n,t—1
     In both Canada and the United Kingdom, the full set of restrictions of

the permanent income hypothesis is strongly rejected. In each country, the
                                              —15—


 coefficients in column (3) are jointly significant at the 0.004 percent level

 or better. For Canada, the strength of the rejection is due largely to the

 restriction that the mean of 5nt should equal (-1/r) times the mean change in

 labor income, a result which follows immediately from equation (3). When

 y <   1,    =
                 s   -
                         (1-y)y   so it is possible to have 5nt be negative even

 though s is positive; nevertheless, the mean of            is too high to satisfy

 the model's restrictions. When the mean restriction is dropped, the other

restrictions of the model are rejected at only the 1.7 percent level. In

Britain, however, the dynamic restrictions of the model are rejected just as

strongly as the mean restriction.

       Allowing serially uncorrelated transitory consumption also helps the

model fit the Canadian data; the coefficients in column (4), excluding the

intercept, are not even significant at the 60 percent level for Canada. But

for the U.K., the model with transitory consumption is rejected as strongly as

the model without.

       As discussed in the Introduction, our goal is to do more than simply

conduct formal tests of the permanent income model. We are interested in

characterizing the fit of the model, bringing out its strengths and its

weaknesses. Tables 3 and 4 also present summary statistics for the VAR

systems which help us to do this.

       In both Canadian and British data, saving Granger causes changes in labor

income at extremely high levels of statistical significance. Furthermore, the

estimated coefficients on 5ntl are negative in both countries and

statistically significant. These findings are exactly those implied by the

permanent income hypothesis since saving is forward looking and rises in
                                     —16—


anticipation of future declines in labor income. As shown in detail in

Section 3, the single-equation regression tests already discussed are

equivalent to the test of the cross-equation restrictions on the VARs. In

fact, the deviations of the estimated VAR coefficients from these restrictions

are just the coefficients reported in the regressions of column (3).

     We also report, for each country, the standard deviation of saving, the

ratio of the standard deviation of the unrestricted VAR forecast of the

discounted present value of future changes in labor income to the standard

deviation of saving, and the correlation between saving and the unrestricted

forecast. In the Canadian data, the correlation is .997 and the standard

deviation ratio is 1.079. If the theory were exactly correct, the correlation

and the standard deviation ratio would both equal one. We have seen that

these differences are statistically significant, but Canadian household saving

appears to incorporate virtually all of the forecastable variation in future

labor income.

     In the British data, the correlation between saving and the unrestricted

forecast is also quite high at .896. Itowever s is less than half as

volatile as the unrestricted forecast of the present value of the future labor

income declines. This may be taken as evidence of excess sensitivity of

consumption to current income in Britain since, if consumption were in fact

determined by current as opposed to permanent income, saving --   the   difference

between income and consumption -- would be expected to have substantially less

volatility than the unrestricted optimal forecast. It should be noted,

though, that the asymptotic standard error on the excess sensitivity statistic

is high at 0.679.
                                      —17—


     We conclude this section by plotting      and the unrestricted optimal

forecast of labor income declines. These plots are given in Figures 1 and 2.

The figures convincingly support the inferences drawn from the summary

statistics.    In particular, the statistical rejection of the permanent income

hypothesis in Canadian data does not appear to have substantial economic

significance. Forecastable variations in the present value of future labor

income declines are incorporated virtually one-for-one in Canadian household

saving behavior (Figure 1). The noteorthy feature of the British plot

(Figure 2) is that, while the magnitude of swings in saving does not in

general match that of swings -in forecastabie labor income declines, the former

tracks every turning point in the latter. Despite the statistical rejections

of the present income hypothesis reported in Table 2, the theory seems to be a

reasonable first approximation to the behavior of household saving in Canada

and Britain.



5.   How Robust are the Findings?

     In this Section we check to see whether our results are robust to changes

in the econometric specification and the measure of consumption. We are

particularly concerned with the possibility that our results are sensitive to

lag length, since Campbell (1987) found this to be the case for U.S. data.

     Fortunately, in British and Canadian data we obtain rather similar

results to those reported for all lag lengths between I and 5.   In Canadian

data, the permanent income hypothesis (without transitory consumption) is

rejected at the 2.]. percent level for lag length 2, the 1.1 percent level for

lag length 3, the 0.3 percent level for lag length 4, and the 0.4 percent
                                              -18-


level for lag length 5. The correlation of 5nt and s falls slightly from

0.996 with lag length 1 to 0.908 with lag length 5, and the standard deviation

ratio rises to 1.518 with lag length 5, but the standard errors on these

numbers also rise so that individually they remain insignificantly different

from one. In British data the model is strongly rejected but the correlation

of     and s remains above 0.85 for all lag lengths. We find strong evidence

of excess sensitivity only at the lag lengths above 3.

     The assumption that the unobservable consumption of services yielded by

the existing stock of durable goods is proportional to                 the consumption of

non-durables and services, involves a potential specification error. To

evaluate the robustness of our findings, we test and evaluate the fit of the

permanent income model using data on total consumption expenditures, c. to

construct a series for saving         =       - c/y    in each country.

     In this case, the cointegrating regression of y on a constant and

c, uniquely identifies the parameter 1/y.            The estimate of 1/y for Canada is

1.289 with a standard error of .013; the estimate for Britain is 1.299 with a

standard error of .012. The null hypothesis of no coiritegration is rejected

at the 10 percent level in Britain, and at the 5 percent level in Canada, as

in Table 2.

     For Britain, the results of the single equation regression tests are

unchanged: the restriction that           -          - (1+r)s_1   or      —

- (1+r)st   be orthogonal to lagged           and       is resoundingly rejected.

However, for Canada, we cannot reject at the 5 percent level the hypothesis

that the source of the rejection is solely a significant constant term in both

the strict and transitory—consumption regression tests.
                                         -19— -


        The only substantive differences in the VAR summary statistics relative

to those reported in Tables 3 and 4 are that the standard deviations of

Canadian saving and the unrestricted forecast increase from .661 and .669,

respectively, to .900 and 1.408. However, the correlation between Canadian

saving and the unrestricted forecasts falls only slightly to .996 from .997.

The corresponding British correlation rises to .913 (from .896) while the

standard deviation of the unrestricted British forecast declines to .154 from

.221.

        Figures 3 and 4 give a visual impression of the results using total

consumption expenditure. The conclusions drawn in Section 4 are not weakened

when total consumption is used.     If anything, the British plots in Figure 4

provide stronger support for the proposition that the permanent income

hypothesis provides a parsimonious and empirically relevant account of the

cyclical dynamics of household saving behavior.



6.   Concluding Remarks

     In this paper, we have found substantial support for the prediction of

the permanent income hypothesis that forecastable variations in disposable

labor income are incorporated in household saving behavior in Canada and

Britain. The tight formulation of the permanent income hypothesis tested in

this paper can be statistically rejected, but we conclude that the theory has

surprising empirical content. Because it abstracts from the demographic

considerations of the life-cyc1e hypothesis, the permanent income hypothesis

is not successful at explaining average saving rates, or differences in these
                                      -20-


rates across countries. However, the theory's predictions about the dynamics

of saving and income appear to be worth taking seriously.
