            THE EFFECTS OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ON LOCAL LABOR MARKETS


                                      ABSTRACTS
        Despite the presence of anecdotal evidence linking regional economic growth

and the presence of quality universities in such areas as the Silicon Valley in

California and Route 128 in Boston, there have been few systematic studies of

the relationship between universities and local economies. In this paper we

examined the relationship between four measures of the quality or extent of

activities of colleges and universities in an area and various measures of the

local labor market activity, including employment, income and migration.

        We could not reject the hypothesis that there is no relationship between

our measures of university activity and the overall employment rate in an SMSA.

We   did,     however,   find evidence     that colleges and universities        affect   the

composition of employment in an SMSA.            The probability of being employed as a

scientist or engineer and the probability of being employed in a high- tech

industry were both found to increase with the amount of R&D funding at local

universities.       The probability of being employed in a high- tech industry was also

found    to    be   positively   related    to   the   number   of   graduates   from   local

universities.       We also found evidence that employment growth rates and earnings

are higher in areas with good universities.             Finally, the data can not reject

the hypothesis that net migration is unrelated to universities.
