1.   Introduction

     This paper specifies and estimates a four—equation disequilibrium

model of the consumption goods market in a centrally planned economy

(CPE). The data are from Poland for the period 1955—1980, but the

analysis is more general and will be applied to other CPEs as soon as

the appropriate data sets are complete.

     The work reported here is based on the previous papers of Portes

and Winter (1980) and Chareiuza and Quandt (1982), referred to below as

P—W and C—Q. The former applied to each of four CPEs a

discrete—switching disequilibrium model with a household demand

equation for consumption goods, a planners' supply equation, and a

"inin condition stating that the observed quantity transacted is the

lesser of the quantities demanded and supplied. C—Q considered how

an equation for the adjustment of planned quantities could be

integrated into a CPE model with fixed prices and without the usual

price adjustment equation. They made plan formation endogenous and

permitted the resulting plan variables to enter the equations

determining demand and supply. Depending on the precise specification

of the equation determining the plan, the model could adjust towards

market clearing in a manner similar to that of disequilibrium models

with price adjustment equations.

     This paper implements the C—Q proposal in the P—W context. It

differs from P—W in several respects: (1) the data are extended

beyond 1975, up to 1980; (ii) the main series have been more or less

substantially revised, using new information; (iii) a plan—adjustment

equation determines the published plan for aggregate consumption by

households; (iv) this plan enters the equation for the supply of

consumption goods; Cv) the variables constructed by P—W to measure

deviations from plans for exogenous variables (output, investment,

defence expenditure), which proxied the plan series by second—order

quadratic trends, now use published plan data. The model here

differs from C—Q in having a more general form of plan—adjustment

equation than they propose.

     The work reported here was possible only because we were able to

assemble reliable time series for plans for the major macroeconomic

variables in Poland and other CPEs. Using this new and unique data

set, our empirical work can now go beyond the question posed by P—W,

which concerned the existence of excess demand in the aggregate

consumption goods markets of CPEs, to a range of important questions

concerning the planning process and macroeconomic disequilibrium:

Are the plans in a CPE properly represented as endogenous, determined

by stable economic relationships rather than political caprice? How
                                                3




do plans so determined then influence the planners and the economy?

Do the planners plan for macroeconomic equilibrium (i.e. does the plan

refer to their planned supply or to their intention for the quantity

transacted)? Is the disequilibrium macro framework appropriate and

useful for the analysis of CPEs (see Portes, 1981a)? There are also

interesting theoretical and econometric questions which arise, some of

which will provide material for future work. The overall framework

is applicable to any large organization which plans economic

variables.


2.      The Model


     Our general model for Poland is taken from P—W with the

modifications indicated above. Thus the consumption demand

equation is identical to that in P—W, derived directly from the

Houthakker—Taylor savings function:


     CD =
             ct1DNFA1   + n2DYD   +'
                                       x3YDi   + u1            (1)

where

     CD =     household desired expenditure on consumption goods and
             services in the current period

     DNFA = household saving, measured as the change in net financial
          assets of households, NFA, during the period (NFA is the
          end—of—period net stock of financial assets); DNFA1 was
          called Si in P—W

     DYD = change in disposable income from the previous to the
          current period

     YD =    disposable    income

     1 suffix denotes a one—period lag operator

             N(O, a )
                                               4




     The work of Houthakker and Taylor suggests the following

a priori hypotheses:

    —1 <         < —       1/3,   0 <   < 1,       =   1.


     The modified supply equation is


     Cs      = 1c* + 2C*z +         84RNFA1 + 5CZXD + 86CZXI + 87DTJM   + u2   (2)



where


     CS =     supply       of consumption goods and services in current period

     C = announced            plan for consumption

     (* denotes a plan throughout. The value of a plan variable in
     period t is the plan for period t, as formulated in period t—1)

     NMP = net material product

     D = defence expenditure

        I =   investment expenditure
     CZ = (C*/NMP*).(NMP_NMP*)
        CZXD = [(D/NMP) — (D*/'NMP*)]NMP

        CZXI =   [(I/NMP) — (I*/NMP*)]NNP
        RNFA = deviation of current NFA from second—order exponential
             time trend fitted to observed values of NFA

        DUM = one for the period 1978—80, zero otherwise
                       2
        u2     N(0, a2)


        A planned supply function of this form is explained, justified

and estimated in Portes and Winter (1977, 1980). The hypothesis is

that consumption goods supply will be determined by the announced

consumption plan and by deviations from plans of output, defence,

investment and consumption, as well as deviations from trend of
                                             5



household financial assets. A coefficient 1% for the lagged values of

C*Z was considered in the general model of P—W but the corresponding

term dropped out of their estimates for Poland and therefore has been

excluded here, while their original numbering of coefficients has been

retained to facilitate comparisons. On the other hand, in P—W

defence and investment expenditure were aggregated, with a single

coefficient 85. A—priori arguments here suggest                1;


82      84 > 0; 8 , 86 < 0 . The dummy variable was introduced because

it was believed that 1978 marked the beginning of an extraordinary

sequence of events, including changes in the planners' behaviour,

which led to the crisis of 1980 (Portes, 1981b).

        In both the demand and supply equations, we expect a priori that

no constant terms should appear. They were tried in initial estimates,

however, and we could not reject the hypothesis that they were zero.

        The simple disequilibrium model is completed by


        C =    mm   (CD, CS)                                          (3)


where C is the quantity observed.

     Now we add the plan—adjustment equation


     C* =
                iS1C*1
                         +   62 + 63C2 + iS4RNFA2 + y(CD—CS) + u4     (4)


where    the    suffix 2 denotes a two—period lag and u4      N(0,   ).

     The plan for the current period is normally determined towards

the end of the previous period, and we suppose it is a function of the

t The plan for year t is formulated in the last quarter of year t—1.
At that time the planners know NFA2 exactly, since it refers to
financial assets at the end of year t—2. They also know part of NFA1 —
the first 6 or 8 months, since it refers to financial assets at the end
of year t—1.
                                   6



plan for that period and realized quantities for that and the

preceding period, as well as the most recent known value of RNFA.t A

final Influence on the plan might be excess demand, or CD—CS.

     Single—equation models of plan formation involving only previous

plans and realizations are discussed by Yeo (1982). Planners'

behaviour of this kind is discussed by Gacs and Lacko (1973) and by

Kornal (1971). Different schemes yield similar relationships of

the form of equation (4) with different interpretations of

'l' 62, 63). We discuss below some of the properties of these

coefficients.

     Our plan—adjustment equation also supposes that the planners will

respond to observed "excess" household liquidity by raising the plan

(64 > 0). We use RNFA1 in the supply function and RNFA2 here because

the former is meant to capture behaviour during the current period,

when RNFA]. is known, whereas when the plan for period t is determined

In period (t—l) only NFA at the end of period (t—2) Is known. A

similar argument might suggest that Cl does not belong in equation

(4), but we suppose the planners have better information on a flow

variable towards the end of the period during which it is realized

than on a stock to be measured at the end of that period. We did try

RNFA1 instead of RNFA2 In equation (4) for some estimates; but

although its coefficient was significant and of the correct sign

it resulted in considerably poorer estimates of (61, 62, 63).

     A more serious objection to the dating of variables in equation

(4) is the use of contemporaneous excess demand, which is clearly

unknown when the plan is fixed. This might be justified on a

"planners' rational expectations" argument; on the other hand, it

might be thought preferable to use lagged excess demand, which would
                                     7




correspond to excess demand in the period during which the plan is

formulated. Unfortunately, the model's likelihood function then

becomes intractable, unless we suppose that u4 is identically zero

(this is clear by analogy with the analysis in Laf font and Monfort,

1979, and Quandt, 1981). We did try estimating such a model, but it

gave some silly results, for reasons which we do not yet understand.

       One variant which was simple enough to implement was to suppose

that CD and CS enter separately in equation (4) with coefficients

and 2' respectively. When we tried this formulation, we did find

     > 2 < 0, as expected, and of the same order of magnitude

(though surprisingly large); and we often could not reject - =

We   therefore report only results for the model as shown above,

expecting y > 0 a priori. We also tried an asymmetrical formulation

where only positive excess demand influences the planners, so the term

In equation (4) is y max (D—S, 0). This did not work well, and the

estimates are not reported.

      All estimates use annual data for 1955—80 for Poland, although

the two—period lag in equation (4) means that we can report estimates

of excess demand only for the 24 observations 1957—80. All variables

are in constant prices, with the CPI used as deflator. Further

Information on the data is given In Appendix A.


3.     Results


      The likelihood function for the model of equations (1) —     (4)   is

derived in Appendix B. It Is clear that the model is coherent, because

the matrix of coefficients of the endogenous variables is the same

whether there is excess demand or excess supply. We used the
                                        8



Davidon—Fletcher—Powell algorithm to obtain maximum likelihood

estimates, with numerical first derivatives. The procedure invariably

iterated long enough so that the H matrix provided good convergence to

the inverse of the Hessian and therefore good estimates of standard

errors.

     We report the results of estimation in Tables 1 and 2. The

first column of Table 1 gives the original P—W estimates, the second

column estimates for the P—W model on the new data (using plans).

The third and fourth columns show estimates for two different versions

of the model of equations (1) —    (4),     first with and then without the

excess demand term in the plan—adjustment equation. As discussed

below, we find the estimates with y = 0 to be superior, so Table 2

gives output only from this run. The first column shows for each

observation the probability it   that   demand exceeds supply, as estimated

by P—W, and the second gives our estimates of it.

     As a first step in the estimation it was decided to estimate the

original P—W model with data for plans instead of time trend proxies.

Estimation of this model for the new data set using a sample from

1957—1980 did not yield acceptable results; however convergence was

obtained when the observations for 1980 were omitted. The results are

given in the second column of Table 1. The estimates of the demand

equation are quite reasonable, the supply equation less so. In

particular the estimates of        and        do not have the expected

signs.

     Estimation of the new model including the excess demand term in

the plan—adjustment equation does produce an estimate of y which is

significant and of reasonable size, and a likelihood ratio test

suggests (though not very strongly) that we should reject the

                                                of   ,   c of y, s of c.

2) Asymptotic standard errors in parentheses.

3) C is the sample mean value of consumption.

4) b5 in the estimates for P—W (1980) is the estimated coefficient on
a term aggregating investment and defence expenditure, but of the same
form as CZXD and CZXI.

5) The estimation in P—W (1980) was carried out over a sample
including 1954—1975.

6) Re—estimation of the P—W model in column 2 included 1956—1979. In
this re—estimation the defence and investment deviations were entered
as separate variables, and not combined as in P—W (1980).

7) The estimates in columns 3 and 4 were carried out over the sample
1957—1980.


Note to Table 2

The values of r taken from P—W (1980) are the estimated marginal
probabilities that the observation was generated by an excess demand
regime, i.e. that CDt > CS . The probabilities reported in column 2
of Table 2 (which correspond to the estimates in the last column of
Table 1) are the est1mated condItIonal probabl1tes that the
observation was generated by an excess demand regime, i.e. that
CDt > CS , conditional on the observed C . The two estimated it's can
neverthe'ess be compared, since Burkett l98l, p. 161) reports that
there is little or no difference between the marginal and conditional
probabilities for Poland in the original P—W (1980) model.
                                    12


restriction y =   0.   On the other hand, the inclusion of this term

affects the estimates of several other coefficients unfavourably

(b2, d1, d2, d3) and gives a less plausible sample separation.         Since

the rationale for using contemporaneous excess demand in equation (4)

is somewhat tenuous (and experiments with separate y1and 12 gave no

better results and used up yet another degree of freedom), we

concluded this informal specification search by choosing the estimates

with y =   0. Note that the dummy variable for 1978—80 is strongly
significant in these estimates, and a run without it was rejected by a

likelihood ratio test.

     Considering the estimates in the last column of Table 1, we find

that all the estimates for equation (1) satisfy the a—priori

conditions, as do the estimates for '
                                          ' 8,    and 154• The other

coefficients in equation (4) look reasonable enough, and we shall

discuss them and the anomalous estimates for 84 and      below.

     The estimated probabilities of excess demand regimes look much

more acceptable here than they did in P—W. P—W were themselves

skeptical about their x's for Poland (pp. 153, 155). Here, almost half

the observations are classified as excess demand, and the pattern is

reasonably consistent with a qualitative assessment of events in the

Polish economy since the mid—1950s. In particular, the estimates pick

up the effects of the investment boom of 1959, the sudden growth of

wages in 1971—72, and the strain on the economy from 1975 onwards,

which further foreign borrowing could not relieve.

     Turning in more detail to the estimates from Individual equations

and coefficients, there is little further to say about the demand

function. The standard errors are somewhat larger than in the
                                      13



original P—W estimates, and the estimate of        is significantly

different, but the overall picture is quite satisfactory. The

coefficients imply a long—run average savings ratio of 2.3% in an

economy growing at 5% p.a.

     The plan—adjustment equation is much more interesting. First,

the coefficients are on the whole quite well determined. Second, it

seems clear that the plan is adjusted upwards when the planners

observe that households are holding "excess" liquid assets; indeed,

they appear to increase the plan more than commensurately (but see the

discussion of b4 below). Third, the long—run properties of the

estimated equation (4) are remarkable.

     Recall that RNFA is a series of deviations from trend.

Although this is not a linear but rather an exponential trend, so that

the mean of RNFA is not zero by construction, it is nevertheless very

close to zero (0.7) compared with C.        If we therefore disregard RNFA

and take the estimates with y =     0, we have the simplified equation

        =
            d1C_1 + d2C_i +d3Ct2                                  (5)




What are the implications of a stationary state in which C = C for

all t? We would have the first—order difference equation


     C = d1C_1       + (d2 + d3)C                                (6)




Provided 1d1( < 1, which does hold for the estimates with y =    0,      this

converges to


        =         + d3)C/(1-d1) = 1.034 C
            (d2                                                    (7)


Given the degree of precision of the estimates, this is tolerably
                                       14




close to permitting a stationary state in which the plan is always

realized.

     Of course, the Polish economy (and aggregate consumption) were in

fact growing steadily until the very end of our period. We might

then ask what constant growth rate is consistent with exact

realization of plans in the estimated version of equation (5)? Taking

C = (l+g)C_1 and C* =     C   for all t     in   equation (5) gives us


     (1+g)2C_2 = (d1-fd2)(1+g)C_2 + d3Ct2              (8)


The positive root of this quadratic is g = .075, which Is close to the

observed average growth rate of consumption over the period 1957—198Q

of 6.3% ! That is, the observed planners' behaviour does not suggest

unrealistic planning. Alternatively, we might say that the

consumption planning mechanism was on the whole consistent with the

economy's possibilities, and the role of RNFA suggests that when

exogenous shocks pushed plans and actual consumption off course, the

planners sought to return to thIs path.

     Finally, suppose we did introduce an excess demand term equal to

a constant proportion e of consumption into the constant growth

economy with exact plan realization of equation (8), but with y             1

In other words, for the moment we visualize a centrally planned

economy In which there Is excess demand for consumption goods in

every period, but in which the planners make planned consumption a

positive function of excess demand. This would give us


     (1+g)2C =                   ÷ d3C + eC                           (9)
                 (d14d2)(1+g)C

It is straightforward to establish how the solution to the quadratic
                                      15


in g will vary with e:



     -    +{(d1 + d2)2 + 4(d3 + e)J —1/2> 0                       (10)


(for the root with g > 0)

As excess demand increases so does the consumption plan and so also

does actual consumption. Thus the higher excess demand, the higher

would be the growth rate of actual consumption required to be

consistent with continuous realization of plans (note that this

conclusion is not independent of the estimated parameter values,

since they determine which root will give g > 0, and indeed whether

there exists a positive real root).

     The estimates of the supply function suggest that consumption is

not used as a "buffer" to absorb unanticipated shocks to NMF             < 1
                                                                  (b2
— see P—W for this interpretation).
                                           Further, they suggest that

consumption goods supply would equal the plan (b1       1) were it not for

the effects of the "deviation" or shock variables, all of which have

means approximately equal to zero.

     In this equation, b4 and b6 take signs opposite to those expected

on a—priori grounds. For each, we can provide fairly plausible ex

post rationalizations, but more study will be required.

     For b6, we conjecture that there was a structural change around

1972, when the foreign borrowing constraint was relaxed, so that

investment no longer crowded out consumption. Indeed, B6 might

well have become positive, if the planners took account of the

multiplier effects of shocks to investment and were willing to

accommodate them with additional imports of consumption goods. To

test this, we tried an additive dummy on the coefficient B6 itself

for the period 1972—80. The coefficient on the dummy was not
                                    16




significant but at least was positive, as expected, and b6 also became

insignificant, but did not switch sign. This gave partial support

to our hypothesis.

     The surprising but fairly small negative coefficient on RNFA1 in

the supply equation must be viewed in the light of the rather large

positive coefficient on RNFA2 in the plan—adjustment equation. It

may be that the end—year measurement of NFA does not correspond to the

data to which the planners actually respond when they plan during

(t—1), in equation (4), and when they adjust supply during t, in

equation (2). Thus we also find that RNFA1 performs similarly well

in equation (4), which is not suprising both because the planners know

some of the information going into RNFA1 by the time they set C*, and

because the observed positive serial correlation between RNFA1 and

RNFA2 is 0.84.

     Moreover it should be noted that the stock of financial assets

affects supply in two ways —   directly,   through the RNFA1 term in

equation (2) and indirectly through the presence of C* in equation (2)

and the presence of RNFA2 in the equation determining C*. Thus the C*

entering equation (2) already has in it information on RNFA2, to which

the planners may have overreacted in period t—1 in setting the

consumption plan. They may then seek to compensate for this

overreaction in period t by adjusting actual supply in the opposite

direction, based on RNFA1. The total direct and indirect effect of net

financial assets on supply can be obtained by substituting the C* from

equation (4) into the supply equation, equation (2). The total effect

of RNFA upon CS is then given by
                                             17



                      84RNFA1
                                +      +
                                      1+1

where e   is   (NMP_NMP*)/NMP* .     Now consider a constant unit positive

RNFA, i.e. a sustained departure of net financial assets from trend.



The supply response will be


                         +
                             1+1

The size of this response of course depends upon 0, which over the

sample period ranged in magnitude between —0.05 and +0.05. The total

effect of RNFA upon supply, based on the two versions of the model

estimated (with and without the term involving y), can be summarized

as follows:

                                   0 = —0.05       0 =   0.05

     Equations (1)—(4)               0.975           0.967
     with y estimated

     Equations (1)—(4)                               0 °'
     with   y0
This suggests that the planners, in response to a sustained

increase in household financial assets, would adjust the supply of

consumption goods by an equal amount. The evidence from the

performance of RNFA that the planners do seek market clearing th.is

seems quite strong.


4.    Conclusion


      We believe we have taken substantial steps towards answering the

questions posed in Section 1 and demonstrating the applicability of
                                   18


the C—Q model. Estimation has shown that it Is both feasible and

informative to use plan data, and to model the regularities in the

process of plan construction. The plan for year t, formulated and

announced in year t—l, is dependent upon planned and actual

consumption and household financial asset behaviour, as known to the

planners in year t—l. These announced plans are then embodied In a

supply function which reflects, In addition, unforeseen developments

In the economy in year t. The role of the financial assets variable

suggests that the planners do appear to try to adjust announced plans

and actual supply in order to reduce excess demand. The disequilibrium

macroeconomic framework, with fixed prices and planned quantities,

can be estimated for centrally planned economies and seems to provide

insight Into their behaviour. The plan—adjustment equation helps in

disequilibrium estimation, which was possible even with a relatively

small sample.

     There are various extensions of the analysis which we shall

explore in future work. We should soon have data sets permitting

application of the model to three other countries. We shall try

further experiments with the model with lagged excess demand In the

plan—adjustment equation. We intend also to try a model allowing

different coefficients on positive and negative excess demand in

equation (4). It may be interesting to run a current—price demand

equation with an inflation term, based on a restricted Intertemporal

linear expenditure system. Finally, the same structure could be

applied to other macro variables and markets —   e.g.,   investment or NNP

itself.

                           Appendix A : Data


     The data used in this study have been drawn from a variety of

Polish and other sources, all publicly available. The earlier study

by Portes and Winter ((P—W (1980)) was based on the data described in

Rudcenko (1979). There are some important conceptual differences

between the variables used here and those constructed by Rudcenko. In

addition some of the series reported by Rudcenko and used in P—W

(1980) have been subject to revision by the Polish central statistical

agency (GUS).


1. Realized Variables


     The series describing actual or realized variables are mainly

drawn from the annual statistical yearbook, Rocznik Statystyczny (RS)

the concise annual statistical yearbook, Maly Rocznik Statystyczny

(MRS), or other publications of the GUS.

i) Real Income (YD): This is the real disposable income of households,

after the deduction of taxes and other obligatory payments. It

includes not only income flows from the state or socialized sector to

households, but income flows within the private sector. In particular

it includes an estimate of the net income of private enterprises and

an estimate of the income in kind of private agriculture. In this

respect it differs fundamentally from the income series reported in

Rudcenko (1979, p.447), which included only gross income flows from

the socialized sector to households. The income series used in the

present study was thought to be the more appropriate for a study of

consumer behaviour.

     This series has been reported regularly in the RS for the years
                                   A-2


since 1970. A comparable series can be found for the years from 1961

to 1970 and for 1975 in the yearbook of national income, Rocznik

Dochodu Narodowego (RDN), for 1960—1965, 1971 and 1976. These issues

of the RDN contain relatively detailed balance sheets of aggregate

nominal household income and expenditure. The income figures, after

some adjustment because of definitional changes, appear to be

comparable to the figures reported in the RS for the years after 1970.

We have not yet been able to obtain comparable published

income figures for the 1950s. Instead we have applied the percentage

changes in the index of "nominal money income of the population" given

in Hodoly (1966, p. 149) in order to create an income series from

1950 to 1960. The percentage changes in income given by Hodoly have

been compared to similar series given in a variety of other

publications and monographs.   In general all these sources agree

closely on the movement in income in the 1950s. This nominal income

series for the years 1950—1980 is then deflated by the published

consumer price index to give the series YD.

ii) Real net financial assets (NFA): This variable is equal to the sum

of savings deposits and cash held by households, minus the total

amount of outstanding loans from the state to households. It is

thus financial assets net of the sum owed by households to the state.

It is measured as an end—of—year stock. This nominal stock figure is

then deflated by the published consumer price index.

     This variable is constructed from the series reported in Rudcenko

(l979,p. 446—450) and has been updated to 1980 from the data

published in the RS and the MRS.    We were not able to obtain a

consistent series for credits advanced to and repaid by households.

Instead we used the series from Rudcenko, which measures credits
                                  A-3


advanced to the population, which includes credits to individual

farmers and non agricultural private enterprise.

iii) Real household consumption of goods and services (C): This series

is obtained as the difference between real income, YD, and the annual

assets variable is deflated before being differenced to obtain DNFA.

iv) Net material product (NNP): This is net material product, in

constant prices. The series is taken from the RS, but re—scaled to

give an implicit deflator equal to 1 in 1971, in conformity with the

practice in P—W (1980).

v) Investment (I): This is total investment in both the socialized and

private sectors, in constant prices. The series is taken from the RS,

but re—scaled In the same way as net material product.

vi) Defence (D): This is current defence expenditure, as given in the

RS. The figure in the RS is in current prices, and is deflated using

the implicit deflator for investment, I. This implicit deflator is

calculated as the ratio of current to constant price total investment

figures as published in the RS.

vii) Consumer Price Index: This is the price index for goods and

services purchased by the population, as published in the RS.         The

published series has been linked and rescaled so that 1955 =   1.0,    in

accordance with P—W. (1980).


2. Plan Variables

     The annual economic plan for Poland is announced during November

or December of the preceding year In the official gazette of the

Polish government, Monitor Polski (NP). The plan figure for year

t is usually given only as a percentage increase over the

(unspecified) actual or realized figure for year t—l. In some cases
                                  A-4


the level of the planned series for year t is also given, but this is

not always the case. The figures in MP have been supplemented and

confirmed from the figures given in the planning journal Gospodarka

Planowa (GP) and in the United Nations Economic Survey of Europe. In

some instances in the 1950s and 1960s additional information was

obtained from the Polish monthly statistical bulletin, the Biuletyn

Statystyczny (BS), and the United Nations Economic Bulletin for

Europe.

1) Planned net material product (NMP*): This series is available in

NP, GP and the U. N. sources, given as a percentage increase over the

preceding year's actual figure. It has been converted to a planned

level by applying this percentage increase to the latest available

published figure for the previous year, which is just the series NHP.

ii) Planned investment (1*): This series is available on the same

basis as the NMP figures, although planned levels are given for some

years. The series 1* is generated in the same manner as the series

NNP*.

iii) Planned defence expenditure (D*): This series corresponds to

budget appropriations for current defence expenditure announced by the

government. The series Is taken from Alton et al. (1980, p.32—33).

Iv) Planned supply of consumption goods and services: There is no

published plan series available which corresponds exactly to our

notion of consumption, although a variety of retail sales plan figures

are available. We have used here a series for the planned "volume of

retail sales" or "retail sales turnover", taken from the United

Nations Economic Bulletin for Europe and the Economic Survey of

Europe. This corresponds to a fairly complete coverage of retail

sales of goods, but not of services. There are some plan figures
                                 A- 5




available for services for the 1970s, but not earlier. We generated

planned consumption levels in the following manner: We applied the

published planned percentage increases in the "volume of retail trade

turnover" to the published series on actual retail sales of goods,

RSG.     This generated a series of planned levels for retail sales,

RSG*.     We then regressed our real consumption series, C, on the

published actual retail sales of goods RSG.     Because our consumption

data is somewhat different in origin for the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s,

we allowed slope and intercept dummies for each of these periods in

the regression relating C and RSG.      We then generated C* by

substituting RSG* for RSG in this estimated relationship.      The

alternative and more direct way of generating C* would be to apply the

planned percentage increases in RSG directly to the actual level of C

in t—l, as if they were the planned percentage increases in C itself.

This yielded a very similar series.
