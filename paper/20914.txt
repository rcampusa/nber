                                           ABSTRACT

Environmental Engel curves (EECs) plot the relationship between households’ incomes and the pollution
embodied in the goods and services they consume. They provide a basis for estimating the degree
to which observed environmental improvements, which come in part from changing consumption
patterns, can be attributed to income growth. We calculate a set of annual EECs for the United States
from 1984 to 2002, revealing three clear results. First, EECs are upward sloping: richer households
are indirectly responsible for more pollution. Second, EECs are convex, with income elasticities of
less than one. Third, EECs have been shifting down over time: at every level of income households
are responsible for decreasing amounts of pollution. We show that even without changes to production
techniques, the pollution necessary to produce the goods and services American households consume
would have declined 5 to 8 percent, despite a 13 percent increase in real household incomes. Most
of this improvement is attributable to households consuming a less pollution-intensive mix of goods,
driven about equally by two factors: household income growth represented by movement along convex
EECs; and economy-wide changes represented by downward shifts in EECs.

Introduction
        This paper presents the first estimates of household-level environmental Engel curves
(EECs), which show the relationship between households’ incomes and the amount of pollution
embodied in the goods and services those households consume. Traditional Engel curves plot
relationships between income and consumption of particular goods or services. They are named
for Ernst Engel, a German economist writing in the mid-1800s who studied the degree to which
household food expenditures increase with income. Engel curves have since been applied to
many different categories of consumption and form the basis for “equivalence scales” that are
used to determine eligibility for means-tested entitlements, such as food stamps and Medicaid.
        Environmental Engel curves describe how households’ pollution changes with income.
This calculation is less straightforward than it is for traditional Engel curves, because households
generate pollution not only directly as a consequence of their activities such as driving cars, but
also indirectly as a consequence of consuming products whose production generates pollution,
such as manufacturing the rubber and steel used to make those cars and refining the gasoline
used to fuel them. We focus on this larger and less studied component, the indirect pollution
generated to produce the goods and services households consume.
        Why is this important? Over the past 30 years, total pollution emitted by U.S. producers
has declined considerably, even though the real value of U.S. production has increased.1 Some of
this improvement has come from employing cleaner production technologies in cars and
factories, but much of it comes as a result of consuming a cleaner mix of goods—more
computers and services and less steel and cement. A key question is whether this cleaner
consumption has been a consequence of economy-wide trends, such as regulation-induced
increases in the prices of polluting goods, or an underlying and possibly coincidental preference
by richer households for cleaner goods.
        Some analysts have pointed to the improvements in the United States and other
developed countries as evidence that richer countries automatically pollute less, implying that
economic growth alone will improve the environment.2 But rich countries might have less

  From 1980 to 2012, emissions of carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide declined by roughly 80 percent, ground-
level ozone by 25 percent, and nitrogen dioxide by 60 percent, even though real GDP and real personal consumption
expenditures more than doubled (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2014; FRED, 2014a and 2014b).

  For example, John Tierney wrote in the New York Times in 2009 that “the richer everyone gets, the greener the
planet will be in the long run” (“Use Energy, Get Rich and Save the Planet,” April 20). And Bruce Bartlett wrote in

pollution because they enact strict environmental regulations—or because they outsource
polluting industries to poor countries.
        To consider these possibilities systematically, economists have parsed the relationship
between economic growth and pollution into three components: scale, technique, and
composition (Grossman and Krueger, 1993; Copeland and Taylor, 2005). The scale component
merely describes a proportional increase in economic activity—if the economy doubled in size,
the scale effect would double pollution. The technique component describes changes to the
pollution intensity of any particular activity. Refining a barrel of petroleum creates less pollution
today than 30 years ago because refineries have more abatement equipment. And the
composition component describes changes to the mix of activities that compose the economy.

        We focus on this third component. The composition effect could arise for two reasons:
changes in the mix of goods produced or consumed. U.S. households could consume the same
mix of goods and services over time, but an increasing share of the pollution-intensive ones
could be imported rather than produced domestically. Or households could consume a less
polluting mix. Since our interest is to separate the effects of regulation-induced price changes
from coincidental preferences of richer households for cleaner goods, we study this second
possibility, shifting household consumption. We ask how much of that shift is merely due to the
fact that households today are on average richer than they were 30 years ago—a movement
along an EEC—and how much is due to changes in the mix of goods consumed by all
households, holding incomes constant—a shift in the EEC.
        One approach to estimating these EECs would be to compare pollution, income, and
consumption choices across countries at a point in time or across time within a country, similar
to the way environmental Kuznets curves (EKSs) have been estimated.3 But EKCs are simply
conditional correlations, without meaningful interpretations other than that pollution does not
necessarily increase with economic growth. EECs, on the other hand, are meant to be structural,
representing income expansion paths holding individuals’ preferences and all else equal. EECs
based on comparisons across countries or over time would be difficult because prices and
characteristics of available goods change. Richer countries might pass regulations making

the Wall Street Journal in 1994 that “existing environmental regulation, by reducing economic growth, may actually
be reducing environmental quality” (“The High Cost of Turning Green,” September 14).
3
  The EKC refers to the representation—typically as an inverted U shape—of the aggregate relationship between
pollution and national income. See for example, Grossman and Krueger (1995) or Hilton and Levinson (1998).

                                                        2
pollution-intensive goods costlier or less desirable, causing households to consume
proportionally less of them. That difference would not be interpretable as the slope of an Engel
curve because it would not represent the change in consumption that results from a ceteris
paribus change in income.
        Instead, our approach compares pollution, income, and consumption across U.S.
households and repeats the analysis separately each year from 1984 to 2002. Households within
a given year each face the same relative prices, available products, and environmental
regulations. In each year, we combine production-side pollution intensity data with detailed
information on household consumption to calculate the total pollution created as a result of
producing the goods and services that each household consumes. Plotting that indirect pollution
against those households’ incomes yields a set of annual EECs.
        We find that EECs display three key characteristics. First, not surprisingly, EECs are
upward sloping, reflecting that richer households are responsible for more overall pollution.
Second, EECs are concave, indicating that although pollution increases with income, it does so at
a decreasing rate. And third, EECs shift down over time, meaning that for any level of real
household income, households in later periods consume a less polluting mix of goods. Between
1984 and 2002 real household incomes in the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) grew by 13
percent, while the predicted pollution necessary to produce the goods those households
consumed decreased by 5 to 8 percent.4
        This reduction in pollution per dollar of expenditures at the household level must come
from one of two phenomena: either richer households consume a less pollution-intensive mix of
goods holding all else equal—a movement along a concave EEC—or households consumed
fewer polluting goods in 2002 than did households with the same real incomes in 1984—a
downward shift in the EECs. We show that the decline in pollution per dollar was about evenly
split between these two effects.


Data and Methods
        Estimating EECs requires information on household income and the pollution attributable
to each household’s consumption. Since we are focusing on indirect pollution, we estimate the

4
 Gertler et al. (2013) show that demand for energy-using assets such as refrigerators increases less than
proportionally with income in Mexico, which means that Engel curves for energy may be concave. But their data
cannot reveal whether those curves shift up or down over time as the country develops.

                                                       3
amount of pollution that was created in order to produce the specific goods and services
consumed by each individual household in our sample, using information from the Consumer
Expenditure Survey (CEX) and the Trade and Environmental Assessment Model (TEAM).
        The CEX is collected each quarter by the Census Bureau on behalf of the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics and provides detailed information on itemized household consumption
expenditures. It contains a nationally representative sample of roughly 7,000 households selected
on a rotating panel basis.5 Households are tracked for five consecutive quarters, over which they
provide information on a wide range of expenditures, income, and other demographics.
Expenditure and income data in the CEX interviews are organized into approximately 700
separate universal classification codes (UCC) and capture around 80 to 95 percent of total
household expenditures.6
        Each round of CEX contains households from every stage of the five-quarter interview
process. These data have been combined and extracted into a publicly available, user-friendly
format by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER, 2000). These extracts consolidate
records across interview rounds and provide a single record for each household showing annual
expenditure values. In addition, the roughly 700 UCC codes are collapsed into 109 spending and
income categories that remain consistent across all sample rounds. Of these expenditure
categories, 47 correspond to various goods and services, while the remaining categories cover
income, taxes and transfers, and measures of wealth. These consolidated data form the starting
place for our investigation.
        We pair the NBER CEX extracts with pollution intensity data from the TEAM, which
provides the pollution intensity of production for various goods and services. The TEAM
framework was originally developed for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to study the
environmental consequences of U.S. trade policies, but the model can be used to assess any


5
  The CEX is organized based on consumer units, rather than households. A consumer unit is smaller than a
household and consists of “(1) All members of a particular household who are related by blood, marriage, adoption,
or other legal arrangements; (2) a person living alone or sharing a household with others or living as a roomer in a
private home or lodging house or in permanent living quarters in a hotel or motel, but who is financially
independent; or (3) two or more persons living together who use their incomes to make joint expenditure decisions”
(U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2008). For convenience the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics occasionally treats the
terms “households” and “consumer units” interchangeably, and we follow suit.
6
  The interview survey collects detailed data covering 60 to 70 percent of household expenditures, along with global
estimates each period for food and related items that capture an additional 20 to 25 percent of expenditures. For
detailed information on the CEX, UCC codes, and the structure of the survey, see U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
(2008).

change in economic activity (Abt Associates Inc., 2009). TEAM has as its core a list of
emissions intensities by six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)
codes. For each of more than 1,000 industries, TEAM reports the amount of pollution emitted
per dollar of industrial output.
         The TEAM data indicate the pollution generated during the production process of each
good directly, but we also want to consider pollution from production of the inputs to those
goods. For example, if a household purchases a sofa, we would want to know not only the
pollution emitted while manufacturing of the sofa itself but also the pollution from tanning the
leather for its upholstery, milling the wood for its frame, and manufacturing the steel for its
springs. Moreover, each of those inputs also required their own inputs, which also resulted in
pollution. To fully capture the total pollution associated with each household’s consumption, we
want to include pollution from manufacturing the products consumed, inputs to those products,
and inputs to those inputs ad infinitum up the supply chain.
         Upstream pollution from the entire chain of inputs for each item can be estimated using a
Leontief (1970) analysis based on the input-output (IO) tables published by the U.S. Bureau of
Economic Analysis. These tables show the dollar amount of each input necessary to produce a
dollar’s worth of output for every other industry. Using the IO tables, we transform the TEAM
emissions intensities into measures that include the pollution to manufacture each final product,
all of its inputs, the inputs to those inputs, and so on.7
         Using these total pollution intensity coefficients combined with the CEX, we estimate the
total amount of pollution created in order to produce each of the goods consumed by every
household in the survey. Adding up pollution for all items within a household gives the total
amount of pollution attributable to the consumption of each household. As a last step, we
exclude any households with incomplete or partial-year income reporting and drop the top and
bottom 1 percent of households based on total expenditures to account for top-coding in the CEX
survey. The final result is a sample of 57,704 households spread across 19 annual cross sections
from 1984 to 2002, in which each household has an estimated total pollution associated with its

expenditures.8 We begin by focusing on particulate matter smaller than 10 microns (PM10)
because of its significant public health consequences and importance to cost-benefit analyses, but
we also show similar results for other major local air pollutants. Table 1 shows mean values for
indirect pollution, income, and other variables for 1984 and 2002.
         A few points are worth detailing here. First, because the CEX and TEAM use different
industry definitions, we manually created a concordance to match consumption items in the CEX
with the pollution intensity of industries in the TEAM. Since the TEAM coefficients (based on
NAICS codes) have more categories than the CEX, most CEX codes were matched to several
NAICS categories. We calculated the weighted average pollution intensity based on total output
for each NAICS code.9
         A second point involves our treatment of technology. One of the important changes
explaining the decline in pollution in the United States has been technological change, or the
technique effect.10 But since here we are interested in the income-driven composition effect—the
income–pollution relationship holding all else constant—one of the factors we hold constant is
technology. We apply the same 1997 TEAM emissions intensities to all cross sections of
consumption data, regardless of year, essentially calculating the predicted pollution generated to
manufacture households’ consumption choices, but holding constant the pollution intensity of
that production at 1997 levels.
         A third issue concerns international trade. One possible explanation for the decline in
U.S. pollution could be imports.11 If the United States imports more of the pollution-intensive
goods its residents consume, domestic pollution could decline with no change in consumption.
But once again, we want to hold changes in trade patterns constant. By using the U.S.-based
1997 TEAM coefficients for every year, we calculate the pollution that would have occurred
each year if all goods had been manufactured domestically using 1997 technology.




8
  We exclude CEX rounds prior to 1984 because this is the first year with integrated diary and interview data, and
the first year with both urban and rural households included (See U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2014). The year
2002 is the most recent CEX round with all four quarters available as NBER extracts.
9
  The NAICS was developed jointly by the United States, Mexico, and Canada to classify industries based on
similarities in production processes. The UCCs used in the CEX categorize goods based on similarities in
consumption patterns. A separate data appendix is available from the authors describing the matching between
NAICS and CEX categories.

   Brunel (2014) shows that this international trade component is small.

       Although the mechanics involved with estimating indirectly generated household
pollution has been complex, several aspect of EECs make their estimation simpler than
traditional Engel curves. For one, estimates of traditional Engel curves must account for the
obvious endogenity of income and consumption. Both income and consumption are at least
partly choice variables, so it is not clear whether people choose the goods they consume based on
their incomes or choose their incomes in order to purchase the goods they desire to consume.
Estimating traditional Engel curves therefore involves tricky issues of identification (Blundel et
al., 2007). But with EECs, we believe we are safe assuming people do not concern themselves
with the pollution indirectly generated to produce the goods and services they desire when
choosing how hard to work or what jobs to take. The pollution might affect their choice of goods
if they are environmentally conscious but probably not their level of income. Income is thus
arguably exogenous with respect to the pollution content of household consumption.
       A second challenge to estimating traditional Engel curves is determining the appropriate
degree of aggregation. Demand for narrow categories can vary widely across households and
over time, making patterns difficult to discern. But broader categories may combine inferior and
normal goods and mask the shapes of the underlying Engel curves. The Engel curve for beef may
be ambiguously shaped if hamburger is a necessity and steak a luxury. When estimating EECs,
however, the overall pollution created indirectly as a result of each household’s consumption
matters, not the specific consumption of individual goods or services.
       One challenge that applies equally to ordinary and environmental Engel curves involves
prices and quality. If richer households purchase more expensive, higher quality goods, they may
spend more on those goods without consuming larger physical quantities or being responsible for
more pollution. Because we estimate pollution by multiplying itemized expenditures by per-
dollar pollution intensity coefficients, expensive items are assigned more pollution than
inexpensive items. For example, if rich and poor households each purchase one bottle of wine,
but the rich households’ wine is pricier, our EECs will falsely attribute more pollution to the rich
households even if both bottles were produced in the same manner. This results in a bias against
finding that EECs are concave. Any concavity we find in those EECs and any share of the
cleanup we attribute to that concavity can thus be interpreted as a conservative estimate.




                                                 7
Nonparametric Estimates of Environmental Engel Curves
        No theory dictates the form of the income-pollution relationship, so we begin by
examining the shape and structure of the EECs with as few restrictions as possible.12 We first
separate households in the 1984 cross section of the CEX into 50 groups based on income, where
each group represents 2 percent of the overall 1984 income distribution. Then we calculate the
average level of pollution associated with households’ consumption within each group. Plotting
these 50 points with income on the horizontal axis and pollution on the vertical axis yields a non-
parametric EEC for 1984. This EEC for PM10 is shown as the top line in Figure 1. Average
pollution is calculated using 1997 TEAM coefficients, so this EEC represents the pollution
associated with household consumption in 1984 if all goods and services were produced in the
United States using 1997 production technology. A household in the 25th income bin ($32,128 to
$33,999, measured in 1997 dollars) would have been indirectly responsible for an average of 147
tons of PM10.
        To observe how the EEC relationship may be evolving over time, Figure 1 also depicts a
second EEC estimated using the 2002 CEX paired with the 1997 TEAM coefficients. In order to
keep the two curves directly comparable, we use the same income bin cutoff values in the 2002
EEC as are used in the 1984 EEC.13 Households with income in 2002 between $32,128 and
$33,999 would have been indirectly responsible for 132 tons of PM10 on average, 15 fewer tons
than households earning the same income in 1984.
        Three phenomena are apparent from the set of EECs shown in Figure 1. First, richer
households are responsible for more overall pollution. This is not surprising since richer
households spend more on consumption and are therefore expected to have more pollution
created as a result of producing the goods and services they consume.
        Second, EECs are concave, meaning that richer households consume less pollution-
intensive mixes of goods and services, even if they are responsible for more overall pollution.14


12
   Common approaches others have taken range from simply plotting the data to nonparametric kernel estimation
(Lewbel, 1991; Hausman, et al. 1995).
13
   In this case, each point of the 2002 EEC does not represent an equal number of households. Income growth
between 1984 and 2002 led to a rightward shift of the income distribution, but since income bin cutoff values are
determined based on the 1984 income distribution, relatively fewer households fall in low bins and relatively more
households fall in higher bins.
14
   Under standard Engel curve definitions, goods whose consumption increases with income are considered
“normal,” and among normal goods, those whose consumption increases less than one-for-one are considered
“necessities.” Pollution, according to these EECs, is a necessity.

                                                         8
Although much of the concavity appears at the top of the income distribution, rich households
account for more spending. As a result, concavity has large effects on overall pollution, as we
show later. And in fact, the EECs’ concavity in Figure 1 may be understated if richer households
consume more expensive versions of the same goods.
       Third, the set of EECs in Figure 1 suggest that EECs are shifting down over time. The
shape and concavity are generally consistent in both years, but households represented by the
2002 EEC are responsible for less pollution than their 1984 counterparts with similar real
incomes. These EECs suggest that households with similar real incomes adjusted the
composition of their consumption toward a less pollution-intensive mix of goods and services
over time. This downward shift is not due to improvements in technology or abatement because
we have fixed the pollution intensity of production using the 1997 TEAM coefficients for both
years. Instead, the shift over time observed in Figure 1 reflects a change in consumption due to
some combination of changing prices, regulations, or social norms.
       One possible concern about the EECs in Figure 1 involves the progressivity of the U.S.
tax system. Because the EECs are based on total household income reported to the CEX and
higher income households pay a higher share of their income in taxes, the EECs in Figure 1 may
have exaggerated concavity. Richer households might appear to be responsible for less pollution
per dollar of income simply because they pay a higher fraction of their incomes in taxes. To
account for this, we repeat the analysis using after-tax income on the horizontal axis in Figure 2a.
The concavity and downward shift of the EECs appear similar.
       A similar concern involves savings rates. The EECs in Figure 1 may appear concave
because richer households save a higher fraction of their incomes. To account for that concern
we repeat the analysis with total consumption expenditure on the horizontal axis in Figure 2b.
Again the concavity and downward shift remain apparent, if less pronounced.
       One drawback of the otherwise flexible approach to estimating EECs depicted in Figures
1 and 2 is that they do not account for additional factors that may affect household consumption.
Households appear to have consumed a less pollution-intensive mix of goods and services in
2002 than in 1984, but an alternative explanation for the downward shift in the EECs may be that
average household sizes decreased. Or perhaps the changes were due to migration patterns as the
U.S. population shifted toward regions with different climates and transportation infrastructures.
Table 1 shows the change in average indirect pollution and income for U.S. households between

                                                 9
1984 and 2002, along with changes in demographic variables. Over this period, the average
indirect PM10 emissions decreased 6 percent (from 155 tons to 146 tons), while average real
income increased 13 percent (from $40,970 to $46,370). At the same time, the average
household became older, smaller, better educated, more urban, and more likely to live in the
South and West. To account for these changes, we turn to a parametric estimate of the EECs.


Parametric Estimates of Environmental Engel Curves
       To account for household characteristics aside from income that affect the quantity and
mix of goods and services consumed, we estimate a series of linear regressions with household
pollution on the left-hand side and income, income squared, and other covariates on the right-
hand side:
                                 P =         +        +       +                              (1)
where P and       are pollution and income associated with individual households in the CEX,
and     is a vector of other covariates. The coefficients are indexed by t because we run separate
regressions for each year to obtain a set of annual coefficients. Column (1) of Table 2 shows a
version of that regression for PM10 pollution with only the income quadratic, excluding all the
other household characteristics, using the 1984 cross section of the CEX. Coefficients on both
income terms are significantly different from zero (19.0 and −0.39) and corroborate the
increasing and concave EECs depicted in Figure 1.
       The second column of Table 2 adds additional control variables for age, household size,
marital status, indicators for race and education of the household head, and regional indicators.
Nearly all covariates are statistically significantly correlated with total PM10. Overall the results
suggest that larger families, older households with more education, and non-Black households in
the East were indirectly responsible for more pollution. All these differences stem from
underlying differences in consumption. More educated households spend more on food, airfare,
and clothing. Households in the East spent more on food, natural gas, and electricity.
       Including these additional household characteristics also has a substantial effect on the
shape of the EEC. The income coefficients both decrease (to 10.28 for income and -0.13 for




                                                 10
income squared). But the estimated EEC is still upward sloping and concave (although the
squared income term is only statistically significant at the 10 percent level).15
        To compare the EECs across time, columns (3) and (4) of Table 2 repeat the regression
from column (2) using the 1993 and 2002 cross sections of the NBER CEX extracts (the middle
and last years of available extracts). The coefficients on income and income squared in 2002
relative to 1984 suggest an EEC that is lower and less concave in recent years. Column (5) of
Table 2 shows the difference between coefficients in 1984 and 2002 (from columns (2) and (4))
and indicates whether there is a statistically significant difference. Older high school graduates
were responsible for proportionally less pollution in 2002 than in 1984, whereas western and
rural households were responsible for more.
        Figure 3 plots the predicted relationship between income and PM10 pollution based on
the EECs estimated in columns (2) and (4) of Table 2. Each line is drawn by fixing the other
covariates aside from income at their average values for their respective years. So the EECs in
Figure 3 plot income expansion paths holding other observable household characteristics
constant. These parametrically estimated EECs mirror those without controlling for the other
household characteristics: they are upward-sloping, concave, and shift down over time.
        The same patterns observed for PM10 are also apparent in EECs based on other common
air pollutants. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2),
and carbon monoxide (CO) all exhibit similar income expansion paths to that of PM10. Table 3
shows coefficient estimates for parametric EECs for these other air pollutants using the 1984
cross section of the CEX. We calculate total emissions due to household consumption using the
same technique as in Table 2 and utilize the same set of demographic control variables. In all
cases, the coefficient on income is positively and statistically significant. For all pollutants
except CO, the effect of income squared is negative and statistically significant. Further, the sign
and significance of other covariates is consistent with the PM10 EEC across different pollutant
types. The hallmark attributes of the individual PM10 EECs—upward sloping, concave, and
shifting down over time—are also exhibited by other common air pollutants.16

15
   To account for potential nonlinear EECs beyond a quadratic form, we also ran regressions including higher-order
polynomial terms (cubics and quartics). They captured much of the influence of the income variable, which was no
longer individually significant, but the joint significance of income terms, fitted values, and goodness-of-fit
remained essentially the same.
16
   Engel curves drawn for VOC, NOx, SO2, and CO closely resemble those drawn for PM10 in Figure 3 and are
available from the authors.

An Application: Decomposing the Composition Effects
        Movements along and shifts in the EECs affect the level of pollution embodied in the
goods and services consumed by households, but there is an important distinction between the
two effects. Movements along the EEC depend on underlying preferences of richer households
relative to poorer households. The environmental consequences of movement along the EEC are
independent of any particular policy intervention. In this sense, movements along the EEC may
be predictive of future levels of pollution under status quo environmental regulations if
household incomes increase but nothing else changes.
        In contrast, shifts in the EEC are the direct result of evolving aggregate preferences or
environmental policies that change the relative supply and demand for pollution-intensive goods.
There is no reason to expect the environmental benefits of downward shifting EECs to continue
without the accompanying change in preferences or tightening of environmental policy.
        Comparing annual sets of EECs allows us to decompose changes in this indirect
household pollution into a component due to income growth (a movement along the EEC) and a
component due to aggregate conditions (a shift in the EEC). For example, we could use the 1984
EEC to assign a hypothetical level of total PM10 to each household in 2002. This would tell us
how much pollution to expect if the EEC was fixed based on 1984 conditions, but households
move along the EEC as their incomes change. The difference between this hypothetical level of
PM10 and the actual emissions (after holding production technology constant) is due to shifts in
the EEC between 1984 and 2002.
        The Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition provides a formal way of separating these
components.17 Define the average level of pollution in a given year based on the regressions
from Table 2:
                                          P =         +         +                                        (2)

where P is average indirect pollution,          and       are average income and income squared, and
is the average of other included covariates. The error term disappears because the average error
in ordinary least squares (OLS) is zero by construction.

Lemiuex, and Firpo (2010).

                                                       12
       Then based on equation (2), the change in average pollution between 1984 and 2002 can
be written as:
                              P −P        =            +               +
                                                                                                    (3)
                                              −            −               −
By adding and subtracting             +                +                   and grouping terms, we have:
                          P −P       =            −            +               −

                                          +       −                +           −                    (4)

                                          +            −           +           −
       The first two terms in equation (4) capture the effect of changing income on total
pollution, holding constant the 1984 OLS coefficients. This is equivalent to a movement along
the 1984 EEC. The second two terms capture the effect of different OLS coefficients on income
and income squared in 2002 relative to 1984. This is equivalent to a shift (or change in shape) of
the EEC. Finally, the last two terms account for changes in all other covariates, including
demographics, migration, and household size, and their changing coefficients.
       Table 4 presents the results of this decomposition. Consider column (1), for PM10. Each
row is calculated by multiplying the change in average values of the variable (column (3) of
Table 1) by the 1984 OLS coefficients (column (2) of Table 2) and represents the change in
pollution predicted by the change in that particular variable. At the bottom of Table 4 we have
grouped these effects into those due to income, or movement along the EEC, and those due to
other covariates. The level of total particulates (PM10) embodied in the average household’s
consumption decreased 9.5 tons between 1984 and 2002 (from Table 1). Changes in average
income and income squared led to a hypothetical increase of 4.16 tons (5.55 increase from
income and 1.39 decrease from income squared). At the same time, changing demographics
offset this increase by 2.71 tons. The remaining difference, 10.93 tons, is attributable to shifts in
the EEC.
       Columns (2) through (5) of Table 4 present similar analyses for VOC, NOx, SO2, and CO.
The scale effects and offsetting compositional shifts due to changes in average income resulted
in modest increases in emissions (3.63 tons, 3.95 tons, 0.91 tons, and 14.84 tons, respectively).
Unlike the case of PM10, these increases were not substantially offset by the effects of




                                                      13
demographic changes. But like PM10, the remaining portions of the total changes for each
pollutant in Table 4 were large, ranging from 2.18 tons for SO2 to 36.88 tons for CO.
       The increases in emissions due to changes in household income, such as the 4.16 ton
increase in PM10, can be further decomposed into separate household-level scale and
composition components. Along a given EEC, richer households consume more goods and
services overall, but they also consume a less pollution-intensive mix relative to poorer
households. The balance of these two effects depends on the shape of the EEC. To the extent that
EECs are more concave, the compositional component is stronger and households with higher
income are responsible for less than proportionally more pollution. On the other hand, two
perfectly straight EECs would indicate a pure scale effect, with pollution growing at the same
rate as income.
       Table 5 summarizes these calculations, decomposing changes in pollution derived from
household consumption into those due to the scale of income growth, the composition of
consumption, movements along the EEC, shifts in the EEC, and other demographic changes.
Column (1) repeats the predicted change in household pollution, holding technology fixed, from
Table 1. All five pollutants decline due to changes in household demographics and the scale and
composition of household consumption. The second column describes the household-level scale
effect. Between 1984 and 2002 average household income increased 13 percent. With no
compositional shift in consumption, we would expect emissions of each pollutant in Table 5 to
also increase by 13 percent. In the case of PM10, we would see an increase of 20.4 tons. The
difference between columns (1) and (2)—29.9 tons of PM10—represents the reduction in
pollution collectively explained by movement along the 1984 EEC, changes in household
demographics, or shifts in the EECs over time.
       The difference between the 20.4 ton increase in PM10 and our movement-related
estimate of 4.16 from Table 4 represents the mitigating effect of compositional shifts along the
1984 EEC. In this case, compositional changes in consumption along the EEC offset 16.3 tons of
PM10 from the scale effect, reported in column (4) of Table 5. In total, the sum of the
compositional offsets (-16.3 from movement along the EEC and -10.9 tons from shifts in the
EEC) together with the effects of demographics (-2.71 tons) counteract the scale effect (20.4
increase) to equal the overall predicted change of -9.5 tons.



                                                 14
        A key conclusion from Table 5 is that movements along the EECs and shifts in the EECs
are about equally responsible for reductions in household pollution. This can be seen by
comparing columns (4) and (8), which set aside the demographic changes in column (6) and the
technique changes that are held constant throughout. Column (4) contains the pollution reduction
due to movements along the concave EEC, and column (8) contains the pollution reductions due
to shifts in the EEC between 1984 and 2002. They are of approximately equal magnitude.
Columns (5) and (9) of Table 5 express these two effects—movements and shifts—as
percentages of the overall pollution decline to be explained in column (3). We find that
movements along EECs explain 46 to 54 percent of the overall compositional effect and shifts in
the EECs explain 37 to 56 percent. But the fundamental point is similar across pollutants.
Changes in the goods and services households consumed between 1984 and 2002 were
responsible for large declines in the pollution those households were indirectly responsible for.
And those changes are about evenly split between those due to growing household incomes
along concave EECs and those due to downward shifts of the EECs over time.
        Figure 4 depicts the relative magnitude of these effects for PM10 over time by applying
the same decomposition to all interim years between 1984 and 2002. The top line depicts the
level of pollution that would occur if the proportions of goods and services households consumed
remained constant as household incomes grew. That is the scale effect at the household level.18
The second line captures the hypothetical effect of movements along the 1984 EEC. The vertical
difference between these two lines (16.3 tons in 2002) is the offsetting compositional effect
reflected in the concavity of EECs. The third line shows the contribution of changing
demographics in addition to changing income and falls below the second line because the
balance of other factors, such as household size, education, and geography, led to a net decrease
in the pollution intensity of consumption.
        The fourth line of Figure 4 shows the predicted level of pollution in each year calculated
by pairing the 1997 TEAM pollution coefficients with each round of the NBER CEX extracts.
This is the level of pollution that would occur if technology were fixed based on 1997 pollution
intensities, but where we account for the true mix of goods and services consumed by households


18
  A curious feature of our CEX data is that real household incomes did not grow between 1984 and 1985. Hence all
of the changes we describe in Table 5 stem from income growth in later years. But the predicted changes in
household-level pollution coming from movements along the Engel curves are derived from comparisons across
households with different incomes in 1984.

                                                      15
in each period. The vertical distance between the third and fourth lines (10.9 tons in 2002) is due
to downward shifts in the EEC over time.
       Similar figures drawn for the other four pollutants in Table 5 all make the same point.
Shifts in the mix of goods and services consumed by the average household have more than
offset any pollution increase due to growth in the scale of household income growth. About half
of those composition changes come solely from the fact that richer households consume a less
pollution-intensive mix of goods, and the other half comes from the fact that households at every
income level consume a less pollution-intensive mix in 2002 than they did in 1984.


Conclusion
       Over the past 30 years, overall pollution in the United States has declined despite
increases in total production. Some of this improvement has come from employing cleaner
production technologies in cars and factories, but much of it comes as a result of consuming a
cleaner mix of goods and services. Has this cleaner consumption been a consequence of
economy-wide trends, such as regulation-induced price changes, or an underlying and possibly
coincidental preference by richer households for cleaner goods? Environmental Engel curves
describing the relationship between income and the pollution-intensity of household
consumption provide a means for disentangling these two effects.
       Whether estimated parametrically or non-parametrically, EECs display three key
characteristics: they are increasing, concave, and shifting down over time. These characteristics
allow us to decompose changes in the pollution associated with household consumption into
movements along the EEC and shifts in the EEC. Between 1984 and 2002 we find that
compositional changes in consumption due to movements along EECs and downward shifts of
EECs more than offset the 13 percent increase in household incomes. For five common air
pollutants, about half the overall offsetting compositional effect was due to movements along
EECs and the other half to shifts in the EECs.
       This distinction between movements along the EECs and shifts in the EECs is critical. An
important reason pollution in the United States has not increased one-for-one with income
growth is that households have moved away from pollution-intensive goods and services. Our
analysis shows that this change is not entirely automatic. Rich households in any given year do
consume a mix of goods proportionally less pollution-intensive than lower-income households.

                                                 16
Given higher incomes and no other changes, 1984 households would have consumed a cleaner
mix of goods, and that accounts for about half of the overall household shift. But households
with the same real incomes consumed a cleaner mix of goods in 2002 than they did in 1984, an
improvement that accounts for an approximately equal shift and must come from changes to
aggregate conditions, such as prices, social norms, or environmental policies.
       In the end, decomposing income growth into movements along and shifts in the EECs
represents just one aspect of the environmental consequences of economic growth. A large
portion of the cleanup in the United States comes from changes in technology, the composition
of production, and the pollution intensity of U.S. imports and exports. Nevertheless, isolating the
consumption-related compositional changes in pollution suggests that household-level
composition changes have more than offset the increased pollution from growing household
incomes.

Notes: Estimates are based on Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions. Movement along each EEC can be calculated by multiplying the
coefficients in Tables 2 and 3 by the corresponding changes in Table 1. Pollution is estimated based on 1997 production technology for all
years. Values for race, education, and regional indicators are the combined effect for each category.
*Figures are statistically significant at the 5 percent level.

Notes: The total change in pollution is predicted using CEX and TEAM data, based on 1997 production technology. The scale increase in pollution is
calculated by multiplying pollution levels in 1984 by the proportional increase in income between 1984 and 2002. The total spread is calculated as the
difference between the predicted change from the TEAM and the predicted increase due to the scale effect. Offsets in column (4) are calculated by
subtracting the predicted level of pollution, including scale effects and movements along the EEC, from the scale effect alone (in column (2)). Offsets
due to demographic changes are calculated in an analogous manner. Offsets due to shifts in the EEC are calculated as the residual, and the offsets in
columns (4), (6), and (8) sum to column (3) by construction. Figures in columns (4) through (9) are based on EECs estimated in Tables 2 and 3.

Notes: The scale effect is calculated by increasing pollution in proportion to real income growth. Movements along
and shifts in the EEC are calculated by estimating pollution in each year using the 1984 EEC coefficients. Pollution
predicted by TEAM is estimated by matching itemized consumption expenditure in each year with 1997 TEAM
pollution intensity data.
