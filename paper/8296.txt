1         Introduction

This paper examines the role of lumpy consumer durables and market power

in generating endogenous cycles. The idea we model is simple. When goods

are durable, past consumption choices determine the current market size

which consists of consumers who have not purchased the good previously.

Larger past sales, ceteris paribus, thus naturally result in a smaller current

market size. In this manner, the seeds of a downturn are sown in an upturn.

        The properties of the cycles predicted by our model are consistent with

a number of empirical regularities. Among the stylized facts on business

cycles are pro-cyclical real wages, counter-cyclical prices, and durable good

consumption being more volatile than output.1 A more detailed discussion

of the empirical implications can be found in Section 3.1.

        Expenditure on consumer durables is often seen as a leading indicator for

business cycles and there is considerable evidence that consumer durables

play an important role in the business cycle. For example, Olney (1999)

argues that the debt incurred for consumer durables, like cars, helped create

the Great Depression. As consumers burdened with high debt cut spending,

output fell as did factor demand, reducing proÞts and wages which in turn

further reduced demand and this spiralled into the Great Depression. Gordon
    1
    Stock and Watson (1999), Cooley and Prescott (1995), and King and Rebelo (1999)
report that prices are counter-cyclical, and durable good consumption is pro-cyclical and
volatile. Barsky, Parker and Solon (1994) and Bils (1987) argue that when measured
correctly real wages are pro-cyclical.




                                           1
(1980) argues that the 1955 surge in the automobile market led a general

boom in the economy.

       Our work relates to three strands of literature: indivisibilities, endogenous

business cycles, and durable good monopoly. The literature on indivisibil-

ities has dealt with the non convex production sets created by indivisibili-

ties,2 with indivisibilities in investment or R&D leading to spurts of activity,3

and with indivisibilities in labor supply raising the intertemporal elasticity

of labor supply.4 However, there has been little work on indivisibilities in

consumption.

       We model a a zero-one kind of indivisibility in consumption: individu-

als buy one unit or none and cannot resell the good which lasts for only

two periods. This zero-one form is meant to reßect the idea that the good

must be of a minimum size.5 In practice, there are ways to make such goods

non-durable and divisible such as renting or sharing their services. However,

to the extent that it is more costly to rent than buy and because of prob-

lems sharing durables, these are not perfect substitutes.6 For simplicity, we

abstract from such alternatives.

     See, for instance, Rogerson (1988).
   5
     It is not possible to downsize endlessly as a way of reducing the extent of lumpiness:
after all, a refrigerator has to be of a minimum size to be able to hold the needed perishables
and a car can only be so small.
   6
     At low income levels, even clothing is seen as indivisible good. One of the most
successful projects undertaken by the World Bank involved subsidizing purchases of wood
stoves. The initial cost of such stoves, around 10 to 25 dollars, prohibited their widespread
usage although they are more eﬃcient than native stoves made of mud.



                                              2
       The business cycle literature provides several models in which cycles may

arise endogenously. One route is via dynamic models where, for some pa-

rameter values, the economy does not converge to a steady state, but to a

limit cycle, see for example, Diamond and Fudenberg (1989). Cycles may

also emerge through expectational eﬀects which could be related to exoge-

nous variables like “animal spirits” as in Howitt and McAfee (1992), or to

endogenous variables like prices and interest rates as in Grandmont (1985).

In these models, both cyclical as well as non-cyclical behavior is possible. A

third route for cycles to arise is via persistent exogenous shocks which get

propagated through the system as in the real business cycles literature. See

King and Rebelo (1999) for a survey of this literature.7 In contrast to the

above literature, endogenous cycles arise generically in our model. Past pric-

ing decisions leads to current demand conditions, and this results in endoge-

nous business cycles in the absence of any exogenous shocks or expectational

eﬀects.

       The literature on durable goods has focused on the price path chosen

by a durable good monopolist in a partial equilibrium setting.8 By assum-

ing that consumers are inÞnitely lived and continually replenished, Conlisk,

Gerstner and Sobel (1984) argue that pricing behavior of a durable good mo-
   7
     There has been much criticism of standard RBC models in terms of their ability to
generate cycles which match the data. Large shocks are needed to generate the needed
supply response given the fairly low intertemporal supply elasticities usually estimated,
and persistent shocks are needed to generate cycles.
   8
     See, for example, Stokey (1979) and Bulow (1982).




                                           3
nopolist could exhibit cycles in a stationary environment due to endogenous

ßuctuations in market size.

        We focus on the general rather than partial equilibrium implications. We

also move away from the standard focus on inter temporal price discrimina-

tion by ensuring that consumers always prefer buying now to later.

        The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we develop the goods

and factor market equilibria. Section 3 looks at why endogenous cycles arise

under the assumption that Þrms are identical. Section 4 generalizes our

results to the case where Þrms are allowed to diﬀer in the demand conditions

they face. We also look at the role of income distribution and argue that

a more equal distribution of income could make cycles deeper. Section 5

shows that allowing forward looking behavior on the producers’ side or credit

markets does not alter our basic results. Section 6 concludes.9


2         The Model

This paper builds on the model developed in Krishna and Yavas (2000).

The model is constructed to allow an elementary presentation. While its

components are standard, the model itself is new.
    9
    An Appendix, available on request, includes calculations for a special case which we
use as an illustration.




                                           4
2.1       Assumptions

There are two types of goods in the economy: One divisible non durable,

and for now, non storable, good produced under perfect competition, and a

continuum of durable goods, indexed by θ ∈ [0, 1], each produced by a proÞt

maximizing monopolist.10 In each period, a new set of individuals arrives in

the economy. Each individual lives for two periods. In each period of his

life he derives utility from the consumption of the non durable good and of

a speciÞc type of durable good. We assume that used durables cannot be

resold.11 Thus, consumers who buy the durable good in the second period of

their lives get only one period of use.

       Individuals are heterogenous in two dimensions. Individual (θ, γ) has a

potential demand for one unit of the durable good θ ∈ [0, 1] and his pro-

ductivity is γ ∈ [0, 1]. We assume that each consumer derives utility V each

period from his durable good, and that V is large. Thus, he would purchase

the durable good as soon as he could even if prices are expected to fall in

the following period. This, of course, makes indirect utility discontinuous:

consumers who are just able to buy the good are signiÞcantly better oﬀ than

those with a slightly smaller income.12
  10
     It should be possible to generalize this to oligopoly at the cost of some complexity.
  11
     This could occur beacuse of transactions costs or the lemons’ problem associated with
resale.
  12
     Although we assume below that V is very high, that agents live for only two peri-
ods, and that the non durable good has constant marginal utility, these assumptions are
made for simplicity. Diminishing marginal utility and a low V results in some of the non
durable good being purchased before the durable one making the indirect utility function
continuous, though non convex. See Ng (1965). This would aﬀect the exact form of the


                                            5
    At each point of time, new consumers have an equal probability of having

a potential demand for any θ so that there is a uniform distribution over

θ. We assume throughout that γ and θ are independently distributed, and

these distributions are time invariant. This ensures that all monopolists face

the same problem if they inherit the same set of old consumers. The set

of consumers who have a demand for the durable good θ are of measure

zero relative to the set of all consumers. Thus, the pricing behavior of a

monopolist does not have any general equilibrium eﬀects.13 Durable good

Þrms are monopolists, and therefore they set prices to maximize their proÞts.

Thus, there tends to be too little of the durable good made.

    We will use Assumption 1 below whenever concreteness is called for, and

will draw the diagrams given this assumption. However, we present the result

in a manner that shows they are more generally valid.


Assumption 1 New individuals are distributed uniformly over the unit

      square in each period with unit density.

2.2     Factor Market

Labor is the only factor of production in the economy. We normalize the size

of each generation at unity. As there are two cohorts, the size of the labor
demand curve facing producers but not its nature. Similarly, allowing many generations
of agents would just increase the complexity of the model and not aﬀect the basic results.
  13
     The assumption that there are a continuum of Þrms and agents removes the familiar
“Numeraire Problem” in the literature. It makes the choice of a numeraire irrelevant as
no individual incorporates the general equilibrium eﬀect of his actions into his decision
making.


                                            6
force at any given period is 2. Workers with productivity γ make γ units

of the non durable good and they produce αγ units of output in durables.

Workers in the durable good sector are compensated according to a piece

rate wage, w. We take the non durable good to be the numeraire. A worker

with productivity γ will have an earning of γ in the non durable good sector.

The same worker will produce αγ units of output in the durable good sector,

and earn αγw. For both goods to be produced in equilibrium the wage has to

be equal to α1 . If the piece-rate wage in durables, w, is greater than α1 , then

all workers prefer to work making durables. Marginal cost of production in

the durable good sector is constant at the piece rate wage, so c = α1 . Note

that the allocation of labor between the two sectors will be determined by

the demand for labor in the durable good sector.


Assumption 2 α > 1.


       As explained later, this assumption ensures that the durable good sector

is viable.

2.3        Goods Market

To begin with we focus on the symmetric case, and assume that consumers

cannot save or borrow so that consumers spend their entire income in each

period.14 An individual’s income consists of two components. The Þrst com-

ponent is labor earnings. As discussed in the previous section, this depends
  14
       As shown in Section 5.2, this assumption is not central.


                                               7
on the productivity of the individual, with higher productivity individuals

earning more. The second component of the income is the proÞt share. For

concreteness we focus on two extreme cases. These are described as Assump-

tion 3(a) and 3(b) below.


Assumption 3(a) ProÞts accrue only to consumers with very high values

     of γ.


   In this case Þrms choose not to sell only to the very rich as they can

at most charge them V and they are small in number, but to the broader

market.


Assumption 3(b) ProÞts are equally distributed across all individuals in

     the economy.


   In this case each individual is entitled to 12 Π as his proÞt share as the

total population (labor force and hence consumers) in the economy is 2.

   Let P be the price of a durable good. Let Π(γ) denote the proÞt share

for an individual with productivity γ. Thus, an individual with productivity

γ has income of Π(γ) + γ so that he will purchase his durable good if


                               P ≤ Π(γ) + γ


assuming that he does not already have it. The balance of his income is

spent on the non durable good.


                                     8
   The demand function facing a typical durable good Þrm given the pro-

portion of young consumers served in the previous period, λt−1 , and expected

aggregate proÞts of Πt is denoted by D(P, Πt , λt−1 ). Figures 1(a) and (b) de-

pict demand under our standing assumptions and Assumption 3(a) and (b)

respectively.

   First consider what happens if there are no old consumers, i.e., λt−1 = 1,

and aggregate proÞts are zero, i.e., demand is D(P, 0, 1). This is depicted

in Figure 1 by the line Dd which gives the proportion of young individuals

with a productivity higher than the price, P . If proÞts exist and go only

to the most productive, who are a small part of the population, then only

their demand could be aﬀected by changes in Π. Willingness to pay equals

the lower of total earnings and V. If earnings exceed V for all these agents,

demand is unaﬀected as depicted in Figure 1(a) by V JT D.

   If proÞts are equally distributed, changes in Π move the demand curve
                Π
vertically as   2
                    is added to each individual’s income and his willingness to pay
                                           Π
for the durable good. At a price of        2
                                                all individuals can aﬀord the durable
                                     Π
good, and as price falls below       2
                                         there are no further increases in demand.

Hence we obtain a demand curve with a vertical segment as depicted in

Figure 1(b) as EeD.

   The existence of some old individuals who have not previously purchased

the durable good causes a kink in the demand curve. The kink occurs at

the point on D(P, Π, 1) vertically above λt−1 , that is, at F in Figure 1. The

demand curve intersects the horizontal axis at (2 − λt−1 ). At prices below

the kink, a unit reduction in the price level will result in twice the increase

in the demand relative to that above the kink. The resulting demand curve,

D(.), is given by V JT F H in Figure 1(a) and EF HK in Figure 1(b) and is

the maximum of the two curves, V JT D and IH in Figure 1(a) and EeD

and IHK in Figure 1(b). We denote the steeper curve where only the young

are served, by D∗ (.), and the ßatter one by D̂(.).


3     Symmetric Equilibrium

The endogenous variables in the system at time t consist of the proÞts earned

by each Þrm, denoted by π t , the proportion of young individuals served,

denoted by λt , and the price charged by Þrms making the durable good, Pt .

In this section we assume that the proportion of young consumers served in

period t − 1, λt−1 , is the same for all Þrms. This assumption is relaxed in

Section 4.

    It is easy to derive the proÞt maximizing choice of the Þrm for given levels

of aggregate proÞts, Πt , and λt−1 . Since there is a unit mass of identical Þrms

in this model, the proÞts of each Þrm equal aggregate proÞts in the symmetric

equilibrium. Setting these equal gives the proÞts in symmetric equilibrium

at time t. Knowing the equilibrium level of proÞts then enables one to Þnd

the remaining endogenous variables including the state variable in the next

period, λt .


                                       11
       Consider the output choice of an individual Þrm at a given level of λt−1

and Π. There are three candidates for the proÞt maximizing output choice of

each monopolist. Firms never choose to serve the whole market as it is not

proÞtable as argued later. Thus, his optimal choice must lie either along the

ßatter part of the demand curve, or the steeper part of the demand curve.

       Let π(Π, λt−1 ) be the proÞts along D(.), while π ∗ (Π) and π̂(Π, λt−1 ) de-

note the proÞts along D∗ (.) and D̂(.) respectively.15 Demand is given by D∗ (.)

for high prices and by D̂(.) for lower ones. An increase in λt−1 increases the

region over which D∗ (.) is relevant as it shifts D̂(.) down vertically, but does

not aﬀect the level of D∗ (.). Note that demand becomes more elastic, and

π P jumps up at the kink. Since π P along both D∗ (.) and D̂(.) is downward

sloping due to concavity of π ∗ and π̂, the Þrst order condition, π P = 0, can

never be satisÞed at the kink. In other words, proÞts are maximized either

along D∗ (.), above the kink, or along D̂(.), below the kink, but never at the

kink.

       Figure 2(a) and (b) depict π ∗ (Π) and π̂(Π, λt−1 ) under Assumption 3(a)

and (b) respectively.


Lemma 1 Under Assumption 3(a), both π ∗ (Π) and π̂(Π, λt−1 ) are indepen-

dent of Π and hence weakly convex in Π. Under Assumption 3(b) both π ∗ (Π)

as well as π̂(Π, λt−1 ) are increasing functions of aggregate proÞts with slopes
  15
    We will use the following convention from here on to simplify the notation. The
absence of P as a variable indicates that the function is a value function as P has been
maximized out.

 less than unity, are convex in Π, and π̂(Π, λt−1 ) is steeper than π ∗ (Π). Given

 Assumption 2, both have positive intercepts.

Proof: Let P ∗ (Q, Π), P̂ (Q, Π, λt−1 ) and P (Q, Π, λt−1 ) denote the inverse de-

        mand curves corresponding to D∗ (.), D̂(.) and D(.), respectively. An

        increase in Π has no eﬀect on demand under Assumption 3(a). Hence

        in Figure 2(a), π ∗ (Π) = π ∗ and π̂(Π, λt−1 ) = π̂(λt−1 ) are horizontal.

        For high (low) λt−1 , π ∗ exceeds (falls short of) π̂(λt−1 ). As λt−1 rises,

        π̂(λt−1 ) falls. At λt−1 = λ̃ the two lines coincide.

        Under Assumption 3(b) an increase in proÞts shifts demand upward by
        Π
        2
          .   Firms choose Q = Q(Π, λt−1 ) to maximize π(Q, Π, λt−1 ). Using the

        envelope theorem gives

                       dπ(Π, λt−1 )    ∂
                                    =     ((P (Q, Π, λt−1 ) − c)Q)

        If there were no sales in the previous period, then sales would be at

        most equal to 2. If sales were at this maximum possible level, proÞts

        would rise one for one with aggregate proÞts. However, sales are less

        than this maximum so that both π ∗ (Π) and π̂(Π, λt−1 ) are ßatter than

        the 450 line as depicted in Figure 2(b).16
   16
     Note that if a Þrm sells to the entire market when aggregate proÞts are zero, then
 individual proÞts must be negative since price is zero and cost is positive. This results in
 a negative intercept for the individual proÞt curve and no intersection with the 450 line
 in Figure 2.

                                             14
       The proÞt maxima along D̂ and D∗ lie along rays emanating from c as

       drawn in Figure 1.17 Suppose that for a given level of aggregate proÞts,

       the proÞts along D̂ and D∗ are equal, so that the same iso-proÞt contour

       is tangent to both,18 that is in Figure 2, π ∗ (.) and π̂(.) curves intersect

       at this proÞt level. Then output along D̂ exceeds that along D∗ so

       that the slope of π̂(.) exceeds that of π ∗ (.) at this point. From this

       it also follows that there can be at most one intersection between the

       two as depicted in Figure 2 since multiple intersections would violate

       this slope relation. Therefore, proÞts are given by π̂(Π, λt−1 ) above the

       intersection point, and by π ∗ (Π) below the intersection point and π(.)

       is the maximum of π∗ (.) and π̂(.). Both π∗ (.) and π̂(.) are convex in

       Π since output rises with Π under assumption 3(b) and is unchanged

       under assumption 3(a). Since the maximum of convex functions remains

       convex, π(.), is convex as well.

       The vertical intercept of the demand function is unity if there are no

       aggregate proÞts. If α ≤ 1, then costs exceed this intercept so that the

       optimal production level is zero and proÞts along both demand curves

       are negative at zero aggregate proÞts. In conjunction with proÞts being
  17
     In the absence of the linearity ensured by Assumption 1, these rays are replaced by the
proÞt expansion paths which would trace out the proÞt maximizing points along D∗ (.) and
D̂(.) as aggregate proÞts rise. Individual proÞts are convex in aggregate proÞts because
when proÞt expansion paths are upward sloping output rises with increases in aggregate
proÞts.
  18
     IsoproÞt contours are rectangular hyperbolas emanating from a height c on the vertical
axis.




                                            15
       ßatter than the 450 line, this means that there is no positive aggregate

       proÞt level at which the two intersect so that the durable good sector is

       not viable. If α > 1, as assumed, then these intercepts are positive so

       that an intersection in the positive quadrant is ensured and the durable

       good sector is viable.

 Proposition 1 There is a unique equilibrium proÞt level.

Proof: Positive intercepts, together with π∗Π (Π) ≤ π̂ Π (Π, λt−1 ) < 1 under both

       Assumption 3(a) and (b) ensures a unique intersection of π(Π, λt−1 )

       and the 450 line and hence a unique consistent level of proÞts denoted

       by Π(λt−1 ). Under Assumption 3(a), proÞts of a single Þrm are inde-

       pendent of aggregate proÞt levels while under Assumption 3(b), they

       depend on aggregate proÞt levels.

     Now we show that the equilibrium must involve cycles. As the proportion

 of old consumers rises so does the proÞt from serving them, i.e., as λt−1 falls

 π̂(Π, λt−1 ) shifts upward. As a result, in equilibrium, proÞts are maximized

 along π̂(Π, λt−1 ) for λt−1 < λ̃ and along π ∗ (Π) for λt−1 > λ̃. Thus, in Figure

 2, equilibrium proÞts fall as λt−1 rises for λt−1 ≤ λ̃, and they are constant

 at Π∗ for λt−1 > λ̃. At λt−1 = λ̃, π̂(Π, λt−1 ) and π ∗ (Π) intersect along the

 450 line. Similarly, output falls with increases in λt−1 for λt−1 ≤ λ̃ and is

 unaﬀected by λt−1 for λt−1 > λ̃.

     In Figure 1 this corresponds to output and proÞts in equilibrium being

 obtained from the intersection of D∗ (.) and the ray through c associated with

                                        16
 D∗ (.) for high values of λt−1 and from the intersection of D̂(.) and the ray

 through c associated with D̂(.) for low enough λt−1 . The switchover occurs

 at λt−1 = λ̃. When λt−1 = λ̃, maximizing proÞts along D̂(.) and D∗ (.) yields

 the same level of proÞts. Hence the iso-proÞt contour is tangent to both D̂(.)

 and D∗ (.).

     A monopolist’s problem can also be thought of as choosing the proportion

 of the young served in the current period, λt , as a function of the young

 served in the previous period, λt−1 . This gives us a relation between λt and

 λt−1 which we denote by λt (λt−1 ). As usual, the proportion of young served

 depends on whether the price chosen is along D∗ (.) or D̂(.), and λ∗t or λ̂t

 correspond to the value of λt (λt−1 ), respectively. Next we proceed to the

 properties of this relationship.

 Lemma 2

                    λt (λt−1 ) = λ∗ < λt−1 f or λt−1 ≥ λ̃

                    λt (λt−1 ) = λ̂(λt−1 ) > λt−1 f or λt−1 ≤ λ̃

 and
                                    dλ̂(λt−1 )
                                               > 0.
                                      dλt−1

Proof: If λt−1 < λ̃, equilibrium proÞts are given by the intersection of π̂(λt−1 , Π)

       and the 450 line. Firms choose to price below the kink in Figure 1 and

       to serve both the young and the old. Output is given by the inter-

       section of the ßatter ray through c and D̂(.). The fraction of young

                                          17
          served at this price is derived by going back to D∗ (.) and is denoted by

          λ̂(λt−1 ). Output exceeds the share of young consumers served as both

          the young and old are served. Note that λ̂(λt−1 ) > λt−1 as the Þrm will

          never price near the kink. As λt−1 falls, output rises but λ̂ falls!

          When λt−1 > λ̃, equilibrium proÞts are given by the intersection of

          π ∗ (λt−1 , Π) and the 450 line so that proÞts, output and λt are unaﬀected

          by λt−1 . As Þrms choose to price above the kink in Figure 1, λ∗ < λt−1 .

          Moreover, as only the young are served, output equals λt = λ∗ .


 Lemma 3 λ̂(λ̃) > λ̃ > λ∗ .


Proof: This can be seen by setting λt−1 in Figure 1 at λ̃ so that λ̂ corresponds

          to λ̂(λ̃). Now note that λ̂(λ̃) > λ̃ > λ∗ .


     We can now depict the relationship between λt−1 and λt as in Figure 3.

 When λt−1 is zero, the market size is merely doubled so that pricing is the

 same as when λt−1 is unity, although output is doubled. Under Assumption

 3(a) this makes λt (0) = λt (1) as drawn in Figure 3. Under Assumption 3(b),

 λt (0) > λt (1) since the higher aggregate proÞts at λt−1 = 0 shift demand

 up compared to when λt−1 = 1. This is the only diﬀerence between the two

 cases.


 Proposition 2 The economy must have Þnite period cycles. If G(.) is uni-

 form, only two period cycles are possible.

                                                                   λ̃−λ∗

       before falling back to λ∗ . When G(.) is uniform, only two period cycles

       exist as λ̂(λ∗ ) > λ̃ so that Þrms cycle between λ̂(λ∗ ) and λ∗ in this

 3.1    Some Empirical Implications

 Among the stylized facts on business cycles are pro-cyclical real wages, counter-

 cyclical prices and durable good consumption more volatile than output.

 There is much evidence in the empirical literature suggesting that wages rise

 with output, that is they are procyclical. Real wages, when measured appro-

                                         19
priately, tend to be pro-cyclical although some studies Þnd that they are not

tightly tied to the business cycle. Using longitudinal data, Barsky, Parker

and Solon (1994) show that individual real wages are more pro-cyclical than

average wages which are at best marginally procyclical. This is a consequence

of marginal workers with below average wages entering the labor market in

good times which drags average wages down. Using cross sectional data they

also show that durable goods prices, as well as the prices of non durables in

concentrated industries, are signiÞcantly counter-cyclical.

   Nominal wages in our model are Þxed in terms of the numeraire good.

However, real incomes are not and the real incomes of diﬀerent groups may

move diﬀerently. We deÞne real incomes as the income left over for the

consumption the non durable good. Thus, individuals who purchase the
                             Πt
good are better oﬀ as        2
                                  − Pt rises. Those who do not buy the good gain

if Πt rises. In the Þrst period of the boom Πt − Pt rises as this is necessary

for more of the young to be served. ProÞts also rise as Þrms prefer λ̂(λ∗ )

to λ∗ although the latter is still available to them. Later in the upturn, λ

rises and equilibrium proÞts fall (as the curve π̂ shifts down) though Πt − Pt

necessarily rises with λ. When the downturn comes, λ falls, taking Πt − Pt

with it. In addition proÞts fall to their minimum of Π∗ . Figure 4 depicts the
                             Πt                                      Πt

income of the rich, and proÞts need not be positive or negative, and our work

supports the idea that disaggregated data, both across groups of individuals

as well as over periods in the cycle need to be examined.

   Stock and Watson (1999) report that the cyclical component of prices is

counter-cyclical, and that this negative correlation is stable since the early

50s. There have been many explanations in the literature for the observed

counter-cyclical prices and markups, especially in durable goods and with im-

perfectly competitive markets. Stiglitz (1984) argues that this occurs because

marginal buyers have more elastic demand. Similarly, Bils (1989) argues that

in booms, consumers with low willingness to pay enter the market and this

raises demand elasticity, which causes price decreases in booms. Rotemberg

and Saloner (1986) argue that counter cyclical pricing comes from enforcing

collusion. The gains from price cutting are higher in good times so that only

lower prices can be supported in a repeated game.

   In our model there are two factors that determine income, and hence

                                                   21
willingness to pay: proÞt earnings and wage income. Wage income is acyclical

while proÞt earnings tend to rise with output. For output to rise a higher

proportion of consumers need to be able to buy the durable good. Thus,

the behavior of prices in our model depends on the distribution of proÞts. If

proÞts are distributed evenly to all consumers, then income level in a boom

will rise, and both prices and output could rise. If proÞts are captured by

only a small group, then prices must fall for output to rise. Thus, unless

asset ownership is widespread, the model’s predictions accord with the facts.

       Durable goods sales are widely understood to be pro-cyclical and more

volatile than output.19 Durable good consumption rises in our model during

good times and as total labor supply is Þxed, consumption of non durables

actually shrinks in a boom. This makes sales of durables more volatile than

total output. Adding an elastic labor supply would allow non durables pro-

duction to be procyclical as well.


4        Asymmetric Equilibrium

In the previous section we assumed all Þrms were symmetric. In this section

we allow Þrms to inherit diﬀerent market sizes and show that it does not

aﬀect our results.

Proposition 3 Even if Þrms diﬀer in terms of their inherited market size,

each Þrm has a Þnite period cycle and there are a Þnite number of Þrm types
  19
    See, for example, Stock and Watson (1999), King and Rebelo (1999), and Cooley and
Prescott (1995).

                                         22
in steady state. Hence, aggregate cycles are of Þnite length.

Proof: Firms, with diﬀerent market sizes will have diﬀerent π(Π, λt−1 ) curves

     as a function of Π alone. However, for the same reasons as earlier,

     these curves are increasing but ßatter than the 450 line, have positive

     intercepts and are convex. Under Assumption 3(b), each type will have

     diﬀerent aggregate proÞt levels (Π̃(λt−1 )) at which their proÞt functions

     switch from being π ∗ (Π) to π̂(Π, λt−1 ). To derive equilibrium proÞts,

     we need to construct the appropriate (according to the distribution of

     Þrm types) convex combination of these proÞt functions. However, this

     aggregate function will have the same properties, namely, it will be in-

     creasing but ßatter than the 450 line, have a positive Y intercept and

     be convex in aggregate proÞts. The intersection of this aggregate proÞt

     function with the 450 line gives unique aggregate proÞts in equilibrium.

     Under Assumption 3(a), proÞts do not aﬀect demand so that the be-

     havior of Þrms is independent of aggregate proÞt levels and hence of

     the distribution of Þrms. The analysis of the previous section carries

     over and asymmetries of this form do not aﬀect the analysis. Firms

     who served λt−1 of the young in the previous period choose to serve

     λ̂(λt−1 ) of the young today if λt−1 < λ̃, while if λt−1 > λ̃, they serve λ∗

     of the young. Since cycles for each Þrm are of Þnite length, so are the

     number of diﬀerent types of Þrms in steady state.

     Under Assumption 3(b), things are more complicated. As the distri-

                                      23
bution of Þrms changes, so does the level of equilibrium proÞts. For

a given distribution of Þrms, and aggregate proÞts, some Þrms will

choose to price at λ∗ (Π). Others will choose to price at diﬀerent levels

along λ̂(Π, λt−1 ). It can be veriÞed by using Figure 1(b) that the λ̂(.)

and λ∗ (.) curves shift upwards with an increase in aggregate proÞts.

This follows from the fact that output and hence the proportion of

young served rising with aggregate proÞts. λ̃(Π) also rises with aggre-

gate proÞts. Recall that the slope of individual proÞts in Figure 2 is

related to the output chosen. Hence π̂ Π (Π, λ̃) > π ∗Π (Π). Thus to keep

π̂(Π, λ̃) = π ∗ (Π), λ needs to rise with an increase in aggregate proÞts.

We know that in equilibrium, proÞts cannot be lower than those that

obtained when all Þrms sell only to the young or higher than those

when all Þrms served no consumer in the previous period, λt−1 = 0,

that is they must lie between Π∗ and Π̂(0) derived in the symmetric
                                          h          i
case. For each proÞt level in the interval Π∗ , Π̂(0) there is a λ̂(Π, λt−1 )

and a λ̃(Π). Let m0 (Π) > 0 be the smallest horizontal distance between

λ̂(Π, λt−1 ) and the 450 line, and let m0 > 0 denote the smallest value of
                                  h        i
   0                                 ∗
m (Π) for all Π in the interval Π , Π̂(0) . Thus, a Þrm which inherits

a λt−1 below λ̃(.) must increase its λ by at least m0 . λ̃(Π̂(0)) is the

highest value of λ̃(.) that is possible and λ∗ (Π∗ ) is the lowest value
                                                      λ̃(Π̂(0))−λ∗ (Π∗ )
that λ can take. Hence a Þrm can take at most                 m0
                                                                           periods

to cross the switchover point. Hence, each Þrm can have at most a


                                  24
                                λ̃(Π̂(0))−λ∗ (Π∗ )
         cycle of length                m0
                                                   .   As a consequence, there can be at most
         λ̃(Π̂(0))−λ∗ (Π∗ )
                 m0
                              diﬀerent kinds of Þrms since when a Þrm switches over, it

         joins all other Þrms which have switched with it.

4.1        No Aggregate Cycles

Although we have shown that individual Þrms must have cycles, there need

not be aggregate cycles, although this is a non-generic case. Suppose that

half the Þrms inherit λ∗ (Π0 ) while the other half inherit λ̂(λ∗ , Π0 ) and ag-

gregate proÞts, Π0 , are such that the proÞt function derived by giving equal

weight to these two types of Þrms intersects the 450 line at Π0 so that this

is an equilibrium. Let λ̂(λ∗ , Π0 ) > λ̃(Π0 ) as is the case with the uniform

distribution. Given this level of proÞts, Þrms which inherit λ∗ (Π0 ) choose to

serve both the young and old and serve λ̂(λ∗ , Π0 ) of their young, while Þrms

which inherit λ̂(λ∗ , Π0 ) choose to serve only their young, and λ∗ (Π0 ) of them.

In each period, Þrms switch types so that there are no aggregate cycles.20

Similarly, there are no aggregate cycles if there are T types of Þrms, each

with a proportion 1/T, and with T period cycles. In this case, Þrms switch

types but the distribution of types is unchanged over time.

4.2        Aggregate Cycles

When aggregate market size varies over time, the economy has aggregate

cycles. The depth of the cycle depends on the asymmetry between Þrms.
  20
       This argument is valid under both Assumption 3(a) and 3(b).

Figure 5 depicts a two period aggregate cycle under Assumption 3(b).         In

this case there are at most two types of Þrms. Those types which have a large

market in the current period and those who have a smaller market. If there

are a greater proportion of the Þrst type, aggregate proÞts are higher than

when the reverse is true. Call the equilibrium proÞts in the Þrst instance ΠH

and in the second ΠL . Firms of the Þrst type whose good periods are syn-

chronized with that of the market, cycle between λ̂(λ∗ (ΠL ), ΠH ) and λ∗ (ΠL )

(denoted by λ∗L ) while Þrms of the second type whose good periods, are

asynchronized with the market, cycle between λ̂(λ∗ (ΠH ), ΠL ) and λ∗ (ΠH )

(denoted by λ∗H ). Note that an increase in aggregate proÞts shifts λ̂(., Π),



                                         26
λ∗ (Π) and λ̃(Π) upwards. This two period cycle will be the case if


  λ̂(λ∗ (ΠL ), ΠH ) > λ̂(λ∗ (ΠH ), ΠL ) > λ̃(ΠH ) > λ̃(ΠL ) > λ∗ (ΠH ) > λ∗ (ΠL ).


In this event, the cycle of type 1 Þrms encloses the cycle of type 2 Þrms.

Thus, their cycle is deeper than that of type 2 Þrms as depicted.

   Under Assumption 3(a), there are no aggregate proÞt eﬀects so that the

λ̂(λ) and λ∗ curves are independent of the aggregate proÞt level in equilib-

rium. In this case, all Þrms follow the same path. Yet, there is an aggregate

cycle if the proportion of Þrms are not equal. There can be aggregate cycles

of more than two period length in steady state if λ̂(λ∗ ) < λ̃. However, cycles

remain of Þnite length since there are a Þnite number of type of Þrms, each

with a cycle of Þnite length.

4.3    Income Distribution and the Cycle Depth

Under Assumption 3(a), distribution of ownership shares and hence proÞts

is very unequal while it is equal under Assumption 3(b). A comparison of

the outcomes under these two assumptions gives some insight into how the

distribution of assets might aﬀect the depth of cycles. Consider a two period

aggregate cycle case. Let σ ≥ 1/2 denote the proportion of Þrms that are

in the majority. As this majority rises, proÞts in the good state (H) and

bad state (L) diverge, i.e., cycles deepen. When σ equals unity, all Þrms

are alike so that aggregate proÞts in the good state are as high as they will

get and in the bad state are as low as they will get.21 When σ equals one

half, then there are no aggregate cycles. Figure 6 depicts this relationship

under assumptions 3(a) and 3(b) respectively. When proÞts are distributed

evenly, the level of proÞts in both states is higher than when proÞts accrue

only to the most productive (Assumption 3(b) versus 3(a)).The diﬀerence

in the good and bad states is also greater so that the two curves are more

spread out as drawn. This suggests that an economy with a more widespread

ownership of productive assets would also be faced with deeper cycles!22
  21
    In the bad period ΠL (1) = Π∗ , and in the good period ΠH (1) = Π̂(λ∗ ).
  22
    More generally, when more assets are held by the more productive, a boom will raise
proÞts and make the demand curve more inelastic as well as shifting it upwards. By
assuming an equal distribution of assets, we have eliminated the Þrst eﬀect which would
tend to reduce output and raise price in a boom.



                                          28
5     Robustness

In this section we show that relaxing a number of assumptions made so far,

including that of myopic behavior on the part of Þrms, and no credit markets

will not change our main results.

5.1     Forward Looking Behavior

We have assumed so far that Þrms maximize their current period proÞts.

They do not take the eﬀects of their current choice on future proÞts into

account. Here we look at the eﬀect of such forward looking behavior on the

part of Þrms and argue that such behavior tends to deepen the cycle, not
                23
eliminate it.

    Think of a Þrm as choosing not output or price, but equivalently the

proportion of young consumers it serves, λt . By reducing λt today, a Þrm

can increase its market size tomorrow. We need to add the value of future

which depends only on its choice of λt , denoted by Z(λt ), to the objective

function of a Þrm. Thus, a forward looking Þrm maximizes


                                π(λt , λt−1 , Πt ) + Z(λt )


and chooses λt so that


                           π λt (λt , λt−1 , Πt ) + Zλt (λt ) = 0.
  23
     Nor for that matter, would the possibility of carrying inventories aﬀect our results as
production costs are constant so that there is no gain from carrying inventories, and if
there are any costs of doing so, there will be no incentives to carry inventories.


                                             29
On the other hand, a myopic Þrm maximizes π(λt , λt−1 , Πt ), and chooses λt

so that

                                 π λt (λt , λt−1 , Πt ) = 0.

Since serving a greater proportion of the young today reduces the Þrm’s

demand and hence proÞts tomorrow, Zλt (λt ) ≤ 0. Hence, a forward looking

Þrm will, if anything, want to hoard customers.24

       Consider the symmetric Þrm case with two period aggregate cycles. How

would a forward looking Þrm’s choices diﬀer from those of a myopic one? In

good times, when proÞts are high, a Þrm has no incentive to reduce λt since it

will not serve the customers it has hoarded in the next, low aggregate proÞt

period, anyway. In other words, in good times Zλt (λt ) = 0, and a forward

looking Þrm chooses the same level of output as a myopic Þrm. However, in

bad times, since it will serve its hoarded customers in the next period, i.e.,

since Zλt (λt ) < 0, a Þrm will have an incentive to reduce λt below that of a

myopic Þrm.25 But this will just deepen the cycle!26
  24
     Although proÞts are not single peaked there is an interior maximum so that the Þrst
order conditions hold.at every local maximum.
  25
     Note that proÞts fall as λt rises up till λ̃, and then are ßat. Due to this, proÞts are
weakly decreasing and convex in λt . As a result of this convexity in proÞts, a Þrm tends
to like variability in λt .
  26
     It is also worth pointing out that allowing for some competition between Þrms will
weaken the incentive to hoard customers as hoarded customers are like a public good,
available to all competitors of the Þrm as well as itself.

5.2     Credit Markets

So far we have assumed that there are no credit markets, or for that matter,

even savings possibilities, available to the consumer. We now argue that our

results are not dependent on this assumption. Credit markets reduce the

distortion caused by indivisibilities by increasing the set of consumers who

can aﬀord to buy the good. However, cycles remain.

   We assume that credit markets are perfect and all those who can repay

their loans have access to credit. We show that while credit markets improve

welfare by expanding the range of consumers who can aﬀord the durable, they

do not eliminate cycles. For simplicity, we only use Assumption 3(a) in this

section. The results can be generalized at the cost of some complexity. We

will proceed as follows. First we will outline how the availability of credit

aﬀects eﬀective demand. From this we derive the demand and supply of

credit and show that when the rate of time preference, ρ, is zero, the analysis

looks no diﬀerent from that above.

   The availability of credit changes the eﬀective demand faced by the mo-

nopolist. When the price is P0 , and only the young are served, individuals

with productivity exceeding P0 can buy the good even in the absence of credit

markets. However, credit allows more individuals to aﬀord the good, ceteris

paribus. Without credit markets, the demand by the young was given by the

line AB in Figure 7. With credit markets, an individual can aﬀord the good
                                                                            2+r
if the price is less than the present discounted value of his income, P ≤   1+r
                                                                                γ.

Thus, demand by the young consumers shifts up to AC where the point C

corresponds to the coordinates (0, 2+r
                                   1+r
                                       ).

   Credit markets also aﬀect demand by the old consumers. Individuals

who lent money when they were young have an income equal to (2 + r) times

their productivity in their second period. This relation is represented by the

line AD where D corresponds to the coordinates (0, 2 + r) in Figure 7. This

line lies above AC for r > 0. Suppose the price in the last period was P0 .

Individuals to the right of H were unable to buy the good in the last period

and their willingness to pay today lies along the line N A. Thus their demand

is given by N A, taking H as the origin. If price exceeds L, then none of

the old can aﬀord to buy the good. Only for prices below L can the old

participate. Thus, total demand from the young and the old in period 1 is

the horizontal sum of the demand of the young and old, and this results in

the kinked demand curve, CKP.

   The equilibrium interest rate, r, is such that demand for credit is equal

to the supply of credit. What are the demand for and supply of credit at

given levels of prices? First note that only the young participate in the credit

market. The old earn revenue from repayments of past loans but neither lend

nor borrow. Now, suppose that only the young are served in period 0 while

both young and old are served in period 1. Let P0 be the price in period 0.

Then, individuals in M H demand credit as they can aﬀord the good on the

basis of their net worth but not based on their current income. Their demand



                                      33
for credit is the diﬀerence between P0 and their current income. Hence credit

demand is given by the area EF G. As r rises AC becomes ßatter and at

given prices demand for credit falls. Hence we have the usual downward

sloping demand for credit.

   The supply of credit comes from two sources. The Þrst source is individ-

uals who cannot aﬀord the good today, even if they borrow, but who could

aﬀord it tomorrow if they save today and lend. If the price in period 1 is

given by P1 , this consists of the individuals in the region HI in Figure 7

whose supply of credit is the area HGJI. The second source is individuals

whose income exceeds the price of the durable, that is, those in region OM
                                                  Π
who supply credit equal to the area P0 BE +       2
                                                      (since proÞts are captured

by some of these agents), as well as individuals whose lifetime income (in

present value terms) is not high enough to aﬀord the durable good even if

they postpone consumption to the second period. This consists of individu-

als in the region IA who supply credit equal to area IJA. The Þrst source

is willing to lend (but only what is needed to buy the durable in the next

period) even if the interest rate, r, is less than the rate of time preference, ρ,

as lending today enables them to transfer part of their income to tomorrow

and thus aﬀord to buy the durable in their second period. On the other

hand, the second source is willing to lend only if r ≥ ρ because their motive

in lending is to consume more of the non durable good later on.

   If r < ρ, the only source of credit is the Þrst one and as r rises AD



                                       34
swings out and AC swings in moving I to the right and H to the left thereby

increasing credit supplied. If r > ρ, all agents to the right of H and left

of M supply credit. Since an increase in r moves H to the left and leaves

M unchanged, credit supplied rises as r rises. At r = ρ, there is a ßat

part for credit supply corresponding to individuals in OM and IA becoming

just willing to supply credit here. This ßat segment makes r = ρ a likely

candidate to be the equilibrium interest rate. Suppose ρ = 0. In this event,

it can be veriÞed that r = ρ = 0 is the unique equilibrium interest rate under

assumption 3(a) and a uniform distribution of γ.27

       This case when r = ρ = 0 is illustrated in Figure 8. Note that here the

curves AC and AD are identical. If the monopolist serves only the young he

maximizes proÞts choosing E along AD. In the subsequent period, demand

is given by DEF as the kink occurs at E (the last period’s price) as in

the original model without credit. The monopolist chooses the point G to

maximize proÞts and prices at P1 < P0 . Of course, this results in a kink in the

subsequent period at H, so that demand is given by DHI. The monopolist

now Þnds it optimal to price at E and so the cycle develops. Note that

the only diﬀerence between this analysis and that without credit is that AD

plays the role of AB earlier. For the same reasons as before, we must have

cycles. For small perturbations in r and ρ, similar arguments work.
  27
    In the uniform distribution case it is easy to show that if ρ = 0, there are only two
period cycles and r = 0 is the only equilibrium in both periods of the cycle. The proof is
in the Appendix.

6    Concluding Remarks

Our work in this paper suggests an important role for income distribution,

and for the distribution of asset ownership on the characteristics of cycles

that economy will experience. It also provides a way of looking at the eﬀects

of inside as done above, and outside credit on the economy. In addition, the

simple general equilibrium structure developed provides a way to study a

number of issues in trade and development which are the subject of ongoing

research.

A      Appendix
A.1      Calculations for the Uniform Distribution Case

In this Appendix we show that cycles are two period ones when the pro-

ductivity parameter is distributed uniformly, γ ˜U[0, 1], even if Þrms are

not symmetric. Recall that when Þrms were symmetric, then two period

cycles were ensured if λ̂(λ∗ ) > λ̃ as shown in Section 3. When Þrms are

not symmetric, then the distribution of young served across Þrms aﬀects the

equilibrium level of proÞts as argued in Section 4. As a result, correspond-

ing to any given distribution and hence aggregate proÞt level in equilibrium,

there correspond functions λ̂(λ∗ , Π), λ∗ (Π) and λ̃(Π) each of which has been

shown to be increasing in Π as depicted in Figure 5.

    A suﬃcient condition for each Þrm to have only two period cycles is

thus that for each level of aggregate proÞts, and each viable value of λ∗ ,

λ̂(λ∗ , Π) > λ̃(Π). Recall that λ̂(λ, Π) increases as λ or Π rise and λ̃(Π) rises

with Π. Thus, if the above holds at the lowest feasible value of λ∗ and Π

on the left hand side and the highest possible value of Π on the right hand

side then it must hold throughout. The lowest feasible value of λ is the value

of λ∗ for the lowest feasible value of aggregate proÞts. The lowest level of

equilibrium proÞts occurs when none of the old are served by anyone. This

results in aggregate proÞts of Π∗ . When all Þrms inherit the largest feasible

market, i.e., the share of young served in the last period takes its lowest




                                       41
value, the highest feasible value of Π = Π̂(λ∗ ) is realized. Thus,


                        λ̂(λ∗ (Π∗ ), Π∗ ) > λ̃(Π̂(λ∗ (Π∗ ))                (1)


is suﬃcent to ensure that there are only two period cycles, even with asym-

metric Þrms.

   We Þrst Þnd λ∗ and Π∗ . The proÞt level associated with the demand

curve D∗ , π ∗ (Π), is the value function for the problem:

                                       Π
                            M ax(1 +     − P )(P − c)
                             P         2

The optimal price and quantity when aggregate proÞts are Π∗ are

                                    1         Π
                             P∗ =     (1 +      + c)
                                    2         2
                                    1         Π
                             q∗   =   (1 +      − c).
                                    2         2

Output is also equal to λ∗ (Π) as no old consumers are served. Individual

Þrm’s proÞts are
                                 1    Π
                             π∗ = (1 + − c)2 .                             (2)
                                 4    2
Of course, Π∗ , can be solved for by setting Þrm proÞts equal to aggregate

levels or implicitly from

                                 1     Π∗
                             Π∗ = (1 +    − c)2 .                          (3)
                                 4     2

   Now to Þnd Π̂(λ∗ (Π∗ )). When all Þrms inherit λ∗ (Π∗ ), demand will have

a kink at q = λ∗ (Π∗ ). The total number of potential consumers is 2 − λ∗ (Π∗ )


                                        42
of which 1 − λ∗ (Π∗ ) are old consumers. Thus, the ßatter part of the demand

function can be expressed as
                                                        Π
                            D̂ = 2 − λ∗ (Π∗ ) − 2(P −     ).
                                                        2
    The proÞt level associated with the demand curve D̂, π̂(Π, λ∗ (Π∗ )), is the

value function for the problem:

                       Max(P − c)(2 − λ∗ (Π∗ ) − 2P + Π).

    Demand by the young is represented by the steeper part of the demand

curve, D∗ (.). The proportion of the young served, λ̂(λ∗ (Π∗ )) can be found

by going back to D∗ (.) at P̂ (λ∗ (Π∗ ), Π). Thus, λ̂(λ∗ (Π∗ ), Π) is

   We now have the left hand side of (1) and turn to the right hand side.

Π̂(λ∗ (Π∗ )) denotes the equilibrium level of aggregate proÞts when all Þrms

inherit λ∗ (Π∗ ). Using (5) and setting individual proÞts to equal aggregate

ones gives Π̂(λ∗ (Π∗ ) to be


                                 1 ³                            ´2

Now to Þnd λ̃(Π̂(λ∗ (Π∗ ))). If aggregate proÞts are Π, then λ̃(Π) can be found

implicitly by setting

                                π̂(Π, λ̃(Π)) = π ∗ (Π).

Substituting for the two sides in the above using (5) and (2) gives

Evaluating λ̃(Π) at Π̂(λ∗ (Π∗ )) gives the needed expression to be
                                 ³   √ ´         Π̂(λ∗ (Π∗ ))
               λ̃(Π̂(λ∗ (Π∗ ))) = 2 − 2 (1 − c +              ).           (9)

       Plotting the diﬀerence between the two using (10) and (11) and MAPLE

shows that λ̂(λ∗ (Π∗ ), Π∗ ) > λ̃(Π̂(λ∗ (Π∗ ))) for all c ∈ [0, 1] which concludes

the proof.

A.2         Equilibrium When r = ρ = 0

We show that if ρ = 0, then r = 0 is the only equilibrium in both periods

of the cycle when the productivity parameter is uniformly distributed in the

unit interval.
  28
    While there are two roots to the equations we choose the negative root as the positive
ones results in infeasibly large output levels.


                                           45
   Following the notation in Section 5.2 we call the period where Þrms serve

only their young as period 0, and therefore P0 denotes the high price. Now,

we Þrst Þnd this price, P0 , and calculate the demand for credit and supply of

credit at P0 if r = ρ = 0. We Þnd that supply exceeds credit in such a case.

Even though potential supply exceeds demand at r = 0, the entire supply

comes from individuals who are indiﬀerent between supplying credit and not,

and supply of credit falls to zero at a negative interest rate. Therefore r = 0

is the equilibrium interest rate. Next we show that in the following period,

period 1, r = 0 remains the equilibrium interest rate.

A.2.1    Period 0 : High Price Period

The demand by the young at an interest rate of r = 0, DA in Figure 9, can

be expressed as
                                               P0
                            D∗ (r = 0) = 1 −      .
                                               2
If the Þrm serves only its young consumers then the optimal price is a solution

to the problem
                                      P0
                            Max(1 −      )(P0 − c)
                             P0       2
which results in

                                     c
                             P0 = 1 + , and
                                     2
                                  1 c
                             q0 =   − = λ0 .
                                  2 4

   Note that price exceeds 1 so that given Assumption 3(a) only the in-

Þnitesimally few who appropriate the proÞts can aﬀord the good on their

with a lifetime income in excess of the price, that is, individuals whose pro-

the diﬀerence between their current income and the price. Thus, the demand

for credit is given by the area P0 EGB in Figure 9.

     Supply of credit comes from two sources: half of the proÞts (share of

share of the young is 12 (P0 −c)q0 , while the supply of credit by poor individuals

is given by the area of the triangle Gλ0 A. Thus, total supply of credit will be

the area Gλ0 A + 12 (P0 − c)q0 . Note that along the line BA, P = 1 − q, and

along the line DA, P = 2 − 2q.

A.2.2   Period 1 : Low Price Period

In the following period, the demand curve is given by DEF, and the mo-

nopolist chooses a lower price and serves a larger proportion of its young

consumers. The ßatter part of the demand curve can be expressed as

                                              3 c
                       D̂ = 2 − λ0 − P =       + −P
                                              2 4

The optimal price, P1 , can be found by solving

                                 3 c

                                    ,   and it is less than 1 otherwise. Credit

demand comes from the young who cannot aﬀord the good based on their

current income.

   Figure 9 (a) depicts the case for c < 2/5, i.e., P1 < 1. Then, individuals

in the interval Lλ1 demand credit equal to the area of the triangle IJK

positive at all c ∈ [0, 1]. Therefore, r = 0 is the equilibrium interest rate.

   What if c > 2/5? In this case, as in period 0, no individual can aﬀord the

good without borrowing. Figure 9 (b) depicts the case for c > 2/5. Demand

for credit is given by the area P1 JKB:

                                 1
            P1 JKB = (P1 − 1)λ1 + (1 − (1 − λ1 ))λ1

                     128 128       512

Now, supply comes from only two sources, the poor and proÞts going to

the young as no one can aﬀord the good on their current income alone:

Kλ1 A + 12 (P1 − c)q1 :

                 1               1             1

                                       50
Even without supply coming from proÞts, supply exceeds demand for all c,

therefore r = 0 is still an equilibrium.

A.2.3    Cycles With Credit Markets

Finally we show that this economy has a two-period cycle with credit markets.

The ßatter part of the demand curve in period 2 is

                              D̂2 = 2 − λ1 − P
                                            11  5
                                      =        + c − P,
                                            8   16

and the optimal price on this demand curve is

                                              11 21
                                   P̂2 =        + c.
                                              16 32

As a result a Þrm produces

                                              11 11
                                    q̂2 =       − c,
                                              16 32

and makes a proÞt of
                                          µ         ¶2
                                              11 11
                                  π̂2 =         − c
                                              16 32
while it can make a proÞt of
                                      ³        µ     ¶
                              ∗              c´ 1 c
                          π       =       1−      −
                                             2   2 4
                                  > π̂ 2 .

by serving on the steeper part of the demand curve. Therefore, this economy

has two-period cycles.
