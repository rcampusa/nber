This paper is the first to study the effect of financial restatement on bank loan contracting. Compared
with loans initiated before restatement, loans initiated after restatement have significantly higher spreads,
shorter maturities, higher likelihood of being secured, and more covenant restrictions. The increase
in loan spread is significantly larger for fraudulent restating firms than other restating firms. We also
find that after restatement, the number of lenders per loan declines and firms pay higher upfront and
annual fees. These results are consistent with the view that banks use tighter loan contract terms to
overcome risk and information problems arising from financial restatements.

1.        Introduction

In recent years, a number of high-profile financial restatements by companies such as

Worldcom and Xerox have reduced previously reported earnings by billions of dollars. 1

According to the United States General Accounting Office, the number of restatements

grew by 145% from 1997 through 2002. From January 1997 through June 2002, about 10%

of all listed companies restated one or more times. The size and visibility of restating

companies also increased: The average market value of a restating company increased from

$500 million in 1997 to $2 billion in 2002. Financial restatements are potentially very

costly to the firms involved. They may shake investor confidence in the credibility of

corporate disclosure, depress demand for a firm’s securities, and constrain corporate

opportunities thereby leading to a substantial loss in market value.

          With the increasing importance of restatements, their effect on the welfare of

shareholders has attracted a great deal of attention. Palmrose, Richardson and Scholz (2004)

document a -9.2% abnormal stock return over a 2-day event window around restatement

announcements. Anderson and Yohn (2002) find a -3.5% cumulative abnormal return

during a 7-day window. Hribar and Jenkins (2004) estimate that, depending on the model

used, the relative percentage increase in the cost of equity capital averages between 10.8%

and 19.5% in the month immediately following a restatement. These studies indicate that

restatements lead to significant loss in shareholder value and an increase in the cost of

equity.

          The extant literature has focused on the consequences of restatements from the

perspective of equity holders. To date there is no evidence on the reactions of debt holders.

1
 As stated by the U.S. General Accounting Office, a financial restatement occurs when a company, either
voluntarily or prompted by auditors or regulators, revises public financial information that has been
previously reported.


                                                                                                     1
This paper attempts to fill this gap by analyzing the impact of financial restatements on

debt contracting. We focus on a firm’s bank loan contracting for two primary reasons. First,

bank loans are an important source of corporate financing. The flow of funds data from the

Federal Reserve System indicate that over the past decade, there have been $780 billion in

net debt security issuances and only $2 billion for equities. Among the debt issues, bank

loans play a significant role (about 54% of total debt since 1980). Given the significance of

private bank debt as well as the growing number of financial restatements, it is important to

understand how the structure and pricing of private debt change after a firm discloses

financial misreporting.

       The second reason that we study bank loan contracts is that they provide multi-

dimensional information about debt, and the reactions of banks to restatements can be

observed explicitly through various features of loan contracts. These contract terms allow

us to investigate the effects of restatements on the direct (interest rate) and indirect (loan

maturity, collateral requirements, and covenant restrictions) costs of debt. Moreover, loan

contracts allow us to uniquely analyze the impact of restatements on the structure of bank

loans, such as the number of lenders in a syndicate loan and loan transaction fees.

       To analyze the impact of financial restatements on bank debt contracting, we begin

by examining the effect on the loan spread. We measure loan spread as the amount the

borrower pays in basis points over LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) or LIBOR

equivalent. After refiling financial statements, the loan spread increases by approximately

one half. Depending on the model specification, the magnitude of the increase is 65 to 72




                                                                                            2
basis points relative to a pre-restatement average spread of 141 basis points over LIBOR,

indicating that the increase in the loan spread is economically significant. 2

         Corporate misreporting varies in severity. Because fraud-related misreporting is

more egregious than error-related misreporting, we expect that the market will punish fraud

firms more severely in terms of a larger increase in loan spread. We find that fraud-related

restatements increase spreads nearly half-again more, relative to restatements not related to

fraud. To determine whether the source of the restatement is important, we examine

whether lenders respond differently to restatements motivated by various initiators such as

auditors, the SEC, the company itself, or others. We do not find evidence that the loan

spread increase varies significantly across these groups. The results indicate that in loan

contracting, the content of restatements is more important than the identity of the prompter.

         By examining non-price terms of the contracts, we also study whether financial

restatements have effects beyond increasing the price of bank debt. We find that loans

contracted after restatement announcements have significantly shorter maturity, higher

likelihood of being secured, and more covenant restrictions. The tighter non-price contract

terms potentially lead to additional costs borne by restating firms, such as incurring higher

transaction costs that result from more frequent refinancing, giving up profitable investment

opportunities to comply with more restrictive debt covenants, etc. Therefore, the economic

effect of restatements on the effective cost of debt is likely even higher than that implied by

the loan spread increase alone.


2
  The magnitude of the loan spread increase is similar to that identified in other settings. For example,
Benmelech, Garmaise, and Moskowitz (2005) find that decreasing asset liquidation value translates into a 58
basis point increase in loan spread. Berger and Udell (1995) find that a firm with a 1-year banking
relationship pays a spread 48 basis points higher than does a firm that has an 11-year relationship. Our finding
that the spread increases by about one-half translates into an increase in about a one-tenth increase in the
overall cost of debt, which is in line with Hribar and Jenkins’ (2004) estimate of the effect of restatements on
the cost of equity.


                                                                                                              3
         In addition to altering contract terms, restatements can also affect how lenders

structure loans. We find evidence that on average, each loan has fewer lenders after

restatement. 3 This is consistent with more concentrated lending arrangements (i.e., fewer

lenders) being formed to enhance monitoring in the environment of increased risk and

information problems after a financial restatement. We also find that the upfront and annual

fees charged by lenders are higher for restating firms, presumably to compensate for

additional monitoring activities.

         This paper is related to both the financial misreporting and loan contracting

literatures. First, the growing literature on the consequences of financial misreporting has

focused on how restatement reduces market value and increases the cost of equity

(Anderson and Yohn (2002), Hribar and Jenkins (2004), and Palmrose, Richardson and

Scholz (2004)), and how misreporting distorts employment and investment in the economy

(Kedia and Philippon (2006)). Our paper provides unique evidence on how restatement

affects bank debt contract terms. Combining our result of a 50 percent increase in the loan

spread after restatement with the previously documented increased cost of equity implies

that the effect of restatement on total cost of capital could be dramatic. Further accounting

for the indirect costs of restatement, such as stricter non-price contract terms, suggests that

restatement is quite costly to borrowing firms.

         Second, our analysis is also related to the literature on bank loan contracting, which

has examined how loan contracts reflect risk and information asymmetry in various ways. 4

Previous contracting research has not investigated how loan contracts are affected by the


3
  Firms may switch to new lenders after restatements. If this is the case, it is likely that the borrowing cost
from new lenders is lower than from existing lenders. Thus, our results of higher direct and indirect costs after
restatements would be likely stronger had firms kept the same lenders before and after restatements.

                                                                                                               4
changes in credit risk and information asymmetry that follow a restatement, so we add to

the literature in this dimension. A restatement implies that the information previously

known to the lending bank is inaccurate; therefore, prior beliefs about loan risk need to be

reevaluated. A restatement also creates uncertainty about the credibility of financial

statements and increases the firm’s perceived informational asymmetry from the bank’s

perspective. To deal with these issues, banks can attempt to enhance the efficiency of

monitoring by using tighter contract terms and a more efficient lending structure. In this

paper, we explore empirically how banks use price and non-price terms as well as the

lender structure of loan contracts to address these risk and information problems.

       Third, we examine multiple dimensions (instead of a single dimension) of the loan

contract, and this allows us to investigate the creditors’ reactions to corporate restatements

more comprehensively. According to Melnik and Plaut (1986), bank loan contracts are a

package of n-contract terms and these contract terms cannot be split and traded separately.

The contract terms include not only the price term (the interest rate) but also non-price

terms such as maturity, collateral requirements, covenants, etc. By examining the multi-

faceted features of loan contracts, we show that restatement affects not only the price but

also the non-price terms and lender structure of loan contracts. Only a few papers examine

the impact of various factors on the multidimensional features of loan contracts and none

have examined the impact of corporate restatements. These papers investigate how the

country level creditor protection environment (Bae and Goyal (2006) and Qian and Strahan

(2006)), asset liquidation value (Benmelech, Garmaise, and Moskowitz (2005)), abnormal

accounting accruals (Bharath, Sunder, and Sunder (2006)), shareholder rights (Chava,

Dierker, and Livdan (2005)), and firm risk characteristics (Strahan (1999)) impact loan

contract terms.


                                                                                            5
        To summarize, our paper makes three contributions. First, our paper is the first to

provide evidence on how restatement affects the cost of raising bank debt, one of the

primary financing sources to corporations. Second, our paper contributes to the loan

contracting literature by highlighting how financial restatements act as a mechanism by

which risk and information asymmetry can affect spreads, maturity, collateral, covenants,

and other aspects of financial contracting. Third, we focus on various aspects of loan

contracts that capture their multidimensional character, while most previous studies focus

on a single dimension (e.g., interest rate).

        The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section discusses the relation

between restatements and loan contracting, as well as the related literature. Section 3

describes the data and summary statistics. Results, implications, and robustness tests are

given in Section 4. The last section concludes.



2.      Financial Restatements, Bank Loan Contracting, and Related

Literature

        Financial restatement can affect a lender’s evaluation of a company through

revisions in beliefs about the firm’s expected future cash flows (mean or wealth effect) or

the uncertainty about the firm’s financial information (variance or information effect).

Regarding the mean effect, a restatement changes historic financial numbers, and thus

changes forecasts that are based on these numbers. 5 A majority of restatement cases reduce




5
 This is what Karpoff et al. (2007) label the readjustment effect, which reflects the market adjusting to a
more accurate representation of the firm’s financial situation. This is the adjustment to the value the firm
would have obtained had it not misreported its financial numbers.


                                                                                                          6
earnings, thereby revealing that companies are worse than they previously appeared. 6 In

addition, some restatements are associated with significant legal liabilities, further

worsening future prospects. Finally, a restatement may harm a company’s reputation, which

has a real effect on firms’ cash flows. This reputation effect refers to the decrease in present

value of the firm’s cash flows as investors, customers, and suppliers change the terms of

trade on which they do business with the firm. 7 The decline in future expected earnings for

restating companies has been documented in the literature, which finds a significant

downward revision in mean values of analyst earnings forecasts following restatements

(Palmrose et al. (2004)). The poorer prospects imply an increase in firm default risk and

such an increase in risk is reflected in stricter loan contract terms.

        Regarding the variance effect, misreporting creates uncertainty about the credibility

of financial statements and signals low quality of disclosed company information. Although

restatement might in some circumstance reduce uncertainty about one particular accounting

item, the overall uncertainty of company financial information increases because

restatement causes investors to question other aspects of the firm's operations and reported

performance. As a result, the perceived information asymmetry between borrowers and

lenders increases after restatement. The literature has provided evidence of this effect. For

example, Palmrose et al. (2004) document a significant increase in analyst earnings forecast

dispersion after restatement announcements. Anderson and Yohn (2002) find an increase in

bid ask spreads surrounding restatement announcements related to revenue recognition


6
  In their sample, Kinney and McDaniel (1989) find that there are twice as many announcements about
earnings overstatements as there are about earnings understatements. In our sample, overstatements
outnumber understatements nine to one.
7
  According to Karpoff et al. (2007), the revelation of misconduct can have real effects on the firm’s
operations and result in reputation loss. For example, customers may change the terms on which they do
business with the firm due to an increased likelihood of misreporting or the perception that the firm cannot
support warranties or supply compatible parts in the future.


                                                                                                          7
problems. The increased information asymmetry requires lenders to monitor the restating

firms more intensely. The increase in monitoring costs is passed along to borrowers in the

form of possibly higher interest rates and more stringent contract terms.

       In short, the potential channels through which restatement affects loan contracting

include both wealth and information effects. We attempt to disentangle the wealth effect

from the information effect (in Table 5) but acknowledge that this part of the analysis is

suggestive rather than conclusive. Therefore, for the most part, we focus on the overall

effect of restatement on loan contracting.

       The traditional banking literature (e.g., Freixas and Rochet (1997)) suggests that

credit risk is the major lending risk faced by banks and is one of the primary determinants

of loan pricing. Greater lending risk leads to higher loan interest rates. In addition, the

theoretical findings in Barry and Brown (1984), Easley, Hvidkjaer, and O’Hara (2002), and

Easley and O’Hara (2004) suggest that the systematic risk of securities is affected by the

amount of available information, and limited information is a source of non-diversifiable

risk that should be priced in securities. As a result, this literature argues that information

disclosure lowers information risk and reduces the cost of capital. From a different angle,

Diamond and Verrecchia (1991) show that information transparency can reduce a firm’s

cost of capital because a firm with less information asymmetry attracts increased demand

from investors and thus increases the liquidity of its securities. The empirical literature

documents that information opacity of borrowing firms increases loan spreads. This

literature investigates the impact of such factors as duration of bank relationships (Petersen

and Rajan (1994) and Berger and Udell (1995)), auditor assurance (Blackwell, Noland, and

Winters (1998) and Pittman and Fortin (2004)), and analysts’ evaluations of voluntary

disclosure quality (Maxumdar and Sengupta (2005)) on loan spread. In short, the findings


                                                                                            8
in this literature are consistent with our conclusion that restating firms, having larger credit

risk and more severe information disclosure problems, face higher loan spreads.

        Diamond’s (1991) theory indicates that debt maturity is a nonmonotonic function of

risk ratings. Low and high risk firms use short-term debt (low risk firms are able to roll

over their debt and high risk firms may be refused long-term debt because of a high default

probability) and intermediate risk firms use long-term debt (these firms avoid short term

debt to minimize refinancing risk). Stohs and Mauer (1996) and Scherr and Hulburt (2001)

find results consistent with this theory. 8 Restating firms are on average riskier than non-

restating firms, 9 thus we expect our results to follow Diamond’s (1991) implications for

intermediate to high risk firms: after restatement, the firms are perceived to be very risky

and are limited primarily to shorter term debt. In addition, Barclay and Smith (1995), Ortiz-

Molina and Penas (2006), and Rajan and Winton (1995) suggest that by forcing more

frequent information disclosure and renegotiation of contract terms, shorter maturities may

be useful in addressing information problems. This is because banks can periodically

evaluate a firm’s ability to pay off debt and maintain a stronger bargaining position through

the short-term debt renewal processes. Our results that restating firms use shorter maturity

loans are consistent with Barclay and Smith (1995), Ortiz-Molina and Penas (2006), Rajan

and Winton (1995), and the intermediate to high risk range of Stohs and Mauer (1996) and

Scherr and Hulburt (2001).

        Previous research finds that riskier borrowers use more collateral (Berger and Udell

(1990) and Jimenez, Salas, and Saurina (2006)). Rajan and Winton (1995) show that the


8
  Guedes and Opler (1996) find that low risk firms borrow at short-term and long-term while high risk firms
borrow at intermediate-term, a result which appears to conflict with Diamond (1991).
9
  Burns and Kedia (2006) show that restating firms have significantly higher leverage and price-earnings
ratios than nonrestating firms.


                                                                                                         9
presence of collateral enhances efficient monitoring. These implications are consistent with

our finding that firms that have misstated financials are more likely to pledge collateral.

         Smith and Warner’s (1979) Costly Contracting Hypothesis (CCH) states that, when

including covenants in debt contracts, firms trade off benefits of reducing agency costs of

debt (which are higher when firms are closer to financial distress) with costs of reduced

flexibility. Bradley and Roberts (2005) argue that an important implication of CCH is a

negative relation between the financial health of a firm and the presence and intensity of

covenants in debt contracts and they document this empirically. Additionally, Rajan and

Winton (1995) suggest that covenants enhance banks' incentives to monitor the borrower.

Hence, this literature suggests that covenants will be used more intensively in the loan

contracts involving firms that are relatively distressed and in need of monitoring, such as

restating firms. Our findings support this argument.

         The loan syndicate literature indicates that firms with a high probability of financial

distress will borrow from fewer lenders (Bolton and Scharfstein (1996) and Lee and

Mullineaux (2004)). This is because a syndicate structure with fewer lenders facilitates

renegotiation and collective decision-making, and thus enhances the prospects of successful

loan restructuring in the event of financial distress. 10 In addition, the literature suggests that

loans to borrowers with information problems involve fewer lenders. Dennis and

Mullineaux (2000) show that banks could decline to provide loans to borrowers whose

information is opaque. Also, when there is limited information about a borrower, fewer

lenders help reduce free riding in information gathering and monitoring. Consistent with

10
  The literature also suggests that the syndication structure can diversify banks’ loan portfolios by spreading
the credit risk among the participating banks. Therefore, more lenders help diversify the credit risk of a loan.
However, in the case of restating firms, banks may refuse to provide loans because such borrowers are
perhaps very distressed and have severe information problems. As a result, for restating firms, the risk
diversification effect may be dominated by other effects.


                                                                                                            10
this literature, we find that firms that have restated will borrow from syndicates comprised

of fewer lenders. In addition, our results are consistent with the increased cost of

monitoring activities being passed along to borrowers through increased fees.



3.      Data

3.1     Sample Selection

        We use corporate misreporting data from the financial restatement database

collected by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO). This database includes 919

restatements announced by around 800 public companies from January 1, 1997, to June 30,

2002. These restatements involve accounting irregularities that result in material

misstatements of previously filed financial results.11 These events include material errors

and fraud.

        The bank loan data come from Dealscan, a Loan Pricing Corporation (LPC)

database. This database contains detailed loan information for U.S. and foreign commercial

loans made to corporations, starting in 1986. The data are primarily gathered from SEC

filings. The rest of the data are from direct research by LPC through contacts with

borrowers, lenders, and the credit industry at large. The basic unit of our empirical analysis

is a loan, also referred to as a facility or tranche in Dealscan. Loans are grouped into deals,

so a deal may have one or more loans. While each loan has only one borrower, loans can

have multiple lenders due to syndication. In the case of syndication, a group of banks




11
   Specifically, the database includes the instances in which a company restates its financial statements
because they were not fairly presented in the initial filings in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP).


                                                                                                          11
and/or other financial institutions (e.g., insurance companies) make a loan jointly to a

borrower. 12

         We use the following procedures to form the sample. First, for companies that

restate their financial information more than once, we keep only the first restatement

announcement. This is because the main purpose of this study is to compare the cost of debt

before restatement with that after restatement. If we were to keep the second restatement

announcement for a firm, the pre-announcement window of the second restatement could

overlap with the post-announcement window of the first restatement and this overlap might

confound the comparison. 13 Sixty-five companies restated twice and eleven companies

restated three times in the original restatement database. We are left with 832 restatements

by 832 firms after removing the second and third restatements. We then merge the

restatement sample with the Dealscan and Compustat databases. Firms are removed if they

have no loan information in Dealscan or have missing Compustat information, resulting in

a sample of 437 firms. Finally, to permit fair comparison of the debt contract before and

after restatement, we remove firms that only have pre-restatement loans or post-restatement

loans. 14 Our final sample includes 237 restatement firms with 2451 loans, of which 1568

loans are initiated before the announcements of restatements and 883 are initiated after the

announcements. These loans span the period 1989 through 2004.


12
   Dealscan provides information about loans at origination but no information about what happens
subsequently (Strahan (1999)). Therefore, our data do not contain loan amendments and it is therefore
advantageous to compare contract terms of new loans (both before and after restatements). In addition,
Dealscan includes loans issued to refinance or consolidate existing debt prior to maturity. Because the
purpose of this study is to compare contract terms of loans issued before restatements with those issued after,
no matter what the loan is used for, loan refinancing will not affect our primary purpose.
13
   For companies that have multiple restatements, in unreported analysis, we compare loans initiated between
the first and the second restatement with those initiated after the second restatement and do not find a
significant difference in contract terms. This implies that there is no significant incremental effect due to a
second restatement.
14
   Including firms that only have pre-restatement or post-restatement loans in the analysis yields essentially
the same results.


                                                                                                           12
       We examine whether the final sample is representative of the original restatement

sample. First, we compare the original sample (919 restatements) and the final sample (237)

in terms of restatement announcement year, reason for restatement, restatement initiator,

and whether fraud occurred. The distributions from these two samples are similar. We also

compare the 832 restatements (that are left after removing the second and third restatements)

with the final sample and again get similar distributions. Second, we compare 237 firms in

the final sample with 437 firms, 200 of which have only pre-restatement loans or only post-

restatement loans. Both samples have similar distributions by restatement announcement

year, reason for restatement, prompter, fraud occurrence, and industry. These two samples

also have similar firm characteristics such as market-to-book, asset tangibility, cash flow

volatility, etc., and similar loan characteristics such as loan maturity, covenants, etc. Further,

regression analyses using the 437 firms do not change our results. Therefore, we conclude

that our final sample is not systematically different from the original restatement sample.

The analysis of sample representativeness is available upon request.

3.2    Sample Description and Univariate Comparisons

                                     [Table 1 about here]

       Table 1 contains the information on the restating firms in our final sample. 237

firms restated their financials for a variety of reasons (Panel A). Issues involving improper

revenue recognition (misreported or nonreported revenue) account for about 40% of the

restatement cases. Restatements related to improper accounting treatment of restructuring

activity, investments, timing of asset write-downs, inventory valuation, etc. account for

16% of the cases. About 13% of firms restate due to improperly recognizing costs or

expenses. A restatement can be prompted by different parties (Panel B). About 44%




                                                                                              13
restatements are prompted by the restating companies themselves, 24% by the SEC, and

5% by external auditors. Panel C of Table 1 shows that about 8% of restatements occur in

firms that allegedly committed fraud. We define corporate fraud as cases subject to fraud

enforcement actions by the SEC. In these fraud cases, the SEC took action against

companies for violating the SEC's antifraud rule 10b-5 because the firm made

misstatements of material fact related to its financial condition. 15 Restatements may occur

before or after SEC fraud enforcement because a restatement could trigger the SEC fraud

investigation, or the SEC enforcement action may result in a restatement.

                                              [Table 2 about here]

        Table 2 presents summary statistics of debt contract terms for restating firms, and

the univariate comparisons of these contract terms between pre-restatement and post-

restatement loans. The price of the bank borrowing, loan spread, is measured as the

Dealscan data item all-in spread drawn (AIS drawn), which is the amount the borrower pays

in basis points over LIBOR or LIBOR equivalent for each dollar drawn. 16 This measure

adds to the borrowing spread any annual fees paid to the bank group. The mean loan spread

increases from 141 basis points over LIBOR before restatement to 223 basis points after

restatement. The average loan maturity drops from 45 months before restatement to 35

months after restatement. We also compare the number of covenants before and after and

find that each loan averages 6.9 before restatement and increases to 7.5 after restatement.




15
   Rule 10b-5 "Employment of Manipulative and Deceptive Devices" of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
proscribes, among other things, “the intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud with misstatements of material
fact made in connection to financial condition, solvency and profitability.” (SEC Administration Proceeding
File #3-9588)
16
   AIS rates are quoted over LIBOR. For loans not based on LIBOR, LPC converts the spread into LIBOR
terms by adding or subtracting a differential which is adjusted periodically.


                                                                                                          14
After restatement, firms also have larger loan size 17 , their loans are more likely to have the

feature of tying the loan pricing to firm performance and are more likely to be secured, and

they pay higher annual fees. All these changes are significant in the mean. There is no

significant change in the number of lenders in a loan after restatement. We later show in the

regression analysis that after controlling for other determinants of loan contracts, the

number of lenders declines significantly after restatement.

4.       Multivariate Analysis

4.1      Effect of Restatement on the Cost of Bank Debt

         In this section we use regression analysis to examine the effect of restatement on the

cost of bank debt. The main empirical model follows:

         Log(Loan spread)=ƒ(Post-restatement indicator, Firm characteristics, Loan

                            characteristics, Industry effects, Macroeconomic factors).                         (1)

         In the regression, each observation represents a single loan. The dependent variable

is the natural logarithm of the cost of debt, loan spread. To capture the effect of restatement,

we define a dummy variable, post-restatement, which is equal to one if the loan is activated

after restatement announcement and zero otherwise. 18 We control for firm characteristics,




17
   There are two reasons that the univariate analysis identifies an increase in loan size after restatement. First,
due to time trends, firm size increases and larger firms borrow via larger loans. Second, post-restatement
loans are more dominated by loans to larger firms than are pre-restatement loans in our sample. After
restatement, the number of loans to smaller firms (i.e., firms with total assets less than the median assets in the
final sample) drops by about 50%, while the number of loans to larger firms drops by only about 20%.
Controlling for firm size, we find that loan size scaled by total assets decreases significantly after restatement.
18
   We use activation date to separate pre-restatement loans from post-restatement loans. Ideally, we would
define post-restatement loans as those that have a contracting date after the restatement announcement date.
However, Dealscan does not provide the information on the date a loan is contracted. Instead, the date a
contract becomes active, which should be no earlier than the loan contracting date, is available. Therefore, the
coefficient on the post-restatement dummy might be understated because we use the activation date.


                                                                                                               15
loan characteristics, industry effects, and macroeconomic factors that may influence the

cost of debt. 19

                                              [Table 3 about here]

        The regression results are reported in Table 3. Column 1 analyzes the cost of debt

with post-restatement dummy as the only independent variable. The estimated coefficient

equals 0.497 and is significant at a 1% level, indicating that after firms announce

restatements, loan spreads increase by approximately one-half. 20 Therefore, the effect of

restatement on the cost of debt is economically significant.

        The regression in Column 2 of Table 3 includes firm characteristics that could

influence the cost of bank loans. 21 These variables include Log(assets), the logarithm of a

firm’s total assets, to measure firm size. Larger firms have easier access to external

financing. They also are hypothesized to have less information asymmetry and are

associated with smaller monitoring costs. Therefore, larger firms are likely to borrow from

banks on better terms. We use Market to book, the ratio of market value of assets (market

value of equity plus book value of debt) to the book value of assets, to proxy for a firm's

growth opportunities. All else equal, a firm recognized as having better growth

opportunities can have a lower borrowing cost. Growth firms may be vulnerable to

financial distress or subject to information asymmetry. However, given that we will control

19
   Data definitions and measurement details for all the variables are reported in the Appendix.
20
   Because the dependent variable is expressed in logarithmic form, the coefficient estimates represent
percentage change effects of the independent variables on the dependent variable.
21
   The financial restatement may of course result in altered financial numbers post-restatement. For the
purpose of our study, we use company reported non-restated financial information in the main regressions.
(For each financial statement data item, Compustat contains a company’s initially reported number and a
restated number. We use the former.) The implications from our analysis do not change if we instead use
restated financial information when analyzing the post-restatement loans. We use reported non-restated
financials when analyzing pre-restatement loans because when loans are contracted before restatement, banks
rely on reported information when setting up the loan contracts. It is possible that banks also have private
information about the firm before a restatement is announced. In such a case, the complete effect of
restatement is attenuated due to the leakage of information to lenders, and the regression coefficient on the
post-restatement dummy may measure a partial effect and be understated.


                                                                                                         16
for other characteristics like tangibility of book assets, market to book may affect the loan

spread negatively if market to book represents the additional value over book assets that

debt holders can access in the event of default.

         We also control for Leverage, the ratio of long-term debt to total assets. Firms with

higher leverage ratios, all else equal, have higher default risk and thus we expect them to

face a higher cost of bank borrowing. 22 We also include Profitability, the ratio of earnings

before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to total assets, because

profitable firms generally have low default risk and thus can borrow at a lower cost.

Tangibility is defined as the ratio of tangible assets to total assets. Because lenders may

recover tangible assets should the firm default, we expect firms with more tangible assets to

have lower borrowing costs. Cash flow volatility, measured as the standard deviation of

quarterly cash flows from operations over the 16 fiscal quarters prior to the loan initiation

year, scaled by total debt, is used to proxy for a firm's earnings risk and is expected to be

positively correlated with the cost of debt.23 Finally, Altman (1968)’s Z-score is included to

further control for default risk. A higher Z-score indicates better financial health and thus

lower default risk. All of the above variables are measured as of the year prior to the loan

initiation date.

         The results in Column 2 show that after controlling for firm characteristics, the

effect of restatement on the loan spread continues to be significant. The results also indicate

that small, volatile, highly levered, distressed firms with few tangible assets and few growth

options are associated with a higher cost of debt.
22
   Alternatively, lower ex ante costs of debt could enable a firm to take on more debt and thus the cost of debt
and leverage could be negatively correlated. To deal with this potential endogeneity, in the regressions,
leverage is measured one year prior to the loan initiation year and is therefore predetermined.
23
   Our definition of Cash flow volatility follows Bharath, Sunder, and Sunder (2006). This measure represents
earnings risk relative to the total debt commitment of the firm. In unreported analysis, we also use cash flow
volatility scaled by total assets, and the results are qualitatively unchanged.


                                                                                                            17
        We further control for loan characteristics that might be correlated with the price of

debt and report the results in Column 3 of Table 3. We control for Log(Maturity), the

natural logarithm of loan maturity in months, because the lender requires a liquidity

premium for longer term debt and this liquidity premium translates into a higher loan

spread. We also include Log(Loan Size), the natural logarithm of the amount of a loan,

which may capture economies of scale in bank lending and thus is expected to be inversely

related to the loan rate. Alternatively, this same negative relation might occur if riskier

borrowers are granted smaller loans with higher interest rates. Performance pricing is a

dummy variable equal to one if a loan contract has the performance pricing feature. 24 This

is to control for the possibility that lenders price loans differently if they contain

performance pricing clauses. The regression results show that further controlling for loan

characteristics has little effect on the magnitude and significance of the impact of

restatement on the loan spread. The results also show that larger loans and loans with

shorter maturity have smaller spreads, while performance pricing is not significantly related

to the loan spread.

        Macroeconomic conditions can affect debt pricing. In Column 4 of Table 3, we use

three different variables to control for macroeconomic cycles. Credit spread is the

difference between the yields of BAA and AAA corporate bonds. Term spread is the

difference between the yields of 10 year treasury bonds and 2 year treasury bonds.

I(1996≤Year≤2000) is an indicator variable, equaling one if the loan is initiated between

1996 and 2000. The literature suggests that credit spread and term spread are good proxies


24
  Performance pricing is a relatively new provision in bank debt contracts. A traditional bank loan is priced
using a fixed spread over a floating benchmark such as LIBOR or prime. Performance pricing explicitly
varies the loan spread with the borrower’s credit rating or financial performance measured with financial
ratios like debt-to-EBITDA, leverage, interest coverage, etc.


                                                                                                          18
of macroeconomic conditions and help explain stock and bond returns (Chen, Roll, and

Ross (1986) and Fama and French (1993)). Specifically, credit spreads tend to widen in

recessions and to shrink in expansions (Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein, and Martin (2001)).

This is because investors require more compensation for increased default risk in bad

economic times. High (low) term spreads are often used as an indicator of good (bad)

economic prospects. In the regressions, we measure credit spread and term spread one

month before the time the loan becomes active. The results show that credit spread is

positively related to loan spread, suggesting that market-wide default risk is reflected in the

individual loan rate.

        Finally, in Column 5 of Table 3, we control for loan type, loan purpose, and

industry effects. Loans are of different types, such as 364-day loans, term loans, and

revolving loans. Loans can also be declared for different uses like corporate purposes, debt

repayment, takeovers, working capital, etc. Because loans with different types and purposes

are associated with different risks, they may be priced differently. In addition, we employ

one digit SIC dummies to control for the potential differences in risks and debt pricing

structures across industries. After adding all the control variables, the results indicate that

the effect of restatement is still economically and statistically significant with a coefficient

that indicates a 46.2% increase in the loan spread after restatement. The average loan

spread of sample firms is 141 basis points before restatement. Therefore, a 46.2% increase

implies that, other things being equal, loan spreads increase by approximately 65 basis

points after restatement. 25 Since the average loan size for the sample firms after restatement


25
  The average one year LIBOR rate is 4.94% during our 1989 to 2004 sample period (historic LIBOR rates
from the British Bankers’ Association’s Interest Rate Settlements.) In our sample, the average total loan rate
before restatement is therefore about 6.35% (1.41% + 4.94%). A 50% increase in the loan spread implies that
the average spread increases by 71 (141×50%) basis points after restatement, and the average total loan rate


                                                                                                          19
is $404 million, the post-restatement increase in the loan spread implies an average increase

of $2.6 million per loan in annual post-restatement interest payments. 26                 27



         In sum, the results in this section are consistent with restatements signalling worse

and/or more uncertain future prospects. The resulting increases in the credit risk and

monitoring costs cause lenders to require a higher price of debt. It is worth highlighting that

the restatement dummy proxies for the increase in risk above and beyond any risk or

information effects captured by the other right-hand-side variables. For example,

profitability, Zscore, and market to book could partially capture the effect of firm

performance on credit risk (i.e., wealth effect), and cash flow volatility could partially

capture information uncertainty. Finding a significant coefficient on the dummy variable

indicates that the other right hand side variables do not fully capture the increase in risk due

to restatement. Moreover, the restatement dummy remains significant even when we

include forward looking variables like analyst earnings forecast and forecast dispersion (see

Table 4) as explanatory variables. Assuming that our linear model is adequate, and that our

specification includes all the relevant publicly available information, this implies that the


increases to 7.06% (6.35%+0.71%). The resulting increase in the total loan rate is 11.18% ((7.06%-
6.35%)/6.35%), which is in line with the 10.8% to 19.5% relative percentage increase in the cost of equity
capital found in Hribar and Jenkins (2004).
26
   About 50-60% of loans in Dealscan are revolving loans, in which the borrower may draw on funds at any
time, up to an established maximum limit, and does not have to exhaust the credit limit. In these revolving
loans, the drawn loan spread (i.e., the spread on the amount drawn) is about 197 basis points, and is much
higher than the undrawn loan spread (i.e., the spread on the amount undrawn), which is about 24 basis points.
An upper bound estimate of the increase in the annual interest payments post-restatement, based on the full
loan size and the drawn spread, is $2.6 million per loan. Under the alternative assumption that firms on
average draw down 50% of the credit limit in revolving loans, a more conservative estimate of the increase in
the annual interest payments per post-restatement loan would be $1.3 million, which is still economically
important.
27
   To investigate the possibility that the impact of restatement could be short-lived and fade over time, we
conduct a regression to separately estimate the effects of restatement on loans that were issued in each post-
restatement year. The results indicate that there are no significant differences in the increase in loan spreads
for post-restatement loans initiated in any year t+1, t+2, t+3, t+4, or t+5. In separate analysis, when we restrict
the sample to years between t-2 to t+2 and perform a regression using the main loan spread specification, we
find some evidence of a loan rate run-up effect prior to the restatement, which we conjecture is a result of
banks using their private information prior to the public restatement announcement.


                                                                                                               20
post-restatement dummy coefficient captures the effect of private information that banks

use to reassess the risk of the firm after restatement.

                                         [Table 4 about here]

       Besides providing the evidence that loan spreads are higher after restatement, we

examine why borrowers are viewed as being riskier after restatement. In unreported

analysis, we find that after restatement there is an increase in leverage and a decline in

profitability, Z-score, net income, return on assets, earnings per share, sales scaled by assets,

operating cash flows scaled by assets, market-to-book, and analyst consensus forecasted

earnings. An unreported regression shows that changes in net income, market value,

profitability, Z-score, and consensus earnings are negatively associated with changes in

loan spreads, while changes in leverage, cash flow volatility, and analyst forecast

dispersion are positively related to changes in loan spreads. These results suggest that

changes in firm characteristics and analyst forecasts caused by restatement reflect changes

in firm risk and such changes in risk are reflected in changed loan spreads.

4.1.1 Wealth Effect versus Information Effect of Restatement

       As discussed above, there are two ways that restatement may affect the cost of

borrowing. The first is a wealth effect, in which a restatement affects estimates of the

expected future cash flows of the firm. The second is an information effect, in which a

restatement affects the degree of certainty that lenders have in their estimates of future cash

flows. Although it is difficult to disentangle the two effects, in this section, we make an

attempt to isolate the extent to which loan spreads change due to reduced earnings versus

increased uncertainty.




                                                                                             21
         Using I/B/E/S data, we identify firms that have increased analyst forecast dispersion

after restatement. 28 These firms have increased information uncertainty due to restatement,

while the other firms do not. Both groups have mean (wealth) effects. This allows us to

estimate the extent to which loan spreads change due to the information effect, above and

beyond the wealth effect.

         We estimate the following regression:

     Log(Loan Spread)=α+βPost-Restatement+γPost-Restatement×DispIncrease+ δX+ ε (2)

where the dummy variable, DispIncrease, is equal to one if analyst forecast dispersion

increases after restatement, and is zero otherwise. X represents control variables. Thus, to

the extent that analyst forecast dispersion reflects information uncertainty, γ is expected to

capture the information effect and β is expected to capture the wealth effect, above any

wealth and/or information effects controlled by X.

                                               [Table 5 about here]

         In Column (1) of Table 5, we include only the post-restatement dummy and the

interaction term and do not control for any other variables. The results show that loan

spreads increase by 45.3% (i.e., β=0.453) after restatement for companies without increased

forecast dispersion. Companies that experience increased dispersion have an additional

16.5% increase in loan spreads (i.e., γ=0.165), for a total loan spread increase of 61.8%

after restatement. In other words, for firms that exhibit increased information uncertainty,

the information effect accounts for about 1/4th (16.5/61.8) of the total effect of restatement,

and the wealth effect accounts for the remaining 3/4ths.
28
   As in Diether, Malloy, and Scherbina (2002), we define dispersion as the standard deviation of analysts’
current-fiscal-year EPS forecasts, scaled by the absolute value of the mean forecast. For each restating firm,
we include only the dispersion of forecasts that are made within one year surrounding restatement
announcements and representing the same fiscal year EPS forecasts. We alternatively define dispersion as the
standard deviation scaled by fiscal year end share price preceding restatement announcement, and the results
from this alternative definition are essentially unaffected.


                                                                                                          22
        In Column (2) of Table 5, we control for various factors in X. In this case, the

wealth effect contributes to a loan spread increase of about 40.8% after restatement, and the

information effect contributes an additional 26.0%. As a result, for firms with increased

information uncertainty, after controlling for observable factors, the residual information

effect accounts for about 40% (26.0/66.8), and the wealth effect accounts for 60% of the

total effect of restatement. We find similar results if we define DispIncrease to equal one

only if the increase in dispersion is statistically significant (reported in Columns (3) and (4)

of Table 5). In Column (4), the wealth and information effects each contribute about one-

half of the overall increase in loan spreads due to financial restatement. 29

4.1.2 The Effect of Fraud on the Cost of Bank Debt

                                              [Table 6 about here]

        In this section, we examine whether fraud-related restatements lead to a larger

increase in the cost of debt than do other restatements. Compared with non-fraudulent firms,

fraud firms have more severe risk and information problems and thus are expected to

experience a greater increase in loan rates after restatement. We include an interaction term

post-restatement× fraud, where fraud is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the restating

company is found to have committed fraud. The results reported in Table 6 indicate that

fraud increases the restatement effect on the cost of debt. The coefficient on post-

restatement is 0.426 and the coefficient on post-restatement× fraud is 0.263, and both

coefficients are significant. Thus non-fraudulent restatements lead to a 42.6% increase in

the loan spread, while fraudulent restatements have a much greater effect: a 68.9% (42.6%

+ 26.3%) increase in the spread.

29
  The results on disentangling the two effects should be interpreted with caution. Banks could have different
perceptions from analysts, and therefore analysts’ forecast dispersion is not a perfect proxy for information
uncertainty.


                                                                                                          23
4.1.3 The Identity of the Restatement Initiator and the Cost of Bank Debt

        In this section, we study whether the identity of the party that prompts the

restatement differentially affects the cost of debt. Restatement initiated by outside parties

such as the external auditor and the SEC may signal that a company’s internal monitoring

failed not only to prevent, but also to correct, a material misstatement. Conversely,

detection and revelation by the company provides some indication of relatively stronger

internal governance. This may mitigate the adverse signal about the company’s future

prospects and the uncertainty generated by the restatement. Therefore, we suspect that the

effect of restatement prompted by external monitors might be a stronger negative reaction

than the effect of restatement prompted by the company.

        To examine the potential difference in the effects of prompter identity on loan

spread, we first create four dummy variables, Company, Auditor, SEC, and Uncertain.

These dummies are respectively equal to 1 if a restatement is initiated by the company itself,

the external auditor, the SEC or other known regulators such as Nasdaq, or any unknown

party. 30 These dummies are interacted with the Post-restatement variable. Each of these

interaction terms captures the change in the loan spread after a restatement attributed to a

specific prompter, compared to the loan spread before the restatement.

        The results (available upon request) show that all the interaction terms between

Post-restatement and prompter dummies are significantly positive, implying that the cost of

debt goes up after restatement no matter who initiates the refiling. The point estimates of

the coefficients of the cross terms are highest for cases prompted by external auditors




30
  Since there are only five restatements initiated by external regulators such as Nasdaq, FASB, IRS, etc., we
combine them with restatements prompted by the SEC in the regression.


                                                                                                          24
(0.612), followed by the SEC (0.535), and then the company (0.457). However, none of the

estimated coefficients differs statistically from the others.

4.2    Effect of Restatement on Other Loan Contract Terms

       If restatements convey information about a company's future prospects and the

quality of information disclosure, lenders might incorporate this information into debt

contracts by altering not only the loan rate but also other contract terms, such as maturity,

collateral, and covenants. In this section, we focus on how restatement impacts the three

major non-price debt contract features: loan maturity, whether a loan is collateralized, and

the total number of covenants.

                                     [Table 7 about here]

4.2.1 Debt Maturity

       Column 1 of Table 7 reports the results on the impact of restatement on debt

maturity, controlling for other variables that could correlate with maturity. The coefficient

on the post-restatement dummy indicates that after restatement, firms use loans that have a

maturity 17.1% (7.7 months) shorter than before restatement, implying that shortened

maturity helps address risk and information problems arising from restatement.

       The regression results also document the following relations between control

variables and debt maturity. First, leverage is positively related to loan maturity, which is

consistent with the empirical evidence presented in Barclay and Smith (1995), Johnson

(2003), and Stohs and Mauer (1996). In addition, a profitable firm with more tangible

assets and better financial health has access to loans with longer maturity. Further, loan size

is positively related to loan maturity. Loans without performance pricing have shorter

maturity, possibly because banks use short maturity to adjust loan terms instead of linking



                                                                                            25
loan pricing with firm performance dynamically. This suggests that performance pricing

could substitute for shorter debt maturity in corporate monitoring.

4.2.2 Loan Securitization

        We study the impact of restatement on the likelihood of a loan being secured

because collateralization is an important feature of financial contracts. We estimate a probit

model where the dependent variable is 1 if the loan is secured and 0 otherwise and report

the result in Column 2 of Table 7. The marginal effect of the post-restatement dummy

implies that the probability of a loan being secured increases by 8.6% after restatement,

holding other variables at their means. 31 This is consistent with the view that firms with

restated financials are more likely to be required to provide collateral against their loans.

        The effects of control variables on the likelihood of a loan being secured are

intuitive. Large, profitable, low leverage firms with more tangible assets and better

financial health likely have lower default risk and thus are associated with a lower

probability of the loan being secured. Loan size is negatively correlated with the likelihood

of a loan being secured likely because loan size is positively related to credit quality, while

credit quality is negatively related to collateral. Finally, in good years, market-wide default

risk declines and the likelihood of a loan being secured decreases.

4.2.3 Covenant Intensity

        Covenants play an important role in private debt contracts. 32 To estimate the impact

of restatement on the covenant intensity of a loan, we follow Bradley and Roberts (2005)



31
  The restatement dummy coefficient of 0.316 translates into an 8.6% marginal effect in the Probit model.
32
  Debt covenants are more important in private debt than in public debt. According to Barclay and Smith
(1995), when a restrictive debt covenant is violated, it is often optimal to renegotiate the debt agreement
rather than forcing the borrower into bankruptcy. It is costly to renegotiate covenants in public debt
agreements outside the bankruptcy process because the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 limits the discretion that


                                                                                                         26
and track the total number of covenants included in the loan agreement, in the context of a

Poisson regression. The goodness-of-fit chi-squared statistic of the Poisson regression has a

p-value of 0.11 and the null hypothesis that the dependent variable is Poisson distributed

cannot be rejected, which indicates that Poisson specification is suitable. The results,

reported in Column 3 of Table 7, indicate that lenders impose more restrictions on loans to

restating firms. The incidence ratio from the Poisson regression shows that on average, the

number of covenants increases from an average of 6.9 in a pre-restatement loan to 7.6 in a

post-restatement loan, after controlling for other characteristics.

         To further investigate the type of covenants added to loan contracts after

restatement, we separately study financial covenants and general covenants. Financial

covenants place limits, which must be maintained while the debt is outstanding, on

accounting variables and ratios. General covenants are restrictions on prepayment,

dividends, and voting rights. Prepayment covenants usually specify that a loan must be

repaid from a specific source such as equity issuance, excess cash flow, excess asset sales,

excess debt issuance, or insurance proceeds related to collateral. The dividend covenant

limits the payment of dividends. The covenants on voting rights mandate the percentage of

lenders required to approve the changes of the items in the loan agreement, such as term

changes and collateral release.

         Columns 4 and 5 in Table 7 show that the new covenants added after restatement

are general instead of financial covenants. Financial covenants are often violated after

restatement. Therefore, tightening financial covenant ratios or increasing the number of




may be allocated to the trustee in a public debt issue. Therefore, private lenders have a comparative advantage
in writing debt contracts that contain restrictive covenants.


                                                                                                           27
financial covenants might be less efficient in solving the monitoring problems, relative to

increasing the general restrictions on prepayment of loans, dividend payout, etc.

         The relations between other variables and covenant intensity are interesting. The

loan contracts of growth firms have fewer covenant restrictions, consistent with the finding

of Nash, Netter, and Poulsen (2003) that firms with more growth opportunities seek to

preserve flexibility by including fewer restrictive covenants in their financial contracts.

Highly levered, low asset tangibility, distressed firms have more covenants, which is

consistent with these firms having higher agency costs of debt. Profitable firms are

associated with more covenants, as are performance pricing loans. The latter might occur

because a high credit risk firm is more likely to have debt priced conditional on credit

improvements, and lenders impose more covenant restrictions on high credit risk firms.

Loan maturity and covenant intensity are positively related, possibly because more

covenants are required to control potential agency problems arising from longer term debt.

Finally, covenant intensity is positively related to credit spread, consistent with firm default

risk increasing with market-wide default risk, and more covenants being written in loans to

firms with higher default risk.

4.3      Effect of Restatement on Lender Structure

         Restating firms have increased credit risk and heightened informational issues, and

these problems may affect the structure of lenders in a loan. In this section we investigate

the effects of restatement on two aspects of the lender structure: the total number of lenders

in a loan, and the transaction fees charged by lenders. 33



33
  Multiple lenders are important features of bank loan structure due to syndication, which has become an
increasingly important way for commercial borrowers to satisfy their financing needs. A syndicate is a group
of lenders making a loan jointly to a single borrower. There is one lead arranger that establishes a relationship


                                                                                                             28
4.3.1 Number of Lenders

                                         [Table 8 about here]

        Column 1 of Table 8 shows that the number of lenders declines significantly in

loans activated after restatement. The incidence ratio from the Poisson regression suggests

that, after controlling for other variables, the number of lenders in a post-restatement loan is

about three-fourths that in a pre-restatement loan: 6.5 post-restatement vs. 8.5 pre-

restatement.

        The estimated coefficients on the control variables provide ambiguous evidence on

the relation between syndicate size and credit risk. On the one hand, highly levered firms

have more lenders, possibly to help the lenders diversify their loan portfolios. Loan size is

positively correlated with the number of lenders, probably because more lenders are needed

to assume loans with larger amounts. In addition, performance pricing and the number of

lenders are positively related, perhaps because high risk firms are more likely to have

performance loans and at the same time require more lenders to diversify the risk. The

economic boom dummy is negatively related to the number of lenders, implying that a

more diffuse lender structure is used when market-wide default risk is high. Taken together,

this evidence is consistent with the classic diversification motive for syndication: By opting

for relatively small portions, participants limit their exposure to high default risk loans.

      In contrast, we also find that firm size is positively related to the number of lenders.

Larger firms typically have less severe asymmetric information problems and require less

monitoring, and therefore can borrow from syndicates that involve more lenders. We also

find evidence that lower profitability and lower term spreads are related to fewer lenders,


with the borrowing firm, negotiates terms of the contract, and guarantees an amount for a price range. The
lead arranger then turns to participant lenders to fund part of the loan.


                                                                                                       29
possibly because of a higher default risk for such firms. The result that syndicate size

decreases with credit risk is consistent with the monitoring motive for syndication: When

borrowing firms are riskier, a more concentrated lender structure enhances group

monitoring and increases the prospects of successful restructuring in the event of default.

4.3.2 Transaction Fees

      We further examine whether lenders charge higher transaction costs for borrowers

that have restated financial results. The lead bank in a syndicate arranges and manages the

syndicated loan, and typically also acts as the agent bank that monitors the firm, governs

the terms of the loan, administers the drawdown of funds, calculates interest payments, and

enforces covenants. The fee the borrower pays for this service increases with the

complexity and riskiness of the loan. Fees are often tiered, with the lead arranger receiving

a larger amount in consideration of its structuring and/or underwriting the loan. Co-

underwriters typically receive lower fees, and then the general syndicate members will

likely receive fees tied to their commitment.

      We examine upfront fees and annual fees charged by banks. 34 An upfront fee is a one-

time fee paid to lenders at the closing of the deal. It is analogous to an original-issue

discount in the bond market. This upfront payment from the borrower to the lead arranger

can be shared by the lead arranger with the other syndicate members, and it varies between

25 and 175 basis points of the total loan amount. An annual fee is simply an annual charge

against the entire commitment amount, whether used or unused, and is also called the

facility fee. The fee information is limited in our sample and our regressions are based on

384 and 555 non-missing observations for upfront fees and annual fees, respectively.

34
  The fees associated with syndicated loans also include the commitment fee, the utilization fee, the letter of
credit fee, and the cancellation fee, among others. We focus on the upfront fee and the annual fee because
they are the most common and important.


                                                                                                           30
Columns 2 and 3 of Table 8 show that after restatement, both upfront and annual fees

increase, suggesting that lenders charge higher fees to compensate for the increased costs of

monitoring after restatement.

      The other coefficients indicate that small firms with high default risk and few growth

options are required to pay higher fees, possibly due to the high cost of monitoring such

firms. Longer term debt requires a greater upfront fee, but not a greater annual fee. In

addition, larger loans are associated with lower fees, probably because fees are measured as

the percentage of loan amount and larger loans have the benefit of economies of scale.

Loans with performance pricing have higher annual fees perhaps because such loans tie the

pricing of loans with firm credit quality and financial performance dynamically, and it is

more costly to administer such loans. Finally, lower fees are associated with lower credit

spreads, higher term spreads, and boom years. This is likely because firm default risk

decreases in good years and monitoring costs decrease with default risk.

4.4    Robustness Tests

       In previous regressions, we controlled for various observable firm characteristics. It

is possible that unobservable firm characteristics could also affect loan contract terms.

Since each firm in our sample has at least two loans at different points in time (at least one

pre-restatement loan and one post-restatement loan), our sample is a panel, which we now

exploit to control for potential unobservable time-invariant firm-specific effects. In addition,

loans borrowed by the same firm could potentially correlate with each other, and this

correlation may lead to biased standard errors. To deal with these two issues, we conduct a

firm fixed effect regression with standard errors adjusted for heteroscedasticity and within-

firm clustering (see Column 1 of Table 9). After controlling for firm fixed effects, the post-




                                                                                            31
restatement effect on loan spread decreases to 0.370 from 0.462 (from the specification in

Column 5, Table 3) but it remains economically and statistically significant. 35

                                           [Table 9 about here]

         Unobservable time series changes (such as macroeconomic or industry shocks)

contemporaneous with restatements could also affect the estimated influence of

restatements. To remove the effect of contemporaneous shocks, we employ a matched

sample differences-in-differences methodology. 36 We first create a matched sample, which

consists of firms in the same 2-digit SIC industry as a given restating firm and with sales

within +/- 10 percent of the restating firm’s sales. Then we estimate the following

regression using a sample that pools the restating and matched firms:

      Log(Loan Spread)j,i,t =α t+β i +γXj,i,t+δRestating Firmi×Post-Restatementi,t+ εj,i,t                  (3)

where Log(Loan Spread)j,i,t is the logarithm of loan spread for loan j borrowed by firm i in

year t, αt and βi are year and firm fixed effects, Xj,i,t represents control variables defined in

Equation (1), Post-Restatementi,t is a dummy variable that equals one after restatement, and

Restating Firmi equals one (zero) for a restatement (matched) firm. This methodology

controls for aggregate fluctuations via year dummies as well as unobservable differences

between restating and matched firms via firm fixed effects. Our estimate of δ captures the

restatement effect, which represents the change in the log loan spread specific to firms that

have restated. 37 The results, as reported in Column 2 of Table 9, show that the impact of


35
   The disadvantage of the firm fixed effect approach is that most firms have only a few loans with non-
missing contract term information, so the power of contract term tests is reduced. Nonetheless, when we
implement a firm fixed effect approach all but one of our qualitative results holds. The one difference is that
in contract terms firm fixed effects analysis, the total covenants variable retains the same sign but becomes
insignificant.
36
   For more details on the differences-in-differences method, see Bertrand and Mullainathan (1999, 2003) and
Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1997, 1998).
37
   Two difficulties arise with the differences-in-differences estimation. First, when some firms restate
financials, banks may alter the loan contract terms of non-restating firms that have similar size or industry to


                                                                                                            32
restatements on loan spread is statistically significant and is estimated to be 0.182. Based

on this coefficient, the post-restatement increase in the loan spread implies an average

increase of $1.02 million in the annual interest payments per post-restatement loan. 38

         Another potential issue is that, in the loan spread regression, one of the independent

variables, loan maturity, may be endogenous because loan spread and maturity are

sometimes simultaneously determined in a debt contract. To deal with this potential

simultaneity, we employ a two stage least square regression. In the first stage, we regress

debt maturity on a firm’s asset maturity. The predicted value of debt maturity is then used

on the right hand side of the second stage regression. 39 The result from the two stage

regression, reported in Column 3 of Table 9, shows that the post-restatement dummy

remains statistically and economically significant after controlling for the endogeneity of

loan maturity.

         We also investigate whether our results could be driven by a few loans that have

extremely high post-restatement loan spreads. We perform a median regression that

estimates the effect of explanatory variables on the median loan spread, conditional on the

values of explanatory variables. The results from the median regression in Column 4 of




the restating firms (i.e., the contract terms of the matched firms). This could potentially weaken our results.
Second, missing Dealscan data in some non-price contract terms may lead to insufficient within-firm variation
and reduce the reliability of firm fixed effect estimation.
38
   If we assume that firms on average draw down 50% of the credit limit in revolving loans, the 0.182
coefficient implies an increase in annual interest payments of $0.51 million per post-restatement loan. See
footnote 26.
39
   Asset maturity meets the requirements to be an appropriate instrument for debt maturity in the loan spread
regression. First, the literature shows that asset maturity is positively correlated with debt maturity. Myers
(1977) argues that by matching debt maturity to asset maturity, firms ensure that the schedule of debt
repayments corresponds with the decline in the value of assets in place. Stohs and Mauer (1996) and Johnson
(2003) empirically show that debt maturity and asset maturity are significantly positively correlated. Graham
and Harvey (2001) note that CFOs rank matching loan and asset maturity as one of the most important factors
in the choice of debt maturity. Second, it can be reasonably argued that asset maturity does not affect loan
spread or the residual of the loan spread regression (see, for example, Bharath, Sunder, and Sunder (2006)).


                                                                                                           33
Table 9 are similar to those from the OLS (mean) regression in Column 5 of Table 3,

suggesting that our results are not driven by outliers.

         Finally, the basic unit of our empirical analysis is a loan. However, a loan may be

part of a multiple loan deal and the loan contract terms are the outcome of deal level

negotiations. As a result, contract terms of the loans in a deal may not be independent, and

treating these loans independently may affect the results and overstate statistical

significance. To address this issue, for each deal, we aggregate individual loans into a deal

level observation by computing weighted (by loan amount) average loan terms such as

spread, maturity, etc. We then estimate the regressions at the deal level and find that the

deal level regression results are similar to the loan level results. 40 We report the deal level

regression results on loan spreads in Column (5) of Table 9; they are quite similar to what

we report throughout the paper. Though not shown in the table, the results are also similar

for deal-level analysis of the non-spread contract terms.

         In sum, the effect of restatement on the cost of debt is robust to a variety of

specifications and remains economically and statistically significant.



5.       Conclusion

         The number and size of companies that restate financial statements grew

significantly in the last decade. Financial misreporting has severe ex post consequences on

financial securities, investors, and firms, resulting in a substantial loss of market value and

investor confidence and an increase in the cost of capital. The extant literature has focused


40
  Loans in a deal could have different spreads, maturities, fees, lenders, and securitization, but typically have
the same covenants. We estimate the deal level regressions on spread and non-spread terms (except
covenants).



                                                                                                             34
on the impact of misreporting from the equity holder’s perspective. In this paper, we

examine misreporting from the debt holder’s perspective by investigating how the

contracting of bank debt changes as a result of financial restatement.

       We find that compared to loans initiated before the disclosure of corporate

misreporting, loans initiated after restatement have significantly higher loan spreads,

shorter maturities, higher likelihood of being secured, and more covenant restrictions. We

also find that loan syndicates contain fewer lenders and firms pay higher upfront and annual

fees after misreporting announcements.

       The increase in the cost of debt caused by restatement is an ex post cost borne by

the restatement firms. The implications for ex ante social welfare, however, are more

nuanced. Kedia and Rajgopal (2005) find that the ex ante costs of anticipated misreporting

are negatively associated with the likelihood of misreporting. To the extent that the ex post

cost of misreporting is reflected in a firm’s subjective ex ante cost, the prohibitive increase

in the cost of capital ex post could be effective in curbing misreporting ex ante.

       In sum, the evidence provided in this paper is consistent with the following view.

Restatement lowers the perception of companies’ future prospects and increases the

uncertainty about reported financial information. The resulting increase in risk is priced

incremental to other known sources of credit risk. Our study provides unique evidence on

how financial restatement influences the design of financial contracts and affects the cost

and terms of debt.

   Effect of Restatement and Analyst Forecast Variables on the Cost of Bank Debt
The table presents the regression results on the effect of restatement on the cost of bank debt, controlling
analyst consensus earnings forecast and forecast dispersion. Analyst earnings forecast (analyst forecast
dispersion) is the mean (standard deviation) of all analyst forecasts extant the month prior to the loan
activation date. The dependent variable is log(loan spread). The dummy variable post-restatement is equal
to one if the loan is initiated after the announcement of restatement and zero otherwise. The details of
definitions and measurements of all the other variables are reported in the Appendix. Heteroskedasticity
robust t-statistics are in parentheses. Significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels is indicated by *, **, and
***, respectively.

                  Wealth Effect versus Information Effect of Restatement

The table presents the regression results on the wealth effect and information effect of restatement on the
cost of bank debt. The dependent variable is log(loan spread). The dummy variable post-restatement is
equal to one if the loan is contracted after the announcement of restatement and zero otherwise. Analyst
earnings forecast (analyst forecast dispersion) is the mean (standard deviation) of all analyst forecasts
extant the month prior to the loan activation date. The DispIncrease dummy is equal to one if for a restating
company, the analyst forecast dispersion after restatement is greater than that before restatement, and zero
otherwise. The DispIncreaseSig dummy is equal to one if for a restating company, the analyst forecast
dispersion after restatement is significantly greater than that before restatement, and zero otherwise. The
details of definitions and measurements of all the other variables are reported in the Appendix.
Heteroskedasticity robust t-statistics are in parentheses. Significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels is

                  Effect of Fraudulent Restatement on the Cost of Bank Debt

The table presents the regression results on the effect of fraud-related restatement on the cost of bank debt. The
dependent variable is log(loan spread). The dummy variable post-restatement is equal to one if the loan is
contracted after the announcement of restatement and zero otherwise. The fraud dummy is equal to one if the
restating company is identified as having committed fraud and zero otherwise. The definitions of the other
variables are reported in the Appendix. Heteroskedasticity robust t-statistics are in parentheses. Significance at
the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels is indicated by *, **, and ***, respectively.

                  Effect of Restatement on Non-spread Loan Contract Terms
The table presents the regression results on the effects of restatement on non-price loan contract terms. (1) is an
OLS regression with log(debt maturity) as the dependent variable, (2) is a Probit regression with debt security as
dependent variable, and (3) is a Poisson regression with covenant intensity as dependent variable. The dummy
variable post-restatement is equal to one if the loan is contracted after the announcement of restatement and zero
otherwise. Log(Maturity) is the natural logarithm of debt maturity measured in months. Security is a dummy
variable that is equal to one if the loan is secured by collateral and zero otherwise. Number of Covenants is the
total number of covenants included in the debt agreement. Number of General (Financial) Covenants is the total
number of general (financial) covenants in the debt agreement. The details of definitions and measurements of
all the other variables are reported in the Appendix. Heteroskedasticity robust t-statistics for OLS regression and
heteroskedasticity robust z-statistics for Probit and Poisson regressions are reported in parentheses. Significance
at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels is indicated by *, **, and ***, respectively.

                             Effect of Restatement on Lender Structure

The table presents the regression results on the effects of restatement on loan syndicate structure. The dependent
variable in Poisson regression (1) and OLS regression (2) and (3) is the number of lenders, log(upfront fee), and
log(annual fee), respectively. The dummy variable post-restatement is equal to one if the loan is contracted after
the announcement of restatement and zero otherwise. Number of lenders is the total number of lenders in one
single loan. Upfront fee is a fee paid by the borrower upon loan closing. Annual fee is the annual charge against
the entire loan commitment amount, whether used or unused. The details of definitions and measurements of all
the other variables are reported in the Appendix. Heteroskedasticity robust t-statistics for OLS regression and
heteroskedasticity robust z-statistics for Poisson regression are reported in parentheses. Significance at the 10%,
5%, and 1% levels is indicated by *, **, and ***, respectively.

                                               Robustness Tests

The table presents the robustness tests of the effect of restatement on the cost of bank debt. The dependent
variable in all the regressions in the table is log(loan spread). Regression (1) is the firm fixed effect regression
with standard errors being adjusted for heteroscedasticity and clustering within firms. (2) is the matched sample
differences-in-differences regression. (3) is the two stage least square regression, with asset maturity as the
instrument variable to control for the potential endogeneity of debt maturity. A median regression robust to
outliers is reported in (4). (5) is the deal level regression, in which individual loan terms in a deal are aggregated
into a deal level observation using loan amount as weights. The dummy variable post-restatement is equal to one
if the loan is contracted after the announcement of restatement and zero otherwise. The definitions of the other
variables are reported in the Appendix. T-statistics are in parentheses. Significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%
levels is indicated by *, **, and ***, respectively.

Cash Flow Volatility   Standard deviation of quarterly cash flows from operations (∆ quarterly data108) over the 4 fiscal years prior to the loan
                       initiation year scaled by the total debt (data9+data34)

Asset Maturity         Asset maturity is the book value-weighted maturity of long-term assets and current assets, where the maturity of long-term
                       assets is computed as gross property, plant, and equipment divided by depreciation expense, and the maturity of current
                       assets is computed as current assets divided by the cost of goods sold (see Barclay and Smith (1995) and Billet, King, and
                       Mauer (2007)). In other words, asset maturity = [PPE /(CA+PPE)]×[PPE/Depreciation] + [CA/(CA+PPE)]×[CA/COGS] =
                       [data7/(data4+data7)]×[data7/data14] + [data4/(data4+data7)]×[data4/data41], where PPE=gross property, plant, and
                       equipment, CA=current assets, and COGS=cost of goods sold

    We use a modified Z-score, which does not include the ratio of market value of equity to book value of total debt, because a similar term,
   market-to-book, enters the regressions as a separate variable.

Loan Characteristics

Loan Spread            Loan spread is measured as all-in spread drawn in the Dealscan database. All-in spread drawn is defined as the amount the
                       borrower pays in basis points over LIBOR or LIBOR equivalent for each dollar drawn down. (For loans not based on
                       LIBOR, LPC converts the spread into LIBOR terms by adding or subtracting a differential which is adjusted periodically.)
                       This measure adds the borrowing spread of the loan over LIBOR with any annual fee paid to the bank group.

Log(Maturity)          Natural log of the loan maturity. Maturity is measured in months.

Log(Loan Size)         Natural log of the loan facility amount. Loan amount is measured in millions of dollars.

Security dummy         A dummy variable that equals one if the loan facility is secured by collateral and zero otherwise.

Performance Pricing    A dummy variable that equals one if the loan facility uses performance pricing.
dummy
Number of Lenders      Total number of lenders in a single loan.

Upfront fee            A fee paid by the borrower upon closing of a loan. (Measured in basis points)

Annual fee             Also called facility fee, is the annual charge against the entire loan commitment amount, whether used or unused.
                       (Measured in basis points)

Loan Type Dummies      Dummy variable for loan types, including term loan, revolver greater than one year, revolver less than one year, and 364
                       day facility.

Loan Purpose           Dummy Variable for loan purposes, including corporate purposes, debt repayment, working capital, takeover, etc.
