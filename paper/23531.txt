                                          ABSTRACT

Economists have long believed education is essential to the acquisition of human capital and
contributes to economic growth. However, education researchers, political and business leaders
and other stakeholders have raised concerns about the quality and costs of the K-12 education
system in the United States and the implications for the development of the nation’s future
workforce. Some of these groups have called for more innovation in K-12 education, leveraging
technology in the classroom and experimenting with different organizing models for schools,
both as a means to lower costs and increase quality. To shed light on the prospects of this
approach, I review the economics literature at the intersection between innovation and K-12
education from two different, but related, perspectives. First, I summarize the evidence about the
efficacy of technological and other kinds of innovation in the classroom. Second, I discuss the
state of research on how the American K-12 system influences the production of innovators and
entrepreneurs. In both instances, I identify implications for policy and opportunities for future
research to generate actionable insights, particularly around increasing the low levels of research
and development in the education sector.

Introduction
        A key objective of public policies designed to promote innovation is to develop, attract,

and incentivize individuals who will generate new technological ideas. Much of the economics

literature in this domain has focused either on increasing the “intensive” margin of innovation

from the ranks of existing inventors via incentives and intellectual property policy (c.f. Stern

2004; Jaffe and Lerner 2011; Bell et al. 2016) or on contributing to the “extensive” margin via

high-skilled immigrants, who have been found to contribute disproportionately to U.S.

innovation and entrepreneurship (e.g., Saxenian 2007; Kerr and Lincoln 2010). However,

economists have written far less about specific policies that can add to the extensive margin of

innovation from a different source, namely, developing the innovative and entrepreneurial

potential of the native-born population.1

        The priorities of different sub-fields in economics partially explain this gap. Although

education economists have studied the American K-12 education system extensively, they have

rarely assessed innovation-related metrics, focusing instead on broader outcomes such as test

scores and graduation rates. For their part, innovation economists seldom study the K-12

education system directly, but rather favor studying innovative outputs of firms, universities, and

governments. As a result, we still have much to learn about how education policy can affect the

domestic supply of innovators and whether new technological innovations can improve K-12

educational outcomes. Some quite recent academic work, discussed below, provides some

intriguing insights for policymakers. However, the relatively small number of papers and




1
  There is existing work on innovation and entrepreneurship policies that looks at developing geographic regions,
reviewed by Chatterji et al. (2014). Other scholars have explored the role of higher education in producing an
innovative workforce (e.g., Romer, 2000; Stephan et al. 2004).
numerous remaining open questions underscore an emerging opportunity for economists

interested in the intersection between innovation and education.

       In this paper, I review two strands of literature that relate to the nexus between innovation

and education. First, I examine the small literature in economics that typically uses experiments

to evaluate the impact of technology (hardware and software) on student achievement. I also

briefly summarize the implications from work on how organizational innovations, such as the

promulgation of new management practices, are related to student outcomes. Second, I discuss

the emerging literature on how the design and curriculum of education systems relates to the

production of an innovative workforce.

Technology, Productivity, and Schools

       The economics of innovation has a long tradition of estimating the productivity benefits

from adopting new information technology (e.g., Stiroh 2002). Although technology has

enhanced productivity across various industrial sectors, it has arguably not had that effect in K-

12 education, despite the great expectations of policymakers, the media, and some technologists.

Cutler (2011) reports that productivity growth in two key sectors, education and healthcare, grew

quite slowly after 1995, in sharp contrast to the economy as a whole, where numerous industries

leveraged new technologies effectively. These two sectors feature prominently in research on the

“cost disease” (Baumol and Bowen 1966; Baumol 2012) which argues that costs can rise rapidly

in industries with low productivity growth, in part because of key services that are particularly

reliant on humans. It is worth noting here that just as Cutler (2011) provides a framework for

understanding where innovators and entrepreneurs can drive productivity increases in healthcare,

a primary aim of the discussion below is to address similar questions with respect to K-12

education. In doing so, I seek to direct the attention of innovation scholars to a new context,
which, much like healthcare, features significant government involvement and complex

regulations.

         Several reasons could explain why education has not experienced rapid productivity

gains via technology adoption to date. First, the supply of high-quality technologies might be

limited in comparison to other sectors, due to low investment in research. R&D accounts for a

tiny share of total expenditures in K-12 education, around 0.2%, or 1/50 the rate of the most

innovative industries (See Figure 1). This low level of investment is even more striking when

one considers that total K-12 spending is approximately $600 billion a year, which is similar to

expenditures in R&D intensive industries such as pharmaceuticals (Chatterji and Jones 2012).

Further, given that improving education is typically considered an important national priority,

alongside goals such as enhancing public health, increasing national security, and discovering

more sustainable sources of energy, it is conspicuous that the U.S. invests so little in education

R&D in comparison to these other areas.

         What can explain this low level of R&D? The private value from commercializing

innovations for use in K-12 schools could be low. However, at first glance, this explanation

seems at odds with the facts. The market for education technology hardware and software in the

United States is actually quite large. Prior work by Chatterji and Jones (2012) argues that it is the

market structure, as opposed to the size, of the sector that makes it difficult for innovative

entrants to thrive, stunting the development of new technologies, a proposition discussed further

below.

         Another, not mutually exclusive, possibility for the lack of IT-related productivity gains

in American schools is that these organizations face endemic management challenges that hinder

the adoption of promising technologies that could increase student achievement. Under this
logic, productivity-enhancing technology is available, but organizations are not adopting it,

whether from fears over substitution of labor for capital or disrupting existing curriculum. If this

explanation were a key factor, we would expect to observe different management practices and

technology-adoption rates across various kinds of schools, for example, between private and

public schools, which differ in terms of flexibility and incentives. We review some indirect

evidence on this point below, though it does not appear private schools are clearly more effective

in their use of technological tools in comparison to public schools on average.

Understanding Technology Adoption in Schools

       To develop a deeper understanding of what makes education technology distinct and to

resolve the puzzles posed above, we can leverage prior work in economics on technology

adoption by firms. For both firms and schools, a classic information problem arises when

deciding whether to adopt a new technology. Many new technologies have difficulty in

demonstrating efficacy, particularly across heterogeneous customers, whether those customers

are different kinds of firms or different kinds of schools. Without institutions to facilitate

transparency about the efficacy of particular technologies, organizations that could benefit from

a new technology still might not adopt it.

       In other key respects, the technology-adoption decision for a school district is markedly

different from that of a private sector firm. For example, how a typical public school would

necessarily capture the gains from adopting a technological tool that improved student outcomes

is not clear. Whereas firms can use new technologies to lower costs or improve product features,

for example, public schools do not seek profits and do not generally compete for students in the

same way firms compete for customers. Thus, the incentives to adopt technology from a pure

return-on-investment perspective are attenuated.
         Another key challenge is related to the market structure of K-12 education.

Approximately 100,000 public schools and over 30,000 private schools are in the United States,2

and they are characterized by diverse preferences. The majority of decisions pertaining to

schools are made at the local level and, with the exception of efforts such as the Common Core

Standards, curricular choices can vary widely across the country. The result is, despite 100,000

potential customers, demand for education technologies is not sufficiently aggregated.3

Designing technological tools in the absence of aggregated demand is challenging. For an

innovator comparing the expected value (V) from successfully commercializing an innovation

with the cost (C) of developing and selling it, this lack of aggregated demand implies the costs,

due to implied customization for each idiosyncratic customer, are much higher than when

customers are more homogenous. As C rises, assuming no increase in V, the incentives to

develop innovation are weakened, limiting the number of high-quality products available.

         Another important feature of this setting, as discussed in Chatterji and Jones (2012), is

that the instructional content market in education is dominated by three large textbook makers.

Perhaps surprisingly, 70% of pre-K-12 instructional content today is still printed material.4 These

textbook companies leverage their large marketing and sales efforts to sell complementary

education technology, in many cases tied to their textbooks. This market structure, coupled with

the lack of institutions to independently assess efficacy, depress the expected value (V) for an

innovator with a new technology. If the technology cannot be demonstrated to be effective, who

will adopt it? And even if a handful of schools adopt the tool, how would the innovator scale

these efforts to capture a larger part of the market? These uncertainties are one reason rates of

R&D spending and venture capital investment in education technology products might be

comparatively low relative to the total size of the addressable market. As shown in Figure 2,

investment is K-12 education-technology ventures was $741 million in 2015 compared to nearly

$60 billion across all industries in the same year.5

         The discussion above suggests the market structure in education and the complex process

by which schools adopt and implement new technological tools can explain why this sector has

not experienced dramatic productivity gains from IT. These themes will frame the next section

of the paper, where I review specific studies of how innovation affects student performance and

other related outcomes.

The Impact of Technology on Student Performance

         Federal policymakers have long emphasized the importance of providing computers and

internet access in the classroom. For 15-year-olds in the United States today, the ratio between

computers and students is almost one to one (Bulman and Fairlie 2016). The E-rate program,

launched in 1998 and budgeted at $3.9 billion in 2015,6 provides schools and libraries with

discounted internet access (Goolsbee and Guryan 2006). In part due to this program, nearly every

classroom in the United States has internet access (Fairlie et al. 2010), and 88% of school

districts have high-speed broadband as of 2016, defined as 100 kbps per student.7

        The market for education technology in the United States is estimated to be

approximately $8 billion a year.89 A proliferation of technology has emerged in American

schools in recent years, with schools spending significant sums on hardware such as tablets and

laptops, interactive “smart boards,” teacher training, and digital curriculum.10 Significant sums

have also been spent on enterprise-software-style solutions designed for managing student

information and a large “after-school” market for mobile education applications. For one data

point that reinforces the scale of this market, consider that Apple’s App Store currently has

170,000 different education applications.11

        Proponents of greater use of technology in the classroom generally posit the following

mechanisms by which student performance can be increased via the introduction of technology.

First, as Barrow et al. (2009) articulate, technology might improve student performance by

facilitating more hours of high-quality individualized instruction time. The authors discuss how

access to computers and appropriate software can facilitate “personalized learning” whereby the

education content is provided at a level appropriate for the student and consistent with the

student’s preferred mode of instruction. According to this logic, personalization could

theoretically increase outcomes for high-performing and low-performing students. An ancillary,

but possibly important, benefit is that using technology in the classroom could also allow

teachers to spend more time with each student, because a proportion of students could be

occupied at any one time with computer-aided instruction. This scenario poses technology as a

substitute for teachers, as opposed to a complement, a possibility that is discussed further below.

       Aside from personalized instruction, digitized content that can be viewed across different

hardware devices can broaden access to education, for example, by providing advanced

placement courses to a geographically isolated school that does not have the appropriate staff or

facilities. Via this channel, greater access through digitization of content could raise student

achievement. Moreover, the user interface provided by digital tools might simply enhance

learning, or the mere presence of new technology in the classroom might increase student

motivation and engagement.

       However, despite the ubiquity of technology in the classroom and various proposed

mechanisms of action, rigorous evaluations of the impact of technology on student performance

are rare and the results are mixed (Bulman and Fairlie 2016). Goolsbee and Guryan (2006) find

that while E-Rate increased investments in education technology between 1996-2000 in

California public schools, it produced no statistical impact on student performance. This finding

is consistent with other studies from the United States and around the world, which find little or

no impact of technology on student outcomes (e.g., Angrist and Lavy 2002; Rouse and Krueger

2004). However, other studies have found some positive impact of technology on student

performance (Ragosta 1982; Banerjee et al. 2007; Machin et al. 2007; Barrow, Markman and

Rouse 2009; Cheung and Slavin 2013; Muralidharan et al. 2016). As discussed in Barrow et al.

(2009), these benefits must be weighed against the costs of program adoption and ongoing

implementation.

       Researchers have offered several explanations for this apparent disconnect between the

promise of technology and mixed empirical results. One rationale, supported by qualitative
assessments, is that fidelity of implementation is the key barrier. Although technology is present

in the classroom, teachers and students might not use it (e.g., Cuban et al. 2001) or use it in

suboptimal ways (Wenglinsky 1998). For example, some recent high-profile technology

interventions, such as a $1 billion tablet initiative in the Los Angeles Unified School District,

have been roundly criticized by journalists and education policy experts due to implementation

challenges. In the case of L.A. Unified, serious technical issues prevented a large percentage of

students from accessing the required curriculum.12 Such examples are consistent with the idea

that several important complements must be in place to leverage technological tools effectively,

most notably high-quality instructors and the appropriate curriculum.

        Note that if teachers and technological tools are complements instead of substitutes, the

implications for productivity from a given intervention might be quite different. For example, to

fully realize the benefits of a given technological tool that complements teachers, a school

district might need to finance more training for its teachers or even hire additional staff, leading

to increased costs, all else being equal. Contrast this scenario with one in which teachers and

technology, say, tablets loaded with self-guided content, are viewed as substitutes. In this

instance, substituting technology for labor might directly reduce costs.

        Another explanation for the mixed results of technology interventions could be that some

technological tools are conducive to learning, but we do not know which ones. So the

technologies that are most widely used are not those that are actually most beneficial for

students. Currently, most education technologies do not undergo any kind of systematic and

rigorous evaluation, which obscures efficacy and likely decreases incentives to innovate in the

first place (Chatterji and Jones 2012). Without evidence of what works, schools adopt

technological tools based on relationships with existing companies, and the sales cycles are long

and complex, dampening incentives for new entrants, as discussed above. As one illustration of

this phenomenon, the famous venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz reportedly refuses to

invest in any education-technology company for which a school or district is intended to be the

primary customer.13

        Chatterji and Jones (2012, 2016) argue that low-cost and rapid evaluation methods could

increase entry into the education-technology sector, spur broader adoption of the most

appropriate technologies, and possibly raise student outcomes. One way to think about

transparent and rapid evaluation is in the context of the innovator’s decision discussed earlier. If

a new technology could be quickly evaluated and compared with existing products, such a

process would enhance the expected value, V, to prospective innovators. Moreover, it might also

reduce the costs, C, of marketing and selling the product to a diverse set of customers, because

these buyers could presumably review the publicly available evaluation results directly. One

further possibility is that existing demand aggregators, such as the League of Innovative

Schools,14 might have preferences for adopting evidenced-based products. The increase in V and

decline in C would increase the incentives for innovation and make venture investments in

education-technology companies more attractive, spurring future innovation and

entrepreneurship. For a longer discussion on this point, see Chatterji and Jones (2012).

        The lack of consistent benefits from technology adoption in schools might have other

explanations. For example, technology could be distracting students to a greater extent than it

contributes to learning, which would be consistent not only with the empirical results from the

academic literature, but also with numerous anecdotes from school administrators.15 In addition,

technologies could be having a positive effect, but not on the skills that can be tested using

traditional methods. For example, technology adoption by schools might result in a higher level

of technological fluency (e.g., greater comfort with various kinds of hardware and software) that

might benefit students later in life, even if it does not directly affect test scores.

        Another intriguing possibility is that specific kinds of education technology perform far

better than others. In one of the most recent studies on this topic, Muralidharan, Singh and

Ganimian (2016) find positive and economically large results for their computer-aided learning

intervention in India, prompting them to categorize the literature in this domain as follows:

Those interventions that have focused on supplying hardware alone have generally not been

effective. Software programs that allow students to proceed through grade-appropriate material

at their own speed produce small positive effects. The largest effects, present in their study and

Banerjee (2007), emerge from software interventions that tailor the content to the student’s

ability, consistent with the personalized learning approach referred to above.

        This suggestive pattern of results across studies highlights an important gap in the

economics literature: economists have done little work to understand how students learn and how

variations in these styles may affect human-capital acquisition. Although a large literature in

education and psychology has explored how students learn, this work has not been connected in

a meaningful way to economics.

accessed February 27, 2017)
       Education technology that is deemed to be “personalized” to the student can have several

different varieties. First, a personalized software application to teach a particular skill could

simply facilitate a different pace of instruction depending on the student. Some students could

move faster and others could move more slowly, which may provide some advantages over

traditional instruction, where adjusting the speed of delivery to each individual student would

have practical limitations. Second, as discussed in Muralidharan et al. (2016), a software

application could provide personalized content that adapts depending on the student’s previous

answers, providing the most appropriate level of instruction and focusing on key areas of

weakness in a particular domain.

       A third approach to personalization is software that is customized to each student’s

“learning style,” defined by Pashler et al. (2008) as “the view that different people learn

information in different ways.” Pashler and co-authors argue that although learning style is a

popular concept in educational psychology and the media, little evidence to date shows they

actually exist. The authors argue that to demonstrate that individuals have different learning

styles, not simply expressed preferences, a researcher would have to randomly assign different

styles of instruction to different kinds of students and demonstrate that “correct” matches

between students and styles actually leads to better performance. More research is required to

document the existence and importance of learning styles and to explore the role specific

education-technology tools could play in matching students to the most appropriate content.

       In terms of identifying promising technologies, some recent efforts have been made to

spur increased research and development in the education-technology space. In 2010, the

President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) proposed the creation of

the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Education (ARPA-Ed), modeled after the DARPA
program to create technology platforms and digital curriculum, spurring innovation in the

education sector (Lander and Gates 2010). A key challenge for these efforts is not simply the

evaluations themselves but also the method by which the results are disseminated. Although

many kinds of hardware and content have diffused widely in schools, ranging from Khan

Academy to smartboards, no system is currently in place to incentivize the adoption of education

technology that has been demonstrated to be effective. To address these concerns, Chatterji and

Jones (2012, 2016) propose a platform to rapidly evaluate digital learning activities in the

classroom using randomized controlled trials. Their platform, EDUSTAR, has evaluated 77

digital learning activities to date.

Organizational Innovations in K-12 Education

        Recent work in economics and other fields emphasizes another important consideration

for evaluating the promise of innovation in schools: how organizations are managed. Scholars

who study private sector organizations have documented that the benefits of technology adoption

depend heavily on the attributes of the organization. For example, Bloom et al. (2012) argue that

recent U.S. productivity gains relative to Europe were driven by better “people management”

practices among American firms in industries that intensively use IT, such as retail. Because

significant variation exists across schools in terms of governance, human resource practices, size,

strategy, and culture, existing management practices or organizational structures could be

hindering the adoption of technology.

        Bloom et al. (2015) find the management of U.S. schools compares favorably to the

management of schools in other nations, which is correlated with higher student outcomes.

Further, charter schools have higher management scores than traditional public and private

schools. This result is consistent with Angrist et al. (2013) and Dobbie and Fryer (2013) who
both find a positive relationship between specific management practices and school performance

measures. Relatedly, a recent field experiment by Fryer (2017) finds evidence for a causal effect

of management training for principals on student achievement in Houston public schools.

       Future research could further investigate the relationship between management practices

at schools and the adoption and efficacy of new technologies. The findings could shed new light

on how best to leverage new education technology to aid student learning. Moreover, the rise of

new organizational models in education presents opportunities for research. Although a large

amount of research has focused on charter schools (see Chabrier et al. (2016) for a recent

summary) and school voucher programs (e.g., Ladd 2002), far less research has investigated

other kinds of schools with novel organizational structures and practices, such as STEM-focused

schools and virtual schools (see Woodworth et al. (2015) for an exception).

K-12 Education and an Innovative Workforce

       Next, I turn to the second major stream of work in this domain, which explores the

relationship between K-12 education and the creation of an innovative workforce. Economists

have argued U.S. productivity growth depends in large part on the knowledge-intensive sectors

of the economy, which will increasingly require skilled workers to invent and use new

technologies along with developing business models to commercialize them. This demand for

skilled workers has been increasing in the 21st century, as firms shift from investing in

production activities reliant on tangible capital to non-production activities more reliant on

intangible capital. This change will require workers who have higher levels of skills in

innovation, management, and marketing (Hulten and Ramey 2015). Many political and business

leaders argue that the U.S. economy lacks the requisite number of skilled workers to capitalize

on these trends (e.g., Augustine et al. 2010). Figure 3 illustrates that the United States lags China
and India in the number of STEM graduates per year, though many observers have pointed out

that quality-based measures may be more informative indicators.

       In response to these challenges, an emerging academic literature has focused on the

allocation of talent in the U.S. economy and its implications for innovation. Much of this

literature has focused at least in part on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics

(STEM) subjects, which are thought to be particularly important inputs to innovation (Augustine

et al. 2010). At the university level, some work has found an association between STEM degrees

and the propensity to become an inventor (Aghion et al. 2015; Bianchi and Giorcelli 2017).

Recent performance data suggest American secondary students are lagging behind peer nations

in math and science achievement (Lander and Gates 2010; Hulten and Ramey 2015), a concern

not only for innovation per se but perhaps also for these students’ long-term employment

outcomes (see Figure 4).

       Although specific policies to support STEM education in the United States can be traced

back to at least the 1958 National Defense Education Act, which was designed to reform the

science curriculum in response to Soviet scientific achievements (Goodman 2017), only recently

has a more targeted strategy emerged. In 2010, the PCAST recommended the creation of a

STEM Master Teacher Corps that could provide increased salary and compensation to STEM

teachers and increase the number of STEM-focused schools to 1,000 by 2020. The PCAST also

called for the National Science Foundation and the Department of Education to develop a

partnership and better coordinate the numerous disparate programs promoting STEM across the

federal government (Lander and Gates 2010).

Fostering interest in STEM fields
       Despite significant interest in expanding STEM education, very few rigorous evaluations

of the impact of these programs exist to date. Some evidence suggests particular interventions

can increase student interest in STEM fields. Hulleman and Harackiewicz (2009) employ a

semester-long randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 262 high school science students and find

that asking students to write monthly about the relevance of the course material to their own lives

(compared to a control condition where the students summarize what they learn) increases

student interest in science and their inclination to take science courses in the future.

       Understanding how exposure to the media, mentors, and labor market signals influences

students’ selection into STEM fields of study and careers has also been a focus of research.

Some scholars have explored how the “STEM pipeline” can break down, leading to students

expressing interest in STEM early in their academic career but eventually pursuing other fields

of study (e.g., Bettinger 2010). Shu (2016) examines a related conjecture that higher

compensation in the financial services industry has lured away “the best and brightest” of U.S.

college graduates from science- and engineering-based jobs. Using a sample of MIT graduates,

the author does not find that lucrative opportunities in finance are drawing away talented would-

be scientists and engineers. Shu concludes that finance and STEM jobs have different

requirements and different kinds of preferred candidates and that below-average students are the

ones who respond to shocks to finance salaries. Although this study uses post-secondary

education as an empirical context, the perception of job opportunities might influence

investments in STEM education in secondary schools as well.

The impact of STEM on earnings

       Next, some evidence is emerging on the extent to which STEM education affects

earnings and the generation of new inventions later in life. Goodman (2017) finds evidence that
an exogenous increase in math coursework during high school increased African-American

student earnings by 3%-4%. This study is especially notable because most of the prior literature

in the economics of education focuses on the amount of time in school, as opposed to the

subjects over which that time is allocated. This point implicates a key concern in most studies

aiming to establish a connection between STEM courses and long-term outcomes. High-ability

students may select into STEM courses, confounding the relationship between these courses and

outcomes such as earnings, innovation, or entrepreneurship. The most useful studies will be

those that, like Goodman (2017), leverage exogenous variation in the amount of or quality of

STEM coursework and measure long-term outcomes of students against a reasonable comparison

group.

         The basic logic behind increasing the absolute number of students studying STEM is that

if more individuals acquire these skills, they will have better job prospects and drive economic

growth via the increased introduction of new innovations. A recent paper by Bianchi (2016),

however, identifies potentially important indirect effects at the university level that are important

to consider. He studies the impact of a change in Italian law that allowed a large number of

students to study STEM subjects in Italian universities for the first time during the 1960s. These

new students came from technical high schools, which generally offered a narrower and more

applied menu of coursework than academic-track high schools. Academic-track high school

students were always able to choose STEM majors in universities and the reform did not

constrain this flexibility.

         He finds the introduction of these new students reduces academic performance of the

incumbent academic track students, likely because of constraints on resources that increased

faculty-to-student ratios and greater diversity in preparation across students. Further, Bianchi
finds some high-potential students may have been induced to select non-STEM majors after the

law was enacted. Finally, he finds some evidence that the law might have negatively affected

lifetime earnings for STEM graduates overall. These results suggest policymakers considering

expansions in STEM education opportunities should consider the possible direct and indirect

impacts of such policies, what economists typically refer to as general equilibrium effects. These

effects include not just the impact of a given policy on the absolute number of students who

study STEM and their labor market outcomes, but also how these changes influence the

economic returns to studying STEM (and other fields) for all students.

The link between STEM education and innovation

       A new line of work also explores the link between STEM education and innovative

activity later in life. Toivanen and Väänänen (2016) find that policy changes in Finland that led

to greater opportunities to earn an engineering degree are related to the likelihood of patenting.

Bianchi and Giorcelli (2017) investigate the relationship between STEM education and

innovation, using the same 1960s-era reform in Italian universities discussed above. The authors

find that, since the law was enacted, high-achieving students (based on high school grades) are

actually less likely to generate new inventions. However, students with lower high school

achievement are more likely to generate new inventions, compared to similar students who

matriculated before the law.

       Interestingly, the decrease in invention among high-achieving students was not

necessarily from the highest potential prospective inventors. Using data on Italian inventors who

patent in the United States (a proxy for quality), the authors conclude the decline in patenting

among individuals who were high-achieving students was likely concentrated among those who

would not have produced the very best inventions. The authors note the different occupational
choices made by students after the change in law might explain these effects. This result

indicates broad expansions of STEM education may not only influence the number of inventions

produced, but also “who” produces them, by changing the composition of would-be inventors.

       Another recent effort has taken a different approach to yield novel insights about the

connection between STEM education and innovative activity later in the life. Bell et al. (2016)

link federal tax returns and the U.S. patent data to investigate the link between human capital and

innovation. They find that children of low-income parents (who are more likely to be in low-

performing schools and have lower test scores) are far less likely to be inventors later in life, and

differences that emerge in the early years of schooling can explain this disparity. The authors

also find that children who grow up in a region where innovation in a specific technology class is

prevalent are more likely to invent in that technology class as adults. This result suggests

exposure to specific kinds of innovation in the early years might be important in determining

how young people select their eventual fields of study and shape their decisions to become

inventors. This logic could inform the design of many sorts of programs, for example, mentoring

initiatives for low-income children.

       The authors conclude that, particularly as it relates to math education, reducing the

relationship between parental income and achievement could contribute significantly to

innovative output in terms of patents by unlocking the potential of more individuals to develop

inventions. Card and Giuliano (2014) provide related evidence that the strategic use of gifted and

talented programs could be one mechanism to achieve this objective. Their study of gifted and

talented initiatives suggests including disadvantaged students in these programs who do not meet

the IQ cutoffs, but have scored well on state exams, may increase subsequent math and science

performance for these students.
Skills beyond STEM and their role in innovation

       Note that not all scholars take for granted that America’s relative standing on STEM

education indicators, such as math and science test scores, is a valuable signal of our nation’s

future innovative and entrepreneurial capability. For example, Bhide (2008) argues the large

domestic market in the United States and the willingness of American consumers to experiment

with new products is a central driver of innovation. Similarly, it is not clear the technical skills

adequately measure the capacity for innovative entrepreneurship. Baumol (2005) observes that

many successful entrepreneurs do not appear to have advanced technical training, and only a

small fraction have created breakthrough innovations on their own. Interestingly, Baumol notes a

possible tension between the kind of foundational technical skills that underlie incremental

innovation and the sort of novel and creative approaches required to develop radical innovations.

He posits that America’s lead in many innovation indicators is not due to the sheer number of

technically trained citizens (an area where we lag behind some peer nations) but is due in part to

the flexibility of our education system and its attitude toward creativity.

       Relatedly, Levine and Rubinstein (2016) find that individuals who start incorporated

businesses in the United States are more educated and score higher on exams, but also engage in

more illicit activities, such as drug use, than their peers. These results are consistent with the idea

that creative and less structured tasks such as innovation and entrepreneurship may favor

individuals who deviate from accepted norms. One implication of this study is that increasing

STEM education at the expense of developing other skills could have an unintended impact on

outcomes such as innovation and entrepreneurship.

       Aside from math and science, other kinds of skills, including non-cognitive skills

(Heckman 2006), could also be important in developing an innovative workforce. Cook et al.
(2014) find large effects on math scores from an intervention in Chicago schools whereby they

provided both academic and non-academic remediation for students who were at risk of dropping

out of school. The academic component consisted of a daily, one-hour math tutoring session with

two students per instructor. The non-academic component was cognitive behavioral therapy to

improve problem-solving, impulse control, and decision-making, delivered through 27 one-hour

weekly sessions. The authors find that participation in this program raised math test scores by the

equivalent of 15 percentile points within the distribution of national scores, and increased

graduation rates by an estimated 14 percentage points.

       Other, seemingly disparate, research in innovation and education suggest teaching “soft

skills” such as social skills and teamwork in K-12 could play a role in increasing innovation and

entrepreneurship. For example, consider Jones (2009), who documents the increase in teamwork

in U.S. innovative activity and finds that inventor team size increased by 35% from 1975 to

1999. More recently, Deming (2015) finds that between 1980 and 2012, jobs with high social

skill requirements increased by 10 percentage points as a share of the U.S. job market. If the

results of these studies are considered in tandem, they imply that teamwork, which necessarily

involves social skills to knit together larger groups of individuals, is crucial for developing new

innovations. Although individuals can learn teamwork in different settings, including at home,

through military service, and in employment, K-12 education could offer a particularly

advantageous setting to develop these skills provided that we can develop evidence-based

practices.

       Interestingly, despite the significant attention from policymakers on STEM skills and, to

a lesser extent, non-cognitive skills, to my knowledge, little empirical work has documented the

mechanisms by which increasing the skill level of a population can enhance the quality and
quantity of innovation. Although more educated populations might produce more innovations, a

relatively small share of citizens are directly involved in innovation in advanced economies.

Whether raising the math and science skills of the average American student would have a

significant impact on this metric is unclear, based on the current literature. Nor do we have any

experimental evidence that I am aware of that specific retraining programs lead to increases in

the quality and quantity of innovation. These topics appear ripe for future research.

Conclusion: An Emerging Innovation Agenda for Education?
       Despite a large amount of attention from policymakers and the media about the potential

for technological innovation to yield dramatic improvements in our K-12 education system, we

have yet to see significant gains in outcomes or reductions in cost. Relatedly, although it is

intuitive to believe that a skilled workforce, particularly in STEM subjects, will create more

innovations, scant direct evidence for this conjecture exists. These gaps present a tremendous

opportunity for new research to generate actionable policy insights.

       Two broad themes emerge from this paper. First, prior work has argued that more

rigorous and rapid evaluations of educational hardware and software can spur wider adoption of

productivity-enhancing technological tools in the classroom (Chatterji and Jones 2012). The

proposed mechanism of action is that institutions that allow demonstration of “what works” will

both provide stronger incentives to would-be innovators and facilitate broader scaling of useful

technologies, particularly where demand is already aggregated. The emerging literature on this

topic suggests the kind of technology being tested is a first-order concern (Muralidharan, Singh

and Ganimian 2016). Some initial evidence suggests “personalized” learning software is

particularly promising in terms of raising student outcomes. But to properly deploy these tools,

we first require a deeper understanding of how students learn. Moreover, an interesting
complementary path will be to explore how organizational and pedagogical innovations facilitate

student learning. Finally, other kinds of outcomes, such as engagement and general technological

fluency, should be assessed in conjunction with traditional student performance measures.

       These open questions underscore the noticeably low levels of research and development

in education. In comparison to other national priorities, we have yet to define a coherent R&D

agenda nor have comparable resources been devoted to it. This marked disparity indicates that a

promising agenda would entail understanding why private and public organizations have not

invested large sums in education R&D to date, identifying levers that might be used to encourage

increased investment and articulating a set of research questions that should be prioritized.

       For example, it would important to consider whether new investments in education R&D

should be managed from the U.S. Department of Education, other research agencies like the

National Science Foundation, or a new entity entirely. Separately it would be interesting to

document what types of research private sector firms and school districts are already conducting

to better understand the prospective direction of innovation. Finally, developing the specific

research questions to be answered would ideally be done by an interdisciplinary set of scholars

and practitioners, given that research on education spans several academic disciplines and

contexts.

       The second key theme of this paper is to highlight the need for new research that links

educational interventions to longer-term outcomes, such as patenting and starting firms. The

insights we do have in this domain (e.g., Bell et al. (2016) are often dependent on access to

sensitive government databases. To establish reliable evidence on how K-12 education is

connected to an innovative and entrepreneurial workforce, we will need more research utilizing

these kinds of data and the creation of new datasets.
        The workforce of tomorrow is in school today. Understanding how the hardware and

content we provide them shapes their acquisition of knowledge and long-term outcomes is a

first-order economic policy issue. A tremendous untapped opportunity at the intersection of

innovation and education has the potential to broaden access, increase quality, and lower costs.

One promising path forward could be sustained research collaborations between government,

business, academia, and K-12 schools to generate rigorous evidence on these important

questions.
