         AN ANALYSIS OF THE EARNINGS OF CANADIAN IMMIGRANTS


                              ABSTRACT


       This paper reports estimates of simple wage equations fit
 to cross-sectional and pseudo-longitudinal data for Canadian
 immigrants in the 1971 and 1981 Canadian censuses.   The
 estimates are used to assess (1) the usefulness of cross-
 sectional analyses for measuring the pace of immigrant earnings
 growth, (2) the labor market implications of admissions
 policies that place different weights on the work skills
 possessed by prospective entrants, and (3) the relative impact
 of selective outmigration and job-matching on the shape of
 immigrant earnings distributions as duration of stay increases.

       The estimates provide evidence of a small to moderate
 assimilation effect that suggests that immigrants make up for
 relatively low entry wages, although the wage catch-up is not
 complete until 13 to 22 years after entry into Canada.   These
 results are revealed clearly in both the pseudo-longitudinal
 and the cross-sectional analyses. The estimates also provide
 evidence that the unobserved quality of immigrants' labor
 market skills declined following changes in Canada's
 immigration policies in 1974 that led to a sharp increase in
 the proportion of immigrants admitted on the basis of family
 ties.   Finally, since there is no evidence that the variance of
 immigrant earnings increases with their duration of stay in
 Canada, and since there are no differential immigrant-native
 changes in higher-order moments of the earnings distribution as
 duration of stay increases, the results are inconclusive with
 respect to the importance of selective outmigration and job
 matching in the evolution of immigrant earnings distributions
 over time.

     The purpose of this paper is to analyze immigrant labor market progress

in Canada - - a country that has screened most of its immigrants on the basis

of their expected "ability to assimilate" as a matter of official policy.

In particular, we compare earnings profiles for Canadian immigrants and

natives and seek to determine whether immigrant earnings profiles reflect

any "vintage effects" associated with year of immigration.

     Over the past 10 years, a number of studies of immigrant earnings have

focused on these same issues using data for U.S.    immigrants.   Among the best

known is that by Chiswick (1978) which fits a standard wage equation to

cross-sectional data on immigrants and natives in the 1970 Public Use Sample

of the U.S. Census.    Chiswick's results support the conclusion that, when

they first enter the labor market, immigrants earn approximately 25 percent

less than natives with comparable years of schooling and experience, marital

status, etc.    However, Chiswick also finds that immigrants have steeper

experience-earnings profiles than "comparable" natives, with immigrant

earnings overtaking native earnings within roughly 13 years of their entry

into the U.S.    A number of other studies have fit the same basic model to

similar data and have reached roughly identical conclusions (see, for

example, Carliner, 1980; Long, 1980; and Borjas, 1982).

     The set of findings based on Chiswick's approach to measuring imniigrant

assimilation has been challenged by Borjas (1985) who argues that the

steepness of immigrant earnings profiles is inflated by cross-cohort

declines in immigrant quality.     Evidence supporting this argument is

provided by using pooled data from the 1970 and 1980 U.S. Population

Censuses to measure earnings growth in the intercensal period for individual

entry cohorts of immigrants.     Based on this analysis, Borjas concludes that
"cross-section studies of inunigrant earnings provide useless and misleading

insights into the process of immigrant assimilation into the labor market"

(p. 485).

     Borjas' conclusion is deserving of further examination.     A prj&ri

theoretical reasoning is perhaps more consistent with Chiswick's empirical

conclusions than they are with those of Borjas.     Low entry wages for

immigrants can plausibly be explained as a loss of (origin) country-specific

human capital; rapid earnings growth can be viewed as reflecting positive

self-selection into immigration (i.e. ,   immigrants are above-average in terms

of their aggressiveness, ambitiousness, willingness-to-work hard, etc.).        In

contrast, sizable cross-cohort declines in immigrant quality are somewhat

harder to accept given that it is not overall quality that is hypothesized

to have declined, but rather that component of overall quality that is

unmeasured (i.e., the part of immigrant quality that is not measured by or

correlated with variables such as schooling, experience, marital status,

country of origin, etc.).     Borjas' results, as he recognizes, may also be

reflective of differential patterns of underenumeration in the successive

censuses, or non-random intercensal mortality and outinigration.    Indeed,

outmigration, death, or undercounting of immigrants who are relatively

unsuccessful in the labor market are all alternatives to declining immigrant

quality as an explanation of Chiswick's cross-sectional results.

     We will also use the example of Canada as an opportunity to gain some

insight into the importance of intercensal exiting from an immigrant

population.     Although there is little information on either the covariates

of immigrant mortality or on differential census undercounting of

immigrants, there are several established lines of inquiry on the subject of

outmigration.     According to a group of imperfect information models,

outmigration is an event that was unplanned ex ante and that occurs


                                   2
primarily among migrants whose labor market expectations are not satisfied

(see Yezer and Thurston, 1976; Allen, 1919; flejer and Goldberg, 1980; and

Lam, 1986).   These models suggest, at the margin, that outmigrants will tend

to be selected from the lower end of the earnings distribution.    On the

other hand, intertemporal substitution models tend to view outmigration as a

planned event among individuals who make short-term moves in order to take

maximal advantage of temporarily favorable earnings opportunities (Stark and

Bloom, 1986; Fox, 1987).    These models suggest that outmigration will be

most prevalent among individuals who are relatively active and successful in

the labor market.    Although the results are far from definitive, empirical

research by Jasso and Rosenzweig (1987, 1989) and by Lam (1987) tends to

support this view insofar as outmigration of U.S. and Canadian immigrants is

reported to be most prevalent among those who are relatively successful.

     Although they are extremely different in spirit, both the imperfect

information and the intertemporal substitution models of outmigration share

an important empirical implication, namely, that the variance of residuals

in a migrant earnings equation will decline with duration of stay (i.e.,

under the imperfect information models exit occurs at the lower end of the

distribution while under the intertemporal substitution models exit occurs

at the upper end).    In contrast, job matching or asymmetric information

models imply that the residual variance in a wage equation will increase

with duration of stay as employers are increasingly able to observe the true

productivity of migrants (see Harris and Holmstrom, 1982; Katz and Stark,

1984).   We attempt to infer which set of forces tends to be stronger by

examining patterns in the variance and kurtosis of immigrant earnings by

duration of stay.    For example, we will interpret an increase (decrease) in

the variance of earnings with duration of stay as evidence favoring the



                                  3
relative importance of the job matching modela (imperfect information

models).

     Thus, we have four main goals in this paper.     First, by fitting the

models proposed by both Chiswick and Borjas to data for Canada, we hope to

assess the extent to which it is generally true that cross-sectional studies

of immigrant earnings are "useless and misleading."      Second, we hope that

estimates of these alternative models will lead to clear substantive

conclusions regarding the shape of immigrant earnings profiles and the

importance of entry-cohort effects on earnings.     Third,   by comparing

corresponding results under different Canadian immigration policies, we hope

to shed some light on the significance of a nation's institutions in

determining the economic benefits of immigration.     Finally, by analyzing the

variance of immigrant earnings by duration of stay in Canada, we hope to

assess the relative importance of selective intercensal exiting and job-

matching/asymmetric information in models of the labor market progress of

immigrants.




I.   Immigration Policy and Immigrants in Canada

      In an effort to enrich our interpretation of statistics related to the

labor market experience of Canadian immigrants, this section will present a

brief review of the history of Canadian immigration policy and of

immigration to Canada.


A.   Brief History of Canadian Immigration Policy

      From the 19th to the 20th century, international migration to developed

countries has been determined less and less by events and decisions of

individuals in countries of origin and more and more by regulations

established in countries of destination.   In this regard, Canada is no



                                 4
exception.     Until 1869, Canada's immigration policy was simply one of free

entry.   But beginning that year, a series of legislative enactments

established specific principles of selection and associated regulatory

apparatuses.    Prohibitions were established on the landing of "criminals and

other vicious classes" in 1872, paupers and destitute immigrants in 1879,

and diseased persons in 1902.     In 1904 an exorbitant head tax of $50

(Canadian) was established for Chinese immigrants.     During this period of

years, the central government also set up quarantine stations, specified

legal responsibilities for companies involved in transporting immigrants,

and began to require those companies to make deposits into a fund whose

purpose was to cover the expenses of indigent immigrants before they were

able to secure employment.

     The basic structure of Canadian immigration policy during much of the

first half of the 20th century was set forth in the Immigration Act of 1910.

This Act firmly established the principle of selective immiaration by

creating a proscribed class of immigrants:     those "deemed undesirable

because of climatic, industrial, social, educational, labour, or other

conditions or requirements of Canada, or deemed undesirable because of their

customs, habits, modes of life and methods of holding property and their

probable ability to become readily assimilated."     In practical terms, this

Act led to a distinction between countries in the extent to which they were

considered to be "preferred" or "non-preferred."     The two most preferred

countries were the United Kingdom and the United States (and France as of

1947); they were followed by several other countries in northern and western

Europe that were "not too different [from Canada] in language and mode of

life;" countries in central and eastern Europe were considered to be non-

preferred, with the most non-preferred countries being Greece, Italy, Syria,

and Turkey.     Immigrants from Asian countries were considered so undesirable


                                   5
that their admission was strictly regulated under separate Acts.

     Subject to time-varying restrictions on total immigrant volume,

applicants from the most preferred countries were admitted on almost a

laissez-faire basis while the admission of immigrants from other preferred

countries depended to varying degrees on whether they possessed training and

skills for which there was a need in Canada.     Only immigrants in a

relatively narrow range of occupations (e.g. ,   agriculture)   were admissible

from non-preferred countries, and the range of relatives they could bring

with them was quite limited.

     One of the chief characteristics of twentieth century immigration

policy in Canada is its strong labor market orientation.        In a broad

statement outlining the principles that have guided Canadian immigration

policy throughout the post-World War II era, Prime Minister MacKenzie King

declared in 1947 that Canada would encourage immigration to meet its need

for population.   He said further that Canada would accept as many immigrants

"as could be advantageously absorbed into the national economy,' with the

admissibility of potential immigrants to Canada depending upon, among other

factors, labor conditions and requirements in Canada and each applicant's

'ability to assimilate."   King also affirmed the discriminatory features of

Canada's immigration policy, stating that "the people of Canada do not wish,

as a result of mass immigration, to make a fundamental alteration in the

character of our population.'   "Canada is perfectly within her rights in

selecting the persons whom we regard as desirable future citizens.           It is

not a 'fundamental human right' of ay alien to enter Canada.         It is a

privilege.   It is a matter of domestic policy...."

     Because control over the volume of immigrants to Canada and over their

national and occupational composition resided in the hands of the Cabinet,



                                  6
immigration policy in Canada has been remarkably responsive to a variety of

social, economic, and political situations throughout most of this century.

For example, immigration was tightly restricted during the high unemployment

years of the 1930's, immigrants were not accepted from Japan, Germany, or

Italy during World War II although many displaced Europeans were admitted

from other countries, and Canada actively assisted and accepted many

immigrants from Hungary during 1957.

     Canadian immigration policy has often been referred to as a "tap-on,

tap-off policy" because of its flexibility jn    j,fl   responsiveness Q

contemporary       market concerns.    For example, the admission of

immigrants was increased sharply as a response to labor shortages in the

1950's, but was curtailed during the years 1958-1962 due to high rates of

unemployment.   Beginning in the 1950's, immigration officials treated

professionals and entrepreneurs with capital quite favorably because of

their potential to generate employment opportunities in Canada.      Indeed,

Canada abandoned its policy of national discrimination in the 1960's partly

because it became increasingly clear that Canada would not be able to

satisfy its need for skilled manpower via immigration from its list of

preferred countries.

     In 1967, Canada substantially altered the mechanisms by which it

administered its immigration policies.    First, it eliminated all

discrimination on the basis of race or nationality.      Second, it defined four

classes of immigrant applications:     (1) sponsored relatives (i.e., dependent

relatives); (2) nominated relatives; (3) independent applications; and (4)

refugees: Sponsored relatives would be admissible merely if they could

demonstrate that they were in good health and of good character.       Refugees,

a status defined by the United Nations, would be accorded preferential

treatment in admission.   Finally, nominated relatives and independent


                                 7
applications would be judged on the basis of a point system.

     The two key features of the point system are that it removed a good

deal of subjective authority from the hands of immigration officers and it

assigned considerable weight in admissions decisions to labor-market related

factors.    In order to be admitted under the point system, an immigrant

needed to receive at least 50 points out of a maximum of 100.      Points were

awarded according to the following 9 criteria, with some minor differences

in the evaluation of independent applications and applications from

nominated relatives:

     (1)    Education and training:  1 point for each year of successful
            formal education or occupational training, up to a maximum of 20;

     (2)    Personal characteristics: Up to 15 points awarded at the
            discretion of immigration officers on the basis of their
            perception of the applicant's adaptability, resourcefulness,
            initiative, and motivation;

     (3)    Occupational demand:   up to 15 points, both for skilled and
            unskilled workers;

     (4)    Occupational skill:  ranging from 1 point for unskilled workers
            up to 10 points for professionals;

     (5)    Age:  10 points for applicants below the age of 35, with 1
            point less for each year above age 35 (with a minimum of 0
            points);

      (6)   Arranged employment:   10 points for applicants with a definite
            job in Canada;

      (7)   Knowledge of French and English: Up to 10 points depending on
            an applicant's fluency in French and English;

      (8)   Relatives:  up to S points for applicants with relatives in
            Canada that could help them to get established;

      (9)   Employment opportunities: up to 5 points for applicants moving
            to areas of strong labor demand.

     The point system was amended in 1974, as a response to both the large

number of immigrants admitted to Canada in 1972 and 1973 and to increases in

the unemployment rate in Canada.       A priority system was established for



                                   8
processing immigrant applications that gave preferential treatment to

applicants with close relatives in Canada, applicants with prearranged

employment in high-demand occupations     and to entrepreneurs and refugees.     A

"Canadians-first" policy was also established under which applicants would

receive no credit for prearranged employment unless they could show that no

equally-qualified Canadian citizen or landed immigrant was available to fill

the position.   In addition, an applicant would lose 10 points if there was

no evidence of pre-arranged employment or bona fide demand for their labor.

The figures in Table 1 indicate that a sharp increase occurred in the

proportion of Canadian immigrants admitted on the basis of family ties

following the 1974 policy changes.


B.   Trends j4 Patterns in Immigration      Canada

     The foreign-born have constituted a sizable fraction of the Canadian

population throughout the twentieth century.     In 1901, 13.3 percent of the

Canadian population was foreign-born.     This fraction increased sharply

during the first decade of the century and hovered around 22 percent into

the 1930's, when difficult economic circumstances led to restrictive

immigration policies that caused it to decline.      Nonetheless, the foreign-

born fraction of the Canadian population had not fallen below 15 percent

through the early 1980's (see Table 2).

      In order to maintain such a high fraction of foreign-born among the

Canadian population, immigration flows into Canada have been quite

substantial.    For example, there were 4.4 million immigrants to Canada from

1951 to 1981, a period during which the population of Canada increased from

14 to 24 million.    Although the ratio of new immigrants to the overall

increase in the size of Canada's population has been above 15 percent during

every year in the post-World War II era, there has been a great deal of



                                  9
year-to-year variation in the number of immigrants.    Especially large

numbers of immigrants arrived in Canada in 1951 (194,391), 1957 (282,164),

1967 (222,876) and 1974 (218,465); in contrast, relatively few immigrants

arrived in 1946-47 (roughly 68,000 immigrants per year), 1961-62 (roughly

73,000 immigrants per year), 1978 (86,300), and 1983 (88,800).

     From the mid-1950's to the mid-1970's, the percent of Canadian

immigrants intending to enter the labor force was just above 50 percent.

That figure dropped to 44 percent starting in the mid-1970s, as the number

of admissions from independent applications dropped from nearly 110,000 in

1974 to under 21,000 in 1984.   Even more dramatic has been the shift in the

distribution of occupations among immigrants expecting to enter the labor

force.   This shift has been notably in the direction of increased skill and

training.   Among immigrants entering Canada during 1954-58, only 12 percent

listed their intended occupations as managers or professionals.     In

contrast, 37 percent listed agricultural worker, laborer, or service worker

as their intended occupation.   During the years 1979-83, the percent of

managers and professionals increased to 28 percent while only 14 percent of

immigrants reported that they intended to work as agricultural workers,

laborers, or service workers.   While some portion of these changes

undoubtedly reflect sectoral shift in the Canadian economy, the bulk of the

changes are reflective of the increased emphasis on skill and training in

Canada's immigration policy (see Table 3).

     Table 4 presents a crosstabulation of the foreign-born population of

Canada by their country of origin and their year of immigration.      The data

are taken from the 1981 Canadian Census.     The figures clearly show that

British and American immigrants dominated the immigration flow to Canada

before 1946 (i.e., in 1981, 61 percent of all pre-1946 immigrants in Canada

were from the U.K. or the U.S.).    That dominance ended immediately following


                                   10
World War II as immigration from Europe (excluding the U.K.) expanded

sharply.   From 1946 to 1955, 68 percent of all immigrants to Canada were

from Europe (excluding the U.K.), up from just 37 percent prior to 1946.

Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands alone supplied an especially large

proportion of immigrants in the ten years following the war (36 percent).

Even in absolute terms, no European country increased the number of

immigrants it supplied to Canada during the post-War period, whereas the

number of immigrants from most European countries actually declined (i.e.,

based on numbers of immigrants actually in Canada in 1981).

     Table 4 also shows that the pattern of immigration to Canada changed

rather dramatically when Canada stopped discriminating among immigrants on

the basis of their countries of origin.     For example, between the first and

second half of the 1960's, immigration to Canada from Asia and Latin America

increased nearly four-fold.   Although these regions of the world supplied

only 2 percent of Canada's immigrants prior to 1946, they supplied 46

percent from 1971 to 1975 and 55 percent from 1976 to 1981.


C.   Immigrants iii the Canadian Jk Market

     We next present a brief descriptive analysis of the employment,

unemployment, and earnings experience of male immigrants represented in the

1971 and 1981 Canadian population censuses.

     Table S reports selected labor market characteristics of immigrants and

natives based on data contained in the 1981 Canadian Census of Population.

Judging merely, on the basis of labor market activity measures, it would not

be unreasonable to conclude that Canadian immigrants are well assimilated in

the labor market.   The labor force participation rate of male immigrants

(aged 1S and over) was 72.4 percent in 1981, just slightly below the rate of

73.6 percent for native Canadians.      The closeness of native and immigrant


                                  1].
labor supply extends beyond labor force participation rates to hours and

weeks worked as well.   Ninety-three percent of immigrant males worked 35 or

more hours during the 1981 Census reference week, compared to 92 percent of

native males.   Similarly, 70.6 percent of the male immigrants reported

having worked 49 to 52 weeks in 1980, just .2 percentage points higher than

the figure for native males.   Despite the closeness in these measures of

immigrant and native labor supply, unemployment rates for immigrants were

notably lower than for natives in 1981 (i.e. , among males, the unemployment

rates were 8.5 percent for natives and 5.3 percent for immigrants).     These

differentials could reflect a variety of factors including differences in

reservation wages, human capital, and demographic composition (see Fox, 1987

for an analysis of immigrant labor supply and unemployment in Canada).

Presumably, such factors also underlie the explanation of the difference in

average income between male immigrants and natives (i.e. ,   the immigrants had

a 7.4 percent advantage).    It is also worth noting that rates of self-

employment are slightly higher among immigrants than among natives, with 15

percent of immigrant males reporting that they were self-employed in 1981

(compared to 13 percent for native males).

     Table 6 compares labor force participation rates, unemployment rates,

and levels of average income among different entry cohorts of Canadian

immigrants --   using data from both the 1971 and 1981 Canadian censuses.   The

statistics show that the more recent immigrants have relatively low labor

force participation rates, relatively low average income, and relatively

high unemployment rates.    Labor force participation rates are also

relatively low in both censuses for pre-1946 immigrants, presumably because

many immigrants in that cohort had reached retirement age by 1971 and 1981.

Although labor force participation rates are quite flat across the cohorts



                                  12
of immigrants that entered Canada between 1946 and 1975, it does appear that

unemployment rates are higher for the more recent cohorts.   Average

immigrant earnings also tend to be lower for immigrants in the more recent

entry cohorts.

      Thus, while there do not seem to be major differences in the employment

and earnings experiences of immigrants and natives in Canada, there are

notable differences between immigrants in different entry cohorts.      Whether

these differences represent genuine vintage effects or simply reflect the

influence of immigrant labor market characteristics or other variables

cannot be determined from these tables.   Making such a determination

requires that we control for a variety of variables in a multivariate

manner, which we turn to in the following section.



II.   Emir1ca1 Analysis     Immigrant Earninas Profiles

      In this section, we will analyze earnings patterns among Canadian

immigrants using data contained in the 1971 and 1981 Canadian censuses.      Our

goal is to answer the following three questions;

      (1) On average, do employed immigrants receive higher wages than

employed natives who are comparable in terms of observed productivity-

related characteristics?

      (2) On average, do employed immigrants who have been in Canada for a

total of X years receive higher or lower wages than employed immigrants who

have been in Canada for flY years but who are otherwise comparable in terms

of observed characteristics? and

      (3) Does the dispersion of immigrant earnings tend to vary with

duration of stay?




                                   13
A.   Empirical Models and Data Issues

       The standard model used to compare earnings profiles for immigrants and

natives was proposed by Chiswick (1978).                 The basic regression model, which

is fit to cross-sectional data for a pooled sample of both immigrants and

natives, is a simple extension of the standard human capital earnings

function:


     log Y    a0 ÷ a1(SCH) ÷ a2(EXP) ÷ a3(EXPSQ) + a4(IMMIG) ÷ a5(YSM)


where Y is earnings, SCH is years of schooling, EXP is years of labor market

experience, EXPSQ is years of labor market experience squared, INMIG is an

indicator variable for immigrants, and YSM is years since migration

interacted with the immigrant dummy variable.                  The estimate of a4 measures

the average percent difference betweeen the earnings of natives and newly

arrived, but otherwise comparable, immigrants.                   The estimate of a5 measures

the average percent increase in immigrant earnings with each year they spend

in their new home country, beyond the increase in earnings associated with

the fact that their human capital stock may have changed during that year

(e.g., EXP may have increased).              Thus, a positive estimate of a5 has been

taken to indicate that the average experience-earnings profile of immigrants

is steeper than that of natives, which is suggestive of labor market

progress and assimilation.

       Borjas (1985) has recently pointed out that interpreting the

coefficients in equation (1) in this manner requires one to assume that

there are no omitted variables that are correlated with YSM.                   This

assumption may be difficult to defend because YSM also measures tidate of

entry into the new country't in a cross-sectional regression.                  If unmeasured

factors relevant to labor market success vary systematically across entry

cohorts of immigrants, the coefficient a5 will measure both immigrant labor


                                            14
market progress and the effect of the average difference in unmeasured

factors across successive entry cohorts (i.e.      it may be a biased measure of

the labor market progress experienced by different entry cohorts over time).

     The most straightforward way to overcome the fact that YSM is a linear

combination of a vector of year-of-immigration dummy variables in cross-

sectional data is to make use of longitudinal data.      Since longitudinal data

provide observations on each entry cohort at two or more points in time, it

is possible to estimate the effect of time spent in the new country on

earnings without the potentially confounding influence of entry cohort

effects (i.e., a regression model can be specified with year-of-immigration

dummy variables and YSM on the right-hand side because the same individual

in a particular entry cohort, with an immutable "year of entry," will have

different values of YSM when he is observed at different points in time).

     To our knowledge there are no sets of longitudinal data for Canada that

are suitable for conducting such an analysis.      Thus, following Borjas, we

will construct a pseudo-longitudinal dataset for different entry cohorts of

immigrants using data contained in the 1971 and 1981 Canadian Population

Censuses.   We will fit the following regression model to pooled data from

these two censuses:


   log Y — b0 + b1(SCH) + b2(EXP) + b3(EXPSQ) + b4(IMMIG) + b5(YSM)

               + c1(C0111) +   ... + ck(COHk)                                   (2)



where COH1 through CORk are indicator variables reflecting immigrant

membership in different entry cohorts.      In principle, fitting this

regression provides estimates of cohort-specific effects on earnings as well

as an estimate of the average rate of earnings growth that is free of entry-

cohort bias (i.e. ,   an estimate of earnthzs growth within --           across   -




                                    15
- jy    cohorts).

     Several features of this econometric approach should be kept in mind.

First, it cannot be used to estimate individual-specific effects on earnings

because there is no information to link the same individuals in the

different cross-sections.   Second, a particular entry cohort sample observed

in 1971 is not necessarily representative of the same population as the

corresponding sample that is observed in 1981.    As noted earlier, non-random

patterns of outmigration, mortality, and differential undercounting      -   -   of
which we find some evidence in our data as well as in Lam (1987)    --   will
tend to undermine the comparability of the samples.     Changing patterns of

employment and self-employment pose similar problems insofar as our

regressions are fit to samples of working individuals who earned their

income primarily from wages and salaries.     Third, because only two cross-

sections are available for the present analysis, we will not be able to

control for period effects that may affect the earnings of different cohorts

differently (e.g., the business cycle).

     Also deserving of mention are two issues tasted by the pooling of data

from two cross-sectional samples.     First, in order to meaningfully compare

earnings in the 1971 and 1981 censuses, it is necessary to make an

adjustment for inflation.   We do this by using the Canadian Consumer Price

Index to transform earnings in the 1971 census (that refer to the year 1970)

into 1980 inflation-adjusted dollars (the multiplication factor is 2.17).

Second, intercensal changes in the real earnings of immigrants may be partly

due to changing capital-to-labor ratios, technological change, or business

cycle fluctuations.   Since real wage growth due to these factors is not

reflective of labor market progress that is immigrant-specific,- we make an

adjustment to the real earnings of immigrants in the 1971 census that

transforms those data into "productivity-constant" terms.     These adjustments


                                 16
highlight our central interest in this section:         measuring the component of

intercensal earnings growth for different entry cohorts of immigrants that

is independent of human capital accumulation, overall economic growth,

business cycle effects, inflation, etc.

     In order to explore the robustness of our results, we make two

distinctly different types of productivity adjustments.         First, we simply

multiply inunigrant earnings reported in the 1971 census by the ratio of real

earnings received by native Canadians in the 1981 and 1971 censuses (the

multiplication factor is 1.20).     This simple adjustment assumes that

immigrants would have experienced the same real wage growth as natives in

the absence of any assimilation effects.        At a somewhat deeper level, it

assumes that average levels of human capital did not change among natives

relative to inunigrants and that the structure of returns to different types

of human capital also did not change between censuses.        To avoid these

assumptions, we also employ a slightly more complex productivity adjustment

that takes account of changes in the human capital profile of the inunigrant

and native labor forces and of changes in the returns to different types of

human capital.   We do this by (a) estimating real wage equations for natives

in 1971 and 1981 and (b) using the difference in the estimated coefficients

to adjust immigrants' 1971 wages for intercensal changes in the returns to

different types of human capital.        We report results based on both sets of

adjustments below.


B.   Emuirical Results g                    Earninr.s

     The immigrants we analyze represent l-in-l00 samples of individuals

born outside of Canada while- the natives represent l-in-600 samples of

individuals reporting Canada as their place of birth.        Both the immigrant

and native samples are restricted to individuals aged 20-64 who are not


                                    17
predominantly self-employed and who worked at some point during the year

prior to the census for a wage in excess of 50 cents per hour in the 1971

census and one dollar per hour in the 1981 census.    The variables 114144650

through 1MM7680 refer to immigrant entry cohorts (e.g., year of entry from

1946 to 1950, etc.).

     Table 8 presents ordinary-least-squares estimates of wage equations

using cross-sectional data from 1971 and 1981 separately.     The dependent

variable in all equations is the natural logarithm of an individual's wage

and salary earnings in inflation-adjusted (1980) dollars during the year

preceding the census (i.e., 1970 and 1980).    These equations were specified

with schooling (SCH), experience (EXP and EXPSQ)     marital status (MST), and

vectors of categorical variables (not reported in the table) measuring hours

worked per week and weeks worked per year as right-hand-side variables.

Depending on the specification, the wage equations may also include an

indicator variable for immigrants (114141G) and a variable measuring the

number of years an immigrant has been in Canada (YSM).     Although not

reported in these tables, we also estimated models with additional right-

hand-side variables reflecting an individual's religion and language ability

and the square of YSM.   Since these latter variables had little explanatory

power either individually or jointly, these specifications are not reported

here in the interest of parsimony.

     The first two columns of Table 8 report wage equation estimates for the

samples of male immigrants in 1971 and 1981.    The estimated equations have

the basic structure one might expect:   a 4 to 5 percent rate of return to

schooling, an earnings-experience profile that increases at a decreasing

rate, and a 15 to 25 percent positive wage differential for married men.        In

addition, the "years since migration" coefficients are positive and



                                 18
significantly different from zero, although the coefficients are rather

small in magnitude (i.e., about .5 percent per year).

    The third and fourth columns of Table 8 report estimates of similar

equations for native Canadians.    The pattern of results corresponds quite

closely to those for the immigrants, although the rate of return to

schooling is slightly higher for natives than for immigrants, probably

indicating that schooling has an important country-specific component.      Even

the residual variances for the immigrant and native wage equations are quite

close in magnitude (e.g. ,   .20 for the imnhigr4nts and .21 for the natives in

the 1971 census data).

     Given the closeness of the estimated wage equations for the immigrants

and the natives, a simple way to compare the wage profiles    is to follow the

work of Chiswick (1978) by pooling the data for the two groups and fitting a

wage equation that includes a dummy variable for immigrants, both by itself

and interacted with the "years since migration" variable.     The results of

this exercise are presented in the last two coLumns of Table 8.      Based on

the 1971 data, the estimate of the immigrant coefficient indicates that

immigrants earn roughly 7 percent less than comparable natives when they

first arrive in Canada; the estimate of the coefficient on YSM indicates

that immigrants' wages increase an average of .54 percent per year spent in

Canada, beyond the increase associated with the acquisition of experience.

These estimates imply that the earnings profiles of comparable immigrants

and natives cross at roughly 12.8 years.     In contrast, the 1981 data

indicate that entering immigrants earn 16.6 percent less than otherwise

comparable natives, although their wages increase at the rate of .77 percent

per year spent in Canada suggesting that the immigrant and native earnings

profiles do not cross until the immigrants have been in Canada for 21.6

years.


                                    19
     In order to investigate whether the various cross-sectional estimates

of immigrant labor market progress are biased by entry-cohort effects on

wages, we now estimate alternative models from pooled 1971 and 1981 data on

immigrants.   The first column of results in Table 9 reports estimates of the

simple wage equation fit to the pooled data.   As one would expect, these

estimates are quite similar to the estimates computed for the separate

years' samples (i.e., they are simply a matrix-weighted average of the

results in columns 1 and 2 of Table 8).   In the second column, we include a

vector of dummy variables that reflect an immigrant's entry cohort.        The

coefficient of YSM in this equation therefore represents a weighted average

of within-cohort real earnings growth between 1971 and 1981 for the

different entry cohorts, other things equal.   The estimate of this

coefficient is quite substantial in magnitude (2.02 percent) and is quite

well-determined (i.e., the standard error is   .08 percent).   Thus, the

within-cohort growth rate of real earnings is three to five times larger

than the cross-cohort growth rate of real earnings.    In addition, estimates

of the cohort fixed effects suggest that the average unmeasured quality of

immigrants increased across all entry cohorts until the cohort that entered

from 1976 to 1980.

     As noted earlier, the coefficient on YSM captures both the true

"assimilation effect" in which we are interested, as well any wage growth

associated with changes taking place in the economy over time (e.g.

increasing capital-to-labor ratios).   In order to isolate the assimilation

effect, we adjust the 1971 earnings data for changes in labor productivity

that occurred among native Canadians from 1971 to 1981.    Estimates of the

wage equation fit to these productivity-adjusted data are reported in the

third and fourth columns of Table 9.   The third column applies the simple



                                 20
adjustment described above based on the ratio of real wages received by

native Canadians in 1971 and 1981; the fourth column applies the more

complex regression-based adjustment that accounts br human    capital   changes

among the immigrant and native labor forces as well as changes in the

returns to different types of human capital.

     The coefficient of YSM reported in column 3 is .24 (with a standard

error of .08).   Although it is statistically significant, this estimate is

substantially smaller than the estimate of 2.02 computed using non-

productivity-adjusted data.     Thus, it appears that the effect of

assimilation on the earnings of pseudo-cohorts of immigrants is quite small,

indeed, almost negligible.    Put another way, within-cohort growth in

immigrant earnings is primarily due to economic forces that affect both

immigrants and natives.   Further confirmation of this result is provided in

the fourth column of Table 9.     Although the estimated coefficient of YSM is

somewhat larger when we apply the more elaborate productivity adjustment,

the assimilation effect of .42 percent per year is still substantively

small.   Moreover, it is sufficiently close in magnitude to the estimates

computed from the individual cross-sections to justify taking issue with

Sorjas' assertion that estimates of the latter type are "misleading and

useless."

     It is also worth examining the estimates of the cohort fixed effects in

columns 3 and 4 in Table 9.     There are no statistically significant cohort

effects among any of the five pre-1971 entry cohorts of immigrants.

However, the estimates do suggest that average unobserved quality among

immigrants arriving from 1976 to 1980 (and perhaps also among the 1971 to

1975 arrivals) was significaxitly lower than for previous cohorts, the same

conclusion suggested by a comparison of the cross-sectional coefficient

estimates of IMMIG in Table 8.     This result is not especially surprising


                                    21
given the relatively high fraction of immigrants admitted into Canada as

relatives of Canadian citizens and landed immigrants in the late 1970's (see

Table 1).   Under the immigration policy in effect in Canada in the 1970's,

applications from relatives did not receive the same degree of labor market

screening as independent applications.


C.       Dispersion g. Iminizrant Earnings

     In this subsection we present and review statistics on the dispersion

of income among immigrants.   In particular, we are interested in determining

whether immigrant incomes tend to become more or less disperse as the

duration of their stay in Canada increases.   A tendency for dispersion to

decline with duration of stay is consistent with the hypothesis that

intercensal outmigrants tend to be selected from the tails of the

distribution (i.e., immigrants whose earnings expectations were not met

selected out of the lower tail while migrants who planned temporary stays to

take advantage of favorable earnings opportunities selected out of the upper

tail).   In contrast, a tendency for dispersion to increase with duration of

stay would be consistent with the view that the labor market has more

information about the true productivity of immigrants the longer they have

stayed in the country.

     The third and fourth columns of Table 10 report the raw standard

deviations of immigrant incomes by the duration of their stay in Canada as

of both 1971 and 1981.   Although the standard deviation of income is highest

for the oldest entry cohort of immigrants, there is little evidence of a

pattern across the more recent entry cohorts in either census year.     There

is some tendency for income dispersion to decrease for individual entry

cohorts from 1971 to 1981, but this may not be due to increased duration of

stay since income dispersion among native Canadians also decreased between


                                  22
1971 and 1981.     In addition, it is worth noting that the standard deviation

of immigrant incomes is remarkably close to the standard deviation of native

incomes in both census years.      Table 10 also reports the standard deviation

of the estimated residuals for different entry cohorts of immigrants in the

1971 and 1981 censuses.     These statistics are more appropriate measures of

dispersion than the raw standard deviations because they do not reflect the

influence of variations in observable factors that are associated with

earnings.     Nonetheless, they tell basically the identical story to that told

by the unconditional measures of dispersion:       there is no substantial

evidence of a difference between natives and immigrants, or among immigrants

with different durations of stay in Canada, in the dispersion of income.

Thus, the statistics in Table 10 are equally supportive of two conclusions:

first, that selective outmigration and job matching are both empirically

unimportant influences on immigrant earnings, and second, that they are

important influences whose effects tend to cancel out.

     In an attempt to distinguish between these alternative views, we

examine higher-order moments in the distribution of residuals from the

earnings equation.     If the tails of the distribution are thinning as a

result of outmigration j4     if   the variance of earnings is increasing among

Canadian immigrants who stay in Canada, we would expect increased kurtosis

in the distribution of residuals for particular entry cohorts, i.e., the

distributions should "thicken" from one census to the next.       This pattern of

results is clearly revealed in the last two columns of Table 10.       However,

because kurtosis also increases among native Canadians, a finding we had no

reason to expect, we are reluctant to view our results for the immigrants as

conclusive.     It would thus appear that a fuller understanding of the

dynamics of immigrants' labor market outcomes and their outmigration



                                     23
decisions awaits the advent of true, large-scale, longitudinal surveys of

inunigrants.




III.    Conclusion

       This paper has reported estimates of simple wage equations fit to

cross-sectional and pseudo-longitudinal data for Canadian immigrants in the

1971 and 1981 Canadian censuses.    The estimates are used to assess (1) the

usefulness of cross-sectional analyses for measuring the pace of immigrant

earnings growth, (2) the labor market implications of admissions policies

that place different weights on the work skills possessed by prospective

entrants, and (3) the relative impact of selective outmigration and job-

matching on the shape of immigrant earnings distributions as duration of

stay increases.

       The estimates provide evidence of a small to moderate assimilation

effect that suggests that immigrants make up for relatively low entry wages,

although the wage catch-up is not complete until 13 to 22 years after entry

into Canada.    These results are revealed clearly in both the pseudo-

longitudinal and the cross-sectional analyses.    The estimates also provide

evidence that the unobserved quality of immigrants' labor market skills

declined following changes in Canada's immigration policies in 1974 that led

to a sharp increase in the proportion of immigrants admitted on the basis of

family ties.    Finally, since there is no evidence that the variance of

immigrant earnings increases with their duration of stay in Canada, and

since there are no differential immigrant-native changes in higher-order

moments of the earnings distribution as duration of stay increases, the

results are inconclusive with respect to the importance of selective

outmigration and job matching in the evolution of immigrant earnings

distributions over time.

Notes for Tables 7-9

     The immigrant samples represent l-in-lO0 samples of all immigrants in
each Canadian census aged 20-64 who report working positive weeks and hours,
who earned more than 50 cents per hour in the 1971 Census (one dollar per
hour in the 1981 Census), and who are not primarily self-employed. Inmates,
members of the armed forces, and immigrants arriving during the year in
which the census was taken are excluded from the sample.

     The native samples represent l-in-600 samples of all natives in each
Canadian census. The samples were constructed using the same criteria as
those used to construct the immigrant sample, of those criteria that are
relevant.

     The regressions include vectors of categorical variables with
information on hours worked per week and weeks worked per year.
