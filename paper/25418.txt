Learning from Coworkers

JEL No. E24,J31,O33

                                         ABSTRACT

We investigate learning at the workplace. To do so, we use German administrative data that
contain information on the entire workforce of a sample of establishments. We document that
having more highly paid coworkers is strongly associated with future wage growth, particularly if
those workers earn more. Motivated by this fact, we propose a dynamic theory of a competitive
labor market where firms produce using teams of heterogeneous workers that learn from each
other. We develop a methodology to structurally estimate knowledge flows using the full-richness
of the German employer-employee matched data. The methodology builds on the observation that
a competitive labor market prices coworker learning. Our quantitative approach imposes minimal
restrictions on firms' production functions, can be implemented on a very short panel, and allows
for potentially rich and flexible coworker learning functions. In line with our reduced form
results, learning from coworkers is significant, particularly from more knowledgeable coworkers.
We show that between 4 and 9% of total worker compensation is in the form of learning and that
inequality in total compensation is significantly lower than inequality in wages.

1     Introduction
Social interactions are an essential part of an individual’s life. These interactions are po-
tentially an important source of learning. Furthermore, since working adults spend a large
fraction of their time working, it is natural that most of this learning is the result of in-
teractions with coworkers. It is plausible that this form of learning constitutes the largest
and most important knowledge acquisition mechanism in society. One that transmits and
diffuses the practical knowledge that individuals use every day in their productive endeavors.
Little is known about this type of knowledge transfer in the workplace. Who learns from
whom? How much? What is the labor market value of this learning? How does this learning
change as we change the organization of production in the economy? We aim to provide
answers to some of these questions.
    We are interested in understanding how individuals learn from coworkers with different
levels of knowledge and the implications of this form of learning for individual and aggregate
outcomes. To do so, we first develop a benchmark model of idea flows in a competitive labor
market. Workers produce in teams and, while doing so, learn from each other. The model
has the key feature that a worker’s pay reflects both her knowledge and a compensating
differential for the opportunity to learn from her coworkers. In contrast, the labor market
compensates those who provide their coworkers with learning opportunities.
    Our goal is to take advantage of the structure of the model, together with detailed micro
data on individual wages in production teams, to study learning on the job. However,
before structurally connecting the model with the data, we start by analyzing the reduced-
form empirical relationship between the wage growth of an individual and the wages of her
coworkers. To measure the key features of this relationship we use German administrative
data that contain the employment biographies of the entire workforce of the establishments
in the sample. We use a variety of empirical specifications that allow us to understand which
features of the distribution of wages are related to an individual’s wage growth.
    Our findings indicate that more highly paid coworkers substantially increase future wage
growth. Furthermore, the transmission depends on particular features of the wage distri-
bution. The data suggest small effects from less-well-paid workers and large, and roughly


                                              1
symmetric, positive learning from those higher up in the wage distribution. We also show
that the effects we find are present across the wage distribution.
   Although suggestive of significant learning from coworkers, these findings could in prin-
ciple also be consistent with other features of wage setting mechanisms in the labor market.
To address these possibilities we offer a battery of checks which suggest that these findings do
not purely reflect mean reversion, back-loading, or other firm-specific factors by separately
analyzing switchers and stayers, mass layoffs at the plant level, using information about
worker tenure, and studying the nonlinearities in the empirical relationship between wage
growth and the distribution of coworkers.
   We then revisit our model which yields a mapping between the matched employer-
employee data and the underlying knowledge and learning of individuals. We structurally
estimate a variety of parametric versions of the learning function, motivated by the most
important reduced form patterns we document. We develop a novel way to estimate the
parameters of this function using micro data for the German labor market. Our methodol-
ogy uses only information on workers wages and the wages of her coworkers. The approach
relies on the basic insight that a competitive and frictionless labor market prices coworker
learning. As a consequence, workers who expect to learn a lot from their coworkers must
pay a compensating differential relative to similarly skilled workers who have little to learn
from their peers.
   A first step in implementing our approach is to choose a cardinality for knowledge. We
show that the expected present value of income is a natural and useful choice for the units
of knowledge. It simplifies the empirical implementation of our approach and allows for a
natural interpretation of the estimated learning functions. We proceed by showing that, given
the learning function, we can invert individual Bellman equations to recover the knowledge
of individuals from the full set of wages of the members of each production team in a
single cross section. Doing this for several years yields a panel of individuals’ knowledge.
Our identification of the learning function comes from the restriction that the evolution of
individual knowledge must be consistent with the learning function we had imposed. We
find the fixed point of this GMM procedure using an iterative algorithm, resulting in a
structurally estimated ‘learning function’ that maps an agent’s learning to the knowledge


                                               2
distribution of her coworkers.
   Our model and estimation strategy rely on some strong but standard assumptions like
complete financial markets (or linear utility), perfect labor market competition, and sta-
tionarity. However, since the estimation strategy relies solely on the individual Bellman
equations together with observed wages and team composition, it imposes minimal restric-
tions on the set of firm technologies and complementarities across workers. In fact, our
methodology proves that these characteristics of the production function are not needed to
estimate learning functions. Furthermore, it can be implemented on very short panels re-
quiring only two observations per worker. As such, we view the structure we impose, and
the empirical results we obtain with it, as a natural benchmark.
   Using this benchmark model we find that agents learn little from less knowledgeable
workers and they learn significantly from those with more knowledge, particularly from the
most knowledgeable members of their teams. On average, between 4 and 9% of the total com-
pensation of workers comes in the form of learning from coworkers in the same team (either
same establishment or same establishment and occupation). We also show that inequality
in wages is between one third and one fifth larger than inequality in compensation because
workers with different levels of knowledge differ in how their compensation is divided between
wages and learning. We further document an apparent tension between firms’ production
requirements—which are reflected in the equilibrium composition of teams—and coworker
learning: Coworker knowledge flows would almost double if workers were to be grouped
in teams randomly. The finding suggests the presence of knowledge complementarities in
production.
   Our estimated model can be used to study a variety of phenomena that might affect team
composition and therefore individual learning. For example, one can study how changes in
the organization of work brought about by technological change affect earnings inequality,
life cycle wage profiles, and the aggregate rate of growth. However, doing so would require
specifying and estimating a production function, which the rest of our analysis does not
require. We therefore leave these exercises for future research.
   There is a large literature in macroeconomics that has used learning from others as the
key mechanism to generate aggregate growth. Lucas (2009) proposes a theory of growth


                                              3
based on random meetings between agents in the entire population. Lucas and Moll (2014)
and Perla and Tonetti (2014) extend these models to add a time allocation choice, while
Jovanovic and Rob (1989), Jovanovic and MacDonald (1994), and König et al. (2016) focus
on the innovation/imitation margin. Other models like Sampson (2015), Perla et al. (2015),
and Luttmer et al. (2014) also generate growth through adoption of ideas from others. As
Alvarez et al. (2013) and Buera and Oberfield (2016) show, the selection of what particular
ideas an individual or firm confronts, as determined for example by trade flows, is essential to
shape the growth properties of these models. This literature considers random learning from
the population, or a selected group of the population, but it has not incorporated learning
from coworkers. The importance of studying this form of selection in learning is evident,
but challenging. For starters, it requires modeling explicitly teams of coworkers that are
heterogeneous across firms. Caicedo et al. (2016) introduce learning in an economy where
production is organized in heterogeneous production hierarchies as in Garicano and Rossi-
Hansberg (2006), but learning interactions do not happen exclusively within the organization.
Jovanovic (2014) studies learning in teams of two, while Burstein and Monge-Naranjo (2009)
study an environment in which a manager hires identical workers and imparts knowledge to
those workers.1 We go further than these papers in that we model learning within teams and
provide direct evidence of its importance, its characteristics, as well as providing a structural
estimation of the key parameters of the model.
      While much of the empirical literature has focused on contemporaneous peer effects (Mas
and Moretti (2009) and Cornelissen et al. (2017)), empirical studies of learning within teams
is much more limited. Nix (2015) argues that increasing the average education of ones peers
raises one’s earnings in subsequent years. Akcigit et al. (2018) argue that increasing one’s
exposure to star patenters raises the likelihood of patenting and the quality of one’s patents.
      In related and complementary work, Herkenhoff et al. (2018) build on a frictional sorting
setup to investigate learning with production complementarities. Like us, they detect strong
coworker spillovers. The main difference between the papers is that our competitive labor
market model allows us to structurally estimate the model without imposing restrictions on
  1
   Anderson and Smith (2010) study matching with dynamic types which can also be interpreted as a
model of learning in teams of two.

the production functions firms use when selecting teams of workers. Our strategy is thus
well-suited for utilizing the full richness of the matched employer-employee data. Because
our model features teams with arbitrary numbers of heterogeneous workers, our analysis
focuses on the role of the within-team distribution of knowledge for the coworker learning
process.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a general but
simple model of an economy in which agents learn from their coworkers. The theory is useful
in specifying exactly the concept of learning we have in mind and its implications. In Sec-
tion 3 we introduce our German matched employer-employee data and present a number of
reduced-form findings about the relationship between the wage of an individual, the wages
of her coworkers, and an individual’s wage growth. Section 4 contains our main results.
We present and implement an algorithm to structurally estimate the learning function in-
troduced in Section 2, and describe the implications for individual investment in knowledge
and inequality. Section 5 extends the baseline model to study how individual characteristics
affect learning from coworkers. Section 6 concludes.



2     A Benchmark Model
Consider an economy populated by a unit mass of heterogeneous individuals with knowledge
z ∈ Z = [0, z̄]. Individuals have a probability δ of dying each period. Each period a
mass δ of new individuals is born. Newborns start with a level of knowledge z drawn from
a distribution B0 (·). Agents supply labor inelastically, consume, and discount the future
according to a discount factor β. Agents are employed in firms where they obtain a wage
and where they can learn from other coworkers. An agent z, working in a firm that employs
the agent as well as a vector of coworkers z̃ will draw her next period’s knowledge from
a distribution G (z 0 |z, z̃). Financial markets are complete, or utility is linear, so agents
maximize the expected present value of income.
    Since individuals learn from coworkers, the wage they are willing to accept depends on
how much they might learn from coworkers. Thus, the wage schedule, w (z, z̃) , paid to a
worker with knowledge z depends also on the vector of coworkers z̃.


                                              5
      All firms produce the same consumption goods. Potential firms pay a fixed cost c in
goods, after which they draw technology a ∈ A from a distribution A (·). A firm with
technology a produces according to the production function F (z; a), where z is the vector
of workers it hires. Firms take the wage schedule as given. We purposely impose minimal
structure on the production function. In particular, differences across technologies need not
be Hicks-neutral or even factor augmenting; production technologies may also vary in their
complementarities across workers with different levels of knowledge. Hence, different firms,
in general, make different choices of z.


2.1      Firms

Let W (z) be the total wage bill of a firm that hires the vector of workers z. If z = {zi }ni=1 for
some n, then W (z) = ni=1 w (zi , z̃−i ), where z̃−i is the set of i’s coworkers. A firm chooses
                       P

the set of workers to maximize profit


                                  π (a) = max F (z; a) − W (z) .                                   (1)
                                             z



Let z (a) = arg max z F (z; a) − W (z) denote a’s optimal choice.2


2.2      Individuals

Agents decide where to work each period given wages and the learning opportunities across
firms. Let Z̃ denote the set of all possible vectors of coworkers. The expected present value
of earnings for an agent with knowledge z is given simply by
                                                      Z   ∞
                        V (z) = max w (z; z̃) + β             V (z 0 ) dG (z 0 |z, z̃) .           (2)
                                  z̃∈Z̃               0


Namely, each period individuals choose where to work to maximize their wage, plus the
future stream of wages given their learning opportunities in the firm. In general, equilibrium
wages adjust so that workers are indifferent about working in a set of firms. The competitive

    Note that the firm is choosing both the type of workers, zi , and the number of workers n. Together
these choices determine the vector z.

labor market assumption implies that workers with a given z will obtain the same value,
V (z), independent of where they work. Hence, the present value of earnings of a worker
does not depend on her current coworkers. Furthermore, since firms take the wage schedule
as given, it must be the case that if a firm wants to hire a vector of workers (z, z̃) then the
wage schedule must capture what it would cost to hire those workers. The wage schedule
must therefore satisfy
                                                              Z   ∞
                          w (z; z̃) = V (z) − β                       V (z 0 ) dG (z 0 |z, z̃) ,                       (3)

for any z, z̃ chosen in equilibrium. A simple implication is that for any z̃, z̃0

                                           0                                         0


Namely, firms with distinct sets of employees pay different wages to identical individuals
to compensate for differences in their learning. If an individual learns a lot at a firm, the
firm can pay a low wage and still attract the worker. In this sense, wages incorporate
compensating differentials in learning.


2.3    Labor Market Clearing and Free Entry

Let B (z) be the fraction of workers with knowledge no greater than z. For any vector z,
let N (z, z) denote the number of elements of z that are weakly less than z. Labor market
clearing requires that for each z,
                                                    Z
                                B (z) = m                 N (z (a) , z) dA (a) ,                                       (5)
                                                      a


where m denotes the mass of firms in the economy.
   Free entry requires that            Z
                                               [π (a) − c] dA (a) = 0.                                                 (6)

2.4     The Distribution of Knowledge

Given the choices of firms, we can define O (z̃|z) : Z̃×Z → [0, 1] to be the fraction of workers
with knowledge z that, in equilibrium, have a vector of coworker knowledge that is strictly
dominated by the vector z̃. Then the fraction of workers with knowledge no greater than
z next period are those who are born with knowledge weakly less than z, and those whose
interactions with coworkers leaves them with knowledge weakly less than z. Namely,3
                                                   Z Z
                   B (z) = δB0 (z) + (1 − δ)                     G (z|x, z̃) dO (z̃|x) dB (x) .             (7)
                                                    x    z̃∈Z̃



2.5     Equilibrium

A stationary competitive equilibrium consists of a wage schedule w, a value function V , a
mass of firms m, firm choices z (a), a coworker vector set Z̃, and a distribution of worker
knowledge B, such that

   1. V and w satisfy (2) and (3);

   2. z (a) solves (1), namely, maximizes the profit for a firm with technology a taking the
       wage schedule as given;

   3. The labor market clears for each z, so (5) is satisfied;

   4. The free entry condition (6) holds;

   5. The law of motion for B in (7) is satisfied.


2.6     Characterizing Equilibrium

The methodology we use below in Section 4 requires the value function V (z) to be strictly
increasing. Here we provide one set of conditions that are sufficient to give rise to this
property. In particular, we impose some structure on the functions F and G. We state these
   3
    Note that if the solution to the maximization in (2) is unique, then O (z̃|x) would
                                                                                      R be degenerate with
a mass point at z̃ chosen by individual x, z̃ (x), and so the integral in (7) would be x G (z|x, z̃ (x)) dB (x).
Uniqueness of the solution of the maximization in (2) is neither guaranteed nor necessarily a desired property
in our model.


                                                        8
properties in three assumptions. Throughout, when we compare two ordered vectors of the
same length, z1 < z2 means that each element of z2 is weakly greater than the corresponding
element in z1 , and at least one element is strictly greater.

Assumption 1 F (z, a) is strictly increasing in each element of z: z1 < z2 implies F (z1 , a) <
F (z2 , a).

Assumption 2 G is strictly decreasing in z and z̃: z̃1 < z̃2 implies that G (z 0 |z, z̃1 ) >
G (z 0 |z, z̃2 ).

Assumption 3 There is free disposal of knowledge.

     The first assumption implies more knowledgeable individuals always have an absolute
advantage in production. The second assumption is that if two individuals have the same
coworkers, the one with more knowledge this period will have stochastically more knowledge
next period. It also says that if two individuals have the same knowledge, the one with more
knowledgeable coworkers will have stochastically more knowledge next period.
     These assumptions are sufficient to deliver the following results:

Lemma 1 Suppose there is a firm with productivity a such that (z, z̃) = z∗ (a). Then for
each z1 > z2 it must be that w (z1 , z̃) > w (z2 , z̃).

Proof. First, free disposal of knowledge ensures that V is weakly increasing. Second, the
fact that G is decreasing in z implies that w (z, z̃) is weakly decreasing in z̃. Finally, toward
a contradiction, suppose there was a z1 > z2 such that w (z1 , z̃) ≤ w (z2 , z̃). Then the firm
should hire z1 instead of z2 . It would strictly increase output, it could pay that worker a
weakly lower wage, and it could weakly lower the wage of all other workers.

Proposition 1 V (z) is strictly increasing in z.
                                                                            R∞
Proof. For any wage schedule, the operator T V (z) = maxz̃∈Z̃ w (z, z̃)+β    0
                                                                                 V (z 0 ) dG (z 0 |z, z̃)
is a contraction because it satisfies Blackwell’s sufficient conditions. To show that the V is
strictly increasing, it is sufficient to show that if V is weakly increasing, T V is strictly in-
creasing. To see this, consider z1 < z2 . Market clearing ensures that there is a firm that

                                                   9
hires z1 , and let z̃1 be the the coworkers of z1 in at least one such firm. Then this, along
with Lemma 1, implies
                                                       Z   ∞
                    T V (z1 ) = w (z1 , z̃1 ) + β              V (z 0 ) dG (z 0 |z1 , z̃1 )

where the first inequality follows from Lemma 1 and the second inequality from the as-
sumption that G (·|z, z̃) is decreasing in z and the presumption that V is weakly increasing.



Proposition 2 z̃1 < z̃2 implies that w (z, z̃1 ) > w (z, z̃2 ).

Proof. This follows directly from the assumption that G is decreasing in z, Proposition 1,
and (4).

Proposition 3 Within a team, a worker that earns a higher wage has more knowledge.

Proof. Consider two workers in the same team, with respective knowledge z1 > z2 . Let z̃
denote the vector of the rest of their coworkers. Then we have that


                         w (z2 , (z1 , z̃)) < w (z1 , (z1 , z̃)) < w (z1 , (z2 , z̃))


where the first inequality follows from Lemma 1 and the second inequality follows from
Proposition 2.
   Finally, we show how a worker’s wage is related to her marginal product. Firms choose
a vector of workers z to maximize profits. Hence, they solve

                                                               n

                                                                                              ∂w(zi ,z̃−i )
The marginal cost to a firm of having its ith worker have a bit more knowledge is                ∂zi
                                                                                                            .
The marginal benefit equals the sum of its marginal product and the change in wages the
firm must pay its other workers.
    Since (3) must hold for any z̃, we can differentiate with respect to coworker i’s knowledge
to get
                                ∂w (zj , z̃−j )      dE [V (z 0 ) |zj , z̃−j ]
                                                = −β                           .
                                    ∂zi                     dzi
We can thus write the optimal condition for the firm as

                     ∂w (zi , z̃−j )    ∂               X d
                                     =     F (z; a) + β          E [V (z 0 ) |zj , z̃−j ] .
                         ∂zi           ∂zi              j6=i
                                                             dzi


Hence, the marginal value of a worker’s knowledge to the firm reflects both the marginal
product of the knowledge and the marginal increase in coworkers’ learning.



3     Reduced-Form Evidence
We next use German social security data to investigate the relationship between coworker
(relative) wages and individual wage growth. Our goal is to provide empirical discipline on
the learning function G (z 0 |z, z̃).
    To do so, we relate individual wage dynamics to wages in the peer group using various
flexible reduced-form specifications. We are particularly interested in three questions: First,
do future wages rise more steeply if one’s coworkers are more highly paid? Second, if so,
does this relationship depend on which coworkers are more highly paid? That is, is it those
below in the within-team wage distribution or those above that matter? Third, how do these
reduced form patterns change with team size, tenure, age, and the current wage level? We
further offer various robustness checks with the particular focus on ruling out two alternatives
to learning which could be driving our initial findings, namely a back-loaded wage structure
and mean reversion.


                                                      11
      While none of the reduced-form specifications are tightly grounded in our theory, we
nonetheless argue that the resulting picture is useful in guiding the structural approach
that follows. Of course, the lack of an empirical identification strategy implies that these
results cannot be understood as causal and so remain simply a suggestive statement about
equilibrium relationships. In the next section we use the structure of our theory, and the
suggested specification of the learning function, to structurally estimate the model.
      Our structural approach builds on the baseline framework developed in Section 2. In
particular, we specify a flexible but parsimonious parametric form for the learning function
G (z 0 |z, z̃) in light of our reduced form evidence. We then implement a simple routine to
discipline the parameters of G(·) using only panel information on wages and peer groups.


3.1       Summary Statistics

We begin by briefly describing the dataset along key dimensions. The longitudinal version of
the Linked-Employer-Employee-Data of the IAB (LIAB LM 9310) contains information on
the complete workforce of a subset of German establishments. The sample establishments are
the ones selected—at least once—in an annually conducted survey between 2000 and 2008.
The employee part of the dataset then contains the employment biographies from 1993 to
2010 of all individuals which were, for at least one day, employed at one of the sample
establishments between 1999 and 2009.4 The employment biographies come in spell format
and contain information, among other things, on a worker’s establishment, occupation, and
average daily earnings along with a rich set of observables (age, gender, job and employment
tenure, education, location, among others). We organize the resulting dataset as an annual
panel. Specifically, the annual observation recorded (employer, average daily wage, etc.)
for each individual pertains to the spell which overlaps a particular reference date (January
31st).
      To construct a baseline sample, we then proceed as follows. We select panel case es-
tablishments for the year 2000 to 2008, since those are the establishments where we obtain
information on the full workforce. We then include those individuals who were employed at
one of those establishments at the reference date during at least one year between 2000 and
  4
      For more detail, see Klosterhuber et al. (2014).


                                                         12
2008. This leaves us with the employment biographies (between 1993 and 2010) of the full
workforce (at a reference date) of a large number of establishments. The Data Appendix A
provides more detailed information on the construction of the baseline sample.
   Throughout, we work with the following two different ways of defining a peer group:

   • Team Definition 1: All workers in the same establishment.

   • Team Definition 2: All workers in the same establishment and occupation.

   We next document the team size distribution and the wage distribution, both economy-
wide, and within teams. We report all those statistics for the year 2000.


Team Size Distribution Figure 1 plots the unweighted size distribution for both team
definitions for the year 2000. We restrict attention to teams that have size ≥ 2. The team
size distribution is naturally more compressed under the second, narrower, team definition,
but for both definitions a sizable fraction of teams are fairly large. The sample contains
4478 establishments with average size 116. When working with the second team definition
we have a total of 28524 teams with an average size of 18.

Wage Distribution Figure 2 plots the histogram of the average daily earnings during
the year-2000 reference spell in Euros. The “mass-points” reflect top-coding of the earnings
data at the social security contribution ceiling (which is lower in Eastern Germany). As a
consequence, 7.7% of the wage observations in the underlying dataset are top coded.5 A
simple variance decomposition implies that the within-team component accounts for 47.9%
of the overall variance in wages under team definition 1 and 22.7% under team definition 2.
Finally, there is fairly little wage growth in the decade covered by our dataset. The cohort
whose wages are depicted in Figure 2 experienced average annual wage growth of .97% over
the next 5 years. The annual growth rate drops to .43% in the second half of the decade.

Wage Gap to Coworkers We are interested in how a worker’s future wage growth re-
lates to her coworker’s (relative) wages. To gauge the extent of wage differences across peers,
Figure 3 plots the histogram of wage gaps, defined as the log difference between an individ-
   5
     While there exist imputation methods to address the truncation, we instead treat the top-coded ob-
servations as actual wage observations and do not correct for the top-coding. We have experimented with
various ways of treating the top coded observations and found our main empirical results to be robust. We
show in Appendix B.2 how our reduced form results change when omitting all teams with top coded wage
observations. For more detail regarding the construction of wages, see Data Appendix A. There, we also
describe how we eliminate some extreme wage observations.


                                                   14
ual’s wage and the mean wage of her peers, for each team definition. Under the first team
definition, the gap has mean .023 and amounts to -.26, .04, and .28 at the 10th, 50th, and
90th percentiles in the year 2000. Under the second team definition, the gap has mean .01
and is -.17, .00, and .20 at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles. Naturally, within-team wage
dispersion is smaller under the narrower team definition.

3.2    Regression Framework

We begin with the following baseline specification which we implement separately for various
horizons h,


       wi,t+h = α + β w̄−i,t + γwi,t + ωage + ωtenure + ωgender + ωeduc + ωocc + ωt + εi,t .        (8)


wi,t+h is individual i’s log wage in year t + h, which we project on the log mean wage
of her peers in year t, w̄−i,t , controlling for her own log wage in year t, wi,t , along with
fixed effects for age decile, tenure decile, gender, education, occupation, and year. Unless
otherwise indicated that is the set of fixed effects used in all specifications. Further, we omit


                                                  15
observations that fall into the top and bottom percentile in terms of wage growth from t to
t + h in all reduced form specifications.
   All our regressions pool the observations across all years t. Since we observe the full peer
groups for ten years, the results for h > 2 use only a subset of years t. For instance, for
h = 10 we are restricted to exclusively use information about peers in the year 2000 (since
we observe workers until 2010). Likewise, for h = 5 we can use all years between 2000 and
2005.
   We report the parameter estimates for each team definition in Table I, clustering standard
errors at the establishment-year level. Panel A reports the results using team definition 2.
We first note that our findings suggest quantitatively large effects: They imply that doubling
the mean wage of individual i’s peers raises, in expectation, i’s wage next year by over 7%.
These effects are naturally larger as the horizon extends further into the future, but they do
not grow linearly. This is natural in the context of learning, as agents likely learn less as
they gradually become more knowledgeable. Over a 10 year horizon, doubling peers’ wages
results in 21% higher wages.
   We next contrast these results with the corresponding results for the wider team defi-
nition 1. Comparing Panel A and Panel B of Table I, the coefficients tend to be larger for
the narrower team definition. These results are consistent with learning from coworkers if
interactions between coworkers within occupations are more intense. Thus, in the rest of
this section we restrict our attention to team definition 2. We separately report all results
for the alternative team definition in the Appendix.
   We next turn to an alternative specification where we split a peer group into those with
                                                +       −
higher and lower wages. In particular, we let w̄−i,t (w̄−i,t ) denote the log of the mean wage
of i’s peers with higher (lower) wages. We then run the otherwise unaltered specification,

                                 −
                    +
 wi,t+h = α + β + w̄−i,t + β − w̄−i,t + γwi,t + ωage + ωtenure + ωgender + ωeduc + ωocc + ωt + εi,t , (9)


and report our findings in Table II.
   The table documents a stark asymmetry. It suggests that the peers higher up in the team
wage distribution matter far more for future wage outcomes than the peers below. While

increasing the average wage of either group comes with a significant increase in the expected
wage of an individual, the peer group above has an impact three to four times larger at all
horizons. These findings are consistent with larger knowledge flows from more highly skilled
peers and little congestion from less skilled peers. Since we find this stark asymmetry to be
robust throughout, we henceforth build on specification (9).


3.2.1      Across the Wage, Age, Tenure, and Size Distributions

We show next that the forces we document are present across the labor market. In particular,
we run the same baseline specification separately for workers in different deciles of the wage
distribution.6 We next repeat the exercise for different deciles of the age, tenure, and team
size distribution. As we discuss further below, the findings in this subsection suggest that the
patterns we have described thus far are not entirely driven by mean-reversion, a backloaded
wage structure, or returns to tenure or experience.
       Our first set of results are reported in Panel A of Table III which reports the regres-
sion coefficients for specification (9) which we run separately for each decile of the wage
distribution.7
       The results are fairly stable across the wage distribution.8 We conclude that having
more highly paid coworkers is associated with future wage growth, largely independent of
the current level of wages. This is informative for the modeling choices we make below.
Furthermore, since the coefficients do not decline as we focus on higher wage deciles, the
results strongly suggests that our baseline findings do not reflect a form of economy-wide
mean reversion in wages.
       Our next set of results is reported in Panel B of Table III where we cut the sample
into different deciles of the (pooled) sample age distribution. Our findings suggest that the
effects we document are substantially stronger for young workers. Furthermore, while we find
   6
      Of course, we use the full peer group in the construction of the independent variable as before.
   7
      Specifically, we assign a worker-year observation to decile i if the worker’s wage in that year falls into
decile i of the wage distribution during that year.
    8
      The sharp increase in the coefficient estimate for the two top deciles is likely a consequence of the top-
coding since that group has an artificially compressed distribution of w̄+ . Further, the fact that the number
of observations is substantially smaller for the bottom deciles reflects that those workers are more marginally
attached to the labor market and are therefore more frequently not employed at the reference spell h years
ahead.

positive and significant effects from more highly paid peers above and below for all segments
of the wage distribution, the asymmetry vanishes, and perhaps reverses, at the top. As a
consequence of these strong age patterns, we entertain an age-specific learning function in
the structural estimation below. The results we find there starkly mimic these reduced form
patterns.
       Our next set of results is reported in Panel C of Table III and shows that the patterns we
describe are present across the (job) tenure distribution. In particular, the table shows that
more highly paid coworkers are associated with larger wage growth for workers everywhere
in the tenure distribution. In addition, increasing the wages of more highly paid peers has a
larger effect on one’s future wage growth compared with the effect from less-well-paid peers.
The asymmetry is stark at the bottom of the tenure distribution and, similar to the results
for age, vanishes towards the top.
       Our final set of results in this subsection gauges the role of team size and is reported
in Panel D of Table III. It shows that the patterns we describe are present in small and
large teams alike. The estimated relationships are somewhat weaker for the smallest teams
and become less precise at the very top.9 These results suggest that learning is, to some
extent, independent of team size and happens throughout the team size distribution. As a
consequence, when we have to take a stance on parametric forms in the structural estimation,
we work with scale-independent learning functions.


3.2.2      Switchers

We now consider whether our baseline results may be driven by mean reversion in wages. To
do so, we run specification (9) for a sample of workers that leave their establishment after
the reference spell. Specifically, we restrict the sample to workers who leave their job after
the reference date in year t and regain employment at a different employer by the reference
date in year t + 1.10
       The results are reported in Panel A of Table IV. The table corroborates the asymmetry
   9
     The reason is that we cluster standard errors at the establishment-year level and there are very few
establishments in the largest team decile.
  10
     Recall that we assign the employer pertaining to the spell overlapping January 31th of any given year
as the annual observation. We further note that our data do not allow us to observe the firm’s other
establishments so we cannot rule out that some of the team-switchers move within the same firm.


                                                   20
we have found so far using the mover design and shows that more highly paid peers comes
with higher wage growth even for those who move to a different establishment.
       Clearly, the effects remain large and significant which implies that our results do not
purely reflect team level mean-reversion in wages. In fact, the results indicate that the effect
of having better coworkers is somewhat larger for agents that switch jobs than for agents
that remain in the same job. This can be the result of selection. Switchers might be the
ones that learned the most, which might give them an incentive to leave the team if there is
no room for their newly acquired skills in their current organization. Alternatively, it maybe
the result of the fact that switchers tend to be young, and young workers’ wage growth is
more sensitive to peers’ wages.
       To account for some of these forms of selection we also present results for only those
switchers who experience an interim unemployment spell between jobs. That is, we re-
strict the sample to movers who experience a period of joblessness in year t and report the
corresponding results in Panel B of Table IV.
       To go even further, we conclude this section by restricting the sample to switchers with
an interim spell of nonemployment whose reference spell employer also experienced a mass
layoff event in year t.11 Arguably, constructing the sample this way partially controls for
selection and, as can be seen in Panel C of Table IV our corresponding estimates tend to fall
somewhat. Further, the results are somewhat more noisy because we lose most observations.
Nevertheless, the results remain large and significant which strongly suggests that within-
team mean reversion is not a key driver of our baseline results.


3.2.3      Discussion and Robustness

Besides coworker learning there are two other prime mechanisms that might be driving the
patterns uncovered in Tables I and II. First, certain plausible wage back-loading patterns
could give rise to the results. In particular, firms could attempt to retain workers by offering
wage schedules that pay relatively more in the future. Firms could have incentives to do so
  11
     We identify such an event at establishments who had at least 50 employers two years prior and have
since contracted employment by at least 30%. We further require that they did not build up employment by

if it is costly to hire new workers and workers search on the job. This would, for instance, be
the case in an environment similar to Burdett and Coles (2003) or Postel-Vinay and Robin
(2002).
   We argue, however, that the additional results we have shown thus far are hard to rec-
oncile with those mechanisms. First, the mover results suggest that the forces we document
are present and similar in size for team switchers, including those who arguably leave their
establishments involuntarily. This suggests back-loading or establishment specific factors
cannot be the only force behind our baseline results. This is further corroborated by the
results which show that our baseline effects are present across the tenure and age distribu-
tion. Second, the sharp asymmetry between β̂ + and β̂ − , for which we provide additional
evidence in the next subsection, is hard to reconcile with an explanation which broadly
builds on within-team mean reversion in wages. Third, the asymmetry, jointly with the
results for movers and job tenure rule out that the basic results are exclusively driven by
learning-by-doing or on-the-job search as in Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002)
   Finally, we point to additional robustness results which are relegated to Appendix B.2.
There, we show that the patterns documented in this section are robust to modified sample
selection criteria and reduced-form specifications. We show results when we omit teams
with top-coded wages, when we omit teams with apprentices, when we exclusively work with
establishments that neither have a collective bargaining agreement nor benchmark their
wages with one. We also report results when we include more high-dimensional fixed effects.
Most importantly, we show our baseline results under the inclusion of team fixed effects
under both team definitions.
   As can be seen from the corresponding tables in Appendix B.2, our baseline results appear
mostly insensitive to these modifications and the basic pattern highlighted throughout this
section remains stable.
   We conclude this section by offering the results for a specification which splits individuals
working in the same establishment as worker i into two groups: Those working in the same
occupation and those working in different occupations. We again split each of those two
groups into those paid more than wi and those paid less. We include those four variables on
an otherwise unchanged specification (9) and report the results in Table V.

                     Table V Peers in the same and in other occupations.

   The results indicate that individuals learn more from higher-wage peers in the same
occupation than in other occupations. The asymmetry between β̂ + and β̂ − is also much
larger in the same than in other occupations. These results are natural if we interpret them
as resulting from learning. In their own occupation, individuals learn mostly from more
knowledgeable peers. In contrast, when they interact with peers in occupations that use
different knowledge, they learn from everyone since they know less of the topic themselves.


3.2.4   A More Flexible Specification

We end the reduced-form exploration with an exercise that attempts to approximate the wage
distribution surrounding a worker in a flexible way. To do so, we divide a worker’s peers into
11 bins. The bottom bin takes peers j with wage such that log(wj ) − log(wi ) < −.45 while
the top bin takes those peers with log(wj ) − log(wi ) > .45. All other workers are grouped
into 9 equally spaced bins in-between. We then compute, for each individual i and year t,



                                                      24
the fraction of her coworkers in each bin k, pi,k,t , and run the following regression,

                   11
                   X
        wi,t+h =         βk pi,k,t + γwi,t + ωage + ωtenure + ωgender + ωeduc + ωocc + ωt + εi,t .      (10)
                   k=2


That is, we project log wages h years ahead on the current log wage and a non-parametric ap-
proximation of the current peer wage distribution around a worker, along with our standard
controls and fixed effects. We present the results in Figure 4.
       Figure 4 plots the marginal response of log wages h years ahead to increasing the weight
on each of the 10 bins (relative to increasing the weight on bin 1 which is the omitted
category). The figure shows that moving 10% of one’s peers from the bottom bin into the
highest bin increases wages 3 years ahead by slightly more than 1.5%. It also shows that
the effects are naturally larger for longer horizons, but exhibit similar patterns. The figure
confirms the findings from the previous exercises: Those who are less well paid (those in bins
5 and under) have little effect on a worker’s future wage growth. In contrast, workers seem
to benefit from additional highly paid workers in the peer group (those in bins 7 and higher).
Note that, while workers benefit more from more highly paid peers, the effects are less than
proportional.12 This mimics our findings from the structural estimation below which suggest
that knowledge flows more efficiently from those in close proximity relative to those far above
in the wage distribution. Nevertheless, we stress that the effects are monotonically increasing
(almost everywhere), suggesting that individuals learn more from coworkers that are further
out in the wage distribution.
       The bottom panel of Figure 4 also confirms that learning from higher earners is accumu-
lates over time, presumably because the composition of teams is highly persistent, but not
in a linear fashion. We report the table underlying Figure 4 in Appendix B.1 along with the
corresponding results for the other team definition. In addition, we report the results, for
the horizon h = 3, for specifications restricted to workers above (or below) the median wage
in their team and to specifications restricted to workers selected from particular deciles of
the wage distribution. The basic patterns in Figure 4 are generally confirmed.

    The top bin collects all peers j such that log (wj ) − log (wi ) > .45 and thus does not directly compare
with the other groups.

4     Structural Estimation
We now turn to a structural estimation of the amount of learning within teams. One of
the key problems interpreting the results in the previous section is that wages do not equal
knowledge. In order to go beyond reduced-form relationships between the distribution of
wages and wage growth and determine the implications of our findings for learning, we need
a theory that allows us to map one into the other. We use the theory developed in Section 2
to do so. Our main objective is to estimate the “learning function” G(·). Below we describe
a strategy to recover G(·) from panel data that includes teams’ wages, and implement our
strategy using the German data.

                                                       26
       Heuristically, our method exploits two dimensions of the data. First, it uses the within-
team coworker pay differentials we observe in repeated cross-sections to back out the worker
types z which are consistent with a particular G(.). That is, compensating differentials
reveal z given a learning function G(.). Second, it uses the intertemporal dimension of the
resulting panel dataset of worker types to estimate G(.). That is, the dynamic evolution of
zi projected on z−i identifies the learning function G(.).


4.1       Identifying Learning Parameters

Our identification strategy requires a panel of at least two years of matched employer-
employee data that includes wages. We rely only on the worker’s Bellman equation,


                                 V (z) = w (z, z̃) + βE [V (z 0 ) |z, z̃]                            (11)


which is the result of the worker’s maximization. Equation (11) depends on the assumptions
of stationarity, perpetual youth, competitive labor markets, and complete financial markets
(or linear utility).13 However, we do not need to place any assumptions on the set of firms
that are active, or features of the technologies that firms use beyond those which guarantee
that V (z) is increasing (e.g. Assumptions 1 to 3). The set of technologies and firms in the
economy determine the set of teams we observe in equilibrium, but our strategy simply uses
the set of observed teams.
       We first note that z does not have a natural cardinality. We are therefore free to choose
a convenient one: If V (z) is the value function in the current equilibrium, we choose a
cardinality of z so that V (z) = z. Then, (11) becomes


                                z = w (z, z̃) + βE [z 0 |z, z̃]
                                                  Z ∞
                                  = w (z, z̃) + β       z 0 dG (z 0 |z, z̃)
                                                         0
  13
    Our approach allows for a number of generalizations. For example, if markets are so incomplete that
agents cannot save or borrow, we can simply replace the current return in (11) with a known increasing and
concave function of the wage.

or


                                zi = wi + βE [zi0 |zi , z̃−i ]                                      (12)

                                                   0


     Our strategy hinges on the following two observations. First, if we know, for each worker
i, zi0 , zi , and z̃−i , we can directly identify G. Conversely, if we know G, we can invert (12)
and solve for zi as a function of a worker’s wage and the wages of her coworkers; for a team of
size n, (12) for each of the n team members delivers a system of n equations in n unknowns
(zi for each team member). Together these equations provide several moment conditions
that can be used to identify G using GMM.
     Operationally, we choose a functional form for G (z 0 |z, z̃; θ), with parameters θ, and we
calibrate β externally. Starting from period t, we can decompose next period’s knowledge,
z 0 , into expected and unexpected components. Namely,


                                         zi0 = E (zi , z̃−i ) + εi ,                                (13)

where E (zi , z̃−i ) is the conditional expectation and εi is the expectational error. We then use
the moment conditions built from E [εi |zi , z̃−i ] = 0. Below we specialize to the case where
E (zi , z̃−i ) = E [zi0 |zi , z̃−i ] is a linear combination of several moments {mk (zi , z̃−i )}K
                                                                                                 k=1 , so
                      PK
that E (zi , z̃−i ) = k=1 θk mk (zi , z̃−i ). In such a case, we would have K parameters {θk } and
K natural moment conditions


                                E [mk (zi , z̃−i ) εi ] = 0, k = 1, ..., K.                         (14)


Formally, if a team has n workers, then given θ and w, (12) provide n equations for the n
unknowns of {zi }. Therefore given the wages wt and a vector of team assignments rt , we
can construct Z (wt , rt , θ) to be the I × 1 vector of all workers’ knowledge at t. Given this,
we can construct M (wt , rt , θ) to be the I × k matrix of moments so that the i, k entry of
M (wt , rt , θ) is mk (zi , z̃−i ) where zi , z̃−i are the knowledge of i and her coworkers implied by
the wages, wt , the assignment rt , and parameters θ. Then the k moments conditions (14)

       We solve for θ using an iterative two-step procedure that exploits the panel structure
of our data along with the intertemporal restrictions inherent in the learning function (13).
We first guess parameters θguess . Given this guess, we can back out the types z in a team
solely from information on wages.14 In other words, we invert (12) to solve for all workers’
knowledge, Z (wt , rt , θ). We do this by finding a fixed point z of the operator
                                                    Z                          

We can then use the wages at time t + 1 to solve for all workers knowledge at t + 1,
Z (wt+1 , rt+1 , θ). With this, we have the implied values of zi , z̃−i , and zi0 for each worker. We
then use these knowledge levels to estimate θ using a linear regression

                                              K
                                              X

                                              k=1


If our estimated θ̂ = θguess then we have found a fixed point. This fixed point is a solution
to (15). In practice, we use θ̂ to update our guess and iterate until we find a fixed point.
       A proof of identification then amounts to guaranteeing that this procedure has a unique
fixed point. While we currently do not have such a proof, this method has always uncov-
ered the true parameter values in Monte Carlo simulations and has always converged when
implemented on the matched German data.


4.2       Results

Guided by our reduced form findings, we focus on the following parametric form for the
conditional expectation, that implicitly determines G(·),
  14
   As discussed in the theory section above, the vector of types z is the solution to the firm problem in (1).
Here, we simply use the composition of teams observed in the data.

where n is the worker’s team size and Θ (·) is a weakly increasing function. Below we let
Θ (·) be piece-wise linear. We focus on the expected value because this is the only feature of
the function G needed to invert the Bellman equation and recover the workers’ knowledge.
This functional form could be motivated by a variant of the model in Lucas (2009) in which a
worker is equally likely to attain knowledge from any coworker, and the function Θ describes
how the worker’s learning depends on the gap between the worker and the coworker. In
contrast to Lucas (2009), however, here agents only learn from coworkers, not from the
whole population.

This learning function allows for asymmetric learning from types zj for a worker zi depending
on whether zj > zi or vice versa. It also allows for a constant time trend in skill growth, θ0 .
It is also scale-invariant (apart from the constant) since we divide the second term by n − 1.
    In updating our guess for θ = {θ+ , θ− , θ0 }, we make use of the linear structure of the
learning function and regress zi0 −zi on zi , n−1

that all the information used in this regression is constructed purely from the cross-sectional
dimension of the data in the first step.
       For this baseline learning function, we report our parameter estimates along with the
associated standard errors in Table VI.15 Choosing the expected present value of earnings
as the cardinality of z allows for a natural interpretation of these estimates. In particular,
the point estimates suggest that raising the average expected present value of earnings of a

worker’s more-highly-paid coworkers in the team by 100 Euros raises that workers expected
present value of earnings over the next year by 7 to 9 Euros times the share of more-highly-
paid workers. In turn, doing so for the coworkers that are less well paid only increases
expected present value of earnings by 1 to 4 Euros times the share of less-well-paid workers.
This implies that there are only small learning effects coming from less-well-paid coworkers.
Furthermore, the results imply that learning for individuals at the bottom of the distribution
of knowledge in a team is large relative to learning for individuals at the top of the distribu-
tion. Naturally, we find somewhat larger effects for the narrower team definition.16 Clearly,
these point estimates are very much consistent with the reduced form patterns discussed in
the previous section.
       Finally, while θ0 is precisely estimated and strictly positive it is very small for both team
definitions. One reason for why we find essentially no trend growth in wages beyond what
arises from learning is that the average real wage growth during the period covered in our
dataset was very limited, as discussed above.
       The next step is to generalize the specification of G to allow for additional flexibility in
order to capture potential nonlinearities in coworker learning. Hence, we specify the learning

     One important observation across all specifications we have worked with is that θ0 is substantially larger
for team definition 2.

where 1 denotes the indicator function. This piece-wise linear function incorporates addi-
tional flexibility yet still allows us to linearly project z 0 − z on the right-hand-side to update
the four parameters of the learning function {θ0 , θ− , θ+ , θ++ }.17 When implementing this
learning function, we set b = 10%.
       The results are reported in Table VII. Our estimates for θ0 and θ− are hardly changed
by the modification of the learning function for either team definition. That is, as before,
changing the wages of those team members with lower type affects an individual’s expected
wage growth little in comparison with those team members with more knowledge. Likewise,
the estimated trend growth remains minimal. Our results indicate that θ+ > θ++ , so the
marginal returns (in terms of future wage growth) to improving the knowledge of those above
in the wage distribution appears to be somewhat larger for those in closer proximity in the
distribution of knowledge. Just like in Table VI, we find that the effects are stronger for the
narrower team definition. Workers appear to benefit more from those coworkers that work
in the same occupation. Similarly, improving those below in the skill distribution has far
larger positive effects when they also work in the same occupation.
       We conclude this subsection with three short exercises which cast light on the quantitative

    In light of our previous findings and due to computational limitations we have thus far restricted the
learning function to take a single parameter for the group zj < zi . This restriction could, in principle, be
relaxed.

importance of coworker learning and its interplay with how teams are formed. We run all
three exercises in the context of both the basic learning function (17) and the piece-wise
linear learning function in (18) for both team definitions.


4.2.1   Investment in Knowledge

An individual receives compensation in two ways: with wages and with knowledge. We can
use our estimated framework to gauge the quantitative importance of coworker learning in
the economy by comparing the value of knowledge flows to the value of wage payments.
Specifically, we compute the value of the annual flow of knowledge, β (zi0 − z), where next
period’s knowledge zi0 is given by equation (13) and compute its simple pooled average across
all individuals and years in our sample. We then subtract the pure trend component βθ0 z
from this and contrast it with the pooled average of wages.
   We present the results for both team definitions and both learning function in Table
VIII. Coworkers knowledge flows account for roughly 4-9% of the average flow value workers
receive, with the remainder given by the wage. This is the total value of knowledge flows each
worker receives relative to the knowledge flows she would attain from working on a team of
identical workers. In other words, agents invest on average 4-9% of their total compensation

in learning from others at work.18 While the results are fairly similar across the two different
specifications, they are substantially larger for team definition 1. The reason is simply that
there is more within-team knowledge dispersion with team definition 1: Workers do not
only learn from their coworkers in the same occupation but also from everyone else in the
establishment.
       Naturally, there is substantial heterogeneity in this breakdown across the knowledge
distribution. For the basic learning function and team definition 1, knowledge flows amount
to 16.0% for the bottom decile of the knowledge distribution reflecting the substantial room
for learning at the bottom. In turn, it becomes negative at the top decile, dropping to -.02%,
reflecting the mild negative effect of having mostly less knowledgeable coworkers. Naturally,
this is somewhat less pronounced for the second team definition where the bottom decile
receives 6.2% of their flow compensation in terms of learning, dropping to -1.2% at the top.
The numbers are very similar for the piece-wise linear learning function.


4.2.2       The Role of Sorting

In equilibrium, the team selected by a firm produces both output and knowledge. As a
result, the sorting of workers across firms reflects both of these goals. How does equilibrium
sorting affect the value of learning within teams? How much would the total value of learning
  18
     If individuals do, in fact, learn from coworkers with the same knowledge, then some of the trend compo-
nent would also represent knowledge flows. We note that when we do not subtract the trend component this
number rises substantially, to approximately 17% in all four cases. The effect of the trend component βθ0 z
is large since average knowledge levels are high relative to the amount of dispersion in knowledge within

change if teams were formed randomly?
   To assess the role of coworker sorting for learning, we conduct a simple experiment
where we randomly reshuffle workers across existing teams in the final coworker year in our
sample, 2008. We leave the team size distribution unaltered and compute, for all workers, a

                                                −i for zi where z̃−i is worker i’s counterfactual

peer group.
   We then contrast the average of the counterfactual conditional expectation with the
average of the factual conditional expectation, E (zi , z̃−i ). We report the results in Table IX
which shows that, under random sorting, the average growth in z rises between 64% and
91%. We highlight that the associated losses in the value of output must weakly exceed
these knowledge gains in an efficient allocation. The results are naturally larger for team
definition 2 because within-team knowledge dispersion is smaller in more narrowly defined
teams.
   These findings suggest that workers are allocated to teams in a way that hinders knowl-
edge flows relative to a random sorting benchmark. We interpret this as reflecting supermod-
ularity in the production function, which results in positive assortative matching of workers
in teams. Intuitively, since the learning function is increasing and convex over much of its
domain, learning benefits from large differences between coworkers. In contrast, production
benefits from small differences between team members due to knowledge complementarity in
the production function. In sum, these findings seem to suggest a tension between the con-
temporaneous requirements on the production side and the dynamic returns from coworker

4.2.3   Inequality

Two individuals with the same knowledge and same present value of earnings might earn
different wages because they work on teams with different opportunities to learn. In other
words some of the wage differences reflect compensating differentials for learning rather than
unequal compensation.
   We now ask how variation in log wages compares to variation in log compensation,
where compensation is measured as (1 − β)zi = wi + βE[zi0 − zi |zi , z̃−i ]. The unconditional
variance of log wages in our data is approximately .13, while the unconditional variance in
log compensation is approximately .10 or .09, depending on the team definition (and similar
for both learning functions).
   Table X reports the difference between the variance of log wages and the variance in
log compensation as a fraction of the variance of log wages. By this measure, inequality in
compensation is one-fifth to one-third smaller than wage inequality. Note that the result
that compensation inequality is smaller is not mechanical; it reflects the fact that those with
less knowledge receive a larger share of their compensation in the form of learning.

4.2.4    An Alternative Interpretation

The equations characterizing an individuals value function use the idea that the change in
one’s knowledge depends on the distribution of knowledge among one’s coworkers. There
is an alternative interpretation of the equations that characterize learning that is consistent
with our empirical specification of learning.
    Suppose that z, instead of being a scalar, represents a vector of individual characteris-
tics. For example, these characteristics could reflect different dimensions of knowledge. In
such an environment, one possibility is that learning is such that the change in one’s value
function depends on the composition of one’s coworkers’ value functions. Namely, in this
case, it is natural to assume that the learning function depends on values, not on knowledge
directly, since values provide a relevant summary of the vector of characteristics z. Then, the
procedure outlined above to obtain an individual’s knowledge from a panel of wages simply
recovers the values of all agents, as in equation (11). Under this assumption, our method-
ology can be used exactly as described, and our quantitative results would be unchanged.
We would simply interpret the estimated learning function as determining how the value of
other agents determines the change in value of a given individual.



5       Incorporating Other Observables
We now show how our methodology can be extended to a setting in which either the produc-
tion function or the learning function (or even the value placed on knowledge) depends on
worker characteristics aside from knowledge. These characteristics may or may not evolve
endogenously. We require the characteristics to be observable.
    An individual is described by knowledge z and a vector of observable characteristics
x. These evolve according to a joint Markov process. For example, x could consist of an
individual’s age, schooling, occupation, location, etc. Denote the joint Markov process by


                                    G (z 0 , x0 |z, x, {z̃, x̃}) .




                                                 37
The value function for an individual with state z, x is V (z; x) satisfying
                                                    Z Z
             V (z, x) = w (z, x; {z̃, x̃}) + β                  V (z 0 , x0 ) G (dz 0 , dx0 |z, x, {z̃, x̃}) .


Thus both the production function and the learning function can depend on the individual
characteristics and those of her coworkers. The realized value function of worker i at time t
is                                 Z Z
                   vit = wit + β            V (z 0 , x0 ) G (dz 0 , dx0 |zit , xit , {z̃it , x̃it }) .           (19)

     The key step is to transform the learning function from the knowledge space to the value
space. We require that V is strictly increasing in z for each x, and therefore has a partial
inverse Z (v, x) that satisfies v = V (Z (v, x) , x) and z = Z (V (z, x) , x). Further, define the
learning function in the value space as

                                                                                          
                     0   0                             0    0        0
                Ĝ (v , x |v, x, ṽ, x̃) ≡ G Z (v , x ) , x |Z (v, x) , x, Z̃ (ṽ, x̃) , x̃ ,


where Z̃ (ṽ; x̃) is the vector of coworkers’ knowledge given their values and characteristics.
With this, we can write (19) as
                                              Z Z
                             vit = wit + β             v 0 Ĝ (dv 0 , dx0 |v, x, ṽ, x̃) .                       (20)



5.1     Algorithm

We now show that it is straightforward to extend the methodology described in the previous
section to estimate the function Ĝ. Let E be the conditional expectation,
                                                                Z Z
                                        0
                E (v, x, ṽ, x̃) ≡ E [v |v, x, ṽ, x̃] =                 v 0 Ĝ (dv 0 , dx0 |v, x, ṽ, x̃) ,


so that the realized Bellman equation (20) can be written as


                                 vit = wit + βE (vit , xit , ṽ−it , x̃−it ) .                                   (21)




                                                           38
   If we observed {vi0 , x0i , vi , xi , ṽ−i , x̃−i } for each worker, we could directly estimate E. And
conversely, if we knew E and we observed {wit , xit , x̃−i , x0i } for each worker, we could solve
for {vit } for each team using the system of equations given by (21) for each team member.
   We can again cast this in terms of GMM. For example, suppose we assume E takes the
form of a linear combination of moments {mk (v, x, ṽ, x̃)}K
                                                           k=1 , so


                                                     K
                                                     X
                                E (v, x, ṽ, x̃) =         θk mk (v, x, ṽ, x̃) .
                                                     k=1


Next, define the expectational error term εit+1 to be


                            εit+1 ≡ vit+1 − E [vit+1 |vit , xit , ṽ−it , x̃−it ]

                                    = vit+1 − E (vit , xit , ṽ−it , x̃−it ) .


We can again build moment conditions to estimate θ from E [εit+1 |vit , xit , ṽit , x̃it ] = 0. Our
natural moment conditions would then be E [εit+1 mk (vit , xit , ṽit , x̃it )] = 0. Formally, given
θ, we can solve for {vit } using (21). Given the entire vector of wages w, observable charac-
teristics x, and team assignments r, let Υ (w, x, r, θ) be the corresponding values that have
been solved for using (21) so that {vit } = Υ (wt , xt , rt , θ) . Given this, we can construct
M (wt , xt , rt , θ) to be the I × k matrix of moments so that the i, k entry of M (wt , xt , rt , θ)
is mk (vi , xi , ṽ−i , x̃−i ) where vi , ṽ−i are the values of i and her coworkers implied by the
wages, wt , the observable characteristics xt , the assignment rt , and parameters θ. Then the
k moments conditions (14) can be stacked as

               h                                                                         i
              E M (wt , xt , rt , θ)T (Υ (wt+1 , xt , rt+1 , θ) − M (wt , xt , rt , θ) θ) = 0.


5.2    Results

We illustrate this methodology by studying the differences in learning between young and old
workers. Let {y, o} indicate whether a worker is young or old. We implement the following

This specification allows knowledge flows to depend on both the age group of the worker and
                                              +
the age group of her coworker. For instance, θyo captures the strength of the knowledge flows
from old to young coworkers. Furthermore, the specification allows for age group specific
trend growth. For simplicity we do not allow for any effects of coworkers j with vj < vi .
     In practice, we do not regroup workers across age groups and instead label them y when
younger than 40 in the year 2000. We then implement our routine on a short panel, using
only information from the years 2000-2002. The rest of the implementation follows exactly
the same routine outlined in the previous section.
     We present our results in Table XI. In line with our previous findings we find little trend
growth for either age group. For the first team definition we find that both the young and
the old learn more from the old. In fact, the old only seem to learn from the old, with
slightly negative trend growth and learning from the young. For the second, narrower team
definition we find that each group learns more from itself, that is the young learn more from
the young than from the old and vice versa for the old. Regardless of the team definition,
the young learn far more than the old, closely in line with our reduced form findings.



6       Conclusion
We set out to study learning from coworkers. We found evidence suggesting that in fact
this form of learning is significant. Our results are intuitive and natural. Workers learn
from those more knowledgeable than they are; knowledge growth is more sensitive to more-
knowledgeable coworkers than to less-knowledgeable coworkers. Individuals—especially those
that are younger and less knowledgeable—invest a substantial fraction of their compensa-
tion into knowledge growth. As a result, inequality in wages overstates inequality in total

compensation.
   We hope that these findings are useful in encouraging work on more theories and empirical
research with learning from coworkers at their core. Our theory, although general in its
specification of technology and existing complementarities in production, does assume that
workers are simply income maximizers and that labor markets are competitive. It would be
valuable to refine our estimates of the value of learning in the workplace by relaxing these
assumptions.
   Finally, the importance of learning from coworkers implied by our findings suggests large
aggregate consequences of any economy-wide change that affects the composition of teams.
Many such changes come to mind, like, for example, technological improvements in informa-
tion and communication technology, other forms of skilled-biased technical change, as well
as increased spatial segregation. Our results underscore the importance of studying these
and other well-known trends in the economy from the point of view of their effect on team
formation and the resulting learning from coworkers.

Appendix

A      Data Appendix
Construction of Basic Annual Panel
The basic dataset comes in spell format where a spell can correspond either to employment or to
a period of benefit receipt. We implement the publicly available code by Eberle, Schmucker and
Seth (2013) to convert the spells into monthly cross sections which we then merge into a monthly
panel covering 1993-2010.19 For each spell that runs through an entire calendar year we see one
observation per variable (occupation, employment status, average hourly wage, type of benefit
receipt,...) per year. For all other spells, we see one observation per variable per spell.
    Our main analysis is carried out on an annual panel and we select the spell overlapping January
31st of a given year as the observation for the year. This implies that the peer groups we study are
the full workforce of the sample establishments on January 31st of each year from 2000 to 2008.
To construct real prices we deflate using a CPI provided by the data provider.
    When assigning a wage observation we assign the daily wage during spells of full time employ-
ment unless otherwise noted.20 As a consequence, we ignore information on earnings from part time
employment and construct peer groups only from full time employees for full time employees. The
  19

  20
    We follow the routine in the aforementioned code to select a main employment spell in case individuals
hold several jobs.


                                                   45
reason is that, while we observe a part time flag, we do not have good information on hours which
blurs the mapping between daily earnings—as reported to the social security administration—and
the wage for non full time employees.


Construction of Regression Sample for Section 3
Team Construction We identify all workers that work at one of the sample establishments
and construct teams with minimum size 2 as the collection of workers employed full time subject to
social security during the reference spell for a given calendar year. We exclude workers in vocational
training and interns. Thus, our reduced form exploration projects log wages for individual i working
full time subject to social security in year t + n on the wages of her full-time coworkers in year t if
she worked in one of our sample establishments in year t.

Wages We drop the bottom percentile and the top .1 percentile of the annual wage observations
and, since our approach requires information on wages, we only use information on full time workers
who work subject to social security.21 We flag observations which are top-coded due to the social
security ceiling when they fall into one of the two masspoints which are easily identified in the wage
distribution in a given year. We further omit any observations from the regressions in section 3
where wage growth over the corresponding horizon h falls into the top or bottom tenths of percentile
of the pooled sample.

Mass Layoffs and Job Loss To identify a mass layoff event at an establishment, we use
information from the IAB establishment panel, which is the annual survey from which the panel
cases in our dataset are sampled. In particular, we identify a mass layoff event if the following
is true: The establishment reduces full time employment by at least 25% since two years prior,
still has a strictly positive number of full time employees, had more than 25 employees two years
prior, did not build up employment by more than 30% between three and two years prior, does not
rebuild to more than 90% of employment two years prior within the next year, and was surveyed
each years from three years prior to one year past.22
     We register a job loss for individual i in year t if there is at least one instance where she is
employed subject to social security at the end of a month but not anymore at the end of the
following month.23 We register a job loss in the context of a mass layoff event in year t if we
register a job loss at the individual level during year t and a mass layoff event at her ascribed
establishment, that is the one she works at during the spell overlapping January 31st of that year,
during the same year t.
  21
      The reason for the asymmetry is that almost no wage observations lie above the social security ceiling.
A small number of observations have a wage that is above the ceiling which the data provider suspects may
either be due to bonuses or actually incorrect. Dropping the top .1 percentile each year eliminates any such
observations.
   22
      These criteria closely follow Davis and von Wachter (2011).
   23
      We do so when we actually have information on that worker for the following month, that is when we
see her receiving benefits. If we do not have any information for the subsequent month we only register job
loss if the worker disappears for more than two months from the dataset.




                                                     46
Construction of Estimation Sample for Section 4
To construct the sample for the structural estimations in section 4, we build on the same annual
worker panel underlying our reduced form work.
    We largely mimic the construction of the sample used in the reduced form part. We likewise
drop the bottom percentile and the top .1 percentile of wage observations and only use information
on full time workers who work subject to social security. As in the reduced form, we assign the
workforce on January 31 during any year to the establishment in that year. Furthermore, we only
keep establishments which were surveyed every year between 2000 and 2010. While this is clearly
not necessary, it still leaves us with a very large number of observations. We constructed the sample
in this way so as to be able to supplement the analysis with firm level information from the BHP
establishment survey.


Correlations
We compute a set of correlations of various wage moments at the team level. Specifically, Table XII
reports the correlation matrix of team average pay, team pay dispersion, team mean-median ratio
(skewness), team size, and max wage at the team. All entries of the matrix are positive except the
correlation between team average pay and the mean-median ratio. 24

This section offers the regression output underlying Figure 4. It then offers the same table for the
alternative team definition followed by the results for various restricted samples at horizon h = 3.
  24
    A natural interpretation is that highly productive teams have a skewed wage distribution with very
highly paid managers.

B.2         Robustness
This sections evaluates the robustness of the main reduced form empirical results reported in section
3.2. We do so for team definition 2 at the horizon h = 3 years and report the corresponding tables
for team definition 1 below.
    To do so, we begin by contrasting our baseline results for specification (9) when omitting teams
that have any apprentices.25 We then restrict the sample exclusively to teams without any top-
coded wage observations.26 We report the corresponding results, contrasted with our benchmark
  25
    We highlight that even our baseline results do not use any wage information on workers in apprenticeship.
  26
    The ceiling varies from year to year and differs between former Eastern and Western Germany. Further-
more the data display a certain amount of bunching in a small interval around the officially reported ceiling
levels. To identify workers with top-coded wages we thus simply group workers into 50 Euro-cent wide bins
in each year and flag the two bins with the most mass.

results, for h = 3 in table XV and, for the alternative team definition, in table XXI. While the
results vary across the samples, the main takeaway from our reduced form exercises is robust.
    We next restrict the sample to workers in teams that are not restricted by collective bargaining
agreements. To that end, we use IAB establishment panel for the year 2000 which asks establish-
ments whether a binding collective bargaining agreement exists and if so if they pay above the
applicable collective bargaining agreement. The survey also asks whether firms benchmark their
wages with a collective bargaining agreement in case they are not subject to a binding agreement.
The second columns of table XVI reports the results if we restrict the sample to workers in es-
tablishments paying, on average, at least 10% above their collective bargaining agreement in the
year 2000. The third column restricts the sample to establishments that are neither subject to a
collective bargaining agreement nor report to benchmark their pay structure with one.
    Finally, we offer results for various specifications where we include higher-dimensional fixed
effects. In particular, we extend the baseline specification (9) in three different ways. First, we
include additional fixed effects for establishment (establishment x occupation in the second team
definition). In a second specification, we include additional team fixed effects. In a third specifica-
tion, we include occupation x year fixed effects.
    In doing so, we replace the separate right hand side variables w̄+ and w̄− in specification (9) with
the gap w̄+ − w̄− . The reason is the following: One’s own wage, those of higher paid teammates,
and those of lower paid teammates are approximately (but not exactly) collinear with a team fixed
effect. If we include a team fixed effect, we cannot recover both of β + and β − , but we can recover
their difference. The results are reported in table XVII.

   Notes: Each row reports the coefficient on the weight of bins 2 through 11 where the weight on the
   bottom bin is the omitted category. Columns 2 and 3 report the results when the sample is restricted
   to workers above (below) the team median wage. The remaining columns restrict the sample to workers
   from particular parts of the wage distribution. Team definition 1. Column titles indicate horizon h.
   Standard errors clustered at the establishment-year level. The regressions include current wage and
   fixed effects for age decile, tenure decile, gender, education, occupation, and year.
