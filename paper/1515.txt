This paper reexamines the empirical basis for two "facts" which seem to be

found in most cross-section studies of
                                         immigrant earnings: (1) the earnings
of immigrants grow rapidly as they assimilate into the U.S.; and (2) this

rapid growth leads to many immigrants overtaking the earnings of the native-

born within 10-15 years after immigration.   Using the 1970 and 1980 U.S.

Censuses, this paper studies the earnings growth
                                                   experienced by specific
immigrant cohorts during the 1970-1980 period, It is found that within-cohort

growth is significantly smaller than the growth predicted by cross-section

regressions for most immigrant groups. This differential is consistent with

the hypothesis that there has been a secular decline in the "quality't of

immigrants admitted to the United States.

            THE IMPACT OF ASSIMILATION ON THE EARNINGS OF IMMIGRANTS:

                           A REEXAMINATION OF THE EVIDENCE

 I.   Introduction

      The question of how immigrants do in the U.S. labor market has again

become an important policy issue due mainly to the rapid increase in immi-

gration rates during the postwar period. The work of Chiswick (1978, 1980)

has been extremely influential in the development of the current consensus

that immigrants adapt quite rapidly and quite well tc the U.S. labor market.

The two fundamental results in Chiswjck's research are that in a cross-section

of immigrant men: (1) the earnings of recently arrived immigrants are signif-

icantly lower than the earnings of immigrants who have been in this country

for longer periods, and (2) the relatively rapid growth of immigrant earnings

over time leads to the existence of aa
                                             overtaking age, at which point the

earnings profiles of the native—born and the foreign-born cross. This creates

the remarkable finding that, for most immigrant groups at later stages of the

life cycle, immigrant earnings exceed the earnings of the native-born. In

Chiswick's (1978) study, the overtaking point was estimated to be around 10-15

years after immigration.

      These findings appeal to labor economists since the human capital frame-

work can be easily invoked to explain the empirical regularities. In particular,

persons immigrating to the United States for "economic" reasons have strong

incentives to devote a large fraction of their effort to the process of accumu-

lating U.S.-specific human capital skills.1 This investment process explains

the relatively rapid rates of growth in immigrant earnings observed in cross-
                                   -4-




sections, and combined with assumptions about how the immigration decision

leads to a relatively select group of immigrants, also explains the existence

of the overtaking age.

     A large literature developed following the appearance of Chiswick's

study. This literature borrows both the theoretical framework and the
                                                                          empirical
methodology of Chiswick's original work. The studies in Borjas (1982), Borjas

and Tienda (1985), Carliner (1980), De Freitas (1979), Long (1980), and others,

essentially expand the literature by analyzing both male and female immigrants,

by studying alternative data sets (such as the 1976 Survey of Income and Educa-

tion), and by focusing on specific immigrant populations (e.g., Hispanics or

Asians). These various studies tend to confirm the robustness of the results

in cross-section analyses of the problem, and their cumulative impact has led

to the current conventional wisdom that after 10-15 years immigrants do

extremely well in the U.S. labor market.

     The analysis presented in this paper questions the empirical validity of

this conclusion. Using the 1970 and 1980 Public Use Samples from the U.S.

Census, the analysis shows that the cross-section regressions commonly used

in the literature confound the true assimilation impact with possible quality

differentials among immigrant cohorts. The empirical analysis below shows

that the study of earnings within immigrant cohorts leads to a very different

picture of the rate of assimilation of immigrants into the U.S. labor market.

Instead of the rapid growth found by the cross-section studies, the cohort

analysis predicts relatively slow rates of earnings growth for most immigrant

groups. The direct comparison of immigrant cohorts in the 1970 and 1980

Census data shows that the strong assimilation rates measured in the cross-

section may be partly due to a precipitous decline that has occurred in the

quality of immigrants admitted to this country since 1950. Thus the positive

 impact of the years-since-migration variable
                                                       in cross-section earnings equa-
 tions captures both the higher
                                       quality of earlier immigrant cohorts as well as
 the increase in U.S. -Specific
                                      capital hypothesized in the literature.      Finally,
 the cohort analysis indicates
                                      that, for most immigrant groups, the overtaking
 point takes place much later in the life cycle (if at all) than the point

 predicted by the cross-section regression.2

      Section II of the paper presents the
                                                   conceptual framework allowing the
 identification of the assimilation and cohort effects in census data, This

methodology is applied in Section III to the
                                                      study of immigrant earnings, and
 in Section IV to the study of the
                                           earnings of immigrants relative to the
native-born. Finally, Section V summarizes the results of the Study.



II. Framework

     The economic analysis of how immigrant earnings respond to the assimi-

lation process is commonly based on the results obtained from the following

cross-section model:



          ln w.
                1
                    X.X +
                     1      t.
                             1
                                 +   c.1                                        (1)



where w. is the wage rate of immigrant i; X. is
                                                a vector of his socioeconomic

characteristics (e.g., years of completed schooling, years of labor market

experience, etc.); and t. measures how long immigrant 1. has been in the United
        3
States.

     Since total labor market experience
                                                  (i.e., Age-Education-6) is usually
included as one of the regressors in (1), the coefficient
                                                                    measures the
differential   value placed by the U.S. labor market between U.S. experience

and foreign experience. As was noted in the introduction, one of the most

important findings of the cross-section literature is that           is significantly
positive. Thus the U.S. labor market rewards U.S. experience at a higher

rate than it rewards foreign experience. The economic interpretation of

this finding is usually couched in terms of the human capital framework.

When immigrants first arrive in the United States they lack U.S. -specific

human capital, and this results in relatively low earnings upon entrance to

the labor market. In order for the costs of immigration to be recouped, the

immigrant rapidly begins an investment path with high levels of investment

costs. These high levels of human capital investments further depress the

current earnings of recent immigrants, but guarantee high rates of growth in

earnings as the immigrants "assimilate" into the U.S. labor market. Thus the

positive and significant   obtained in cross—section estimates of equation (1)

captures how earnings grow with the assimilation process.

     The fallacy with this interpretation lies in its use of a cross-section

regression model to explain a dynamic series of events. There are (at least)

two obvious factors which can seriously bias cross-section estimates of

and raise serious doubts about the conclusion that the earnings of immigrants

rise rapidly as they assimilate, The first of these problems (and one about

which little can be done with currently available data) arises from the fact

that many immigrants eventually return to their country of origin. Piore

(1979), for example, estimates that over 30 percent of the immigrants admitted

into the United States in the early 1900's emigrated back to their country of

origin. Similarly, Warren and Peck (1980), using the 1960 and 1970 Census,

estimate that 18 percent of immigrants admitted to the U.S. between 1960 and

1970 had emigrated by 1970. Since the incidence of emigration is not likely

to be a random process in the, immigrant population, potentially serious sel-

ection biases can affect the cross-section estimate of .    For example, if
immigrants who do not do well in the United States are more likely to emigrate,

the coefficient   will be biased upward since earlier cohorts of immigrants
                                      —7—



will have been self-selected to include only the most successful immigrants,

while the recent cohorts contain a more representative selection of the

immigrant pool. It is unfortunate that, despite the potential importance of

this problem, the complete lack of emigration data for the United States

implies that any analysis of this issue (even the simple counting of how many

emigrants there are) requires the making of many unverifiable statistical and

institutional assumptions.4

     The second problem with the dynamic interpretation of the cross-section

coefficient      is its implicit assumption that, abstracting from the emigration

problem, the average tIqualityt of successive cohorts of immigrants is not

changing over time. It is this stationarity assumption which permits the

inference that since the cross-section regression indicates that a recently

arrived immigrant earns (10)iOo percent less than one who arrived 10 years

earlier, it follows that the earnings of recently arrived immigrants will

increase by (10).iOO percent in the next decade (net of aging effects).

     Note that the direction of the bias if the stationarity assumption is

not empirically valid depends on the secular trend in the quality of the

immigrant cohorts admitted to the United States. If, for example, institu-

tional changes in immigration policies and/or political disturbances in sending

countries lead to higher quality immigration, the cross-section estimate of

  would be downward biased. If, on the other hand, the shift from occupational

to family preferences mandated by the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act and

the increase in unscreened illegal immigrants has lowered the average quality of

immigrant cohorts, the cross-section estimate of     would be upward biased, and

the impact of the assimilation process on the earnings of immigrants would be

overestimated.
                                                -8-




      It is likely that the rapid increase in immigration rates since 1950 has

violated the stringent requirements imposed by the stationarity assumption in

cross-section studies. Thus the estimates of equation (1) are likely to suffer

from serious biases. To derive a general framework for comparing the cross-

section results with the findings obtained from within-cohort analyses, con-

sider the group of immigrants aged 18—54 in 1970. Using the 1970 Census, it

is convenient to partition this group into four cohorts: arrivals in 1965-

1969, arrivals in 1960-1964, arrivals in 1950—1959, and immigrants who arrived

prior to 1950. Consider next the group of immigrants aged 28-64 in the 1980

Census. The 1980 Census data allows the partitioning of this group of immi-

grants into six cohorts: arrivals in 1975-1979, arrivals in 1970-1974,

arrivals in 1965-1969, arrivals in 1960—1964, arrivals in 1950-1959, and

immigrants who arrived prior to 1950. Note that the last four cohorts defined

in the 1980 group exactly match the definitions of the cohorts from the 1970

Census. In addition, the age composition of the two samples ensures that

(if the census data contained all observations from the population) the same

individuals are included in each of these cohort samples.5 Given these data,

two cross—section regressions can be estimat:



      in w70 =          +            +            +            +           +         (2)

      in w80 =          +            +            +            +
                 Xy80       75D75        70D70        65D65        60D60 ÷ 50D50
                        +            +                                               (3)

where the dummy variables indexing years-since—immigration/cohort are defined

by: D75 =   1 if immigrated in 1975-1979; D70 = 1 if immigrated in 1970-1974;

       1 if immigrated in 1965-1969; B60                 1 if immigrated in 1960-1964; B50 = 1

 if immigrated in 1950-1959; and                1 if immigrated prior to 1950. By defi-
                                    D40
nition, the vector X in (2) and (3) does not contain a constant term.

       Consider cohort k, where Dk = 1 (k=40,50,60,65). Let k give the mean

values of the socioeconomic characteristics for this cohort as of 1980. Define:




                 70,k =         ÷
                                                                               (4)


                 80,k = XkygO +     k'
                                    +
                                         k+10                                  (6)



Equations (4) and (5) give the predicted (ln) earnings of the average member

of cohort k in 1970 and 1980,
                                respectively. Equation (6) gives the predicted
(in) earnings in 1980 for the cohort who arrived 10 years after cohort k.

Note that, by definition, as of 1970 cohort k has been in the U.S., say, j

years.    As of 1980, cohort k+10 has also been in the U.S. j       years.   Thus the
comparison of these two cohorts across censuses holds constant the number of

years since immigration.

      Using the definitions in (4)-(6), the 1980 regression predicts that over

10 years, the cross-section growth for cohort k (net of aging) is given by:6



                 80k - 80k+lo              -
                                                k+10                          (fl



      The cross-section growth given by (7) can be rewritten a:



                                                   +
           80,k 8O,k+1O =      8o,k;7o,k                                      (8)


Equation (8) decomposes the cross-section growth into two parts. The first ters
in   (8) gives the earnings growth experienced by cohort k over the decade, and
                                     - 10—




will be called the "within-cohort" growth. The second term in (8) estimates the

difference in earnings which occurred over the decade for individuals with a

given number of years since immigration. Thus it compares different cohorts

at the same point of their U.S. life cycle and will be called the "across-cohort"

earnings growth. If, for example, the quality of cohorts is declining over time,

the earnings of immigrants who have been in the U.S. j years will decline across

censuses. Thus the second term in (8) is positive, upwardly biasing the cross-

section measure of earnings growth. Equation (8), therefore, illustrates a very

useful result: the comparison of immigrant cross-sections over time can be used

to infer the extent to which the underlying quality of immigrant cohorts is

changing.

     It is important to note that, although as equation (8) shows, the cross-

section growth is biased by the existence of quality differentials across

cohorts, the within-cohort growth can also be biased by the effect of secular

changes in aggregate labor market conditions. For example, if economic con-

ditions worsened between 1970 and 1980, the within-cohort growth in (8) will

be biased downwards, and the decomposition in (8) will exaggerate the extent

of quality differences across cohorts. One possible solution to this problem

is simply to analyze the behavior of immigrant earnings relative to a base of

native-born workers. Suppose the wage structures for native-born workers are

given by:



            mw70,n      Xô70 +c n,                                   (9)

            ln W80n =          +                                     (10)
                        Xo80



where the subscript "n" indicates native-born status. Define the earnings a

native-born worker statistically similar to the average immigrant from cohort k

would earn by:
                                            —11—




                 70,n XkÔ7O +                                                    (ii)
                 80,n =     XkÔgO
                                    +
                                        .                                        (12)


Note that the cross-section growth in the relative earnings of immigrant cohort

k is given by:




                                        8O,k+1080,n           k+1O              (13)



Thus the estimate of cross-section growth is unaffected by the introduction of

the native-born into the analysis.8 Equation (13) can be decomposed into:



             -          =                     -
                 k+1O       8O,k8O,n
                            + E(Y70,kY70,n)                                     (14)
                                                   80,k+1080,)L

The first bracketed term in (14) gives the difference in the relative earnings

of cohort k between 1980 and 1970. This within-cohort effect measures the rate

at which the earnings profiles of the immigrant-born and the native-born are

converging (or diverging). The second bracketed term        in   (14), as   before,    gives
the across-cohort effect. It estimates the difference in the relative earnings

of immigrants who are at the same position in their U.S. life cycle between 1970

and 1980. If this difference is positive, the across-cohort growth indicates

that, relative to the native-born base, the quality of immigrants is falling

over time, upwardly biasing the cross-section growth in immigrant earnings.

     Finally, it should be noted that the statistical framework leading to

equations (8) and (14) is     rather    general. By allowing the socioeconomic vector
X to have a different effect between the native-born and the foreign-born, and

across different time periods, the biases introduced by invalid restrictions
                                   —12-



on the coefficients are avoided. It turns out that in the census data analyzed

below, the large sample sizes used led to the rejection of equality constraints

on these coefficients for practically all immigrant and native groups.

III. The Earnings of Immigrants

     The data used in the analysis are drawn from the 1970 1/100 Public Use

Sample from the U.S. Census (5 percent SMSA and County Group Sample), and the

1980 A Sample from the U.S. Census (a 5 percent random sample of the population).

Due to the very large sample sizes in these data sets, random samples were

drawn for some of the larger groups (e.g., white natives in both 1970 and

1980, black natives in 1980, etc.).9

     The analysis is restricted to male persons aged 18-54 in 1970 and 28—64

in 1980. The four sample selection rules used in both Censuses are:      (1) the

individual is not self-employed or working without pay; (2) the individual is

not in the Armed Forces (as of the Census week); (3) the individual does not

reside in group quarters; and (4) the individual's record can be used to

calculate the 1969 or 1979 wage rate.'° Since previous research has shown

that major differences in economic status exist within the male immigrant (and

native) labor force, the study will be conducted separately for each of the

six major immigrant groups: Ilexican (18.0 percent of the male immigrant

population as of 1980), Cuban (5.3 percent), other Hispanic (9.7 percent),

Asian (15.9 percent), white (45.4 percent), and black (5.7 percent), where the

"white" and "black" immigrant samples contain the observations which are

neither Hispanic nor Asian.11 Table 1 presents the means of basic economic

characteristics for the cohorts in each of the immigrant samples, and for

their native-born male counterparts. The table presents the mean (ln) wage

rate (WAGE), the mean completed years of schooling (EDUC), the average age of

the group, as well as the number of observations in the sample (N). Throughout

the paper the 1979 wage rate has been deflated to 1969 levels by using the

Consumer Price Index. Table 1 illustrates the well known facts that major

differences in these socioeconomic characteristics exist both between native

and immigrant groups, as well as within each of these populations across

national groups.

     The empirical analysis reported throughout the paper is based on the

estimates of equations (2), (3), (9), and (10): the two immigrant cross-

sections and the two native-born cross-sections. To allow the testing of co-

efficients across these equations, the four equations were estImated jointly.

The Appendix to this paper presents the complete set of regressions used in

the analysis: Table Al provides a description of the variables used in the

regression; Table A2 presents the estimated regressions; and Table A3 pre-

sents the means of the socioeconomic characteristics used in the decomposition

of cross—section effects into its within— and across-cohort components. The

vector of socioeconomic characteristics, X, in the Cross-section regressions

includes the variables: years of completed schooling; years of labor market

experience (defined by Age-Schooling-6); years of labor market experience squared;

whether or not health limits work; whether or not married, spouse present; and

whether or not the individual resides in an SMSA.12 The dependent variable is
                                   13
the 1969 or 1979 (ln) wage rate.

     In this section the discussion will focus on the estimates of the immigrant

cross-sections (2) and (3). To provide comparability between these results and

the literature, Table 2 presents the coefficients of the years-since-migration

variable obtained from the 1980 cross-section for each of the six national

groups. The omitted dummy variable in the table is D75 (arrivals in 1975-79).,

so that all coefficients in Table 2 measure wage differentials between earlier

immigrant cohorts and their most recent counterparts. The results in Table 2
                                    -14-



 tend to mimic those presented in the literature:
                                                    with relatively minor excep-
 tions, the earnings of immigrants who have been in the U.S. many years are

 significantly higher than the earnings of recent arrivals. For example, Asian

 immigrants who arrived in the early 1970's report about 17 percent higher earn-

ings than the most recent Asian arrivals in the 1980 Census.    This differential
increases to over 30 percent for the Asian immigrants who arrived in the early

1960's, and to over 40 percent for the Asians who immigrated prior to 1950.

Similar qualitative conclusions can be drawn for practically all national groups.

Thus the 1980 cross-section regressions in the
                                                 immigrant samples, if anything,
indicate the robustness of the years-since-migration variable in cross-section

regressions.

     The analysis in the previous section, as summarized by equation (8), shows

how the growth implicit in the cross-section estimates of Table 2 can be de-

composed into a within-cohort growth and an across—cohort growth. This decom-

position is carried out in Table 3 for each of three cohorts which can be matched

exactly in the 1970 and 1980 Census files: arrivals in
                                                         1965—1969, 1960-1964, and
1950— 1959.14

     Perhaps the best way to understand Table 3 is to illustrate its derivation

through an example. Consider the group of white immigrants who arrived in the

U.S. during the 1965-1969 period. As Table 2 shows, these individuals earn

roughly 7.0 percent more than the most recent arrivals (i.e., white men who

immigrated in 1975-1979). Thus the cross-section analysis predicts that over

a 10-year period the 1965-69 immigrants will have increased their earnings by

7.0 percent. However, if we compare the earnings of this cohort in 1970 and

1980, as measured by the first term in (8), the cohort actually experienced

an insignificant increase in earnings of about .6 percent. The difference

between the cross-section growth and the within cohort growth is 6.4 percent.
                                    —15—



 This differential indicates that recently arrived immigrants in 1970 had 6.4

 percent higher earnings than recently arrived immigrants in 1980, and may be

 indicative of a drop in quality across immigrant cohorts. Thus the decompo-

 sition of the cross-section growth predicted for this immigrant cohort indicates

that, in fact, the cohort experienced no earnings growth over the decade, and

that the entire cross-section growth is
                                           explained by earnings differences across
immigrant cohorts.

     The remaining rows of Table 3 replicate this analysis for all other cohorts

in the six immigrant groups. The major finding obtained from these results is

that there are significant differences in the within-cohort growth experienced

by immigrants both within a national group, and across national groups. The

latter fact is illustrated by the result that within-cohort growth is over-

whelmingly negative for white and black immigrants, but is
                                                             overwhelmingly
positive for Asian, Mexican, and Cuban immigrants. Thus there
                                                                 are strong racial!
ethnic differences in the rate at which the earnings of immigrant cohorts actually

increased over the 1970-1980 period. Note also that the across-cohort growth is

positive in 16 out of 18 cases, and has a t-ratio exceeding 1.5 in 12 out of 18

cases. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the quality of

immigrants has declined over succeeding immigrant cohorts. It is, in fact,

interesting to note that the only important negative (but insignificant)

across-cohort effect, indicating that the quality of immigrants increased

over time, is obtained in the row for Cuban immigrants who arrived in 1950-1959.

The across-cohort effect in this case measures how these arrivals compare with

the Cubans who arrived in 1960-1969. The increase in
                                                        quality suggested by Table 3
is consistent with the hypothesis that the 1959 political upheaval in Cuba led to

the outflow of "better" Cuban immigrants in the first few years of the post-

revolution period.

IV.   The Relative Earnings of Immigrants

      As was pointed out earlier, the decomposition of the cross-section growth

in Table 3 into the within-cohort and across-cohort components is itself not

free of bias. If labor market conditions worsened sufficiently between 1969

and 1979, the within-cohort growth of immigrants will be depressed by the fall

in the aggregate wage level, and the across-cohort quality change will be

exaggerated. It is important to note, however, that the evidence in Table 3

suggests that this cannot be the only reason for the difference between cross-

section and within-cohort effects. In particular, if the fall in aggregate

wage levels was neutral across immigrant cohorts and national groups, the

results in Table 3 indicate that since some immigrant national groups and/or

some cohorts within each group did fare quite well during the 1970-1980

period, the relative differences in the results across the 18 cohorts do

measure the variance in the within-cohort growth and the secular quality

change among immigrant cohorts.

      The analysis in Section II suggested that a simple way of netting out the

influence of the fall in aggregate demand from the estimates was to decompose

the cross-section growth in immigrant earnings relative to the native-born base.

One of the most remarkable findings of the cross-section literature on the real-

tive earnings of immigrants is the existence of an overtaking age, at which point

immigrants' earnings begin to surpass the earnings of statistically similar

native-born workers. This overtaking point has been dated at between 10-15

years after immigration for some immigrant groups.

      Before proceeding to the decomposition of the relative change in immigrant

earnings over the 1970-1980 period, it is useful to provide a set of results

comparable to those found in the literature. Table 4 presents the difference

between the 1980 (ln) earnings of statistically similar immigrants and native-

born workers, evaluated at the mean level of the socioeconomic characteristics
                                                —i7..




 of the immigrant cohort. 15             It should be noted that the choice of the reference
 group -     the   native-born -    is   somewhat arbitrary since the immigrants can either

 be compared to the white native-born population or to the immigrants' nationality

 counterparts in the native-born population (i,e. Mexican immigrants would be

 compared to Mexican/American native-born men, black immigrants to black native-

born men, etc.). Both of these strategies were pursued and since the possibility

of overtaking the white native-born population was quite low for most of the

immigrant groups, the analysis is presented using the latter alternative.

That is, each immigrant group is compared to its native-born counterpart.16

        The results in Table 4 are consistent with
                                                            the findings reported in the
literature: the earnings of white immigrants overtake the earnings of statis-

tically comparable white native-born workers within 10—15 years after immigra-
        17
tion.
             All other immigrant groups, however, have slower rates of convergence,

even though the other groups are not being compared to the white native-born

base.

        Equation (14) presents the methodology by          which the cross-section rates of
convergence can be decomposed into withincchort and across-cohort changes in

relative     earnings.
                         18     .              ..             .
                              This decomposition is given in Table 5.      Lonsider, for
example, the results for Mexican immigrants who arrived in
                                                                       1965-1969. According
to the cross-secUon, relative to the Mexicn rativc'born, the wage of these

immigrants increases about 32 percent within the first 10 years after immigration.

Note, however, that the cohort actually experienced an increase of only 18.8 per-

cent in their relative earnings during their first decade in the U.S. The differ-

ence between these two growth rates, about 13.2 percent, is the across-cohort

growth and indicates that recent Mexican immigrants in 1970 did 13.2 percent

better (relative to Mexican natives) than rece.rt Mexican immigrants in 1980.

Thus relative to the Mexican native-born population, the result in Table 5

indicates that the relative quality of Mexican immigrants may have declined

over time.
                                   -18-



     An additional implication of this result is that the cross-section growth

underestimates the number of years that it will take the recent Mexican immi-

grants to overtake their statistically similar native-born counterparts. Since

the earnings profiles of the Mexican native and foreign-born men are converging

at relatively slow rates, the overtaking point is delayed considerably.

     The remaining rows of Table 5 indicate that practically all the immigrant

cohorts being analyzed experienced strong relative earnings growth over a 10-

year period according to the cross-section results. The within-cohort analysis,

however, shows that improvements in the relative earnings of immigrants is

concentrated within specific race/ethnic groups. For example, the groups of

white, Asian, and Mexican immigrants generally exhibit strong rates of conver-

gence between immigrant and native-born earnings profiles. On the other hand,

the results for blacks and Cubans show either little change in the relative

earnings of immigrants or a deterioration in their relative earnings over the

1970-1980 decade.

     The results in Table 5 also show that the rate of growth in relative

immigrant earnings given by the cross-section analysis often exceeds the actual

rate of growth experienced by the immigrant cohort. The across-cohort growth

is positive and has a t-statistic exceeding 1.5 in 10 of the 18 cohorts under

analysis. These positive across-cohort effects state that, for the same number

of years in the U.S., immigrants in earlier cohorts do better (relative to

natives) than immigrants in more recent cohorts. Thus the results in Table 5

are again consistent with the hypothesis that the quality of immigrant cohorts

has been falling over time for many immigrant groups.

     It can, of course, be argued that the across-cohort effects are only

capturing the fall in demand for immigrant labor that presumably occurred

during the 1970s. This argument, however, is not sufficient to explain the

results in Table 5 since the variation in across-cohort effects across and
                                   —19—




within immigrant groups is quite large. For example, why are the across-

cohort changes larger for black and Cuban immigrants than they are for white

and Asian immigrants? Further, why are the across-cohort effects so different

within specific groups? In the white sample, for instance, two of the across-

cohort effects are negative (and insignificant), while one is significantly

positive and numerically large. The demand shift hypothesis cannot explain

these variations unless it is also argued that demand varied
                                                               systematically
not only across national groups, but also within national groups according to

the years-since-migration. Finally, the demand shift hypothesis must also

assume that the demand for immigrant labor declined relative to the demand

for native-born labor. The evidence on any of these assumptions is, at

present, nonexistent.

     The results in Tables 3 and 5, therefore, raise important doubts about

the validity of the inference drawn from cross-section studies that immigrants

"assimilate" rapidly in the U.S. labor market. It is important to note that

these effects, by focusing solely on the years-since-migration variable, are

measuring the impact of assimilation net of aging effects. The effect of

aging on the relative earnings of immigrants would not be very important if

the age coefficients (more precisely, the coefficients of potential labor

market experience) were roughly similar in the native-born and foreign-born

earnings functions. The regressions in Appendix Table A2, however, suggest

that this is not the case. Thus it is worthwhile to conclude the analysis

by presenting estimates of the change in the relative wage of immigrants over

a 10 year period due solely to the fact that the men are 10 years older in

1980 than in 1970.

    Using the 1980 cross-section regression in equation (3), the earnings

of immigrants in a particular cohort with T   years of potential labor market
experience can be defined by:
                                                     -20-



                   = ZO + p.T + X.T2             ,                       (15)


where Z is the vector of all the socioeconomic characteristics except for       4



experience and experience squared, and the subscript "i" indicates that the

parameters are drawn from the cross-section regression estimated in the im-

migrant sample. The predicted earnings for an immigrant who is 10 years

younger, holding all other factors constant, is given by:



                         =         + p(T-l0)      +   X.(T-lo)2.         (16)




Thus the change in immigrant earnings due solely to the aging of the immigrant

over the decade is:



               =   lop.      + A. (20T-l00).
                                                                         (17)



     Using the 1980 cross-section estimated in the sample of the native-born

leads, of course, to a similar expression for the aging effect experienced by

statistically similar native—born men:



               =   lop       + A    (20T-100).                           (18)




Hence the change in the relative earnings of immigrants due purely to aging

is given by:



                   =   lO(p.-p)       +.   (A.-A)(20T-loo).              (19)




Equation (19) illustrates the obvious fact that the relative earnings of

immigrants are affected by aging only if the coefficients of the age vari-

ables differ between the immigrant and native-born earnings functions.
                                     -21-




     Table 6 presents the estimated aging effects, as defined by equation (19),

for each ofthe 18 cohorts under analysis. The obvious implication of these

results is that for four of the six immigrant groups, pure aging effects lead

to a deterioration of the relative earnings of immigrants over time. This

deterioration is not only statistically significant but is also numerically

important. For example, the fact that the immigrant men are 10 years older

in 1980 than in 1970 lowers the relative earnings of Asians by 15-17 percent,

lowers the relative earnings of Mexicans by 7.5 percent, lowers the relative

earnings of Cubans by 10-12 percent, and lowers the relative earnings of

other Hispanics by 10-11 percent. If these quantities are added to the within-

cohort assimilation effects presented in Table 5, it quickly becomes apparent

that, in fact, the relative earnings of immigrants, as a result of relatively

low assimilation rates and detrimental aging effects, simply did not increase

very much in the 1970-1980 decade.

     The other two immigrant groups -   whites   and blacks - have aging effects

which are positive, but generally insignificant. Only one of the six aging

effects estimated for these two groups has a t-ratio exceeding 1.5. Moreover,

in the case of whites the impact of aging on the relative earnings of immigrants

is numerically trivial. Thus Table 6 reveals that the pure impact of aging

seldom works in favor of the immigrants and, in fact, often works to their

detriment.



V.   Summary

     This paper has conducted a reexamination of the empirical basis for two

"facts" concerning immigrant wage growth which seem to be found in most cross-

section empirical studies of the problem: (1) the earnings of immigrants grow

rapidly as they assimilate into the United States; and (2) this rapid growth

also leads to immigrants overtaking the earnings of the native-born within 10-15

years after arrival.
                                    —22-




     The study in this paper stresses the differences between cross-section and

cohort analyses of earnings determination. In particular, cross-section studies

of immigrant earnings growth confound the true assimilation impact with across-

cohort changes in immigrant quality. The analysis of 18 specific immigrant cohorts

in the 1970 and 1980 Public Use Samples of the U.S. Census led to three major

results:

     1.    The earnings of a cohort of immigrants grow at a much slower rate than

that predicted by cross-section studies. Over the 1970-1980 decade, the cross-

section regression overestimated the true rate of growth experienced by- immigrants

by as much as 20 percentage points in some immigrant cohorts.

     2.    The earnings growth of immigrant cohorts relative to the native-born

are again greatly overestimated by cross-section analysis. The empirical study

of specific immigrant cohorts shows that the relative earnings of many of these

cohorts experienced little change, or even a slight decline, over the 1970-1980

period even though the cross-section regression predicts rapid growth in the

relative earnings of immigrants.

     3.    These results imply that the across-cohort change in immigrant earnings

is quite significant, with earlier cohorts earning more at every point of their

U.S. labor market career than more recent cohorts. Although part of this across-

cohort result may be due to a hypothesized fall in demand for immigrant labor,

the results are also consistent with the hypothesis that the quality of immigrant

cohorts has experienced a secular decline.

     The analysis in this paper, therefore, raises serious questions about the

economic interpretation of immigrant behavior in the labor market and about the

policy question of what is the contribution of immigrants to the United States.

The main lesson of this paper, however, is that cross-section studies of immigrant

earnings provide few, and misleading, insights into the process of how immigrants

assimilate in the labor market. More generally, the results of the cohort analysis
                                   -23-




make it clear that an understanding of the immigrant experience in the U.S. cannot

be obtained in a vacuum free of an institutional framework. The immigration

experience cannot be understood without the introduction into the model of the

parameters of admission policies, the recurring political and economic upheavals

in sending countries, and the shifts in labor demand for native- and foreign-born

labor. The study of immigrant earnings, within this institutional framework,

will surely lead to a much deeper understanding of the immigration experience.

     *Professor of Economics, University of California, Santa Barbara, and

Research Associate, National Bureau of Economic Research. I am grateful to

Barry Chiswick, Daniel Hamermesh, Jacob Mincer, Marta Tienda, and Robert Topel

for comments made on a previous draft of this paper, and to Bill Gould for

providing me with a test version of STATA. This research was supported by

grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Department of Health and Human

Services. Of course, I alone am responsible for the contents of this paper.



     1This argument can also be made for the so-called "non-economic's immigrants

(e.g., political refugees); see Borjas (1982).



     2Although the cohort analysis of earnings conducted in this paper is not

available in the literature, a few previous studies have addressed issues

related to those discussed below. For example, Chiswick (1984) has analyzed

the earnings growth of the small sample of immigrants available in the Mature

Men National Longitudinal Survey. Similarly, both Chiswick (1980, Chapter 10)

and DeFreitas (1981) have used the 1965 and 1970 occupation variables available

in the 1970 Census to study the extent of occupational mobility in immigrant

samples. The results of these studies, however, do not provide a consensus

on whether or not longitudinal data leads to different results than cross-

section data. In the studies of occupational mobility, for example, Chiswick

finds relatively higher rates of.upward mobility as immigrants assimilate in

the labor market, while DeFreitas, in his analysis of black men, finds either

no difference between the native-born and the foreign-born or slower rates of

upward mobility for the foreign-born. In addition, the study of the long-

itudinal National Chicano Survey by Snipp and Tienda (1984) finds no evidence

that Mexican immigrants experience relatively more upward occupational mobility

than native-born Mexican/Americans.

     31n some studies, t. is defined as a vector of variables indicating the

time period in which the immigrant arrived rather than a Continuous variable

measuring years since migration. The simpler specification is used in the

discussion to focus attention on the substantive problems introduced by cross-

section data.




        simple calculation of the magnitude of the bias could, in principle,

be based on the fact that some immigrants (e.g., political refugees) have no

possibility for return migration, while other immigrants (e.g., Mexicans)

face low return costs due to geographic circumstances. This kind of solution,

however, would have to take into account the differences in observable (and

unobservable) quality indeces among the national groups.



     50f course, there are many reasons why the cohorts in the 1970 and 1980

Census data may not be perfectly matched. For instance, as noted earlier,

the presence of emigration will lead to secular trends in the size (and

quality) of a specific immigrant cohort. Similarly, institutional changes

in the Census enumeration procedures may lead to different counts of immigrants

(and native-born persons) in particular cohorts across Censuses. Finally,

there may be age (or cohort) related diff€rences in labor supply, self-

employment propensities, and mortality rates which generate additional

differences in the cohort samples included in the regressions over time.

Note, however, that all these problems will impart biases on both cross-

section and cohort analyses. Hence the cohort study presented below simply

nets out one of the many sources of bias, that due to violations of the

assumption of stationarity in the immigrant human capital stock at the time of entry.
                                   -32-




     6Equation (7) defines the cross—section growth exactly for all but one

of the cohorts in the data. In particular, consider the cohort which arrived

in 1950-1959. Since the 1960 cohorts are partitioned into 2 groups, the defi-

nition for cross-section growth used for this sample is given by:



                 -
                     8O,6O
                             _50 - 6065
                                      2




so that a simple average is used to pooi the two coefficients from the 1960's.



     7me decomposition of the cross-section growth into its components can

also be made by pooling the 1970 and 1980 observations for a specific cohort,

and including a dummy variable in the earnings function indicating the census

from which the observation is drawn. It is easy to show that this methodology

is identical to that given by equation (8) as long as the y coefficient vector

is allowed to vary across censuses but is fixed for all cohorts within a

census.




     80f course, this result follows directly from the fact that all the pre-

dicted earnings terms are evaluated at a given level of socioeconomic char-

acteristics, Xk, so that the decompositions in this section are net of any

pure aging effects. The empirical analysis below will present separate

estimates of the earnings differentials created by the aging process.



     9The sampling fractions for 1970 are: white native-born (.001 of the popu-

lation), all other groups (.01). The 1980 sampling fractions are: black natives

(.00245), black immigrants (.01651), Mexican natives (.01652), Mexican immigrants

(.01638), white natives (.00042), white immigrants (.00249), all other groups

(.05).

     '0As was noted earlier there are many reasons why in actual Census data

the 1970 and 1980 cohorts of immigrant (and native-born) men are not exactly

matched. In fact, the ratio of the number of immigrants in the 1980 sample

to that of the 1970 sample is 1.12. The value of the same ratio for native-

born men is 1.07. Thus the restriction of the sample to salaried men in

the labor force -    along with the age restrictions imposed on the two samples -
leads to an increase in sample size over the decade. The increase in
                                                                     sample
size, however, is relatively neutral for immigrants and native-born men since

in the 1970 data 4.4 percent of the sample is foreign-born, while the same

statistic in the 1980 data is 4.6 percent.



     UTwo points should be made about this ethnic/racial breakdown. First,

the Asian sample aggregates over a wide variety of countries and cultures;

hence the results for the Asian sample should be interpreted cautiously.

Second, the Hispanic samples do not include the group of Puerto Rican men

since Puerto Ricans born in Puerto Rico are not asked the year they migrated

to the U.S. by the Census,



     12Since most immigrants reside within an SMSA, the analysis was also con-

ducted on the subsample of metropolitan residents, This estimation led to only

minor changes in the results.



     13
          The calculation of the 1969 wage rate uses the weekly hours worked

reported for the Census week, while the estimated 1979 wage rate uses the

usual hours worked per week in 1979.



     '4The cohort arriving prior to 1950 can also be matched in the two census

data files. The open—ended lower interval, however, leads to the aggregation of

immigrants from many different cohorts, and thus confuses the basic issues.
                                    -34-




     '5More precisely, using the notation in Section II, the statistics

presented in Table 4 are given by 8O,k8O,n



          has been suggested that a more relevant base group would be the

sample of native-born young men. Since immigrants are new entrants to the

labor market, their experiences are likely to resemble those encountered by

native-born youths. This, comparison, however, ignores the fact that, for

example, the 1960-1964 cohort of white immigrants has been in the U.S. for

17 years and is, onthe average, 43.5 years old. Thus the comparison of this

group with teenage workers would be quite misleading.



     17An important implication of the hypothesis that there has been a secular

decline in the quality of immigrants is that overtaking will occur at a later

point in the life cycle in the 1980 Census than in the 1970 Census. The result

in Table 4 that white immigrants in 1980 overtake the native-born after 10-15

years seems to contradict this implication since Chiswick (1978) dates over-

taking at the same point using the 1970 Census. However, the definitions of

ttwhiteet men vary significantly across the two studies; in this paper a dis-

tinction is made between Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic whites. In fact,

given that the samples are defined identically in the two Censuses the re-

suits do show that overtaking occurs at a later point in the 1980 Census.

For example, a regression estimated in the 1970 Census using a pooled sample

of white native and immigrant men yields:


        w = Xy - .0468D65 + .0626D60 + .0603D50 + .0479D40, R2    .205,
                 (—1.18)    (1.38)     (2.11)     (1.49)

where the omitted dummy variable indicates native-born status. This 1970

regression implies that among white men overtaking occurs within 5-10 ye&rs
                                   -35-




after arrival in the U.S., while the 1980 results in Table 4 reveal that

overtaking (in the same racial/ethnic sample) occurs within 1015 year

after immigration. Thus over a 10 year period the overtaking age increased

by 5 years, a movement consistent with the hypothesis that the quality of

white immigrants has declined over time.



     18The astute readerwil]. realize that the cross-section rates of con-

vergence implicit in Table 4 are not identical to those given by equation (13).

The reason is that in Table 4 the comparison between each immigrant cohort

and the native-born population is calculated at the mean level of X for each

immigrant cohort, whereas the conceptually correct cross-section growth in

equation (13) holds constant the values of the socioeconomic characteristics

across cohorts. The reader can verify that the differences between the two

experiments are minimal.
