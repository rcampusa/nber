                                         ABSTRACT




      This paper provides the foundations of a general theory of information
 and the capital market.
       We show that in a pure gambling market, even with asymmetric information,
 there cannot exist an equilibrium with trade with rational individuals.
 We argue that although a pure exchange stock market is not a pure gambling
 market, most of the trade on the stock market arises from irrationality
 on the part of some investors and the rational
                                                response on the part of
 other investors to take advantage of that
                                              irrationality.
       We show that   the private returns to information acquisition and
dissemination   differ markedly from social returns and     as   a result the
market equilibrium is not a (constrained) Pareto optimum. Moreover, we

show how firms' actions, e.g. the fraction of shares retained by the

original entrepreneurs, the debt equity ratio, and       the   level of investment,
may   convey information about firm   characteristics.   This in turn affects
the behavior of firms. As a result,  the original owners of firms will be
incompletely diversified, firms will not take actions which maximize
their stock market value, and, in particular, they may behave in a risk
averse maimer, paying attention to own risk (which traditional theory
suggests that the only risk firms should care about is the correlation
with the market).

I. Introduction
    Is the stock market just a gambling casino? Are too many
resources being spent on obtaining information by individuals who
are attempting to beat the market? Is it in fact possible to beat
the market?
    The answer to these questions is important for an evaluation
of the role of the stock market in our economy. In neoclassical
economic theory, the stock market provides a crucial link between
consumers and producers. In theory, the stock market is supposed
to provide the signals for firms to make the correbt investment

decisions. If, at the extreme, individuals had no "information"
about the relative probabilities of different events and the relative
merits of different investment opportunities, prices would simply

be random, and the stock market would be unable to perform its role
in allocating investment.

    There are two contrasting views of information in the stock
market: one that if the market worked well, so prices reflected
values, there would be no incentive to obtain information and

therefore, there cannot exist an i.nformed market equilibrium. Even
if prices did not reflect true values,to the extent that insiders'
gains are at the expense of outsiders, rational outsiders will

refuse to "play"; and if that happens, the insiders have no one
from whom they can make money.
      In contrast, Hirschleifer has argued that in a pure exchange
market, there are strong incentives for information acquisition;
for any individual who finds out information about which state of

nature is about to occur, e.g. which securities are going to rise

in price and which are going to fall, will be able to make a profit
out of the capital gain.

     A simple example along the lines of that employed •by Hirschleifer
might be instructive. Let there be two factories. If state 1
occurs factory 1 has an output of Q, factory 2 an output of -IQ;
if   state 2 occurs, factory 1 has an output of Q, factory 2 an
outputThf 0. Initially, with individuals assuming the two states

equally probable if they choose a portfolio to maximize their expected
utility then the relative price of the two factories will be unity.

If an individual knows that state 1 will occur, he will demand

shares of factory 1 and sell short shares of factory 2 so long as

the relative price of factory 1 shares is less than 2. When it
then becomes publicly known that state 1 will occur, the price
of the shares of firm 1 will rise, those of firm 2 will fall,
and the informed speculator will thus make a large profit.

     Indeed, Hirschleifer argues that because the gains from

information acquisition are purely redistributive, any information
acquisition has no social value: some gain at the expense of others.
     These two hypotheses appear to be in direct contradiction of one
another: the one suggesting that even when there is a social return to in
vesting in information,. there may be no investment in information, the othe
                                                                3.



suggesting that even when there is no social return to investing in infor-
mation, there will be some investment. We argue that both positions are
wrong--the latter because it implicitly assumes irrationality and/or
noncompetitive behavior, the former because it fails to recognize
the role of the seller of securities in providing information,

because it fails to take account of the presence of "noise" which

results in prices imperfectly conveying information from the
informed to the uninformed,1 and because it fails to note that, even
with free entry into the "information" industry, equilibrium may be

characterized by partial monopolies, in which particular individuals

may have a monopoly of particular pieces of inforrnation
    Both views suffer from failure to identify fully the nature of
the social and private gains to information.

    It-is clear that central to an understanding of the functioning
of capital market is an analysis of

    (a) the incentives, within a market economy,for individuals
         to acquire information;
    (b) the extent to which market prices reflect the information
         of informed individuals; and
    (c) the role that market prices play in determining the
         behavior of managers of firms.
    We argue that within a competitive economy there are only
limited incentives to acquire information which is of general value;


    1This aspect of the argument is developed more fully in
subsequent work by Grossman and Stiglitz (1976, l98) and
Grossman (1977).

    Tite fact that market prices/reflect the true value of firms has
two important consequences:

    Owner-managers who know that their firms are undervalued will

diversify imperfectly. Firms which they control will behave in a
risk averse manner, even though their output (profits) have a zero
correlation with the market, and even though the market values     -

                                              argue, pursue a
marketvalue maximizing policy but are npt, at the same time,
subjected to the threat of take-over.

    Secondly, good firms may attempt to convey to the market information
about their quality. Since direct statements (such as that their
prospects of returns are very good) have only limited credibility,
indirect screening devices may be employed. Since owner-managers
of good firms will be more willing to retain a larger proportion
of their own firms than are owner-managers of poor firing, the

fraction of shares owned by insiders ij serve as an effective
screening deviceJ In order to do this, however, owner-managers
of good firms have to retain a larger fraction of their own shares


    kin the more recent literature on imperfect information, this
is sometimes referred to as an example of a self-selection device;
and the fraction of shares owned is said to serve as a signal.
See Stiglitz (1982), Spence(1973) and Salop and Salop (1976).

 than they otherwise would, so that even in situations
                                                       where the
 market prices do accurately reflect the returns, the firm acts in
 a risk averse manner. There are other situations; however, where
 the only equilibrium is one in which the market does not differentiate
 between ttgood and "bad" firms in order for the fraction of shares
 retained by the owner-manager not to convey information about

 quality, the poor quality firms have to imitate the good firms, i.e.
 they too have to retain significant fractions of their shares.
      Other policies, such as the debt-equity ratio and dividend
 policy may also serve as screening devices.     We do not pursue the
 implications of our analysis for these other important aspects of
 financial policy here.1

II.    Can There Be an Informed Securities Market?

      In this section, we consider in somewhat more detail the
paradox discussed in the introduction; alternative
                                                      resolutions of
the paradox are presented, of which only one will be pursued in
subsequent sections of the paper.
      We limit Ourselves to a
                                pure exchange economy. Individuals are
endowed with ownership claims on different "factories." The output
of the factories is distributed at the end of the period to different

individuals in proportion to their ownership claims at the time.


    1See, for instance, Leland and Pyle (1977), Ross (1977),
(198Z and Stiglitz and Weiss (1980, 1981)                    Stiglitz
                                                                6.



    Between the beginning of the period and the end of the period there

    are, say, T trading periods, during which individuals can trade
    their ownership claims with one another.   There is little loss of
    generality in assuming only two trading periods and it simplifies
    the discussion considerably. In.the intervals between the beginning
    of the period and the trading points, individuals can expend resources

    to acquire information about the output of the different factories,

    or about the probabilities of different states of nature.
         We assume everyone has the same tastes and the same initial

endowments (i.e. their ownership shares in the different firms are
identical). Assume that the output in the different states of
nature of each of the firms is knowJ but the relative prObabilities
of the.different states are unknown. Assume, again for simplicity,

that there are only two states of nature.      Initially, all individuals
assume the two states equally likely. Consider the following possible
scenarios:

(1) No one does research. Then at the first trading date, the
relative price of the different factories will reflect the individual's
priors that the two states of nature are equally likely. Since all
individuals have the same priors, the same tastes, and the same

endowments, no trade will actually take place. The prices established
on the market at the two trading dates are identical.

(   2)   One person does research. Could the situation described above
be an equilibrium? Hirschleifer argues that it is not. For an


    1lndeed conventionally, we define a state of nature as a
complete specification of all the outcomes of the different firms.
                                                                   7.


 individual can come along, invest some resources In obtaining informa-

 tion about which state of nature will occur. Assume he obtains the
 information before the first trading point. He then knows that the

market value of some firms is too high, some too low. He sells

short the overpriced firms and buys the underpriced firms with the

proceeds. In the interval between the first and second trading
period he makes the information public; this raises the price of

the underpriced firms and lowers that of the overpriced firms,

enabling our investor-in_information to make a capital gain on both
parts of the transaction and to pay for the cost of research.

Thus, the expenditure on information turns out to be profitable.
Since the amount available for consurttion is unchanged by the

expenditure on information, Hirschleifer has termed this expenditure
on information socially wasteful. One     person   is made better off,
at the expense of others who are worse off, and because it requires

resources to obtain information the gains of the former are smaller
than the losses to the latter.

       There are three objections to this argument:

        The uninformed individuals in this argument are particularly
       a)

naive. At the minimum, they should discover that, were they to have
held on to their original portfolios, they would have done b!tter
than   to have engaged in speculative activity.    They should have, in
other words, pursued what I call later, a non-speculative strategy.

Their expected utility from pursuing such a strategy is higher

 than that from pursuing the naive
                                      policy assumed by hirschleifer__
 and it is equally unsophisticated.

     b) It might be argued, on the other hand, that the
                                                        uninformed
 individuals are more sophisticated
                                      than suggested just now; that
 they observe that the market price
                                    Conveys information__when the
 price of a security for a particular state is bid up, it is because
 the informed know that the state is going to occur. In
                                                        this
 particular case, the implication of this is that again there will
 be no trade, but whereas in
                             the previous case, they refused to trade,
 here they have a demand function for securities, but the
                                                          only market
 clearing price entails no trade.
     c) Finally, there is no reason to believe that only one
                                                                      -

 individual will do research. Indeed, consider what happens if
                                                                only
two individuals do research, and they both come up with the
                                                            same
result about which state of nature is to occur before the first

trading period. Assume that they behave
                                         competitively (rather than
collusively). Then they will bid against each other and drive
                                                               up
the price of the securities which otherwise would have been under-

valued, and drive down the price of the securities which otherwise
would have been overvalued.. Thus, when the next trading period

occurs, the prices will be the same as they were at the first
trading point, and neither individual makes any gains (or losses);
but they are both worse off than those who did no research, since
they have invested in resources to obtain information.

    Thus, Hirschleifer's argument for excessive expenditure on
information implicitly requires both irrationality on the part of
the uninformed and a monopoly on the part of the informed. It is
                                                               9.



hardly a model of a rational competitive securities rnarket)

     This leaves open the question of the possibility of a rational,
competitive, informed securities market. We shall argue that
 (i) A rational pure exchange market with trades cannot exist if

individuals have identical endowments, tastes, and information.
 (ii) Moreover,           if the level of information is endogenous,
a rational, jformed market cannot exist.


XIX. Pure Gambling Markets

    There are two central properties of what we shall refer to as
aure gambling markets. (i) The gains of one individual are completely
at the expense of some other individual, i.e. it is a pure exchange

market and (ii) the outcomes (events on which the bet is placed)
are uncorrelated with all participantsother sources of income.
The latter condition is what distinguishes qambljg markets from

inaarance markets. The reason that trade (gambling) occurs is that
individuals have different opinions about the probability distribution

of the outcomes. The prototype of a pure gambling market is a horse
race. One of the questions to which we shall turn later is whether
the stock market ought to be viewed as a pure gambling market.
    There is a widespread view that rational individuals who are

risk averse should not (or would not) gamble. This, it is believed,
would be true even if individuals could acquire information about


    11t is not an answer to this to suggest that it is unlikely that
two individuals will come up with exactly the same information at
exactly the same moment. For if one individual comes up always
first, then he is in effect a monopolist in information and the
market is not competitive; if different individuals       up with the
information first in different periods, then the individual is a
temporary monopolist- -the market is still not competitive in the
conventional sense. In either case, for Hirschleifer to be correct
requires that the uninformed also be irrational, in the sense to
be defined below.
                                                               10.



the various events. The fact that some information about the
relative merits of different horses can be acquired does not make
it any more rational to gamble on horses. Equilibrium in a pure
gambling market with rational risk averse individuals thus entails

no trades (no gambling) and no information. These contentions, if
true, clearly have profound implications for understanding the
nature of the stock market, j the stock market can be described
as a pure gambling market.

    In this section, we examine the nature of equilibrium in pure

gambling markets with rational, risk averse, individuals. Critical
to the analysis is an understanding of the concept of tionality.
The central question is, what is    reasonable for the individual
to know? What does he observe, and how does he make inferences on
the basis of these observations?

    Our concern here is with repeated markets, like horse races.
The reason that there is a widespread presumption that betting on
horse races is irrational is that there is enough experience with

gambling in such markets that rational "individuals should have
learned that they can't win." (This is not a completely persuasive

argument, because some individuals do win, and it is this observation
which keeps others in the market.) The
intuitive belief          that gambling is irrational is, however,
I think, correct. Our objective is to clarify the precise sense
in which this is so.

    In the subsequent discussion we shall explore several alternative

notions of rationality. We begin our analysis with a concept we
refer to as weak rationality. We shall say that an individual's
                                                                  11.



xectatione weakly rational if the expected value of his
aains are equal to his averaga ins.
        Note that rationality in this sense is much weaker than that

which usually goes under the rubric "rational expectations" where
it is the expectations on the whole distribution of returns that
conform to ex post realizations.
        We now show:

Proposition 1. _jJ individuals have weakly rational expectations.
and are risk averse, there will be no trading in a pure garling
market.

Proof. For simplicity, assume individuals' income apart from the
gamble is given. Let the gamble be defined as, follows: if a particular

even Eeoccurs, the individual receives 1; if it does not occur, he
pays p/l-p. The amount he bets is chosen to

(5.1)   max u(Y+B )11J + u(yJ -

where JI is the jth individual's estimate of the probability; hence

The expected gain is

Thus if betting occurs (1B1> o),

some individuals must have expectations of gains which are not
realized.

        On the other hand, the following converse of Proposition 1
can also be easily established:

    In this discussion        so far, we have said nothing either about the

consequences of differential information or about the incentives to

 obtain) information, that different individuals obtain different
 information, and these differences are what make      such markets
 function. We shall show that even when individuals have different

 information, provided they are rational in a particular sense to
 be explained below, there will be no trade in a pure gambling market.
     First, however, we examine a somewhat different notion of
rationality, in which there will be trades in the.pure gambling
market. We shall say that the market exhibits group
                                                         rational1
 if the average value of individuals' estimates of the probability
of the states is equal to the true
                                       probability. Assume, for instance,
that individuals are betting on the proportion of red balls in a very

large urn containing red and black balls. Each individual is
allowé3 to draw 100 balls from the urn. The proportion of red

balls in their sample provides an unbiased statistic on the proportion
of red balls in the urn. Thus the verage value of individuals'

estimates of the probability of red balls is equal to the true

probability. If individuals bet on the basis of their estimate,
and if the distribution of estimates is symmetric we can show
Proposition 3:     The market odds provide an estimate of   the   probabilities

gr for concentrated distributio. More generally, market odds
will not equal   the true probability, even with a large
population.
Proof:

    Let   11*   denote the true probability. Consider the demand
and supply of bets of individuals who over and underestimate it by

an amount x. By the assumption of a symmetric distribution, the
                                                                                                              "-
      number of such individuals is the same. Assume p =                                        11*   .     Consider
      first the case of 11* =                           1/2.    It is clear that E(-x) =                  -8(x)
      where 8(x) is the demand for bets of a person whose estimate of II
      is 1/2 x. For if

so again B(x) C -B(-x).
      For II*_..j     large and x large, the market odds may provide
either an under or overestirliatej

      Of course, in any market in which the market odds differ from
the true probability there is an incentive to obtain accurate

information concerning the true probability, provided such information
is not too expensive.

      Still, in the situation just described, with the market displaying

aransionalitv, it seems foolish for individuals not to realize
that others are betting on the basis of their sample information;

their iétting behavior ought to convey information, and the rational
individual ought to take this into account in forming his

expectations.
      We shall say that an individual is rational if the expected

return, conditional on whatever is observable to the individual,

is equal to the average realized return on an (arbitrarily) large

number of repetitions of the gamble. This concept differs from our
earlier notion of wsak rationality in that we require the individual
to form his expectations conditional on whatever is observable;


      1Iet u'(y) =e           .   Let   II   =   3/Il., x =    1/8. Then for

Hence p > 3. .

but like the concept of weak rationality, it entails a far less

stringent notion of rationality than that associated with conventional

rational expectations, since it requires only that the mean of the
distribution coincide with the mean of the true distribution.         Because,
in general, different individuals may observe different signals,
they will have different information and therefore different beliefs.

One might have thought that therefore, in this situation, there
could be trade on a gambling market. We shall now show that this
is not the case.

Proposition 1..      If all indj.iduals have rational expectations.
there can be no trade in a pure gambling market.
Proof. For simplicity, let us assume that we have two groups in
the population, one of which only observes the market odds of the

gamble-, the other of which observes something else, which is correlated
with the event on which the gamble is being made. The former
group we shall refer to as the uninformed, the latter as the
informed. Since the uninformed observe only the market odds, if
they trade it must be the case that (using (3.2))

                 E(ff'ip) p

where the superscript u indicates that it is the uninformed
individuals' expectations.

         The informed individuals form their expectations on some signal
£2
     ,   and possibly on p too. Clearly, their expected utility, if they

ignore the information £2, must be less than or equal to their

expected utility if they do not ignore their information
                                                                 17.



                        max E(U'IQ,p) > wax                        (3.13)
                                            E(U'Ip)
                        (B)                (B)

Assume B*(7,p) is the optimum trade function of the informed and

IB*(&,pb>O    for   some

    But if, say,

               E(I1'Ip) > p       and BU > 0 ,                     (3.JA)

lear1y     B1 C 0   ,   and the expected return to gambling, for that

is negative. Moreover, by hypothesis, both the signal              and the     -




event   are unconelated    with   the individuals'inccme. Hence, the gamble

represents a mean reducing increase in the spread of the distribution
of income, and hence expected utility is lowered:

              E(E(u'I   9,p)jp1(u Ip; .
This contradicts (3.13). Hence

                 B*(O,p) E    0
    The result can easily be generalized to more than two groups.

The basic intuition is simple: gambling cannot increase the mean
income of all.groups; at least one group must have a lower mean
income. At the same time, gambling increases the dispersion of
the distribution of income. Hence, there must be at least one group
for whom expected utility is lowered as a result of gambling. Hence,
there cannot exist a gambling market with all rational individuals.

    The argument we have just presented can also be easily generalized to
cases where Y is not constant and endowments are not identical.
The critical property of a pure gambling market is that it          serves    no

 With perfect information, a market on the gamble on S would have
 no trade. (The initial resource allocation, relative to the event 5,
 is ex ante pareto optimal.) Assume some individuals have information
   ,   such that

      But for each ,           for   which (3.22) is true, (5.17) holds.
 Hence,

      EUt.[Yils,p]ucp,s)c1P_EuIiryil_Sp J(1-rr(p,s))

which contradicts (5.18).

      The intuition behind this result may be put another way: Any
individual who is uninformed, and

knows that he is uninformed, will
                                               not bet, since he knows that his
opponent will only bet when the odds are in his favor. Asswue that
the individual does not know whether he is more or less informed
than his rival, but believes that his rival knows whether he is
                                                                   18.

  more or less informed. The rival
                                     will only bet when he is the more
  informed and the odds are in his favor. Since the
                                                     individual knows
  this, he will not be willing to engage in the bet. Thus, the
                                                                only
  possible case in which betting can occur is when both bettors
                                                                do
  not know whether they are the more or less informed. it is
                                                             as likely
  that the individual is the less informed as that he is the
                                                                  more
  informed. But then betting simply represents a mean
  preserving spread in their incomes, and if both are risk
                                                           averse (no
  matter what their utility
                            functions look like), neither will be
                             i..2
  willing to engage in a bet.

  IV. Incentives to Acquire Information in a Pure Exchange

     A simple example may make this clearerJ

    Assume we had an insurance market for rain.     Whether it rains

some of the factors are observed, some are not, so that from the-

be the estimate of the probability of rain when the information is I

the same information (later, we shall consider the case where
different individuals obtain different information)'.

event rain) will be a function of the individual's estimate of the

 An increase in the price lowers the demand
                                            but an increase in the
 estimated probability of the event increases the demand.

        The uninformed (those who do not observe    '1   ).   must base their
 betting on a priori information (which we assume is given, and unaltered

 throughout the analysis) and on market price (odds); for the
 individual knows that if there are       informed individuals, the
 markeCodds will reflect their information. If we write

 •      Bu= Bu(p), with B/p <

 to    represent his demand function, then market clearing requires

        B1(p,Tt-)+ Bu(P) = 0

 Under our assumptions,for every value 11      there is a unique value
 of p
       p =p(n)       p' >0
 i.e. the uninformed can infer precisely from the market odds the
information of the informed (even though the market odds need not

equal ii).      But then there is no incentive for anyone to obtain

information. /

          Note that if no one obtains information, the market odds
will be invariant period to period and cannot reflect any information.

It would pay then.        someone to obtain the information if the

 information were not too costly.

     Thus, there is no non-stochastic competitive equilibrium to
 the exchange model with information which is costly (but not too
 cdstly). If the demand functions for bets depend on some other
 set of variables which were stochastic, and not observable (and the

 values of which were not inferable
                                   indirectly, say, by observing
 some other set of markets),then the market price (odds) will depend

 on this variable as well, and the uninformed will not be able to
infer precisely the value from the market odds. Thus, in
                                                          exchange
markets which are not pure gambling markets there may exist market
equilibrium with trade in which prices do not always perfectly
reflect the information of the informed, although they do on
                                                             average.
    There is an incentive in this system for the uninformed to

the                 demand functions of the informed and uninformed,
rather than 1 directly; for by knowing      the demand function
and the market price they can infer the information about , and

this may be a cheaper (or indeed the only) way for the uninformed

to obtain the information which we have assumed is available to the
informed.



 V. The Stpck Market as a Gambling Market
    The stock market is clearly not a pure gambling market. Yet,

the arguments of the preceding section suggest both that much of

the trading on the securities markets is based on some kind of

irrationality, and that there are only limited incentives to
acquire information about the returns of various securities.     In
                                                                -
                                                                    22.


 this section, we attempt to show this.

        For simplicity, we assume that all individuals have a constant
 wage income, are endowed initially with an equal fraction of the
 shares of each of the firms, and are risk averse. Initially,
                                                               we
 shall assume that they have the same degree of risk aversion. Let

 us define a non-speculator as an individual
                                               who purchases (holds)
 a representative market share, paying no attention to price; we
 define a culator as an individual who attemptà to form
 expectations of the returns of various securities and allocates his
portfolio to maximize his expected utility, given those expectations
and market prices.

    Individuals may form expectations about all securities or only
     -'a.
about a subset of securities.
    The expectations of the j.th.individual with respect to the i.th
                                               .




security are said to be nbiased if (where tildes denote the true
values, carets the estimated values),

                  1
                      =   .1'ELI.1k   =

where       is the jth individuals expectations about the mean of
the ith security and       is his expectations of its covariance
with the returns of the kth security.

         If individuals have a choice between obtaining unbiased
information at a cost or following the non-speculation strategy,
all individuals   will follow the non-speculation
                                                    strategy.
    Assume only one individual speculated. Clearly, if all others
are pursuing a non-speculative strategy, he must end up with his

representative market share of each of the firms, and hence his
                                                               23.


 income pattern is the same, but he has spent resources to obtain

 the information, and so is worse off. If several individuals
 speculate, and they obtain identical information the argument is the
 same. If they obtain different (but on average unbiased) information
 on average they must obtain the market return, but sometimes they
 do better than the market, sometimes worse. If the "quality of

 the information" is uncorrelated with the output of the economy
 (so that the individual does not consistently do better than the

market average when the market does poorly, and conversely)
the variance of his income is larger than with the non-speculative

strategy and, as we argued above, his net mean income is lower:
again it does not pay to speculate.                                  -




    The result we have obtained is valid even if
                                                 some individuals
have a comparative advantage in obtaining information. If, for
instance, one individual could find out costlessly f or certain
the returns to different securities, others would be unwilling to
trade with him,   tie would simply determine the prices of the
different securities. If two individuals believed that they have

a comparative advantage--and they agreed on the returns (for
certain) of the different securities--again there would be

negative net returns to acguiring information, since in fact they
would end up with exactly the same portfolio that they would have
had had they followed the alternative non-speculation strategy.
    The result can also be extended to cases where individuals have

different utility functions.
                                                                         24..




    Assume all individuals evaluate alternative strategies in terms
of the mean and variance of income
                                   which they generate. Assume they have
choice between (a) obtaining unbiased information about individual secur—

 ities, (b)followjng thenon-specuiai strategy, or (c) following the
non-speculation strategy with respect to the risky assets, but
obtaining information about the mean and variance of the risky
securities together, at a lower cost than obtaining information

about individual securities. We now show they will follow one of
the latter two strategies.
        All     i   individuals   who obtain each period unbiased sure
information would purchase the same bundle of risky securities, i.e.
the market bundle. An individual who purchased only information
about the mean and variance of the market
                                                   bundle would, however,
have just as good a knowledge of the "market line"1 as the
individual who knew the returns to individual securities. But he

would have paid less for information, so he would be better off.




    11n the terminology of mean variance analysis, the "market
line" is defined by
                             =    b(-r)
where           and are the mean and standard deviation of the
         is.,
income from a portfolio consisting of all the risky securities
on the market, and r is the (safe) rate of interest.
                                                         24a.



         Thus, in a mean variance model, individuals would never
acquire information about the properties of individual
securities 1,2

         Note that screening information (discussed below in
Section VII), that some,stock is above average, some other

stock below average, does not, in general, affect individual's
beliefs about the return of the market as a whole. Much

of the information provided by stockbrokers appears to be of
this type.

    This result can be seen as an immediate corollary of
    Proposition 4. In a mean variance model, information which
    leaves unchanged expectations about the mean and variance
    of the market portfolio leaves unchanged individual's port-
    folio allocations. Thus (3.16) and (3.17) are satisfied.

 Vi.    LQo Alternative Explanations of Trade and
                                                  Information
        Acquisition on the Stock Market
        Trades do occur on the stock market, and there is considerable

 expendjtute on information about particular securitj•,. How do
 we recencile these observations with the results of the preceding
 two sections. There are two basic explanations for trading:
 not all individuals are rational, in the sense in which we have
 defined the term, and individuals' endowments differ so that trade

 is desirable, even with identical information (and, perhaps more
 to the point, their endowments of assets, including non-traded
 assets, change in such a way as to warrant continuous trade in
the stock market): We discuss these alternative explanations in
the next two subsections.


VI.l Irrationality
       In this section we shall see that as long as individuals are

finitely lived, and there is a continual stream of new individuals

being born (entering maturity) it may be optimal for there to be

speculation (from the private point of view). The argument
requires not only that a fool be born every moment but that each
of us believes he is not that foolj

       An individual entering the market observes a distribution of
returns from speculating. If he assumed he were simply average,
he would not speculate. But if he believes that the reason that


    1This corresponds to the observation of most teachers that
more than 1/2 of their students believe that they are in the upper
half of their class.
                                                                 26.


  individuals who have done above average is that they have a comparative

 advantage in obtaining information (and are not just "lucky"--
 alternative hypotheses between which the data may not discriminate)
 and he believes that he is one of those individuals, he will
                                                              go
 ahead and speculate. If there are many such individuals, there will
 be a "competitive" market for securities. As some individuals
 "win"   their   estimate of their comparative
                                                 advantage may actually
 increase; as other individuals "lose" their
                                                 estimate decreases, and
 if they lose long enough they stop being speculators and adopt
 the alternative non-speculative
                                 strategy.
     The "thinness" of the market will depend then on the flow of
 new entrants into the market, the
                                     speed with which individuals revise
 theirxpectations and the variance of the returns. If they are
 stubbdn, and revise their expectations only slowly (the gambler
whose luck is about to turn), then only if individuals have a long

string of bad luck will they drop out of the market.


IV. .2 Differences in endowments and tastes

    Some trading on the stock market is life
                                                  cycle trading: young
individuals purchasing securitieth which they will sell when they
are old. But if our earlier analysis is
                                            correct, rational
individuals would simply purchase a mutual fund; there would not
be trading in individual securities.

    When entrepreneurs are lucky, and the firms which they have

started do particularly well, they will have a disproportionate share
of their wealth in their own firm. If they are risk
                                                     averse, they
will thus wish to trade their own finn for a mutual fund consisting
                                                                   27.


of the market as a whole. This gives rise
                                                  to some trade; but again,
if the analysis of the preceding sections is correct, it cannot

give rise to sustained trading. Once portfolios are "balanced"
so that each individual has a proportionate share in all firms,
there will be no further trading.

     Not all assets are tradeable; in particular, markets for

human capital are notoriously imperfect.        To the extent that (a) the
huthaxi   capital   of different individuaj.b yield returns which are ilzperfectly
correlated; and (b) different securities on the market have different cor-
relations with the reFnrns to different
                                              indlviduam' humancapital, if
individuals initially

had identical endowments of securities, there would be an incentive
for them to trade, to obtain portfolios that are appropriately
matched to their human capital.
                                       Moreover, changes in their human
capital will, in general, give rise to changes in the optimal
portfolios. Thus coal miners are likely to sell coal short in their
portfolio.. (assuming the skills of being a coal miner are specific

to the industry).. I suspect this kind of "insurance" or "matching"

function of trading in securities is relatively unimportant. In
any case, if this is the primary motivation, it has
                                                           interesting
and important implications for the nature of the incentives for

information acquisition, which we shall discuss in the next section.
                                                          27a.


      The assumption that individuals evaluate portfolios simply
 in terms of their means and variances was critical to the

 result that only information about the market portfolio had
 value. (Information about the mean and variance of the market
portfolio has social value, when individuals' attitudes
towards risk differ, since it allows a more efficient distri-
bution of the burden of risk; formally, for such infomration,

assumption (3.16) is not valid.) When individuals' attitudes
towards risk are not described by means and variances (or by

one of the other utility functions for which a generalized
mutual fund theorem (Cass—stiglitz, 1970) is valid), then,
again, information about a particular security may have value.

(Again, assumption (3.16) is not valid.)
    vrsut note that if the returns to all securities can be

written as a linear combination of a set of market factors,

              =          + e.
                  EMp.
where     =         = 0,   and where there are enough securities
so that individuals can diversify out of the idiosyncratic

risk (ci) (as is commonly asserted), then again, information
about individual securities is again of no value. Individuals'
expected utility will be a function of the implicit prices
associated with each of the market factors (assumed to be

unaffected by information about a small firm) and the probability
distribution of these market factors. This will determine their
demand for each of the market factors. Thus ex post realized

utility level will be a function only of the realization of
the vector M and the implicit market prices associated with
each of the market factors (and, of course, the subject
                                                         27b.




  probability distribution of these market factors). Again,
  if assumption (3.16) is valid, (3.16) will be; infonnatjon
  about particular securities will not generate any trades
  and such information will have no value.




VII. The Returns to Information

     In this section, we shall examine in more detail the nature of
the incentives for information acquisition in the stock market.

We shall show that there are marked discrepancies between the

social and private returns to information.
                                                                 28.


VII.l The taxonomy of information and the capital market

     First, however, we must distinguish among several different
 kinds of information.

     In another paper, on information in the labor market, (Stiglitz
 1975) I distinguished between two kinds of information:      general
 and specific. The former was information about a characteristic
 of an individual which affected his productivity in a variety of

 jobs, the latter was information relevant for a specific jnh.

     Here we need to distinguish four kinds of information, depending
 on how the information relates to both buyers and sellers.

 (1) General-general: information which affects all securities
 and all purchasers, for instance, that pertaining to the relative
 probabi4ity of different states of nature which are of importance
 to all -individuals (e.g. the probability of a recession).


 (2) General-specific: information which is of importance to
specific individuals, but which affects their attitudes towards

a whole class of securities, e.g. the probability of a recession
in the coal mining industry is of importance for workers in that
industry, but if the decline of the coal mining industry is

uncorrelated with, say, the business cycle, it may be of relatively
little importance to individuals who work in other industries.


(3) Specific-general: information which is specific to a firm
(e.g. the mental stability of the manager) but which is of
interest to all individuals who own   the   security.
                                                            29.



 (U) Specific-specific: information which is of value both to a
 specific individual (or class of individuals) and to a specific firm.
 If I am risk neutral, the only information I want is the mean return
 of the curity; if I am risk averse, I will want information about
 other risk properties of the security.

     Most information obviously falls in scope between the very

general and the very specific: it affects not all firms but more
than one; it is of value not to all individuals but to more than

one. The dichotomy is. important, however, both because the mechanisms
for obtaining the returns to information and the relationship

between social and private returns differ in the different categories.
    There is another important distinction which must be made:
some &fbrmation may be of "value" to different individuals, but
the information may increase the value of the security in the eyes
of some, decrease it in the eyes of others.

    Information that the firm will do very well if a certain

contingency arises, but will do very badly Otherwise, may raise the
valuation of the security in the eyes of those who think the event
likely, lower it in the eyes of those who think the event unlikely.1
For instance, an individual who v'orks in coal mining and whose wage

is, as a consequence, correlated with the prosperity of the coal
industry, will value firms whose profits are negatively correlated
with the prosperity of the coal industry more highly than those

     LObviously, if there is a complete set of Arrow Debreu securities
markets, then the judgments concerning the relative probabilities
of different events affects the relative prices of different
contingent commodities, but given the prices of Arrow Debreu
securities, the firm need not concern itself with the probability
of different events (see Stiglitz.(].97o), Grossman-Stiglitz (1977, l980b)).
                                                               30.


  whose profits are positively correlated; for someone in another
  industry, a negative correlation with the coal industry may correspond
  to a positive correlation with his own wage, and thus he will find
  such a security unattractive.

      Consider a bit of information which affects two securities which

 are initially indistinguishable. If, as a result of the information,
 all individuals now agree that security A is more valuable than
 security B, then we call that information hjerarchical; that is to
 say, at least with respect to the characteristic being identified,
 all individuals agree that, say, more of the characteristic is better

 than less. For instance, information related only to the mean of
 the securities is hierarchical. On the other hand, when one subset

 of the-,-population values A more highly as a result of the information,
 while another values B more highly, then we say that the information

 is I.ching, i.e. it matches specific indi'uiduals to
 specific securities)

vII.2 Social return to information in an exchange economy

     From this discussion, we can see the nature of the social returns
       in a pure exchange economy:2
 to information/ given that individuals are different, it is in
 general not optimal for individuals to have the same portfolio.

 Information (both general and specific) allows a better "matching"
 of securities with individuals.


     1This distinction played an important part in my analysis of
 information in labor markets. Information about the wage a
 specific firm pays is hierarchical information about certain
 non-pecuniary characteristics of die firm is 1i3ely to be "matching"
 information. See Stiglitz (l97)..

              production, there are, of course, further returns.
 See below.
                                                                31.



VII.3 Private returns to information

        What is the private return to providing information?

        The private return to providing information takes two forms:

 (a) a direct consumption effect, particularly of specific-specific
 information, allowing the individual who acquires the information
 to obtain a portfolio better suited to his needs; (b) a market
 valuation effect; if announcement of the information results in a
 change in the market value of the securities, then by buying the

 security if it is underpriced or selling the security short if it

 is overpriced, before releasing the information, and then making
 the information public, the individual is able to reap a capital gain.

          In this sub-section, we are concerned primarily with the

  latte.r effect, particularly with the incentives for individuals
  to obtain, and disseminate, hierarchical information.1 For
  individuals     to be able to appropriate the returns from this kind
  of information
  (i)   they   must own, or be able to acquire, the asset before the
  information     is disseminated;

  (ii) there must be an incentive for someone to disseminate the

  information, so that the market price can adjust to reflect the
  information;    and
  (iii)   the information, when disseminated, must be believed; it
  must be credible.


       1H.ierarchical information, it will be recalled, is information
 which affects all individuals' evaluation of the asset identically;
 it does not result in any better allocation of the asset among
 the population.
                                                          31a.


       There are problems at each of the three stages of the analysis.
 Our previous discussion (sections II and Iv) argued that in a pure
 betting market there would be no trade. The fact that one individual
 (who is believed to be informed) is willing to buy some shares from

me conveys the information that he believes the shares are under-
priced; I will not, as a result, be willing to sell to him.

       This has one interesting implication: it is sometimes
suggested that firms that are undervalued will be subjected to take

over bids. If all takeover bids were so motivated then they would
never be successful (if those making the takeover bids on average
were correct in identifying undervalued firms)
       Information dissemination poses a standard public good (free
rideT) problem: all individuals who own shares in the finn would
like someone else to pay the costs of information dissemination.
All who own shares in the firm gain from the increase in the price.2


       1There may, of course, be other motivations for take-overs;
a wealthy individual might, for instance, wish to buy an asset which
is negatively correlated with the return to his other assets. As
we argued earlier, trade can occur to match assets with
but it seems that this provides little of the motivation individuals,
                                                          for most
take -overs.

         similar free rider problem arises in take-overs aimed at
improving the quality of the management. If on average, those who
engage in takeovers do improve the quality of management, so that
the returns on the asset are increased, it will result in an increase
in the value. But then no small shareholder has an incentive to sell
his shares to the firm attempting the take-over. He shares in the gains
from the improved management. The only situation in which there is an
incentive for a take—over to occur is when the new management can
appropriate some of the increase in returns for itself. This point
has been developed by Grossman and Hart.(l98o
                                                              32.


 Only if a single individual owns all the shares, or if the
 owners act collusively, can the full benefits of the change in
 price from the information transmission be captured by the provider
 of the information.1




    c-r




      1Note that if there is a cost of
                                       transmitting the information,
and these costs are large, and are a function of the number of
individuals to whom the information is
individuals to whom it pays to transmittransmitted, the only
                                        information are other
potentially large shareholders (the wealthy). Thus the
are suppliedQrmatj          other wealthy sellers of securities.
                                                                33.


     There is, however, a natural method by which the owners of the
 firm can act collusively: to have the information provided by the
 firm itself. Assume that the owners of the firm have perfect

 knowledge about the returns to their firm (and hence are in agreement).

 Then clearly, provided the transmission costs are not too high, it
will pay the firm to make the information public.

     It would of course pay firms with low returns not to have

information disclosed. But if some firms disclose information, and
others do not, the market will assume that the firms which have
not disclosed information must have a low return. Since there is
"no information" about any of these firms, they will all be treated

identically. But firms who are above the average of this "below

average group" can increase their value by disclosing
                                                        information,
or having information disclosed about them (at the expense of
course of those below average in the below average group). The

process repeats itself until information about all the firms is
revealed.

    The process is closely parallel to that which I have used else-
where to describe the education system as a screening device. It

is in the self-interest of the bright to become so identified, and

although this identification need have no        returns (if it
does not result in a change in production), it will yield private
returns to the bright at the expense of the stupid.

    There are, however, some important differences which make the
analysis of screening in the capital market considerably more
complex than in the education market. The most important differences
arise from the fact that human capital is (at least currently) not
 normally bought or sold short; that is, even if I know that you are
 overvalued, I cannot sign a contract to sell your services next
 period, announce the true value of your prcductivity, and then,

 next period having arrived, buy your services from you at the now
 much lower price. Nor can I buy a fraction of your human capital
 for later resaleJ Thus, in our discussions of screening of
 individuals, we assumed that it was the individual who made the
decision about whether to have himself screened. Since in the

capital market, through speculation, every individual is a potential
owner of every firm, there is the possibility, at least, that it
might be in the interests of someone other than the original owner

to certify the characteristics of the firm. Our analysis has
suggested that so long as the screening industry is competitive, the

returns to screening will be captured by the original owners of
the security, and thus it is they who--as in the education market--
have the incentive to provide the screening.

    In the education market, it is natural to assume (although not

necessarily the case) that individuals know more about their own

ability than anyone else. Similarly, in the context of the capital
market it is natural to assume that the individuals who do have
more information about the security are the original owners of
the firm.2


    LThese statements are not quite correct. There are firms which
attempt to find "undervalued" individuals, screen them, and then sell
their labor services at a higher price, and some individuals do
incorporate themselves, in effect selling a portion of their human
capital. But these instances are more the exception than the rule.
    2i is, of course, possible that others have more information
about the prospects of the firm than the original owners. In that
case these individuals may take over the firm, and have the firm
provide the information. But if the original owners know that this
is the motive for the takeover, they will be unwilling to sell.
                                                                       35.
VIX.4 Relationship between the social and private returns to information
      In the previous.subsection, we showed how certain
                                                        aspects
  of    the problem of information on the capital market can be       recast
 as    problems
             in the-economics of screening. Wefcan thus borrow some
 results from the general theory of screening. We obtain the

 following two important conclusions:
 (a) The returns to the provision of information which changes the
 market value of firms is captured primarily bythe original owners
 of the shares     it
                   is accordingly they who have an economic incentive
 to    provide the information.
 (b) The private returns to       the provision of   information   do not, in
 aenera1correnJ         to thsociaet just               as in the case of
 screening of individuals. There is likely to be excessive
                                                                     spending
 on "hierarchical screening," i.e. in screening for characteristics
 whicfftindiviauals value in the same way, and too little spending

 on "matching screening", i.e. on screening for characteristics
which individuals value in different ways. The latter can be seen
most easily by considering a case where the provision of
                                                                   information
leaves the price of the asset unchanged, the increase in the demand
by one group being offset, say, by a decrease in the demand by
another group. Even when there is essentially no cost to providing
this information, and even though there may be a high social return
to doing so, there will be no incentive for the firm to provide
this information.
       In the next two sub-sections, we provide
                                                     both examples showing
the relationship between social and private returns for hierarchical
and matching information.
                                                               36.
     The third problem we noted above is that of credibility:
 although firms have an economic incentive to provide

 iaformatioat.hey_also have an economic incentive to provide

tnLainjorination, just as in the education market individuals have
an incentive to have themselves overrated. In the education

market, an individual who has misrepresented himself is usually
found out, and thus is not able to enjoy the benefits of his

misrepresentation (a higher wage) for long. in the capital market
it may be more difficult to ascertain misrepresentation, and by the

time it is ascertained, the original owner of the security has
already absconded with his gains. This makes it even more necessary
than in the case of the education market for the information to be

certified by "public" outside institutions. These institutions
in thircapital market are the investment consultants, the stock

brokeiage firms, etcJ




    1The division between direct production of information and
certification depends, presumably, on comparative costs of producing
different kinds of information and the fact that some information
may be relevant to several different firms. That is, GM may have
an advantage in producing information about the production
characteristics of GM, but a stock brokerage firm will produce
information about the demand for cars in general.
                                                                57.


VII.5 An Example of Hierarchical Screening
     We assume that everyone is risk averse and evaluates the
 portfolio in terms of the mean and standard deviation of the return.

     We assume, moreover, that there are enough securities of each type so
 that the individual, -   if he completely diversifies, faces essentially no
 risk There are two kinds of securities, type 1 with mean 9
 and type 2 with mean 2              All securities are known to
                          l > 2
 have the same variance,02. There are equal• .!ners of the two types

 of securities. For simplicity, we assume all securities are

 independently distributed, and the distribution of returns of each
 is normal. All individuals have the same utility function, which
                            -
 we assume is of the form -e crY where y is income. (constant

 absolute risk aversion). Hence, the individual seeks to maximize
              a2
 (7.l)- -
              -t
 where   Y is his mean income

         4   is   the variance of his income.

     Each individual is endowed initially with one firm. He knows
what kind of firm it is, but does not know what type any other firm
is. He can supply to the market information about the quality of
his firm.

     The cost of providing this information is C; we
assume c is neither very small nor very large.1
            0-0                                  0-0

There are then two equilibria:

(a) The no-information equilibriuni. The relative price of all
    securities is unity. The individuals who own   type   one
     firms retain a fraction A of the wealth in their own security

    and divide the remainder equally among all other shares. A is
    chosen to
                                                                           38.

when 0 is the mean return on all securities soldon the market.
For the moment, we shall assune that the owners of low productivity
firms retain the same fraction of their shares as do the owners of

high productivity firms.1 This implies that the average return to
                                           0 +0
a randomly selected share on the market is     2
                                            12     If the number of firm
is large, we can ignore the effect of the ith firm's               action on the
average   return, so

Using ( 7.11.) it is clear that for the
                                                     entrepreneur owning a type 1 firm

He is slightly better off than the average person; how much

depends on his aversion to risk (cx) and the variance of his own

security.

    If he screened, the value of his wealth would go up by an
amount       , and he could then completely
                                            diversify, so
          —   cx       2
(7.8)
          YcryZ l



          assumption will be justified in the next section. The
basic argument is simple: if the fraction of shares retained by
firms retained a smaller fraction than A ,                 it
the original owners is an observable variable, if the low productivity.
                                                would signal to the
market that they were low productivity, and this would have a marked
effect on their market value.
    The results would not be significantly affected if we assumed
that the original owners of poor quality firms retain a smaller
fraction of their shares.
                                                          38a.


Under the assumption of (7.2), it does not pay him to undertake
the screening.

(b) The full information equilibrium. The relative price of the
two securities is              1'2 .    For the upper group,

              —       cx2
     (7.10)       -




 If an individual who owns a type 1 firm does not screen, his
 expected utility is

 (.ii)        -
                  exp   -      + 1   ______

                                         2

 Thus, it pays the individuals of type 1 to screen. This
 example illustrates several of the important aspects of markets
 with imperfect information:
 (1) There may be multiple equilibria.
 (2) Some of these equilibria may be Pareto inferior to others.

        In this example, it can be shown that the no screening equilibrium
 is pareto superior to the screening equilibrium.
 () The type 2 securities owners exert an externality on the
         txp.J        secury
                     owners. If all securities were good (type "1")
the expected utility of the type 1 security holder would be
                                                            -exp(o1a)
In both the full information and
                                 no information equilibrium, the
type 1 individuals are worse off. On the other hand, the losses
to the type 1 individuals exceed the gains to the type 2 individuals,

relative to what they could have had if all securities were of type 2.
This is obviously the case in the screening (full information)
equilibrium, where in fact the type 2 security holders are no better

of f than they would have been in the absence of type 1 security

holders, but the latter are unambiguously worse of f:

      Tht example developed in some detail above involved one group

of securities being unambiguously better than another group. The
               now
example which we/present involves differences in opinions among
different individuals about what states of nature are most likely
to occur; this in turn affects which securities maximize ex ante

expected utility.
      Consider a particular firm.            It is known that it either
produces using technique A or technique B. For simplicity we
assume individuals are risk neutfal, but we assume individuals are
not allowed to sell securities short?




      1
          These assumptions may easily be modified.
There are three groups in the population; type A indiviciuais
believe that, if the firm produces using A, it will have a

very high profit, but if it produces using B, its profits
will be low; conversely, type B individuals believe expected
profits with B are high but with A are low.          Type C
individuals believe that the two techniques have the same

expected profits.       In the absence of information about which
technique is being employed, all individuals assume that there
is   a            chance that a particular technique is used.
         fifty—fifty
More precisely, let llA(A be     expected profits if technique
A is used in the judgnent of person of type A, and      be
the aggregate wealth of individuals of type A. There isan alterna-
tive investment opportunity (lecurity C) whdse 'epéctéd rettrn

Thus, in the absence of information, individuals of type A
or type B prefer security C to the given firm. The firm
will be entirely owned by individuals of type C. By
assumption,    their wealth exceeds the value of the firm.

(The value of the firm will be

                                                                                                         k2.

     which is less than the aggregate wealth of type C Individuals)
     The remainder of the wealth of type C individuals as well as
     the wealth of type A and B individuals is invested in type C

    it is clearly worth procuring.                 Note, however, that although
    this information has value, there is absolutely no change in
    the market value of the firm.               Thus the firm            would have no
    incentive to provide the information —— even if it could do
    so almost costlessly.        Individuals of type A have an

 incentive to get together, to form a "consumer cooperative" to

 procure the information; but this is likely to be impossible,
 since it is difficult for individuals of type A to identify each

 other. (Thus, although there is a natural "producer" cooperative
 for providing information by sellers of securities, i.e. the firm
 itself, there is no corresponding natural consumer cooperative.)
And even were it possible to identify who was in fact an individual
of type A, there are all the classical public good (free rider)

problems which argue that there is likely to be underinvestment in
this type of information.i

VIII.   Self-Selection Equilibria
    We argued in the previous section that the original owners of
the more productive firms have an incentive to provide information
  to the market
                  establishing their productivity.
                                                     There is, however,
  a fundamental problem of credibility:
                                           information supplied by
  (or paid for by) the firm is not likely to be
                                                believed. It is well
  known that actions speak
                          louder than words; in the recent literature
 on screening, actions which
                             convey information (e.g. about the
 productivity of the firm) are referred to as Uf-seictiona;ic
  (Stiglitz (1982). An entrepreneur who is willing to hold
                                                            on to a
  large fraction of the shares of his
                                      company may be conveying
  information that he believes the market is
                                             undervaluing his firm.
      Of course, if investors come to believe this, then firms
                                                                which
 are not productive may attempt to imitate the more
                                                     productive firms;
 the share of the firm retained by the original
                                                 owners would not
 then convey information. This discussion should make clear
                                                              that
 analysis of self-selection equilibria is a fairly complex
                                                            question.
 Indeed, as we shall see, it may not even be clear what the
                                                             appropriate
 notion of equilibri should be.
    The essential Property of a self-selection device is
                                                          that the relevant
cost curves (indifference curves) for one group differ from those of the

other. An increase in the share of thE firm retained by thE original ownen
has a cost in the reduced
                          diversification (increased risk) which the
entrepreneur must bear. If, however, the market undervalue5 the
security, there is a gain: mean income
                                          will increase as the fraction
retained increases. Thus, the aQt cost to the more productive
firms is lower than to the
                           less productive firms, and it is this
difference which in some
                         circumstances may enable the fraction of
shares retained by the original owners to serve as
                                                   a self-selection
device.

       To see this more formally, we return to the simple model of
 section 7.5. Let     p   denote the price at which an owner of a firm
 of type i can sell his shares. The mean return of shares purchased
 on the market is normalized at unity. In figure     7.1 we have
 depicted the individua]. indifference curves in (A,p) space
 (where A is the fraction of the shares
                                        retained)) Clearly,
      d    >        >.
           < 0 as A<M(p)


where A*(p) is the optimal value of A.      (See, e.g. equation 7.14.)
Moreover,




The owners of the less productivity (type 2 firms) require a larger

increase, in the price to compensate them for an increase in the
fraction of the firm they retain.
Pooling equilibrium
       Assume first that A is observable. Consider the no information
equilibrium, when A1 = A2 (Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) refer to this a

a pooling equilibrium). Clearly, in equilibrium, p=l, and the optimal
value of A (from the point of view of the more productive firms) is

just A1
    is this, however, an equilibrium? Clearly, the good firms would
like to signal that they are good. What would happen if one such
firm   were to announce that it was willing to sell a fraction A. at
a price p greater than 1, with the point (,p), located in the
shaded area in figure 7.1  i.e. below type 2 individualsl
