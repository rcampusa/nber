          MIDDLE—AGE JOB MOBILITY: ITS DETERMINANTS AND CONSEQUENCES

                        Ann P. Bartel and George J. Borjas*



       It is well known that job mobility is an important characteristic of

the working life histories of individuals. Labor Department data indicate

that on the average a young man at age twenty can expect to have 6.6 job

changes during the next forty years of his working life. While the ex-

pected number of job changes declines over the life cycle, it is inter-

esting to note that men aged 45—54 still exoect to change jobs an addi-

tional 1.4 tines prior to retirement.1 Due to lack of microdata, earli

studies of job mobility were unable to analyze individual mobility

patterns; rather, these studies examined the determinants of inter—

industry job separation.2

       The recent availability of longitudinal data on earnings and job

histories has allowed researchers to significantly expand the study of

job mobility. For examole, Parnes and Nestel (1975) studied the

determinants arid conseauences of job changing using the National Longitudinal

Survey of Mature Men (NLs). Their most ixnoortant findings were that the

probability of quitting a job was systematically related to job tenure, job

satisfaction, the existence of private pension plans and the individual's

current wage. Using the same data set, Borjas (1975) analyzed the effects

of differential lifetime mobility patterns on the current earnings of mature

men by estimating a "segmented" earnings function——that is, relating the

individual's earnings to his job history. The study suggested the exis-

tence of a strong positive relationship between human   capital   investment

and job duration. Finally, Bartel (1975), using the Coleman—Possi Retro-

spective Life History Study, was able to decompose post-school earnings

growth into gains occurring on the job and gains due to job mobility. It

was shown that while inter—firm mobility had a positive effect on earnings

growth through the wage gain obtained across jobs, the more mobile individ-

uals had significantly lower wage growth per time period within the job.

The use of longitudinal (life—cycle) data, therefore, has provided econo-

mists with new insights into an important characteristic of labor markets,

namely job mobility.

      Our paper uses the wealth of information available in the NLS to ex-

pand on previous work in several ways. First, we investigate whether there

is a meaningful distinction among types of job separations. Traditional

analysis has categorized job separations as either emnloyee—initiated

(quits) or employer—initiated (layoffs). We question whether this

dichotomy is correct. For example, a person who quits his job for per-

sonal (exogenous) reasons, such as health, has a different motivation
                                        —3—


than a quitter in search of a better job. This argument would suggest the

need for a more detailed breakdown of quits. On the other hand, it has

recently been argued that it is irrelevant which party to the "contract"

initiates the separation.3 A job can be viewed as a match (or marriage)

between employer and employee. Since the separation is solely determined

by the existence of an improper match, it is unnecessary to know which

party initiated the separation in order to know the factors determining

the separation. This line of reasoning would, of course, lead to the

conclusion that the quit—layoff breakdown is meaningless and that seara—

tion rates should be the focus of the analysis.

       The National Longitudinal Survey data is especially useful for

studying the relationshin between wages and the probability of quitting.

Most theoretical work on the determinants of job separation concludes

that the probability of changing jobs is related to a reservation wage.

The NLS data set allows us to test this relationship since it includes

information on the individual's "hypothetical wage"-—that is, the wage

required to induce the individual to accept another job. Given this in—

formation, we are able to compare the effects of different measures of

the individual's price of time (e.g. the current wage and the reserva-

tion wage) on the probability of quitting. In addition, we analyze the

role of human capital variables, job related characteristics and family

background   in the determination     of job mobility.

       The    analysis of the determinants of job separations in the cross—
section naturally leads to an investigation of the relationship between
previous separations and future separations. In particular, we consider
whether     such a relationship exists, and whether the nature of previous

separations is a good predictor of the nature of future separations.

       Finally, we analyze the effects of job mobility on earnings and on

job satisfaction. We distinguish between the immediate gains to mobility

and   the   future gains to mobility, and also consider whether the nature of

the separation is an important determinant of the consequences of job

mobility.

       Part II of the paper presents a brief framework for the analysis of

job mobility. It will review various theories that have been presented

in the literature to explain quit—layoff phenomena. In Part III, we

conduct an empirical analysis of the determinants of job separations

and consider whether the distinction between quits and layoffs is indeed

appropriate. Part IV analyzes the effects of job mobility on wage growth

both in the short— and long—runs. A susary of the empirical results is

presented in Part V.


I. A Framework for the Analysis of Job Mobility —
       Economic theory predicts that an   individual will attempt to sell    his

services in the market which offers him the highest return. This simple

concept was first applied by Sjaastad (1962) to the analysis of labor

mobility in his study of internal migration in the United States.4 The




   4See Polachek and Horvath (1976) for a more recent analysis of geographic
mobility using individual, instead of aggregate, data.
                                                   —5—



individual       is assumed     to   calculate his discounted net return from migrating

at time    t,    and base      his   decision to move on whether the net return is posi-

tive. In the case of job mobility, the individual will engage in a similar

calculation of the discounted net returns from leaving his current job.

Hence for the th worker, the probability of quitting in his th year of

job tenure, q.., will be positively related to the gains from                 job   mobility.

That is:



                        a. .
                         _1J
                               =   f(Y..
                                      .J
                                           — Y.
                                              13
                                                  .)                                     (1)


where: Y. .
            13
                  is   the present value of the expected real income stream if the

individual       leaves his current job in job year j, Y.,. is the present value

of   the expected real income stream in the current job calculated at job

year j.5 Equation (1) suggests the following implications:                   (1) the

higher the value of the current job, the less likely the individual is to

quit his job; (2) the better the alternatives available to the individual

relative to the current job, the more likely a quit               will   take place; (3)

the   longer the time remaining until retirement, the greater the gain from
quitting since the returns to mobility can be collected over a longer
period of time.
       Of   course,     not all job        separations need be initiated bc' the    emolovee.
At   job year j, the      employer will compare his estimate of the worker's
marginal revenue        product,              to the wage he is currently paying the




   50f course, equation (1) implicitly nets out the costs of mobility which
may vary across individuals.
                                           —6—

worker, w... The employer will then lay off those workers whose marginal

revenue products fall below the wage. Thus the probability of laying off

the th worker after j years of lob tenure, i.., can be expressed as:6



                      2...   = g(MP. . — w..)                                  (2)
                       13          13    13



Clearly the higher the labor costs, the higher the probability of a layoff
since 2... is negatively related to the difference between marginal revenue
product and      labor costs.7

        We now turn   to an analysis of the process by which the differentials
in   equations (1) and (2) lead to job separations.


A. The Matching Hypothesis

        One approach to the study of a job mobility is to view turnover as

the result of an imperfect match between employer and employee.8 Accord-

ing to this hypothesis, the worker and the firm learn about each other




       can interpret 1P.. as the stream of marginal products received by
     6We
the firm during the worker's tenure. Similarly, w,. can be interpreted
as the discounted stream of all labor costs (e.g. wages, fringe benefits,
etc.) Note that the worker's perception of the value of the job, Y..,
includes w. and any other job         consumption benefits obtained by   the worker
in that job.


     7Note   that our analysis focuses on permanent layoffs. For a discussion
of temporary     layoffs, see Feldstein (1976).

     8See Becker, Landes, and Michael (1976) for an application of the matching
hypothesis to marital instability; Jovanovic (1976) develops a model of job
matching in the labor market.
                                          —7—



during   the first few years of the worker's tenure. If they determine that

they have been imperfectly matched with one another (i.e. the worker is

not suitable for the job), a separation will occur. Thus this aptroach

predicts a negative relationship between job tenure and separations.

In the matching model developed by Jovanovic (1976), the employer adjusts

wages to the      worker's   productivity as he learns about the latter over

time. If the worker's productivity (and hence the wage) falls below the

level which is attainable in other firms, the worker will quit. Since

those employees that remain at the firm will be those whose productivity

(and hence wages) are high, there will be a positive correlation between

wage levels and      job   tenure. Thus the matching hypothesis predicts a

negative relationship between wages and         searations,    not holding job

tenure constant. Once tenure is held constant, we would expect this

negative relationship to be weaker, since for a given tenure level there

will be a smaller variation in productivity across individuals within

the firm.

         Note that since the wage is assed to be adjusted to equal the

worker's productivity, layoffs will never occur in this model. The

fact that a separation might be officially recorded as a sIlayoffII is

basically a matter of semantics and         might   in fact be due to the

reluctance to cut      wages below the going entrance wage or to eligibility
constraints in unemployment        compensation     programs. Therefore an impor-

tant conclusion of the matching hyothesis is that there is no useful

distinction between a quit and        a   layoff. Finally, it is important to

note that because learning about the job is likely to take           a   relatively

short    period   of time, the matching hypothesis is most relevant for

understanding      turnover in the early years of job tenure.

B. The Specific Training Hviothesis

        Alternative models of job separation have focused on the concet of

fixed costs of employment.9 It is argued that when a firm hires a worker

it incurs certain fixed costs in the form of hiring and   training   costs.

The immediate implication of the existence of these fixed costs is that

workers with a higher degree of "fixity" are less likely to be laid off

during periods of slack demand since the employer has an incentive to

recoup his investment. This model, of course, can be generalized such

that fixed costs are borne by both workers and employers (e.g. specific

training), and therefore workers with a higher degree of fixity are less
                  10
likely to quit.

        To illustrate the effects of the existence of specific training on

labor turnover, consider:



                     q.=a0—1S                                           (3)



                     != 8— i S                                          (4)


where

        S = worker     financed specific trainina
         w
          =   firm   financed specific training



Equations (3) and (4) state that the probability of quitting (layoff) is




   9See Ci (1962),      Rosen (1968) and Becker (1975).

  101n Parsons' (1972) model of specific training, implications are de-
rived for both quit and layoff behavior.
                                                —9—


a negative function of worker (firm) financed specific training. We can
express    S   as a function of the wage and skills (e.g. education, E) by
noting    that an individual' s      wage can be defined as:

                                                                                          (5)


Equation (5)     implies:




                   S = w
                    W
                       —             'l
                                 — — E—           —
                                                  10
                                                                                          (6)
                            y2                    12



Substituting (6) into (3) yields;




                        =        —   ____   )    — a1
                                                   —W       +    ____       E             (7)
                                      12              2              12


Therefore      the soecific training hvothesis oredicts that the probability
of quitting is inversely related to the wage rate and positively related
to   education (i.e.. skills). It can             be seen that if SW and S are posi-
tively correlated, the wage and            education      coefficients will be qualita-

tively similar     in the quit and layoff ecuations. Hcwever if Swand S.,
are   negatively   correlated, then wages will have a oositive effect while

education will have a negative effect on layoffs. One would expect to

observe a positive correlation between                    and
                                                                Si   however, since substan-

tial specific training' investment is likely to take                      place   only after the

matching process has been completed.

C.     The Job Search Hvnothesis

           Another approach to the analysis of job mobility is suggested by the

existence of imperfect information in the labor market.11 It has been

shown that imperfect information on the part of employers and employees

creates a non—degenerate distribution of wage offers for given skills.12

This wage dispersion is likely to affect the labor turnover decisions of

both      individuals   and firms.

           We can easily derive the implications of the existence of wage dis-

persion on the probability of quitting by considering equation (1).

Clearly      the higher the current     wage relative to alternatives the lower

the    probability     of quitting. In the case of layoffs, the effect of the

wage is not as clear: The worker may be receiving a higher relative

wage in this firm than elsewhere since his productivity in this particu—

lar firm may also be relatively higher. The effect is nil if wages are

adjusted      to productivity, but positive if discrepancies between wages
and productivity are larger at higher wage levels and are not eliminated.

D. Compensating Differentials
           It has   been   argued that the relationship between wages and separa-
tion      rates is another example of the     theory of compensating wage differ—
             13
enttals.           Workers who are employed in industries that have high layoff



     11For basic models of job search see McCall (1970), Mortensen (1970) and
the   survey article by Lipoman and McCall             (1976).


     12For    a   derivation of this   distribution see Mortensen (1974).
     13
     For example, see Hall (1970). Of course, this argument dates back to
Adam Smith who specifically mentioned job stability as a determinant of
wage differentials across types of jobs.
                                       — 11




rates will demand a wage premium to comensate them for the job instability.
Thus we would exect to find a positive correlation between wages and the
probability of a layoff.14

E. Summary
     We   have discussed four hypotheses that       examine   the   relationshins   be-
tween wages and quit and layoff rates. As an aid to the reader we summa—
rize these   predictions in Table   1 below.

Note that these nredictjons have been made under the assuxnstion that job
tenure is not held constant in the equation. If job tenure were held


   14Pencavel (1972) argues that each einnloyer selects a particular wage—
quit stratecy such that the lower the quit rate an employer is willina
to tolerate the higher the wage rate he must nay, thus resulting in a
negative correlation between the nrobability of quitting and the wage
rate. The problem with this nrediction is that those industries which
carry out this policy might be precisely those industries with high
cuit rates.

constant,   we have shown   earlier that the      negative effects of the wage on

the quit and layoff rates would be weaker or possibly vanish according to

the xnatching hypothesis. For the other hypotheses, however, the predic-

tions of signs   are   invariant with respect to job tenure.


II. The Determinants      of   Job Mobility

      In this section we present an empirical analysis of the determinants

of job mobility. The data set used is the National Longitudinal Survey           of
                                         — 12 —




Mature Men (aged 45—59 in 1966) which provides continuous information on

work and earnings histories between 1966 and 1971.15 To simplify the

empirical analysis, we restrict our sample to consist of all white men who

reported a wage rate in 1966, who renorted key variables such as education

and   job   mobility oatterns, and who were still in the labor force in 1971.

We also limit our sample to individuals who experienced no geographic

mobility during the period in order to focus on job mobility within the

local labor market. We avoid the problem of individuals being recalled

from a layoff by defining job mobility as a change in employers. Thus

recalls would not be measured as job searations. Moreover, by deleting

migrants and     retirees   from the sample of job changers, we further under-

estimate the true separation rate. Any additional restrictions on the

sample   will   be discussed as the results are presented.

       Table 2 shows the mean probabilities of job separation for our samle.

It can be seen that despite the age range of the samole we observe a high

degree of job separation. In fact, within a five—year period, 22 percent

of the samole changed employers. Note, however, that about half of these

seoarations were eplover—initiated——i.e. layoffs or firings. This leaves

a remarkable amount of quits considering the average age of the       satnole.
When we segment the five—year period into shorter tine soans, 1966—69 and

1969—71, we see clear evidence of the effect of a downturn in the business

cycle on the type of job separations that occur. For example, in the

1966—69 period, 57 percent of all job separations were auits, while in

1969—71, the statistic was 39 percent. Although job separations decline

with educational attainment for this sample, it is interesting to note

that the proportion of job separations that are quits increases with

education. This pattern, however, is not as clear during the economic

downturn of 1969-71. In Table 2, we also find that about 60 percent of

all quits are due to "job—related" reasons. An individual is assumed

to have quit for job—related reasons if his quit is due to:     (1) dis-

satisfaction with wages, hours, working conditions, type of work,

(2) difficulty in getting along with employer and/or fellow employees,

or (3) finding a better job. An individual leaves for personal rea-

Sons if his quit is due to (1) dislike of location or community, or

(2) health or family reasons.

       Our analysis will be conducted in two steps. Although in the

previous section we argued that the matching process would only be

relevant in explaining turnover in jobs of short duration, we will

initially focus on mobility from all jobs using the traditional

dichotomy of quits and layoffs, as well as a more refined definition

of quits in terms of job—related and   personal   quits. We will also

analyze    the determinants of job separations without distinguishing
between quits and layoffs. Finally, we differentiate between short
and long jobs and discuss in detail the relevance of the    matching

process.

       Our discussion in Part II showed that we expect to observe a

negative   correlation between the wage and the probability of quitting
and   an ambiguous correlation between the wage and the probability of
                                            — 15 —




a   layoff, ceteris paribus. Recall, however, that the quit rate was af-
fected by    the real wage (see equation (1)]. This suggests the use of a

measure of the price of time which          captures the value of the job to the
individual. The NtIS provides us with such a measure in terms of the
reservation wage——i.e., the wage that would induce the individual to
leave his current      job.    In the case of layoffs, the       firm makes its

decision    based on labor costs (see equation       (2)] which are better        mea-

sured by the actual wage. Moreover, there might exist personal, job

and/or family characteristics which affect the differentials given in

both   equations (1) and (2) and hence        are likely to affect the quit        and
layoff    rates. These characteristics will be included in our empirical

formulation of the cuit        and layoff   equations.16


A. The Determinants of Quits

         Table 3 presents the estimated quit regressions using the reserva-

tion wage as the wage variable. Since the dependent variable is defined

as being equal to unity if the individual quit his job and             zero   otherwise,




    16The probability of quitting can be         written   as:



                   q          I f(w)dw
                          w

where i   is the reservation wage and f(w) is the wage offer distribution
facing individuals of given skills. In principle, for a given wage
offer distribution the quit       rate
                                 would be exactly determined by the
reservation wage. Since our measure of the reservation wage is corre—
lated with f(w) across individuals of varying skills, the variables
measuring hwnan capital also serve to standardize for the wage offer
distribution.

the estimation technique utilized is maximum likelihood logit.17 It is

important   to   utilize this technique since ordinary least squares does
not take account of the restriction that the probability of quitting
should lie in the (0, 1] interval. The logit method of estimation
assumes that the probability that the i

         The regressions in Table 3 examine the determinants of the probabil-

ity of quitting between 1966 and 1969.18 Some regressions on the prob-

ability of quitting in the five—year period, 1966—71, are presented below.


1. The Reservation Wage

         Our measure of the reservation wage is based on the question:19


         Q: Suppose someone in this area offered you a job in the same
             line of work you are in now. How much would the new job
             have to pay for you to be willing to take it?


Individuals responded to this question by either giving a numerical wage or

by answering that:       (a) they would not accept a job at any   wage;   (b) they

would accept a steady job at the same or less pay; (c) they would accept a

job but did not know at what wage; and (d) any other response. About half

of our    sample   responded with an actual reservation wage. For those in-

dividuals   who gave one of the above reasons, we set the reservation wage
equal to the actual wage but at the same time we standardize with a set
of dummies indicating the actual response. The dummies we use to corre-
spond to the above answers are (a) NOTTAXE, (b) STEADY, (c) ACCEPT, and
(d) OTHER.2°



   18Note that the sample sizes in Table 3 are different in each column.
This is because for each regression we defined the relevant sample as
those individuals who did not change jobs plus those who changed for the
particular reason under analysis. We use this method in order to answer
the question of what determines a particular type of separation versus
staying on the job.

           1966 Questionnaire, Question 29a.

   201n effect what we are doing is to use the best available information
(i.e. the actual wage) for those individuals who did not report a reserva-
tion wage. The dummies capture the fact that the true reservation wage
was unavailable for this group of individuals. See Dagenais (1973) for
a discussion of the econometric problems encountered with missing infor—
mation.
                                         — 20 —



          In   regression 3.1 we estimate the equation for all quits;   that   is,

the dependent variable is coded as unity if the individual quit his job

in 1966—69, and zero if he did not change jobs at all. We find that

the effect of the reservation wage is negative and significant.21 Its

magnitude indicates that a one dollar increase in the amount required

to induce the individual to change jobs decreases the probability of

quitting by about 16 percent in this saxttple.22 It is also interesting

to note the effects of the duimnies indicating the individual's response

to   the reservation wage question. For example,        those individuals who

responded       that   they would not accept a job at any wage   (NOTTA) are
83 percent less likely to quit a job than individuals who gave a nuineri—
cal reservation wage. Thus the qualitative response to the reservation
wage question in 1966 was as important as the quantitative response in
indicating which individuals were more likely to quit in the next three
          23
years.




     21Thereare two reasons for our using the 1966 wage rate even though
we   examine mobility during the subsequent three years:(1) it is impor-
tant to have a base period in order to assign a wage to those individuals
who did not change jobs; (2) in this age group the wage rate at any point
in time should be a stable measure of the individual's stock of human
capita]..
     22                                                                 *
       This number calculated by dividing the coefficient on w by the
                         is
mean probability of quitting which is .11.
     23Note that since the effect of NOTTAXE       is five times the effect of a
one dollar increase in the wage, individuals who responded that they
would not take a new job at any wage were, in effect, indicating they
would require a five dollar wage increase to change jobs. Since the
mean wage is under four dollars, this group of individuals requires
more than a doubling of the wage in order to change jobs.

         We   can   extend the empirical analysis by noting that the     NLS   pro-
vides detailed information on the reasons for quitting. We segment the
sample    into two major categories: quitting for job—related reasons and

quitting for personal reasons. One could argue           that   the reservation

wage should have a weaker effect in the case of personal (or exogenous)

quits since when unexpected personal problems arise, the            "value" of the
job,    as measured by the reservation wage, becomes a less critical fac-

tor in the individual's decision to quit. This is, in fact, what the

results in Table 3 indicate. In regression 3.2, we find that a one

dollar increase in the reservation wage significantly lowers the prob-

ability of a job-related quit by 21 percent. On the other hand, in

regression 3.4, we see that a one—dollar increase in the reservation

wage lowers the probability of an "exogenous" quit by only 12 percent.

        We can isolate from the men who quit for job—related reasons a

small group of individuals who quit because they found a better job-—

that is, men who were "pulled" from the current job by a better job

offer. It would appear that the reservation wage should have a strong

negative      effect on   the probability of finding a better job, since these

individuals most closely resemble the typical decision maker in search

models. The results         in Table 3   confirm this ext,ectation. From regres-

sion 3.3, we can calculate that a one—dollar increase in the reservation

wage makes the individual 23 percent less likely to find a better job.

        In order to make our results comparable with those from other data

sets,   and because the reservation wage is defined for only half our

sample,   we estimated the logit regressions using the actual wage as the
relevant measure       of the price of time. The estimated equations are
                                           — 22 —




shown in Table 4. The results are qualitatively similar to those obtained

using the reservation wage: A one—dollar increase in the wage reduces the

probability of a job—related quit by 26 percent, but reduces the prob—

ability of an exogenous quit by only 6 percent. The similarity between

the two   sets   of coefficients should not be surprising. The basic differ-

ence betzeen w and w       is that the reservation wage incorporates the value

of nonpecuniary aspects of the job. Since our vector of standardizing

variables includes a measure of job satisfaction, we are in a sense hold-

ing constant these noripecuniary differences; in fact, we may be "double—

counting" variations in these differences thereby weakening the effect

of w on the quit rate.


2. Job Characteristics

       A vector of variables describing the characteristics of the individ-

ual's current (1966) job is included in the regressions in Tables 3 and

4. We find that individuals who liked their jobs (as measured by LI)

were 60 percent less likely to quit in the next three years. It is im-

portant to note that the probability of being "pulled" from the job is

not affected by the individual's level of job satisfaction; LIXE has an

insignificant effect in equation 3.3. This result is intuitive since an

individual may     like   his current job very much but if a better job offer

is found he will accept it.

       It   has been argued that the existence of private pension systems in—
hibits job mobility. 24 While        our   results   in ecuation 3.1 strongly support

this hveothesis (that is, the        probability of quitting is inversely related

to the existence of a private pension plan in the firm), it is interesting
to consider the differential effects of pensions (PENS) on the probability
of quitting for job—related versus personal reasons. From equation 3.2
we find that individuals who had a private pension plan were 67 percent
less   likely to quit   for job-related reasons; yet in equation 3.4            the

existence of a pension plan reduces the probability of exogenous                quits   by

only 36 percent and     is   statistically insignificant.25 It should be noted

that the negative effect of PENS might       be      the result of a simultaneous

relationship between the existence of private pension plans              and   the prob-

ability of quitting. If the availability of a private pension plan is

dependent on job tenure and      if   future separation rates are    correlated
with job tenure, then the pension coefficient could reflect the influ-

ence of job tenure on the existence of        a private pension olan. As         will

be   seen   below, once job tenure is    introduced    into the equation, the ef-

fect of     PENS on the probability of quitting is, in fact, diminished.
       We also have evidence that institutional           factors have strong ef-
fects on job mobility. For exaxnnle, we find that individuals in the

public sector are 69 percent less likely to quit           their jobs.    This

result   suggests that either public employment inhibits job mobility or
that individuals who prefer job stability choose public sector jobs.
We can also analyze the effect of union membership on the probability
of quitting. Since the NLS does not provide a measure of union


   25A more comniete study of the effects of pension plans on separation
rates would take into account the tvoe of vesting provisions in the plan.
Unfortunately, the NLS data do not provide this information.

membership until the 1969 survey, we can       only    analyze its effect on the

probability of quitting between 1969 and 1971. We find that an individ-

ual who was a member of a union in 1969 was 75 percent less likely to

quit his job during the next two years, not holding job tenure              con—

stant. 26,27
        Finally, we   also included two    variables   to measure the extent of

unemployment   that the   individual has   undergone during the past year:
WKS, the number of weeks unemployed, and SPELLS,          the   number   of spells
of    unemployment. Generally, we find that WKS has       an insignificant

effect   on the probability of quitting with one important         exception:
The probability of being pulled from the job by getting a better job

offer   is inversely related to WKS, holding SPELLS constant. This find-
ing could be interpreted as evidence that peoule who have long periods
of unemployment might be viewed as undesirable job applicants by firrs,
thus lowering their probability of being pulled from the job. In fact,
an additional week of unemployment leads to a decrease of 13             percent in
the   probability   of finding a better job offer. On      the other hand,
SPELLS has a strong positive effect on the probability of quitting for

all groups. On the average, an additional spell of unemt,loyment, hold-

ing WKS constant, roughly doubles the probability of quitting




   26For the sake of brevity, these regressions are not given in the
tables.
     27There
           is a possibility that the negative effect of union member-
ship on the quit rate is due to a simultaneous relationship in that
people who have little job stability would have no incentive to join
unions.
                                        — 26 —




the   current job.    This effect is probably    due   to the fact that   SPELLS is

a   oroxy for job separations that occurred within the past year prior to
entering   the current job. Thus it indicates that mobility is most likely

at early stages of tenure.

        This effect is even more strongly observed through the use of the

variable TENURE (current job tenure as of 1966) in Table 5. This table

contains ordinary     least   squares regressions using the reservation wage

as the wage variable; the maximum likelihood logit program would           not
converge   in the estimation of these regressions.28 The effect of TENURE

on the probability of quitting is strong].v negative for all samples,

although for the sake of brevity we only show the ecuation for all quits.

For   example, from   equation 5.1 we obtain the fact that an additional

year at the current job       reduces the probability of quitting   by 15 per-

cent. This result can be explained through the use of the specific

traininghypothesis. That is, there is a positive correlation between
the volume of specific training and job duration thus inhibiting in-
dividuals with longer job tenure, ceteris aribus, from quitting. As

explained in Part II, an alternative hvoothesis is that individuals

and employers view the first few years of a job as a trial "match."

If either the employer or employee find the match incompatible then

job separation will occur. According to this hypothesis, once this

initial trial period has elapsed, we would expect mobility not to be

affected   by job tenure. This implication can be tested by breaking up the

TEIflJRE variable into a set of duirtmies.          We also do this in Table 5 where

we only show the coefficients of the job tenure dummies, although all

the variables shown in equation 5.1 were included in the regression.

The results are striking. The probability of auitting the job within

the first three years of job tenure is 378 percent higher than that of

quitting after 33 years of job tenure. This percentage effect drops

dramatically to 74 percent in the second three years of job tenure.

Thereafter, no significant relative effects of job tenure on the prob-

ability of quitting are observed, although weak positive effects ecist

until eleven years of job tenure. These results support the "matching"

view of mobility since the effect of tenure is much stronger in the

early years.

      It is important    to   note that   the    introduction of job tenure into

the quit   regression   reduces the significance of several variables, for

example, the wage rate which becomes insignificant and •ension plans

which become less significant. In our discussion of the effects of

private   pension plans, we had indicated that the pension plan variable
could be simultaneously related to the quit rate through job tenure.
The results in Table 5 confirm this hyothesis. Similarly, once job
tenure is held constant, the wage effect is diminished since wage
levels and job tenure are strongly and positively correlated.29 The
question arises, however, as to whether a correctly specified quit


   29For a detailed discussion of the        relationship between job tenure
and wage levels, see Sorj as (1975).

function    should include job tenure as an exogenous variable. It can be

argued that the same process which determines the probability of quitting

in 1966—69 also determines job tenure as of 1966, since tenure in the

current job is the result of the process determining mobility in earlier

periods. To the extent that           the   variables determining job mobility in

the 1966—69 period also determined tenure in the current job as of 1966,

it is not surprising that the coefficients on the other variables are

affected significantly. In fact, it is worth noting that the R2 obtained

in    estirtatina a regression of the quit rate on job tenure is only slightly
smaller (.12) than the explanatory power obtained by including job tenure
in addition to the personal, human capital, and job—related variables.

3. Persona]. Characteristics
      The regressions in Table         3 also   include a set of variables describ-
ing the    individual's background,         finances, marital status and other
characteristics. Overall, these variables have little effect on the
probability of quitting. For example, while education has a positive
effect on quits, it is always insignificant. Similarly, time remaining
in the labor force (defined as the exuected age of retirement minus
current age) has a weak positive effect on the            probability   of quitting.
This is consistent with an       investment     view of job mobility. That is,

the   longer the   time   remaining   in the   labor force the larger the payoff
to any investment in mobility; thus the more likely the individual is
to   quit his job. Moreover, REM has no effect on the probability of
quitting for persona]. reasons since for these individuals quitting is
not an investment decision, but the result of exogenous factors.

Finally, a duy indicating        the wife's participation in the labor force

(WLFP)    has the   strongest effect of all the persona].      characteristics.

Its    positive effect can be interpreted as evidence of an intra—fainily
substitution      effect. That is, individuals whose wives have a close

attachment to the labor      force   are more likely to have a weaker attach-

ment to their jobs. It is interesting           to   note that WLFP   is weakest
for individuals who quit their jobs          for personal (exogenous) reasons.

This    is consistent with the hypothesis that cuitting for personal rea-
Sons is a response to an exogenous shift in the individual's opnortu—
nity set and cannot be readily explained by systematic shifts in
economic variables.

4. Quits Between 1966 and       1971

         Table   6 presents the equations estimating the determinants of the
probability of quitting between 1966 and 1971. This ødifies the
previous empirical analysis by extending the period under study to in-
clude a downturn in the business cycle. By comparing Tables 3 and 6,
it can be seen that with one exception the results for 1966-71 are
identical to those for 1966—69. The exception is the estinated effect

of education. Recall that EDUC had a weak effect on the probability of

quitting in 1966—69; in Table        6,   however, EDUC has   a positive and sig-
nificant effect.      We had shown    in   Part II that education would have a

positive effect on the probability of quitting because of the             existence
of specific training.

B.    The Determinants of Layoffs
        Our analysis of mobility has concentrated on separations initiated
by the individual. In this section we focus on separations initiated by
the firm. The NLS data provide two categories of firm-initiated separa-
tions: layoffs and discharges. Since most of these separations are
layoffs, we   ignore   the distinction between the two   categories.   Table 7
presents the set of layoff regressions both for 1966—69 and 1966—71.


1. The Wage

        In studying worker-initiated mobility, we argued that the relevant

wage variable underlying the individual's decision to quit was the

reservation wage, Clearly when we analyze firm-initiated separations the

relevant wage variable should be the actual wage, since the actual wage

is   more positively correlated than the reservation wage with the firm's
labor costs. Note that the actual wage has a positive (but insignificant)
effect on the probability of being laid—off. This finding is consistent
with a specific—training hypothesis only if there is a negative corre-
lation between firm—financed and worker—financed specific training. A
more likely explanation is provided by the hyoothesis discussed in Part II
that workers are comensated for working in jobs that have high layoff
rates   by receiving higher   wages. We can test this hypothesis further by
including   a set of industry dummies in the regression in order       to capture
the   inter—industry differences in layoff rates •   Within   an industry one

would expect a weaker relationship between layoff rates and wages. In

fact,      the wage coefficient is reduced by about 50 percent once industry is
                    30
held    constant.


2. Job Characteristics

        While   job satisfaction (LI) had a negative and significant effect
on quits,     it has no effect on the probability of being laid off. A riori,

however, this result is not as obvious as it seems. That is, one could
argue that individuals who like their jobs are better workers and are less
likely to be laid off. Alternatively, if LI is positively correlated
with   fringe benefits and   hence labor costs, the layoff rate would be
positively     related to LIKE. The   observed coefficient then is the result
of   two   coposing forces. It is also worthwhile to note the negative and
significant effect of pension plans on layoff        rates. This would be con-

sistent with the hynothesis that individuals who have pension plans at
their firms strive for better job performance in order to reduce the
probability of being laid off.
        The results in Table 7 show that unemployment in the last calendar
year (as measured by WKs and SPELLS) is positively related to the prob-
ability of layoff. These variables, of course, could be proxies for
some undesirable characteristics of the        worker thus increasing the rob-
ability of involuntary turnover.


   30The only positive and significant industry coefficient was construc-
tion (the omitted industry was agriculture) which had a coefficient of
.106 and a t-value of 2.26.   It is interesting to note that the industry
variables do not signflcantly affect the wage coefficient in the quit
regression (for example, see Table 10).
                                          — 35   —




        Job tenure is introduced into the layoff equation in Table           8. Regres-
siori   8.1 shcws that job tenure has a strong negative effect on the prob-

ability of layoff: An additional year of job tenure decreases the prob-

ability of layoff by 12 percent. Again this could be due to the exis-

tence of firm—financed specific training, although as can be seen in Table

8, the relative effect of job tenure becomes zero past the first three

years of employment. This finding would tend to su art the "matching"

hypothesis discussed earlier. It is interesting to note the difference

in the effects of the job tenure dummies betzeen quits and             layoffs. There
is   a much sharper decline in the effects of the tenure dumties in the lay-

off regression. This could be evidence of some degree of job seasonality.

Due   to   the construction of the data set, termination of temporary jobs

could not be distinguished from actual layoffs. Thus it could be that

the strong effect of      short   job tenure on the probability of being laid

off is merely evidence of a large         proportion of "layoffs" that are

actually      seasonal jobs.31
         We also found that union    membership had a   weak positive effect on

the probability of being laid off between 1969 and           1971,   not holding

job tenure constant. This could occur because in unionized firms              the
employer      would have less flexibility in reducing wages. Therefore, the

only alternative open to him        in   the face of a reduction in product de-

mand might be to cut employment.32

3. Personal Characteristics

        One striking difference between the quit and layoff regressions is

the effect of education. As discussed in the previous section, educa-

tion had a positive and insignificant effect on the probability of quit-

ting.    The results   in Table   7 show   that education is an important deter-
minant of layoff rates: an additional year of schooling reduces the

probability of being laid off by 9 percent. This finding is consistent

with    a specific training hypothesis only if there is a negative corre-
lation between firm—financed and worker—financed specific human capital.
A more likely explanation is       that   jobs requiring more human capital are
less unstable. Note that the effect of education on layoff rates is
weaker   in   1966—71. It appears    that   during   the 1969—71 downturn in   the
business   cycle the more educated men were more likely to be laid-off

than during    the 1966—69 period, thus more closely resembling the less
educated individuals. 33 Finally, note that the positive effect of the
wife's   wage is consistent with our earlier evidence of an intra—family

substitution effect.


C.   The Determinants   of   Separations

        In this section we analyze the determinants of job separations with-

out distinguishing between quits and layoffs. It will be recalled that

the matching hypothesis discussed in Part II predicted that there is no




   33it is important to note that the 1969—71 recession was not typical of
other business cycle downturns. Usually a downturn in the cycle increases
the differential between the layoff rates of the less educated and highly
educated workers.

useful distinction    between   quits and layoffs in studying the determinants
of    job mobility. Table 9 presents the regressions estimating the deter-

minants of the separation rate.         An interesting conclusion to be drawn

from Table 9 is that       the explanatory power of the independent variables

in    the separation rate equation (whether measured in terms of X2 or R2)
is higher than the explanatory power of these variables in the separate
quit and layoff    equations.

          coefficients in equation 9.1 are mostly weighted averages of the
         The

coefficients observed in the separate quit and layoff equations reported
in regressions 4.1 and 7.1. Note, however, that although the matching

hypothesis predicts a negative correlation between separation rates and

the wage rate when job tenure is not held constant, the results in Table 9

do    not support this predicticn.

ID.    Separations from Short and     Long   Jobs
     Contrary to the matching hyothesis, our ana1ys in Sections A and
B indicate that it is imvortant to distinguish between quits and layoffs
in analyzing the determinants of job seoarations. Moreover, the results
in Section C only partially support the matching view of job mobility.
However, we argued    in   Part II   that the matching hypothesis is most relevant
during the early years of job tenure. Therefore, in order to more accu-
rately test the matching hypothesis, we divide our        into individuals
                                                         sample

whose job tenure as of 1966 is less than or equal to three years (short
jobs) and individuals whose tenure is longer than three years (long jobs).
It is interesting to note that the probability of a job separation for
individuals in short jobs is 53 percent, and 56 percent of these separa-
tions are quits. For longer jobs the respective statistics are 7 percent

and 59 percent. To test the relevance of the matching model, we estimated

separation, quit, and     layoff   regressions setarate1y for short and long

jobs. The wage coefficients from these regressions are given in Table

10.

        Once   we take account of the compensating differential effect on the
probability of a layoff by holding industry constant, we find that the
actual   wage has no effect   on the probability of separating, quitting, or
being    laid off from a short job. In Part II, we showed that, according

to the matching hypothesis, there was no distinction between quits and

layoffs, and that the wage rate would not be related to either when

analyzing separations from jobs of short tenure. The results in Table 10

seen to indicate that the matching process is useful for understanding

the determinants of separations from short jobs.

         For longer jobs, wages are negative and significant in determining

the orobabilitv of separating       or quitting, and have a weak, negative ef-
fect on the probability of a layoff. Once we realize that the layoff
coefficient may have a tositive bias if we are not adequately controlling

for compensatory differentials, these findings are consistent with a
specific training hypothesis that assumes a positive correlation between
worker—financed and firm—financed specific training investment.
         It is important to note that the    results in   Table   10   are not af-
fected by      the introduction of job tenure into the regressions. The wage

coefficients from these regressions are shown in Appendix Table A-6. In

the case of long jobs, job tenure is often insignificant and the wage

coefficient does not change. Indeed, in these regressions the                 is not

substantially        increased when job tenure is held constant. Therefore,          within
the set of long jobs, there appears to be little need to standardize for

job tenure. In the case of short jobs, however, tenure has a significant

negative effect and           increases   R2 substantially although the wage coeffi-

cients are still insignificant in the quit equation. This result, there-

fore, indicates that the matching process may take place in a very short

span of time within the job.

         The reader might wonder why the results in our earlier tables point

out the need to differentiate between quits and layoffs even though most

mobility      occurs early in the         job and the matching hymothesis explains

this    turnover. The answer relates to the fact that in the pre—retirement
years,   most individuals are         in long jobs, and a regression pooling the
two groups (short and long jobs) would be heavily weighted toards an

analysis      of    the   determinants of    mobility     from long jobs.

E.     Serial   Correlation In      Job    Mobility
         In   our discussion of job tenure, we have already found that individ-
uals who have short current job duration are much more likely to separate
from the        either through quit or layoff. This would suggest that there
              job

is a    strong serial correlation in job mobility. We can further explore
this relationship by examining the effects of mobility in 1966—69 on                 the

probability of job separation in 1969—71.
         In   Table       11, we present selected coefficients from regressions est—
mating the probability of quitting and being laid-off in 1969—71. The
results are quite striking. The probability of quitting the 1969 job in
the 1969—71 period is 227 percent higher if a quit occurred in 1966—69,

while   it is 286 percent higher if a layoff occurred in 1966—69. On the

other hand, the probability of being laid off in 1966—71 is 157 percent

higher    if a cuit occurred in the   previous    three years, while   it is 318

percent if a layoff occurred in the 1966—69 period. We can summarize
these results by noting that the probability of quitting does not de-
pend on the nature of the previous job separation, while the probabil-
ity of    layoff is more strongly related to a previous layoff than to a

previous quit. This result, of course, could be due to the fact that

terminations of seasonal jobs are coded as layoffs in the NLS.            More

generally,    the results in Table 11 show that certain individuals are
chronic   movers. It is well known     that   turnover rates decline with age,

yet   we find that within this group of middle—aged men there exists a
subset    of individuals who are   moving continuously. Moreover, it       is
interesting that the nature of the earlier separation does not strongly

determine    the nature of the subsequent separation once we account for
some degree of seasonality in the layoff group.

         In summary, the evidence from Tables 10 and 1]. suggest the Irnoor—
tance of the matching process in the first few years of job tenure once
we abstract from    the   effect of coxnensating differentials in jobs that

have high layoff rates. As predicted by the matching hyothesis, we

observe   an insignificant wage coefficient in the regressions explaining

quits and layoffs from short jobs. Moreover, the importance of the
matching process within the      job is highlighted by the fact that the
nature of the    previous separation does not determine the nature of the

separation from the current (short) job.

 III.    The Consequences of Job Mobility

         The previous sections have focused on an analysis of the determinants

of job mobility. We now       extend   our   study   by concentrating on the effects

of job mobility on the earnings profile. Previous work on the NLS by

Borjas    (1975) and Parnes   and Neste]. (1975) has       found that   quitters had

wage    growth over the survey neriod at least as great as the non—changers.
It is important to note, however, that these studies examined the wage
growth of these different groups contemporaneously with the job change.
Thus their results captured a mix of both the immediate and future gains
in wages from job mobility. We extend their work in several respects.
First, we distinguish between the immediate gains from job mobility and
the future gains from job mobility. We comnare individuals who quit
their jobs in 1966—67 (and did not change jobs thereafter) with individ-
uals who stayed with the same employer throughout the five—year period.
The relevant comparisons are the iximiediate wage gains (i.e. 1966—67) and
future wage growth (1967—71). This enables us to answer the question of
whether the effect of mobility on the earnings rofi1e is a parallel up-
ward shift. The second contribution of our analysis is to distinguish
between job—related   quits   and   quits due to exogenous reasons as well as

between quits and layoffs. Of course, the            a               that
                                                         priori expectation is
if    a quit is to pay at all, it should pay for those individuals who left
their job   because of   a better job offer. Finally, we will briefly analyze
the   effects of the different types of job separation on           job satisfaction.
In inter reting the   effects of job mobility, however, one should bear in

mind that individuals who leave their job might            leave precisely because
they have lower wage growth. Moreover          another problem arises in that we
                                       — 46   —




compare   the wage growth in the early years of job tenure for movers with
the wage   growth in the later years of job tenure for stayers. Thus com-

paring the subsequent wage growth of movers to that of the stayers might

yield a biased estimate of the true effect of job mobility.


A. Thmediate Wage Gains

        Colus 12.1 arid 12.2 in Table 12 present the regressions explain-

ing percentage wage growth in the 1966—67 period for individuals who

either did not change jobs at all in 1966-71 or who changed jobs in

1966—67 only. By including a set of durmties indicating the nature of

job mobility we are able to measure the immediate gains from mobility

since   each dtmny variable gives us     the percentage difference in wages

between    changers and   non—chancers.34 Co1tnns 12.3 and 12.4 present

similar regressions explaining 1966—69 percentage wage growth. In

these latter regressions, the sample includes individuals who either

did not change jobs at all in 1966—71 or who changed jobs in 1966—69

only. The duy variables indicating job mobility therefore capture

the gains   to   mobility that occurred in 1966—69. note that this

definition   of   immediate wage gains entails a longer period, arid is

therefore less exact than     the   analysis of 1966—67 wage growth.




   34Note that the sample sizes in this section have declined slightly.
This is due to our restricting the sarnnle to men who reported their
wage in periods subseauent to 1966. Also note that our use of per-
centage wage growth (and not absolute growth) is suggested by the
han capital modal of wage determination. For an exposition of the
model see Mincer (1974).

        In   Table   12, four dummy variables are used to capture the effect of
job mobility on wage growth: LAYOFF, indicating whether or not the in-

dividual was laid off from the 1966 job; PERSONAL, indicating if the

individual quit his 1966 job for exogenous reasons; PULL, if the quit

took place because he found a better job; and PUSH, indicating that the

quit took place because of dissatisfaction with his 1966 job. The ex-

cluded group, of course, are those individuals who did not change em-

ployers.

        Generally, the dimmy variables indicating type of quit are insig-

nificant except for the effect of PULL on 1966—69 wage growth. We find

that individuals who quit the 1966 job because they found a better job

have percentage wage gains      that   are 18 percent higher in 1966—69 (or

6 percent higher per year) than those who           stayed.     In the 1966—67

period, however, the effect of PULL is 12 percent per year. Moreover,

in this shorter period the effect of PUSH is negative and         slightly
significant. Note that these results point out the need for di3tinguish—

ing between different types of quits. That is, in order to correctly

estimate     the effects of job mobility on wage growth, one needs to know
the motivating force behind the individual's decision to quit. This
finding is even more strongly observed when we utilize a more detailed
breakdown     of quits   as in Table 13. One    striking result is the   differ-

ence in the effects of the several categories which composed PUSH in

Table 12:      (a) individuals who quit due to dissatisfaction with wages;

(b) individuals who quit due to dissatisfaction with working conditions;

and   (c) quitting    due to interoersonal relations. it is worth    noting

that   both quits due to dissatisfaction with work and quits due to inter-

personal problems in the job have strong negative effects on the immediate

wage gain, while quits due to dissatisfaction with wages have a positive

effect which becomes significant in the 1966—69 period. Thus If an in-

dividual disliked a nonpecuniary aspect of his job, he is willing to

trade away some of his wages. As will be seen below, the trade is "fair"

sincethese individuals gain significantly in terms of job satisfaction.
These findings show that to examine the effects of quits on wage growth
it   is important to distinguish between the different types of quits;

otherwise,    the net impact of quitting will be a conglomeration of many

diverse effects.

         The effect of LAYOFF on the immediate wage growth is interesting.

We find that individuals who were laid off in 1966—67 had a significant

increase in their wage growth as compared to the non—movers. Yet in

1966—69, LAYOFF during that period has no effect on contemporaneous wage

growth. Thus we conclude that men who were involuntarily separated from

the 1966 job do at least as well as those who did not change jobs in the

1966—71 period. This could be due to the fact that our sample       of   lay-

off s is restricted to "successful" searchers——that is, men who were laid

off in 1966—67, but stayed with the new employer for the remaining four
         35
years.

         We also included a vector of personal and job characteristics in

the regressions    in Table 12.   Overall,   these variables are not good


     351f we do not restrict the sample to successful searchers, the effect
of   being laid off on the immediate wage gain becomes insignificant, though
still positive.    The coefficient is .0317 Ct =     .91).

predictors of an individual' s wage growth.36 The most stable results are
the effects of time remaining in the labor force, REM, and changes in
marital status. We find that REM has a positive and significant effect
on wage growth. Theoretically, the effect of REM on wage growth is
ambiguous.  First, the longer the time remaining, the higher the payoff
to on—the—job investment. Clearly, more investment would take place at
younger    ages, creating a positive relationship between REM and wage

growth.     On the other hand, it can       be   argued that the later in the life

cycle    the   quit occurs, .   the more incentive there is to get as large an
immediate wage gain as possible. This could be tested by examining the
effect of REM      on the wage growth      of individuals who quit. However,        the

results    still show a positive effect of REM on wage growth. Thus it
seems that the investment hypothesis dominates. We also find that in-
dividuals who suffered a marital breakup during the period (MARl =                 1

and MAR2        0), experience smaller wage growth during this period.
        The 1969 NLS questionnaire provides additional information on the
nature of the      job change. In particular, it gives us data on whether the

individual had a new       job lined up nrior to the separation, The data show
that    47 percent of thce who r!uit        had a new job versus 12 er—
cent of those who were laid off. 'oreover, within the grouo of quitters,

63 percent of those who quit         for   job—related reasons had a new job

versus 12 percent of those who quit           for   exogenous or   personal   reasons.

The   similarity between the latter group and the individuals who were

laid off points out the exogenous            nature of       these cuits. It is important
to note that having a new job lined up has a strong positive                 effect on the
1969—71 wage gain of individuals who changed jobs during that oeriod in-

dicating the significance of on—the—job search. However, even when we hold

having a new job constant2we still find that it is important to distinguish
                                   37
among   tyes   of separat.ons.            i•!oreover interaction terms between hav:ng a

job lined up and nature of the separation were generally insignificant.

        Finally, we compared the effects of separating from a short job

(tenure . 3 years) aid separating from a long job (tenure > 3 years).

Recall that in explaining the determinants of separating from a short

job we found that there was no meaningful. distinction between quits

and layoffs. The question arises as to whether in studying the con-

sequences of separating from short jobs one should distinguish between

quits and layoffs. We find, that in comparing individuals who separated

from short jobs with individuals who stayed in short jobs the results

reported in Table 12 still hold, i.e., there is a meaningful distinction

between quits and layoffs. In comparing individuals separating from

long   jobs with individuals staying in long jobs, one important new result

is obtained: being laid off from a long job has a significant                  native
effect on inediate wage growth. Quitting from a long job has the same

effects as those reported in Table 12.


B. Future Wage Gains

        We have already shown that job mobility creates discontinuous shifts

in the individual's earnings profile. We now consider whether mobility

in the pre—retirement years has any             effect    on the subsequent wage growth

in the new job, i.e., on the slope of the earnings profile. Again, we

consider two time         oericds:    1967—71 for individuals who changed in 1966—67,

and 1969—71        for   those   who changed in 1966—69. The      results are presented

in   Table   14.
        The most striking result is the negative and significant effect of

LAYOFF    on future wage growth. That is,             even though the immediate      effect
of a layoff on wage growth is positive, over the long run these individ-

uals exnerjence smaller wage growth than those men who stayed on the job.

Generally, the effects of a quit on future wage growth are insignificant,

except for the coefficient of finding a better job on 1969—71 wage growth

which is negative. However, even for this group, the net gain of a quit

over the five—year period, 1966—71, is positive. The fact that quitting

in general has an insignificant effect on future wage growth suggests

that   the gain to voluntary mobility (at least for those who were "pulled"
from the job) is one of an immediate wage gain rather than a continuing
increase in wages.          This   result   might be due to   the age   range of the
sample.      Clearly at older ages, the finiteness of life would             imply   little

on—the—job investment taking place. Thus these individuals undertake mo—

bility not as a means of finding jobs which provide higher levels of job

investment but as a method of obtaining an immediate increase in wages

by shifting to higher, but parallel (to that of stayers), earnings

profiles.38


C. Nonpecuniarv Gains

         Up to this point we have analyzed the effects of job mobility on

wage growth. In this section, we explore its effects on job satisfac-

tion. We defined an individual as "liking" his job if he indicated

that he liked his job "very much" or "fairly well." Table 15 shows

the percentage of individuals who liked their jobs in 1966 and 1969 by

type of job separation during this period. The results are extremely

interesting. About 93 percent of the individuals who stayed in the job

in the 1966—69 period liked the job in 1966, while only 83 percent of

those who quit their job in the next three years were satisfied with

their 1966 job. It is remarkable that by 1969, the percentage of in-

dividuals who liked their jobs was 94 percent for both groups. In fact,

most of the increase in job satisfaction for those individuals who quit

is due to the increase attained by those individuals who were "pushed"

out of the 1966 job—that is, those individuals who left the 1966 job

because they were dissatisfied with a job—related characteristic such as

wages,   work, and interpersonal relations.


   381t is imPortant, however, to note that our analysis was carried out
in percentage terms and since the stayers have higher average wage levels
than the quitters, those who remain in the job achieved larger absolute
wage increases in the survey period.

        The results in Table 15 are quite important since they provide empir-

ical. evidence that an individual does not necessarily leave his job in

order to achieve a money wage gain. In fact, for the         grouns   that achieved

a significant increase in job satisfaction we find insignificant money

wage   gains (see Table 12), while for the grouo that was '1pulled" from the
1966 job and that achieved significant money wage gains, only a small in-
crease in      job   satisfaction can be   detected.


IV.    Summari

        This   paper has analyzed the determinants and consequences of middle—

age job mobility. Traditional analysis has distinguished between two tyes

of separations: au.tts and layoffs. It can be argued by viewing the job

as a marriage between employer and worker that this distinction has no

empirical      content and adds   nothing to our understanding of the determi-

nants of job separation. On the other hand, persons quitting their jobs

for   personal reasons may not have the same economic motivation        as those

who   quit   for job—related reasons. This latter argument would suggest an

even more detailed breakdown anng types of auits. By utilizing this

latter breakdown of job separations we obtained        several major empirical
findings:
        1.   Theoretical, models of job separation are couched in terms of      a
reservation wage. We took advantage of the fact that the NLS provides
this information, and as expected we found that the probability of
quitting for job—related reasons was significantly and negatively re-
lated to the      reservation   wage when job tenure was not held constant.
The probability of quitting for personal. reasons, however, was less
                                      — 59 —




strongly    related to the reservation wage since this type of quit is due to

exogenous forces. Once job tenure was held constant, the effect of the

wage   on quit rates was diminished in all samples.
        2. The availability of a pension plan had a strong negative effect
on job-related quits but did not determine quitting for personal reasons.
Similarly, personal characteristics such as time remaining in the labor
force and   the   wife's labor force status bad   systematic   effects on job-'
related quits and insignificant effects on exogenous quits. These find-
ings   were invariant to the inclusion of job tenure in the regression.

        3. The probability of layoff was positively related to the in-

dividual's wage rate and this effect became stronger when job tenure

was held constant. The positive wage effect can be explained by compen-

sating differentials individuals in jobs with a high degree of insta-

bility will demand higher wages. Indeed, when industry was held constant

in the regression, the positive wage coefficient was diminished.

        While the above results support the argument that the quit-layoff

distinction as well     as a more detailed breakdown of quits is meaningful,
our analysis   showed that the matching hypothesis has relevance as well:
        4. We found strong evidence of serial correlation in job mobility.
In particular, we observed that most senarations occur during the first
few years of job tenure. This result is evidence of a matching process
between firm and worker that occurs in the early years of the job as
both parties learn about each other.
        5. The nature of previous job separations was not a strong deter-
minant of the nature of future job separations.       This finding conforms

with the predictions of the matching hypothesis that the quit-layoff

breakdown is uninformative.

        6.   Since it can be argued that the matching hypothesis is most rele-

vant for short jobs, we separately analyzed the determinants of searations

of short jobs versus long jobs. Cnce we took account of the        compensating
differential effect operating in the layoff equation, we found that the

wage rate had no effect on the probability of separating, quitting, or

being laid off from a short job. The distinction between quits and lay-

offs, however, remained in the analysis of long jobs.

        Finally, we analyzed the consequences of job mobility during the pre—

retirement years. Our analysis focused on the effects of job mobility on

wage growth and job satisfaction:

        7. We found significant evidence of the need to distinguish between

types of quits. In particular, we observed that individuals who were

pulled (i.e. found     a   better job) from their jobs had higher immediate wage

gains than stayers, while individuals who were pushed (i.e.      were   dis-

satisfied with the current job) had smaller wage gains than stayers. We

also found   that in   this age range, quitting did not affect the slope of

the earnings profile in the new job.

        8. Job mobility affected not only the individual's money wages, but

also his degree of job satisfaction. For example, while individuals who

quit because they were dissatisfied with their current job had negative or

zero   immediate wage gains (relative to the stayers), they experienced
significant gains in job satisfaction. These individuals evidently quit
not for wage gains, but for nonecuniary aspects of the job.
       The reader will recall that at the outset of this pacer, we discussed
several hypotheses which are useful in understanding the determinants and
                                   — 61 —




consequences of job mobility. The findings presented in this paper indicate

that once we take account of compensatory differentials in jobs with high

layoff rates, the matching view of job turnover is relevant for explaining

separations from short jobs. In the case of long jobs, however, the

evidence points to the relevance of specific training in explaining job

turnover.
