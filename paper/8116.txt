1    Introduction

The origins of nominal exchange rate dynamics remain elusive. In particular, there is no widely
accepted explanation for the sizable short and medium-term movements in the dollar during the
√üoating-rate period. More generally, theoretical models relating exchange rates to macroeconomic
fundamentals are still outperformed by simple time series models in forecasting spot rates over
short and medium-term horizons (Frankel and Rose 1995).
    This paper provides new perspective on the poor performance of exchange rate models by
focusing on the information structure of trading between FX dealers in the spot market. I develop
a new theoretical model of FX trading that emphasizes the role of incomplete and heterogeneous
information in dealers‚Äô trading decisions. The model shows how an equilibrium distribution of FX
transaction prices and orders can arise at each point in time from the optimal trading decisions
of dealers. This result directs attention away from the traditional view that there is a single
equilibrium value for the exchange rate. Instead, it motivates an empirical investigation of how
the equilibrium distribution of FX transaction prices is determined. The paper undertakes this
investigation with the aid of a new data set that details trading activity in the FX market. This
analysis reveals a striking new perspective on the source of exchange rate movements over all
horizons. In particular, I √ûnd that much of the short-term volatility in exchange rates comes from
sampling the equilibrium distribution of transaction prices that, under normal market conditions,
changes comparatively slowly. I also √ûnd that public news is rarely the predominant source of long
term exchange rate movements, a result that contrasts with the assumptions of traditional macro
models.
    The theoretical model of FX trading has its antecedents in the simultaneous trade model of
Lyons (1997) and is designed to capture the key features of the actual market. It focuses on trading
between dealers that accounts for approximately 75% of total trading in major currency markets.
The model is populated by a large number of dealers that trade directly with each other and with
non-bank customers. Dealers receive private information from two sources. The √ûrst comes from
outside the market in the form of customer orders. FX dealers cite customer-dealer transactions
as an important source of information (Lyons 2000). The second source of private information
comes from direct, interdealer transactions. As in the actual market, the details of each direct
transaction (e.g., the bid and ask quotes, the amount and direction of trade) are only observed
by the counterparties. This means that any information conveyed by a transaction diÔ¨Äuses slowly
across the market. Markets with this information structure are said to ‚Äúlack transparency‚Äù.

                                                 1
   The lack of transparency in both direct interdealer and customer-dealer transactions is a key
feature of the model and diÔ¨Äerentiates it from other multiple dealer models (see, for example,
Perraudin and Vitale 1995, Lyons 1997, and Evans and Lyons 1999). In those models, each dealer
quotes a publicly observed price at which she will trade any amount with any number of other
dealers. In equilibrium, this leads dealers to quote a common price to avoid being arbitraged. In
this model, by contrast, a dealer can only quote a price (good for any amount) to one other dealer
at a point in time. This restriction, and the lack of transparency, make it possible for diÔ¨Äerent
dealers to quote diÔ¨Äerent prices without opening themselves to arbitrage. The task of the model is
to show how heterogeneity in the customer orders received by diÔ¨Äerent dealers, combined with the
lack of transparency, leads to an equilibrium distribution of FX prices at which direct interdealer
trading takes place.
   Another key feature of the model is that it considers trading over a large (but √ûnite) number
of trading periods. This means that the duration of a trading period can be viewed as being as
short as the few seconds it takes to complete a transaction. By contrast, existing multiple dealer
models split the trading day into a few periods (e.g. Evans and Lyons 1999). These models are
better suited for examining the cumulative eÔ¨Äects of trading on exchange rate dynamics than the
origins of high frequency intraday dynamics that I shall study. Of course, the introduction of a large
number of trading periods is not without cost. In particular, it makes the optimization problem
facing dealers much more complex. One ‚Äúresolution‚Äù to this problem is to assume that dealers
make rule-of-thumb trading decisions as in Chakrabarti (2000). My approach is to cast the model
in an overlapping generations structure. Within this structure, the optimization problem facing
dealers becomes tractable and an analytic solution for market equilibrium can be found. The use
of an overlapping generations structure is new to the literature on FX trading.
   Section 2 of the paper presents the model and examines how an equilibrium distribution of FX
transaction prices arises. The model characterizes the dynamics of the transaction price distribution
in terms of two exogenous shocks: customer-order shocks and common knowledge (CK) news shocks.
The former drive the customer-orders received by dealers and represent the eÔ¨Äects of portfolio
shifts or changing liquidity demands by agents outside the FX market. CK news is characterized
by the simultaneous arrival of new information to all market participants and their homogeneous
interpretation of its implications for equilibrium prices. Clearly, CK news shocks are akin to the
public news shocks found in macro exchange rate models. I use the diÔ¨Äerent terminology to stress




                                                  2
the fact that the news must be heard simultaneously and must be homogeneously interpreted.1
    The model also characterizes the behavior of equilibrium interdealer order √üow. This variable
measures the direction of trade between dealers and is a proximate determinant of equilibrium
prices in many trading models. It plays an important role in my analysis because the theoretical
model makes predictions about the relationship between the distribution of prices and order √üow
that can be exploited empirically. In particular, the model shows that equilibrium order √üow is (i)
unaÔ¨Äected by CK news shocks, and (ii) lags behind prices in responding to customer order shocks.
While result (i) comes from many trading models, and follows naturally from the de√ûnition of CK
shocks, result (ii) is new to the theoretical literature.2 It implies that market-wide price movements
are useful in predicting future order √üow. This seems counter-intuitive from an eÔ¨Écient market‚Äôs
perspective: Can‚Äôt dealers exploit the information in prices about future orders to make larger
trading pro√ûts? However in this model, the market‚Äôs lack of transparency makes it impossible
for dealers to learn about market-wide prices quickly enough to exploit their predictive ability for
future order √üow. Thus, the lack of transparency plays a central role in the model. In fact, one can
demonstrate that the equilibrium breaks down if transparency in the market rises above a certain
level.
    With these results, I develop an empirical model that can be used to examine the origins
of exchange rate dynamics. The empirical model decomposes observed changes in transaction
prices into three components: a CK news component, an order √üow component, and a sampling
component. The former incorporates the traditional macro view of exchange rate dynamics in which
all innovations in spot rates are attributable to the arrival of public news in a CK framework. The
second component identi√ûes the eÔ¨Äects of customer order shocks, the external source of private
information to dealers. This component identi√ûes the degree to which asymmetric information
aÔ¨Äects equilibrium transaction prices. The sampling component arises from the fact that there is an
equilibrium transaction price distribution at each point in time. The dispersion in this distribution
re√üects the heterogeneous trading decisions dealers make in a market that lacks transparency.
    The empirical analysis begins in Section 3 with a description of the data. The data set details

   1
     An example of the distinction between CK and public news can be found in Brennan and Cao (1997). They study
a model where investors hold diÔ¨Äerent priors about the value of assets. When public news arrives, better-informed
investors change their valuation of the asset by more than the less well informed investors.
   2
     This lead-lag relationship between prices and order √üow does not appear in the Portfolio Shifts Model of Evans
and Lyons (1999). In that model cumulative order √üow during the trading day is a proximate determinant of the
price at which customer/dealer trades are conducted at the end of the day. Thus, causality runs from order √üow to
prices at a daily frequency. The model presented here focuses on intraday trading, so result (ii) refers to the high
frequency relationship between order √üow and prices.

trading activity in the spot FX market over a four-month period, May 1 to August 1996. These data
are unique in that they provide information on trading between FX dealers around the world.3 In
particular, they allow us to track the pattern of trade and FX prices in the direct interdealer market
on a transaction-by-transaction basis. As such, the data series constitute sequences of irregularly
spaced observations on a continuous trading process. This makes standard time series methods
based on regularly space observations inapplicable. Section 3 describes how GMM estimation
methods can be adapted to deal with the irregular spacing problem. Estimates are obtained from
the data series sampled over a √ûxed 5-minute observation window, allowing for the fact that the
window may correspond to varying spans of ‚Äúmarket time‚Äù: the time scale at which market processes
evolve at a constant rate.
    Section 4 reports the empirical results based trading in the DM/$, the most heavily traded
currency pair. These data reveal that there is considerable variation in the intensity at which trading
takes place between dealers. Some of the variation has a well-de√ûned intraday pattern that appears
consistent with dealers based in diÔ¨Äerent geographical locations entering and leaving the market.
However, actual trading intensity can diÔ¨Äer greatly from the intraday pattern on any particular
day. Transaction prices and order √üow also display some interesting statistical characteristics.
Price changes observed over a 5-minute interval appear to be non-normally distributed and display a
signi√ûcant degree of negative serial correlation. Order √üow, by contrast, is positively autocorrelated
and highly persistent. Although the serial correlation in price changes accords with the predictions
of the trading model, the persistence in order √üow does not.4 In fact, order √üow‚Äôs persistence
emerges as a puzzling feature of FX trading.
    The paper‚Äôs central empirical results come from the empirical model estimates and may be
summarized as follows:

    ‚Ä¢ The origins of exchange rate movements vary considerably according to the state-of-the mar-
       ket, measured by transaction intensity.

   3
     They diÔ¨Äer from the FX quotes shown on the screens of specialist information providers, such as Reuters, Telerate,
Minex and Quotron. These quotes represent indicative prices rather than the √ûrm prices at which a dealer will enter
into a transaction. Their relation to the transaction price data used here is discussed in Evans (1997). There exists a
large literature studying the quote data because this was the only source of market-wide information on FX trading.
A partial list of papers includes; Baillie and Bollerslev (1991), Bollerslev and Domowitz (1993) and Bollerslev and
Melvin (1994), Dacorogna, et al.(1993), Engle, Ito, and Lin, (1990), Goodhart and Giugale (1993), and Guillaume,
et al (1994a).
   4
     The source of the negative serial correlation in the trading model does not arise from ‚Äúnoise‚Äù or bid-ask bounce;
reasons that are often suggested for the presence of negative serial correlation in indicative FX quote changes (see, for
example, Zhou 1996). Nor, as I shall show, does the presence of serial correlation imply the existence of unexploited
pro√ûtable trading opportunities.


                                                           4
      ‚Ä¢ Under normal market conditions, the CK news accounts for approximately 15 per cent of the
        variance in short-term price changes. As trading intensity increases, the contribution of CK
        news rises to a peak of approximately 40 per cent.

      ‚Ä¢ The sampling component accounts for approximately 80 per cent of the variance in short-
        term price changes under normal market conditions. When trading intensity is very high, the
        sampling component‚Äôs contribution falls to 17 per cent.

      ‚Ä¢ Long-term price movements originate from both CK news and customer order shocks.5 When
        the transaction intensity is very low, more than 90 per cent of the variance of permanent
        shocks to the price level are attributable to CK news shocks. When the intensity is high, the
        CK contribution falls below 20 per cent. In these market states, approximately 80 per cent
        of the variance in permanent price shocks comes from customer orders.

      ‚Ä¢ Customer order shocks aÔ¨Äect transaction prices at least 20 minutes before interdealer order
        √üow. Their peak eÔ¨Äect on changing the price distribution occurs approximately 15 minutes
        after the shock and lasts for approximately 30 minutes. The strength of these eÔ¨Äects increases
        with transaction intensity. When intensity is high, customer order shocks account for more
        than 50 per cent of the variance in price changes over a 30 minute to 2 hour horizon.

      ‚Ä¢ Customer orders have both temporary and permanent eÔ¨Äects on the level of prices in all
        market states.

      These results provide new perspective on exchange rate dynamics in two respects. First, they
provide strong empirical support for the idea that equilibrium in the FX market is described by
a distribution of prices rather than a particular price level. The existence of this distribution is
key to understanding the short-term dynamics of exchange rates because so much of the variance
in observed price changes is attributable to the sampling component. Second, they challenge the
traditional macro view that emphasizes the role of public news as the primary source of exchange
rate movements. CK news shocks are rarely the predominant source of exchange rate changes over
both long or short horizons. Moreover, the contribution of customer order shocks to permanent
price movements points to a source of exchange rate dynamics, over macro relevant horizons, that
has been overlooked by traditional models. The concluding section of the paper discusses how these
observations may lead to the more empirically successful macro models of exchange rates.

      By de√ûnition, long-term price movements are not aÔ¨Äected by the samplingly component.


                                                        5
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical trading
model, analyses the equilibrium behavior of transaction prices and order √üow, and derives an
empirical model that can investigate the source of exchange rate dynamics. Section 3 describes the
data set and the econometric techniques used to study the data. Section 4 presents the empirical
results. Section 6 concludes.


2     A Model of Direct Interdealer Trading

This section presents a simple model of direct interdealer trading in the FX market. Interdealer
trading accounts for about 75% of total trading in major spot markets (the remaining 25% is be-
tween dealers and non-bank customers) and breaks into two transaction types, direct and brokered.
Direct trading between dealers accounts for about 50% of interdealer trade and brokered trading
accounts for about 50%.
    Direct interdealer trades result from bilateral conversations between dealers typically over a
sophisticated E-mail system (see below). A conversation is initiated when a dealer calls another
dealer on the system to request a quote. Users of the system are expected to provide a fast two-way
quote with a tight spread, which is in turn dealt or declined quickly (i.e., within seconds). Thus,
trade follows the so-called dealer protocol where quotes precede orders. The system allows a large
number of dealer pairs to hold conversations at the same time so many transactions can take place
simultaneously. Importantly, details of each conversation, such as the quotes and the decision of
the initiating dealer, are only known to the counterparties. They are never transmitted via the
system to other dealers in the market.
    In the model below, trading takes place simultaneously between pairs of dealers according to the
dealer protocol. The model also incorporates the information structure of direct dealing: Details
of each transaction are private information to the counterparties and only disseminate more widely
as further trading takes place. The model also conforms to the actual market in that each dealer
receives customer orders. These orders are a source of private information to dealers on the state
of the market and play an important role in the dynamics of transaction prices.


2.1   Structure

Consider a market in which two assets are traded, one riskless, and one with a stochastic payoÔ¨Ä
representing FX. The market comprises a continuum of dealers d ‚àà [0, 1) who are split equally


                                                 6
into two groups, {A : a ‚àà [0, 1/2)} and {B : b ‚àà [1/2, 1)} . Dealers trade with the public and
among themselves to maximize expected utility de√ûned over future wealth subject to an inventory
constraint that limits the number of periods they can hold a long or short FX position.6 Let Itd
denote the inventory of dealer d at the beginning of period t. Under the constraint, Itd must equal
zero at the end of each trading cycle that comprises two periods.
       The structure of the model is most easily described in terms of a dealer‚Äôs actions over the trading
cycle. Consider dealer a ‚àà A beginning her trading cycle at the start of period t with wealth wta and
no inventory, Ita = 0. At the beginning of the period, the dealer receives an order from a customer
for cat units of FX. This customer order is to be √ûlled at the market price; that is, the same price
as trades between dealers during period t. A positive value for cat represents the net purchase of
FX by the public. The customer order is only known to the recipient, dealer a. It is not observed
by other dealers in group A, or by any dealers in group B.
       After receiving the customer order, dealer a must choose the price, pat , at which she will √ûll the
customer order and trade with other dealers. Once this price is set, an order from dealer b ‚àà B
arrives for xbt units of FX. Dealer b is matched with dealer a according to an exogenous matching
mechanism. A positive (negative) value for xbt denotes that dealer b wishes to purchase (sell) FX.
Dealer a √ûlls the customer and dealer orders at the end of the period. Her wealth and inventory at
                                             a
the beginning of period t + 1 are therefore wt+1 = (cat + xbt )pat + wta and It+1
                                                                              a = ‚àí(ca + xb ).
                                                                                     t    t

       At the beginning of period t + 1, dealer a has the opportunity to initiate trade with the public
at price st+1 . This price is good for any amount the dealer wishes to trade and is observed by all
dealers. Dealer a now chooses the fraction of her inventory to trade with the public knowing that

√ûgure show the decisions and actions of a typical dealer in groups A and B respectively. Here we
can see how the trading cycles of dealers overlap in the typical manner of OLG models. During
any period dealers from one group are setting transaction prices while dealers from the other are
deciding how to manage their inventory. Notice that all interdealer transactions take place between
dealers from diÔ¨Äerent groups via an exogenous matching mechanism. This stops dealers from
sharing inventory risk by trading within a group. Dealers are also prohibited from initiating trades
with the public during the √ûrst period of their trading cycle.
    Figure 1 also shows how information arrives to each dealer. At the beginning of each period
all dealers learn about the outside price, st . At the start of their trading cycle, dealers also receive
customer orders, cdt . These orders are only observed by the recipient and so constitute a source
of private information. Dealers also receive information from trading. Trading takes place simul-
taneously between pairs of dealers so that no dealer knows market-wide prices or orders as he or
she trades. In the actual FX market, there is no mechanism reporting past market-wide prices or
orders, so dealers must infer these aggregates from their interactions with other individual dealers.
To keep the model tractable, I assume that market-wide price and order √üow information becomes
public with a one period delay7 : After trading has ending in period t, all dealers observe the average
transaction price and dealer order √üow from interdealer trading in period t ‚àí 1, denoted by pt‚àí1
and xt‚àí1 respectively. Thus, dealers make trading decisions before they obtain any market-wide
information on interdealer trading in the previous period.
    Equilibrium transaction prices and dealer orders are determined endogenously by dealers in
response to exogenous customer orders, cdt , and outside prices, st . The customer order received by
each dealer is comprised of common and idiosyncratic components:

                                               cdt = ct + udt ,
                                                                                                             (1)
                                               ct = vt + Œ±vt‚àí1 ,

where uit and vt are i.i.d. normal random variables with zero means and variances Œ£u and Œ£v . The

   7
     Ideally, the rate at which market-wide price and order √üow information became public would be determined
endogenously. In this case, trading between dealers via brokers would undoubtedly play a role because information
on brokered trades is disseminated across the whole market (see Lyons 2000). Presumably, brokered trading speeds
up the market-wide dissemination of information on direct interdealer trading. Hellwig (1981) provides the √ûrst
example of a rational expectations trading model where the transmission of market prices is delayed.

outside price is assumed to follow a random walk


                                                  st = st‚àí1 + Œµt ,                                                 (2)


where Œµt is an i.i.d. normal variable with mean zero and variance Œ£s .
    Several comments concerning the speci√ûcation of these processes are in order. Recall that the
duration of a trading period in this model is very short: it is only as long as is necessary to conduct
the transactions depicted in Figure 1. Thus, (1) and (2) characterize the behavior of cdt and st over
very short time periods. With this perspective, the random walk speci√ûcation implies that high
frequency FX returns are unpredictable given their own history (i.e., E[(st+1 ‚àí st )/st |st , st‚àí1 , ...] =
0). This implication of (2) makes outside prices semi-strong form eÔ¨Écient because their history
is known to all dealers and members of the public. The random walk characterization is also
consistent with existing empirical evidence on high frequency FX returns.8 The short duration of
a trading period also motivates the presence of serial correlation in cdt . The idea is that members of
the public place FX orders with dealers to facilitate real transactions elsewhere in the economy. If
these transactions take longer than FX transactions, the customer orders received by dealers will
generally be serially correlated.9 I assume that the serial correlation takes the form of an MA(1)
process for tractability.
    Equations (1) and (2) also embody an important assumptions about the public‚Äôs price elasticity
of demand for FX. Recall that st represents the price at which dealers can trade any amount of
FX with the public at the start of the second period in their trading cycle. Thus, ‚àÜst = Œµt can
be viewed as the change in the public‚Äôs inverse demand function. If the demand for FX were less
than in√ûnitely elastic, Œµt would generally be correlated with innovations in the public‚Äôs holdings of
FX. In this model, these holdings vary as a result of the trades initiated by dealers. Thus, in so
far as dealers‚Äô trading decisions are aÔ¨Äected by customer orders, Œµt should be correlated with the
lagged values of vt . Equations (1) and (2) imply that this correlation is zero because vt and Œµt are
independent serially uncorrelated shocks. Thus the speci√ûcation for customer orders and outside

   8
     While there is some evidence of weak negative √ûrst-order serial correlation in the high frequency returns con-
structed from indicative quotes, these are typically attributed to bid-ask bounce or ‚Äúnoise‚Äù (e.g., Zhou 1996, and
Andersen and Bollerslev 1998), factors that are absent from the theoretical model.
   9
     As an example of how serial correlation in customer orders can arise, suppose agents I and II sign a contract at
the start of period t which speci√ûes that I will pay II z units of FX in exchange for a good. Agent I places the order
for cat = z with dealer a ‚àà A and receives the FX within period t. The trade of goods and FX between I and II then
takes place. The earliest time at which II can sell the FX is in period t + 1 by placing a customer order of cbt+1 = ‚àíz
for some dealer b ‚àà B.

prices implicitly assumes that the public‚Äôs demand for FX is in√ûnitely elastic.10 This assumption
aids in the analysis that follows for two reasons. First, it greatly simpli√ûes the optimal trading
problem facing dealers. Speci√ûcally, it makes the speculative positions taken by dealers during
the second period of their trading cycles independent of inventory holdings. The implications of
relaxing this restrictions are discussed below. Second, it means that Œµt shocks represent CK news
about the value of FX: all dealers observe and interpret the implication of Œµt shocks for equilibrium
transaction prices in the same way. This would not be true if Œµt were correlated with vt‚àí1 . In this
case, the pricing implications of Œµt would be interpreted diÔ¨Äerently across dealers because they hold
diÔ¨Äerence priors about vt‚àí1 . DiÔ¨Äerentiating between the eÔ¨Äects of CK news and other shocks would
then be much harder.


2.2      Equilibrium

Equilibrium in this model is a described by a sequence of transaction price and order √üow distribu-
tions consistent with market clearing and the rational trading decisions of dealers. The requirements
of market clearing are very simple. In the √ûrst period of the trading cycle, dealers must √ûll customer
and dealer orders at a single price. In the second period, the dealer must trade with her assigned
counterparty at the price set so as to √ûnish the trading cycle with no FX inventory. Hence, the
order from dealer d at the end of her trading cycle is


                                       xdt = ‚àíŒªdt Itd = Œªdt (cdt‚àí1 + x‚àót‚àí1 ),                                   (3)


where x‚àót‚àí1 represents the dealer order she received one period earlier. (Hereafter, ‚Äú‚àó ‚Äù denotes
variables chosen by another dealer.) This condition must hold for every dealer in the market. It
implies that the dealer orders received during the √ûrst period of a trading cycle match the inventory
another dealer wishes to trade in the second period of their trading cycle.
       Trading decisions are made to maximize expected utility de√ûned over wealth at the end of
trading in period Td for d = {a, b}, where ITdd = 0. Formally, for dealer d starting her trading cycle

  10
    This contrasts with Evans and Lyons (1999) where the public‚Äôs overnight demand of FX is less than in√ûnitely
elastic. The model present in that paper focuses on how the cumulative eÔ¨Äects of FX trading aÔ¨Äect the daily dynamics
of exchange rates and so complements this analysis of intraday dynamics.

The terms on the right of (7) and (8) show the new information received between the beginning of
one period and the next. Public information arrives in the form of outside prices and the average
of past prices and order √üow. Dealers also receive private information between the start of periods
t ‚àí 1 and t in the form of cdt and p‚àót‚àí1 , the customer order and the price they were quoted during
trading in t ‚àí 1. Between the start of t and t + 1 dealers receive private information in the form of
x‚àót , the dealer order received in period t.
   To √ûnd the equilibrium, I √ûrst posit a form for the dynamics of the equilibrium distribution of
prices and dealer orders. Using these processes, I then solve the dealer‚Äôs optimization problem to
√ûnd how optimal prices and orders are set over the trading cycle. Finally, I check that the posited
dynamics for prices and orders are consistent with the solution for the optimization problems facing
all dealers. Appendix A provides a detailed derivation of the equilibrium. The results are presented
below.

      Proposition: If dealers hold rational expectations about the equilibrium process for
      prices and orders, and expected utility is de√ûned as

      V ar(x‚àót |‚Ñ¶dt ) and V ar(p‚àót+1 |‚Ñ¶dt+1 ) are constants that depend upon the parameters govern-
      ing equilibrium price and order √üow distributions. Typical elements of these distributions
      can be written as


                                          pdt = st + Œ∑1 cdt + Œ∑2 vÃÉt‚àí1

                                                                                               (11)
                                          xdt = Œ∑3 (vt‚àí1 + udt‚àí1 )                             (12)


      where Œ∑ 1 , Œ∑2 and Œ∑3 are all functions of the structural parameters, Œ∏, Œ±, Œ£v , Œ£u and
             d
      Œ£s . vÃÉt‚àí1 is dealer d0 s estimate of vt‚àí1 at the end of her trading cycle in t ‚àí 1. In
      equilibrium, this estimate is equal to vt‚àí1 + edt‚àí1 , where edt‚àí1 ‚àºi.i.d.N(0, Œ£e ) with Œ£e =
      Œ£u /(1 ‚àí (Œ∑2 /Œ∑1 )2 ).

   The equilibrium displays several noteworthy features. First, (11) and (12) describe elements
in the cross-sectional distribution of prices and orders. Customer orders are the sole source of
this heterogeneity. DiÔ¨Äerences in the customer orders received at the start of the trading cycle
directly contribute to the dispersion of prices (via cdt in eqn. 11) and also to the dispersion of
dealer orders chosen next period (via udt‚àí1 in eqn. 12). DiÔ¨Äerences in customer orders also lead
                                                          d , which also contribute to the dispersion
dealers to have diÔ¨Äerent estimates of vt‚àí1 , denoted by vÃÉt‚àí1
of prices. Appendix A shows that the heterogeneity in prices and orders disappears if there are no
idiosyncratic shocks to customer orders.
   The second feature to note is that changes in outside prices have a one-to-one eÔ¨Äect on equilib-
rium prices but no impact on order √üow. The reason is that changes in st represent CK news about
the value of FX: Recall that st follows a random walk with i.i.d. innovations, so E[st+1 |‚Ñ¶dt ] = st for
all dealers d. Innovations in st therefore lead all dealers to revise their forecast for outside prices in
the same way. Since prices are set as a markup over E[st+1 |‚Ñ¶dt ] that depends on expected dealer
orders (see eqn. 9), and dealer orders depend on the expected markup, E[p‚àót+1 |‚Ñ¶dt+1 ] ‚àí st+1 (see
eqns. 3 and 10), in the rational expectations equilibrium no dealer setting prices expects a change

                                                       12
in dealer orders, and no dealer choosing their order expects a change in the markup. Consequently,
prices move one-for-one with outside prices and interdealer order √üow is unaÔ¨Äected.
    Notice also that customer order shocks aÔ¨Äect both equilibrium prices and order √üow. Equi-
librium markups, pdt ‚àí st , follow an MA(1) process while order √üow depends on customer order
shocks lagged one period. The intuition behind these results is most easily understood by consid-
ering how a customer order aÔ¨Äects the optimal trading decisions of an individual dealer. Customer
orders are received at the beginning of the trading cycle and contain three components, a common
shock, vt , an idiosyncratic shock udt , and a lagged common shock, vt‚àí1 . Dealers need to estimate
vt and vt‚àí1 in order to optimally set prices because their forecasts of x‚àót and p‚àót+1 depend on these
estimates. Appendix A shows that these estimates are formed by combining the information in
customer orders and past prices:

two idiosyncratic components: p‚àót‚àí1 , the price the dealer was quoted in period t ‚àí 1 trading, and
cdt , the customer order received before period t trading. Equation (13) shows how a customer order
changes the estimates of vt‚àí1 and vt . Because dealers are paired through an independent random
matching process, dealer d‚Äôs estimate of u‚àót‚àí1 (the idiosyncratic customer shock received by d‚Äôs
period t counterpart) is zero, so the rationally expected order √üow is E[x‚àót |‚Ñ¶dt ] = Œ∑3 E[vt‚àí1 |‚Ñ¶dt ] from
(12). Similarly, (11) implies that E[p‚àót+1 |‚Ñ¶dt ] ‚àí st = Œ∑1 E[c‚àót+1 |‚Ñ¶dt ] + Œ∑ 2 E[vÃÉt‚àó |‚Ñ¶dt ], which in turn is
equal to (Œ∑ 1 Œ±+Œ∑2 )E[vt |‚Ñ¶dt ] because E[e‚àót |‚Ñ¶dt ] = 0 through random matching. Thus, customer orders
aÔ¨Äect prices directly via the √ûrst term in (9) and indirectly through revisions in expectations, with
a net eÔ¨Äect measured by the Œ∑1 coeÔ¨Écient.
    In the second period of the trading cycle the dealer must decide how much of her inventory
to retain for trade with other dealers. As (10) shows, this decision depends on her expectations

Equation (16) shows that a customer order received in period t aÔ¨Äects the dealer‚Äôs estimate of
  ¬£        ¬§         ¬£           ¬§
E vt |‚Ñ¶dt+1 but not E vt+1 |‚Ñ¶dt+1 . Thus, customer orders received at the start of the trading
cycle aÔ¨Äect dealer orders next period because they contain information that dealers √ûnd useful in
forecasting quotes.
   Customer orders also have a lagged eÔ¨Äect on prices. Because the price set by dealer d re√üects in
part the customer order she received in period t, the information received by her trading counterpart
in t is also aÔ¨Äected by that order. Speci√ûcally, combining (11) and (14) gives

which is a component of E[vt+i |‚Ñ¶‚àót+1 ]. As we saw above, these estimates are used by dealers to set
prices optimally. Hence, a customer order received by one dealer will aÔ¨Äect the price set by another
the next period because transaction prices convey information that is useful in making subsequent
trading decisions.
   The origins of the price and order √üow dynamics now become clear. Persistence in the cdt process
means that the customer orders received by dealers in one group are correlated with the customer
orders received by dealers in the other. Since trading always takes place between traders from
diÔ¨Äerent groups, this correlation means that customer orders aÔ¨Äect dealers‚Äô expectations about the
dealer orders or quotes they will received while trading. As a consequence, customer orders aÔ¨Äect
dealer orders and transaction prices.
   One particularly important feature of the model is that dealers only observe market-wide trans-
action prices and order √üow with a delay. After trading has ended in period t, all dealers observe the

                                                                   14
average transaction price and dealer order √üow from interdealer trading in period t ‚àí 1. This lack
of transparency means that dealers must make trading decisions before there is precise information
about the common shock to customer orders last period. To appreciate how this lack of information
aÔ¨Äects trading behavior, it is useful to consider what would happen if all dealers learned the value
of vt‚àí1 immediately after period t ‚àí 1 trading ended so that vt‚àí1 ‚àà ‚Ñ¶dt . In this case, (15) simpli√ûes
to E[p‚àót+1 |‚Ñ¶dt+1 ] = st+1 + (Œ∑ 1 Œ± + Œ∑2 )vt so dealers hold the same expectations about future quotes.
These expectations, in turn, imply that dealer orders are xdt+1 = ‚àíœà(Œ∑ 1 Œ± + Œ∑ 2 )vt from (3) and (10).
Since these orders are completely predictable to dealers setting prices in t + 1, V ar(x‚àót+1 |‚Ñ¶dt+1 ) = 0
and the optimal markup shown in (9) becomes in√ûnite. Thus, increasing the degree of transparency
leads to a breakdown in the equilibrium.
       One further perspective one the equilibrium comes from considering the origins of dealer order
√üow. In this model dealer orders represent the unwinding of the speculative position taken mid-
way through the trading cycle. At this point, dealers observe outside prices and decide on the
fraction of their inventory to retain for trade with other dealers. Recall that for a dealer starting a
                                                                   d
trading cycle in period t, her inventory at the start of t + 1 is It+1 = ‚àí(cdt + x‚àót ). Thus, a positive
value of Œªdt+1 (cdt + x‚àót ) represents a short position established at the start of t + 1 that must be
unwound by purchasing xdt+1 = Œªdt+1 (cdt + x‚àót ) from another dealer later in the period. Equation
(12) shows that the size of these positions depend on the diÔ¨Äerence between the outside price
and the price they expect to be quoted by another dealer, and the variance of that quote. The
optimal position does not depend on the inventory the dealer started the period with because the
public‚Äôs demand for any unwanted inventory is in√ûnitely elastic. Thus, customer orders have no
direct eÔ¨Äect on subsequent order √üow through an inventory-control channel.11 Instead, they aÔ¨Äect
dealer order √üow because they change expectations and induce dealers to take speculative positions
that ultimately are unwound through dealer orders. Speci√ûcally, suppose a positive vt shock raises
customer orders received by group A dealers in period t. If Œ± is positive (negative), these dealers
will revise their forecasts of c‚àót+1 upward (downward), and also their forecast of the quote they will
receive from a group B dealer in t + 1 trading. Consequently, group A dealers will establish longer
(shorter) speculative positions at the start of t + 1 that in turn lead to lower (higher) average dealer
order √üow, xt+1 .

  11
    If the public‚Äôs demand was less than perfectly elastic (see Evans and Lyons 1999, for example), optimal speculative
positions would depend in part on the dealer‚Äôs inventory. Although this modi√ûcation would make the model very
much harder to solve, it would introduce an operative inventory control channel that in principle could lead to serially
correlated order √üow.

2.3   Empirical Implications

Equations (11) and (12) describe elements in the equilibrium cross-sectional distributions of prices
and orders at a point in time. Suppose we observe the average order xt , and an randomly drawn
price pot , from these distributions at time t. Since pot = pdt for some dealer d, equations (1), (2) and
(11) imply that we can write the observed price as


                                              pot = pt + œâot ,                                      (17)


where œâ ot = Œ∑ 1 udt + Œ∑2 edt‚àí1 is an idiosyncratic shock. pt is the average price that follows


                     ‚àÜpt = Œ∑1 vt + (Œ∑2 ‚àí (1 ‚àí Œ±)Œ∑1 )vt‚àí1 ‚àí (Œ∑ 1 Œ± + Œ∑2 )vt‚àí2 + Œµt
                           = B(L)vt + Œµt ,                                                          (18)


where B(L) represents a polynomial in the lag operator, L. The size of the œâ ot shock depends on
the identity of the dealer whose price we observe. If the observed price is drawn randomly from
the cross-sectional distribution of prices every period, œâ ot will be serially independent. It will also
be independent from leads and lags of ‚àÜpt .
   Combining (17) and (18) gives the period-by-period change in the observed price as


                                    ‚àÜpot = Œµt + B(L)vt + œâ ot ‚àí œâ ot‚àí1 .                            (19)


This equation decomposes observed price changes into three components: the CK news component
Œµt , the order √üow component B(L)vt , and the sampling component œâ ot ‚àí œâ ot‚àí1 . The √ûrst component
incorporates the traditional macro view of exchange rate determination in which all innovations
in spot rates are attributable to the arrival of public news. More precisely, this view assumes
that: (i) all information relevant for exchange rate determination is CK, and (ii) the mapping from
information to equilibrium prices is also CK. Œµt shocks play the role of CK news in this model
because all dealers learn the value of Œµt simultaneously and hold the same view about the mapping
from Œµt to the equilibrium transaction price distribution. The second and third components come
from the trading-theoretic perspective of the model. The second captures the role of customer
orders as a source of asymmetric information to dealers while the third arises from the existence of
an equilibrium distribution of transaction prices at a point in time.
   While the three components are mutually independent, they cannot be separately identi√ûed


                                                    16
without some further information. This is provided via the trading model in the form of average
dealer order √üow. In particular, (12) implies that average dealer order √üow follows,


                                          xt = Œ∑3 vt‚àí1 = C(L)vt ,                                   (20)


so we can rewrite (19) as


                                     ‚àÜpot = D(L)xt + Œµt + œâ ot ‚àí œâ ot‚àí1                             (21)


where D(L) = B(L)C(L)‚àí1 .
   Equation (21) takes the form of regression with an MA(1) error-structure that can be used to
estimate the diÔ¨Äerent price change components. For example, in the case of the model presented
above, (21) becomes


                            ‚àÜpot = a1 xt+1 + a2 xt + a3 xt‚àí1 + Œµt + œâ ot ‚àí œâ ot‚àí1 .                 (22)


where a1 = Œ∑ 1 /Œ∑3 , a2 = (Œ∑ 2 + (Œ± ‚àí 1)Œ∑1 )/Œ∑3 , and a3 = ‚àí(Œ∑2 + Œ±Œ∑1 )/Œ∑ 3 . Note that the right hand
side of this equation contains both a lead and lag of order √üow. The leading term arises because vt
shocks aÔ¨Äect prices contemporaneously but order √üow with a one period lag. Hence, the value of
a1 captures the contemporaneous eÔ¨Äect of vt on prices.
   Although the structure of the trading model honors the main features of direct interdealer
trading, it limits the actions of dealers in ways that the market does not. In particular, the
model imposes a rigid structure to the timing of events and assumes the presences of an exogenous
matching mechanism that has no exact market counterpart: Actual dealers can choose to initiate
conversations with any other dealer at any time they are not responding to a quote request from
another dealer. In recognition of these limitations, I will not attempt structural estimation of the
trading model with (22).
   I will focus instead on (21). This equation allows us to study the origins of exchange rate
movements beyond the con√ûnes of the speci√ûc trading model. In particular, decompositions of
exchange rate changes using (21) rest on three identi√ûcation assumptions: (i) the orthogonality of
œâ ot to all leads and lags of ‚àÜpt , (ii) the dependence of xt on only vt shocks, and (iii) the absence of
serial correlation in Œµt . Assumption (i) will hold provided that the observed price is an independent
random drawing from the distribution of prices each period. This is a reasonable assumption in



                                                      17
a market where there are a large number of dealers who can execute transactions at any time.
Assumption (ii) rules out the possibility that common knowledge shocks aÔ¨Äect order √üow. This
assumption holds true in a wide class of rational trading models and has been used elsewhere in
empirical research (see, for example, Hasbrouck 1991 and Payne 1999). Assumption (iii) implies
that all CK shocks have permanent aÔ¨Äects on the spot exchange rate. This assumption is a little
stronger because, as macro models show, it is possible for public news to have a temporary eÔ¨Äect on
spot rates. However, given that the estimated speed of mean reversion in spot rates following such
shocks is typically measured in weeks, months or longer, and we will be considering observations over
√ûve minute intervals, this assumption is also rather weak. Notice that none of these assumptions
restrict the form of the polynomial D(L), which captures the dynamics of prices and order √üow via
B(L) and C(L). The model presented above places restrictions on B(L) and C(L) that would almost
surely be diÔ¨Äerent in richer theoretical settings. Thus, in the empirical analysis that follows, I will
estimate (21) with quite general speci√ûcations for D(L). The parameter estimates thus obtained
will then be used to decompose price changes into their various components.


3     Empirical Analysis

3.1   The Data

The analysis below utilizes new data on trading activity in the DM/$ spot FX market over a four-
month period, May 1 to August 31, 1996. The data set contains time-stamped tic-by-tic data on
actual transactions taking place through the Reuters Dealing 2000-1 system via an electronic feed
that was customized for the purpose by Reuters. This is the most widely used electronic dealing
system. According to Reuters, over 90% of the world‚Äôs direct interdealer transactions took place
through the system.
    Trades on the D2000-1 system take the form of electronic bilateral conversations. The conver-
sation is initiated when a dealer calls another dealer on the system to request a quote. Users of the
system are expected to provide a fast two-way quote with a tight spread, which is in turn dealt or
declined quickly (i.e., within seconds). To settle disputes, Reuters keeps a temporary record of all
the conversations on the system. This record is the source of the transactions data. Every time
an electronic conversation on D2000-1 results in a trade, the Reuters feed provides a time-stamped
record of the transactions price, a bought or sold indicator, and a measure of cumulative trading
volume.


                                                  18
       Several features of the data are particularly noteworthy. First, they provide transaction in-
formation for the whole interbank market over the full 24-hour trading day. This contrasts with
earlier transaction data sets covering single dealers over some fraction of the trading day (e.g. Lyons
1995, Yao 1997a, and 1997b, and Bjonnes and Rime 1998). The data set makes it possible, for
the √ûrst time, to analyze trading patterns and prices at the level of ‚Äúthe market.‚Äù The only other
multiple-dealer data set in the literature covers brokered interdealer transactions (the electronic
system examined by Goodhart, Ito and Payne 1996, and Payne 1999). The system they examine,
however, accounts for only a small fraction of daily trading volume.12
       Second, these market-wide transactions data are not observed by individual FX dealers on the
system as they trade. Though dealers have access to their own transaction records, they do not
have access to others‚Äô transactions on the system. The transactions data therefore represents a
history of market activity that market participants could only infer indirectly. This feature has
important implications for interpreting the results reported below.
       Third, the data cover a relatively long time span (four months) in comparison with other micro
data sets. This span provides as truly vast number of minute-by-minute observations on trading
activity across a wide variety of ‚Äúmarket states‚Äù. In the analysis that follows, I utilize that data
collected between 00:00:01 BST on Monday to 24:60:60 BST on Friday. (All time is measured
relative to British Summer Time (BST) which corresponds to GMT plus one hour). This time
interval appears to span the week of trading in the DM/$ fairly well. Although the D2000-1 system
runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, it rarely recorded trades outside this interval. Excluding
weekends and a feed interruption caused by a power failure, there are 79 full trading days in the
sample.
       The analysis below concentrates on (i) transaction prices, (ii) interdealer order √üow, and (iii)
trade intensity. Transactions take two forms in the data. If a dealer initiating a conversation ends
up buying dollars, the transaction price is equal to the ask quote in DMs per dollar oÔ¨Äered by
the other dealer. I refer to this as the DM purchase price for dollars, p+
                                                                         t . If the dealer initiating

a conversation ends up selling dollars, the transaction price will be equal to the bid quote given
by the other dealer. I refer to this as the DM sale price for dollars, p‚àí
                                                                        t . Thus the designation of

a transaction price as a purchase or sale price depends on who initiates the transaction. Buyer-
initiated trades take place at the purchase price while seller-initiated trades take place at the sale

  12
    There is also evidence that dealers attach more informational importance to direct interdealer order √üow than to
brokered interdealer order √üow, (see Bjonnes and Rime 1998).



                                                        19
price. Interdealer order √üow, xt , is de√ûned by the diÔ¨Äerence between the number of buyer-initiated
orders and seller-initiated orders per period. Trade intensity, nt , is de√ûned as the number of trades
per period.


3.2    Econometrics

The spot FX market is open continuously in the sense that dealers can trade with one another via
the D2000-1 system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The system also allows conversations between
many dealer pairs to take place at the same time. Thus, it is possible for multiple trades to be
concluded, and recorded, at the same instant. The resulting data set constitutes a sequence of
irregularly spaced observations on a continuous trading process. At some points in the sample,
the gaps between successive trades span many minutes, while at others several trades appear with
the same second-by-second time stamp. I will not attempt to directly model these irregular timing
patterns in the analysis below. Instead I will utilize prices, order √üow and trade intensity measured
relative to a √ûxed 5 minute observation interval. Hence, p+      ‚àí
                                                          t and pt are respectively the last dollar
purchase and sale price recorder during interval t; xt is the diÔ¨Äerence between the number of buyer-
initiated and seller-initiated trades during interval t; and nt is the number of transactions during
interval t.
    One drawback to adopting a √ûxed observation interval is that there are periods of the day when
no transactions take place during the interval. I designate the price and order √üow observations
from these periods as ‚Äúmissing‚Äù. All the statistics and estimates reported below are calculated
without the use of these observations. For example, in computing the √ûrst order autocorrelation
coeÔ¨Écient in the ‚àÜp+                                                  +       +
                   t series, I only use consecutive observations on ‚àÜpt and ‚àÜpt‚àí1 for which none
of the values for p+
                   t were ‚Äúmissing‚Äù. More generally, I employ the GMM estimation procedure

described below.
    All the statistics and empirical models considered below can be written in the state-space form:


                                        Œæ t = AŒæ t‚àí1 + Œ∂ t ,                                     (23)
                                        yt = CŒæ t ,


where Œæ t is a q-dimensioned state vector, and yt is a r-dimensioned vector of observed variables.
Œ∂ t is a q-dimensioned vector of shocks with zero means that are uncorrelated with Œæ t‚àí1 , serially
uncorrelated and have covariance matrix ‚Ñ¶. Although the form of A, C and ‚Ñ¶ vary according to


                                                 20
the particular application, in all cases the eigenvalues of A lie inside the unit circle so that Œæ t
and yt follow stationary processes. Hence, (23) implies that the unconditional means of Œæ t and
yt are respectively equal to a q and r-dimensioned vector of zeros. (23) also implies that the
covariance of the states, Œì(k) ‚â° Cov(Œæt , Œæ0t‚àík ), is computed as Œì(k) = AŒì(k ‚àí 1) with Œì(0) =
      ¬£                     ¬§
vec‚àí1 (I ‚àí A ‚äó A)‚àí1 vec(‚Ñ¶) . The covariance of the observed variables is therefore given by

                                            0
                                    Cov(yt yt‚àík ) ‚â° Œ≥(k) = CŒì(k)C 0 .                                (24)


In some applications, I also make us of a j-dimensioned vector of instruments, zt , with the property
          0 ) = 0 for i ‚â• 0.
cov(yt , zt‚àíi
   Let Œ∏ represent the vector of parameters to be estimated. As in the standard GMM case, I

                                            E [mt (k; Œ∏)] = 0                                        (25)

for k = 0, 1, ..K. D(k) is a vector of ones and zeros that selects the moments to be included in
mt (k; Œ∏). (25) gives a maximum of rj + r2 independent conditions when k > 0 and rj + r(r + 1)/2
conditions when k = 0.
   To compute the GMM estimates, let mt (Œ∏) = [mt (0; Œ∏), mt (1; Œ∏).....mt (K; Œ∏)]0 be vector of se-
lected moment conditions. While all the elements of mt (Œ∏) can be computed for any period t, if a
particular element involves a value for yt or yt‚àík designated as a ‚Äúmissing‚Äù observation, the result
is also designated ‚Äúmissing‚Äù. This holds true irrespective of the value of Œ∏ so the set of ‚Äúmissing‚Äù
elements in mt (Œ∏) will not vary with Œ∏ for a particular t. Let Œõ = {t‚àó1 , .t‚àó2 ...t‚àóT } denote the set of
observations for which none of the elements in mt (.) are ‚Äúmissing‚Äù. The estimates of Œ∏ are found
by minimizing

with T ‚àó equal to the number of observations in Œõ. I follow the standard practice of √ûrst setting
the weighting matrix W equal to the identity to obtain consistent estimates of Œ∏. These estimates,
Œ∏ÃÉ, are then used to compute a consistent estimate of the optimal weighting matrix. The form of
this weighting matrix varies across applications according to whether elements of mt (Œ∏) are serially
correlated under the null hypothesis of a correctly speci√ûed model. The most general weighting
matrix I consider follows the form proposed by Newey and West (1987):

In applications where all the elements of mt (Œ∏) are serially uncorrelated, Œ∫ is set to zero so that
WÃÉ = Œì0,T ‚àó . The GMM estimates, Œ∏ÃÇ, are found by minimizing (26) with W = WÃÉ . The asymptotic
covariance matrix of the resulting estimates is VÃÇ = [GÃÇWÃÉ ‚àí1 GÃÇ0 ]‚àí1 where GÃÇ = ‚àÇmT ‚àó (Œ∏ÃÇ)/‚àÇŒ∏0 .
     Several facets of this estimation technique may be illustrated by considering its application to
the regression in (22). In this case, yt = ‚àÜpot ‚àí a1 xt+1 ‚àí a2 xt ‚àí a3 xt‚àí1 , Œæ 0t = [Œµt , œâot , œâ ot‚àí1 ], and

         It is clear in this application that the GMM technique does not necessarily provide the most
eÔ¨Écient parameter estimates. For example, if Œµt and œâ ot were normally distributed and the time
series for yt contained no missing observations, Œ∏ would be most eÔ¨Éciently estimated by maximum
likelihood with the aid of the Kalman Filter. However, balanced against this, the GMM technique
oÔ¨Äers two important advantages. First, it does not require any distributional assumptions regarding
the error processes. Although the trading model implies that Œµt and œâ ot are normally distributed,
this arises from modeling assumptions made for analytic convenience rather than any deep economic
reason. In reality, the distribution of Œµt and œâ ot could be far from normal. The second advantage
stems from the presence of missing observations. Although the Kalman Filtering algorithm can be
extended to deal with one or two missing observations (see Harvey 1989), dealing with many adds
considerable to the complexity of the √ûlter and makes estimation very computational burdensome.
By contrast, the GMM technique can deal with many missing observations very easily. Moreover,
because the data set spans four months, the adoption of the √ûve minute observation interval provides
us with a truly vast number of (non-missing) observations. As a consequence, the GMM estimates
of Œ∏ are extremely precise judged by the metric of their asymptotic distribution.


4         Results

4.1        Sample Statistics

Although the D2000-1 system runs 24 hours a day, the vast majority interdealer transactions in
the DM/$ are concentrated during the European trading. This institutional feature gives rise to
recurrent intraday patterns in the data. Exemplifying this phenomena, Engle, Ito and Lin (1990),
Baillie and Bollerslev (1991), Bollerslev and Domowitz (1993), Goodhart and Giugale (1993), Payne
(1997) and Andersen and Bollerslev (1998) have all studied the intraday patterns in the volatility
of indicative quotes.
         There is also a pronounced intradaily pattern in transactions. Figure 2 plots the average trade
intensity during each √ûve minute observation interval calculated over the 79 trading days in the
sample. As the √ûgure shows, average trading activity follows a three humped pattern. The √ûrst
hump occurs between 01:00 and 05:00 with peak intensity of approximately 5 trades per minute.13

    13
    Trading in the DM/$ is comparatively light during this period because only Asian based dealers are typically in
the market. It is also possible that the Reuter‚Äôs Dealing system is used much less by Asian based dealers that their
counterparts in Europe and the US.



                                                        23
The second hump begins around 07:00, peaks with approximately 25 trades per minute at 09:30, and
drops to 15 trades per minute by about 12:30. Trading during this period is dominated by dealers
situated in Europe. The third hump begins at 12:30, and rises quickly to a peak of approximately
30 trades per minute at 14:30. This increase coincides with U.S. based dealers entering the market.
Activity remains around 25 trades per minute until approximately 16:00, when European based
dealers typically leave the market. Thereafter, there is a gradual decline in activity with fewer than
5 trades per minute taking place after 19:00.
   It is important to stress that Figure 2 plots average trade intensity over the sample of 79 trading
days. Actual intensity can vary considerably from day to day. For example, the most active period
of trading in the sample occurs between 09:00 and 10:00 when more that 200 transactions per
minute take place, 8 times the average for that time of day. More generally, the diÔ¨Äerence between
the actual and average intensity during each √ûve minute interval has a sample standard deviation
of 58, so that trading intensity on any particular day could diÔ¨Äer signi√ûcantly from the pattern
displayed in Figure 2.
   Further evidence on the variability of trading activity is provided by Table 1. The upper panel
of this table reports estimates of a 6-state √ûrst-order Markov process for trade intensity. The states
are de√ûned as {j : n ‚àà [Sj , Sj+1 )} for j = 1, ..6 where Sj is the lower bound for state j reported in
the table. Thus, an observation of nt = 10, would represent state j = 3 of the Markov process. The
body of the table reports the matrix of estimated transition probabilities, with entry i, j denoting
the probability of transition from state i to state j. Two features of these estimates are noteworthy.
First, the probability of remaining in the same state, reported on the leading diagonal, is less
than 75 per cent in every case. Second, the probability of leaving the current state is highest at
intermediate levels of trading activity. These features are more pronounced in the lower panel of the
table which reports estimates of a 6-state Markov process for the ‚Äúdeseasonalize‚Äù trading rates. In
this case, states are de√ûned as {j : n ‚àí nÃÑ ‚àà [Sj , Sj+1 )} where nÃÑ denotes the average trade intensity
for the interval from which n is observed. These estimates indicate that unusually high or low trade
intensities are more likely to persist than intensities that are closer to the norm for that particular
time of day. They also show that trade intensities can vary over the complete range of states from
period to period. In contrast to the upper panel, all the oÔ¨Ä-diagonal transition probabilities are
non-zero.
   These results show that there are considerable variations in trade intensity over the sample
period. Some of these variations can be attributed to a fairly well-de√ûned intraday pattern that


                                                  24
appears consistent with dealers in diÔ¨Äerent locations entering and leaving the market. However,
on any particular day actual trade intensity can vary considerable from this norm. This raises
the possibility that the 5 minute observation interval spans varying periods of ‚Äúmarket time‚Äù: the
time scale at which market process evolve at a constant rate. If this time scale is grounded in the
rate at which information becomes available to dealers, and the arrival of private information is an
important source of interdealer trade, then the variable trading intensities we observe may in part
result from the speeding up and slowing down of market time. This phenomena is referred to as
time deformation (Stock 1988) and I shall examine its possible implications below.
    Sample statistics for the change in purchase price, ‚àÜp+
                                                          t , and order √üow, xt are reported in Table
2.14 From the statistics in the right hand columns of the upper panel, the unconditional distributions
for both variables appear non-normal. The distribution for transaction price changes is skewed to
the left and is highly leptokuritic. The distribution for order √üow is also fat-tailed but skewed to
the right. The lower panel reports estimated autocorrelation coeÔ¨Écients together with the p-values
for the null hypothesis of a zero coeÔ¨Écient. In the case of purchase prices, these estimates indicate
the presence of a MA(1) process for ‚àÜp+
                                      t : there is a signi√ûcant negative coeÔ¨Écient at lag one, while
all coeÔ¨Écients at higher lags are insigni√ûcantly diÔ¨Äerent from zero. By contrast, order √üow displays
positive autocorrelation that is statistically signi√ûcant at the 1% level on lags one through six.
    Further evidence on the dynamics of price changes and order √üow is provided by Table 3. Here
I report GMM estimates for various ARMA speci√ûcations using the variance and the √ûrst twelve
autocorrelations as moments (see Appendix B). The number of overidentifying restrictions for each
set of estimates are reported in the right hand column together with the Hansen (1982) J-statistic
and its associated p-value.
    The upper panel of the table reports estimates of ARMA models for the change in purchase price.
Consistent with the statistics in Table 2, there is strong evidence of a moving average component in
this series: the moving average coeÔ¨Écient(s) are highly signi√ûcant in all but one model. Although
the MA(1) model appears well-speci√ûed when judged by the J-statistic, the autoregressive coeÔ¨É-
cients also appear to be signi√ûcant in the ARMA(1,1) and ARMA(2,2) models. This is an interesting
√ûnding because it provides some preliminary evidence that order √üow contributes to price changes.
Recall from (19) that observed price changes can be written as ‚àÜpot = Œµt +B(L)vt +œâ ot ‚àíœâ ot‚àí1 , where
Œµt , vt and œâ t are serially uncorrelated. According to this equation, price changes should follow an

                                                         t , are almost identical to those for ‚àÜpt and so are not reported
to conserve space. All statistics on ‚àÜp+ t  are calculated without  ‚Äúmissing‚Äù  observations.   Appendix B provides details
on all the empirical results presented below.


                                                           25
MA(1) process if B(L)vt = 0. However, the estimates in Table 3 suggest that price changes follow
a higher order process. According to (19), this must originate from the order √üow component,
B(L)vt .
       ARMA model estimates for order √üow are reported in the lower panel of Table 3. These estimates
indicate that order √üow follows either an ARMA(1,2), ARMA(2,1) or ARMA(2,2) process with a
high degree of persistence. Judged by the J-statistics, lower order models do not appear to capture
the high degree of persistence in the process implied by the autocorrelations reported in Table 2.
For example, the estimates of the ARMA(1,2) model imply a root for the order √üow process of 0.84.
       The persistence in the order √üow is somewhat puzzling. To see why, consider the implications
of these results for the behavior of inventories and customer orders. Market clearing ensures that
‚àÜIt+1 = ‚àí(ct + xt ) where It denotes the average level of dealer inventories at the start of period t.
Now suppose that dealers‚Äô trading decisions are in part motivate by the desire to control inventories.
One minimal implication of an operative inventory control channel is that Cov(‚àÜIt+1 , ‚àÜIt‚àíi ) < 0
for i > 0, because dealers adjust their quotes so inventories do not stray too far from their (constant)
desired level.15 When this condition holds, market clearing implies that


       Cov(ct , xt‚àíi ) + Cov(xt , ct‚àíi ) + Cov(ct , ct‚àíi ) + Cov(xt , xt‚àíi ) = Cov(‚àÜIt+1 , ‚àÜIt‚àíi ) < 0.        (27)


       The order √üow results in Tables 2 and 3 could be squared with the presence of an operative
inventory control channel if the sum of √ûrst three terms is negative. Let us therefore consider these
terms in turn. Interdealer order √üow cannot be observed by non-bank customers so there is little
reason to think that the √ûrst term is negative. The second term depends on the extent to which
inventory imbalances resulting from customer orders are passed on from one dealer to another; a
phenomena termed ‚Äúhot potato‚Äù trading by Lyons (1997). If ‚Äúhot potato‚Äù trading is prevalent,
interdealer order √üow will be positively correlated with lagged customer orders so Cov(xt , ct‚àíi ) > 0.
Together these observations suggest an upper bound for Cov(ct , ct‚àíi ) of ‚àíCov(xt , xt‚àíi ) in the
presence of an inventory control channel. Since Cov(xt , xt‚àíi ) appears signi√ûcantly positive for a
number of lags i, the bound implies that customer orders are negatively autocorrelated over similar
horizons. Although customer orders are taken as exogenous in the trading model, in a more general
setting they would be determined endogenously by the behavior of the non-bank public. Whether

  15
    See Hasbrouck (1998) for a discussion of the canonical inventory control model where this condition holds.
Empirical evidence on the importance of the inventory control in dealer decision-making is provided in Lyons (1995).
He estimates a half life for unwanted inventory of approximately ten minutes for the dealer in his study.


                                                        26
such negative autocorrelations could arise endogenously remains to be seen.
   Equation (27) provides a further perspective on the behavior of order √üow. Suppose that cus-
tomer orders are serially uncorrelated. If Cov(xt , ct‚àíi ) ‚â• 0 and Cov(ct , xt‚àíi ) = 0 for the reasons
cited above, then Cov(xt , xt‚àíi ) is a lower bound on Cov(‚àÜIt+1 , ‚àÜIt‚àíi ). From this perspective, the
order √üow estimates in Tables 2 and 3 suggest that average inventory changes are positively corre-
lated: an equally puzzling result that is inconsistent with the micro evidence on dealer inventories
in Lyons (1995).
   A key assumption in these arguments is that the dynamics of order √üow hitting individual dealers
(i.e., x‚àót ) is well-represented by the dynamics of the aggregate measure, xt . If there is a signi√ûcant
degree of heterogeneity in dynamics of individual the order √üows, the estimates in Tables 2 and 3
will not be informative about the behavior of x‚àót . And, as a result, the puzzles alluded to above
become more apparent than real. If this is indeed the case, the order √üow results simply serve to
reinforce my emphasis on the important role of heterogeneity.


4.2   Structural Models

I now turn to examine the origins of exchange rate movements. Table 4 reports GMM estimates of
the regression in (21) for ten diÔ¨Äerent speci√ûcations for D(L), the polynomial on order √üow. The
dependent variable in all cases is the change in purchase price, ‚àÜp+
                                                                   t . (Results using the change in
sale price, ‚àÜp‚àí
              t , are nearly identical.) The table reports the coeÔ¨Écient estimates on each of the order
√üow terms, together with their standard errors which are corrected for conditional heteroskedasticity
and an MA(1) error process. Inspection of these estimates reveals that the coeÔ¨Écients on xt‚àí2 , xt‚àí3 ,
xt+5 and xt+6 are (individually) insigni√ûcantly diÔ¨Äerent from zero at the 5 per cent level whenever
they are included in a speci√ûcation. This evidence suggests that D(L) is well-characterized by
a 60 th order polynomial (i.e., one that includes terms in L‚àí4 , L‚àí3 , L‚àí2 , L‚àí1 , L0 , and L). As row
VII of the table shows, all the coeÔ¨Écient estimates in this speci√ûcation are statistically signi√ûcant.
The importance of the leading order √üow terms is further emphasized by the results in the last
row. Here the table reports estimates for the case where D(L) includes only L0 , L, L2 and L3
terms. The R2 statistic from this speci√ûcation is 0.005, much lower than the R2 statistics for the
other speci√ûcations. Thus, order √üow contributes most to the predicable variation in price changes
through the leading terms.
   The right hand columns of the table report the estimated sum of the order √üow coeÔ¨Écients
together with some regression diagonstics. In every case, the sum of the coeÔ¨Écients is positive


                                                  27
and statistically signi√ûcant. Since the dependent variable is the change in price, these estimates
imply that order √üow variations have a permanent eÔ¨Äect on the price level. This is a surprising
√ûnding when judged against the background of the trading model. There customer order shocks
only exerted a temporary aÔ¨Äect on prices so that D(1) = 0. The estimates in Table 4 strongly
reject this restriction. The trading model makes more accurate predictions about the structure
of the regression residuals. The right hand column of the table reports l‚àí statistics (Cumby and
Huizinga 1993) for the null hypothesis that the regression residuals follow an MA(1) process. For
the preferred speci√ûcation in row VII, the l‚àístatistic is signi√ûcant at the 9 per cent level.
    While the results in Table 4 provide strong evidence on the price-impact of order √üow, more
can be learnt about the origins of price movements by utilizing both the purchase and sale prices,
p+      ‚àí                          +      ‚àí

be serially uncorrelated and independently distributed. They will also be independent from the CK
news shock Œµt , and from leads and lags of order √üow.
    Equation (28) provides us with a generalizing of (21) that utilizes both purchase and sales price
changes to estimate the dynamics of the average price change ‚àÜpt , which is represented by the √ûrst
two terms on the right hand side. The third term is the sampling component of observed price
changes that arises from the presence of the transaction price distribution. To estimate the model,
I draw on the results in Table 4 by assuming that D(L) is a 6‚Äôth order polynomial containing terms
in L‚àí4 to L. I also assume that œâ +       ‚àí
                                  t and œâ t have the same variance, Œ£œâ , and constant means.

The GMM estimates are obtained using instruments zt = [xt+4 , ....xt‚àí1 ] and moments derived from
the covariances of observed price changes.
    The GMM estimates of the Bivariate model in (28) are reported in Table 5. The order √üow

     The latter assumption implies that there is no period-by-period change in the diÔ¨Äerence between the average
                                  ‚àí
purchase and sales price, pÃÑ+
                            t ‚àí pÃÑt . This is not a completely innocuous assumption because dealers can change the
                                                                              ‚àí
spread between their bid and ask quotes, which in turn could alter pÃÑ+  t ‚àí pÃÑt . However, spreads in the interdealer
market are extremely small (for example, Lyons 2000 reports a median spread of DM 0.0003/$ for the dealer he
                                              ‚àí
studied), so keeping the means of œâ+  t and œâ t constant is not unreasonable.




                                                         28
coeÔ¨Écient estimates are generally very similar to those reported in row VII of Table 4, and are all
highly statistically signi√ûcant. The sum of the estimated coeÔ¨Écients is approximately 0.24 with
a standard error of 0.02. This estimate is also similar to the one in Table 4 and implies a strong
rejection of the null hypothesis that customer order shocks only have temporary aÔ¨Äects on prices.
                   1/2        1./2
The estimates of Œ£Œµ      and Œ£œâ , the standard deviations of CK news and the idiosyncratic shocks
are rather similar. Thus, the cross-sectional dispersion of transaction prices appears to be of the
same order of magnitude as the variance of CK shocks.
   These estimates provide empirical support for the existence of an equilibrium distribution of
transaction prices at a point in time. While the trading model shows how an equilibrium distribution
can arise from heterogeneity and a lack of transparency, are other interpretations possible? In
particular, couldn‚Äôt the estimates simply imply the presence of some sort of measurement error? In
one sense, the answer is clearly no. The data on p+      ‚àí
                                                  t and pt come from the Reuters trading system

and constitute part of the audit trail. There is not doubt that transactions took place at exactly
the prices recorded in the p+      ‚àí
                            t and pt series. Of course, it is possible that dealers make typing errors
or irrational decisions when using the trading system. p+      ‚àí
                                                        t and pt will then contain measurement
errors in the sense that they do not correspond to equilibrium transaction prices in any theoretical
model that excludes these possibilities. But even in this case, the assumptions of the Bivariate
model are valid so long as the œâ ot shocks are serially uncorrelated. Thus, while it may be possible
to attribute some of the price distribution implied by the estimates to economic factors ignored by
the trading model, it cannot be even partially attributed to pure measurement error in the data.
   The estimates reported in Table 5 are based on the dynamics of price changes and order √üow
measured over a √ûxed 5-minute observation window. As I noted above, it is quite possible that
this √ûxed interval corresponds to varying spans of ‚Äúmarket time‚Äù. Consequently, the estimates may
be aÔ¨Äected by the presence of time deformation. To examine this possibility, I use trade intensity
as a state variable to test for the presence of state-dependency in the dynamics of prices changes
and order √üow. If market time is in part determined by the rate at which dealers receive new
information from outside the market, and arrival of non-common knowledge (NCK) information is
an important source of interdealer trade, the large variations in trade intensity we observe may be
signaling the presence of time deformation.
   The upper panel of Table 6 reports the results of the state-dependency tests for the dynamics of
price changes and order √üow. In the former case, I estimate models for price changes that include
the distributed lag of order √üow D(L)xt , together with the interaction terms D(L)xt nt , D(L)xt n2t


                                                 29
and D(L)xt n3t . I then test the null hypothesis that the estimated coeÔ¨Écients on all the included
interactions terms are zero using a Wald test corrected for the presence of heteroskedasticity and
an MA(1) residual error structure. As the table shows, these test statistics strongly reject the
null. The Wald tests for state-dependency in the order √üow dynamics show much weaker evidence
against the null; none are signi√ûcant at the 5 per cent signi√ûcance level. These tests are based on
AR(6) models for order √üow (i.e., D(L) = d1 L + ... + d6 L6 ), but the results are robust to the use
of higher-order models.
   The lower panel of Table 6 reports tests for heteroskedasticity in the variances of Œµt , œâ +       ‚àí
                                                                                              t and œâ t .
The center three columns report Glesjer (1969) tests for heteroskedasticity using combinations of
nt , n2t and n3t . As the table shows, there is very strong evidence against the null of homoskedasticity
in all three cases. The right hand column reports LM statistics for √ûrst order ARCH (Engle 1982)
for each of the three shocks. These statistics also imply a rejection of the homoskedastic null at
very high signi√ûcance levels. The table also reports tests for heteroskedasticity in the variance of
the innovations in order √üow. The tests use the innovations from the estimates of the ARMA(2,2)
order √üow model in Table 3. All four test statistics are highly signi√ûcant.
   Overall, the results in Table 6 strongly indicate that the dynamics of price changes vary signi√û-
cantly with the state of the market as measured by trading intensity. While this does not constitute
direct evidence of time deformation, it is certainly consistent with the idea that speed of market
processes varies through time. The results also point to the need to incorporate state-dependency
into the Bivariate model. To this end, I consider the following extension:

serially uncorrelated shocks, but their variances are now state-dependent: V ar(Œµt ) = Œ£Œµ (n) and




                                                     30
V ar(œâ +            ‚àí
       t ) = V ar(œâ t ) = Œ£œâ (n). I model state-dependency in the coeÔ¨Écients and variances as


                       di (n) = di (0) exp(‚àín/Œ≥) + di (‚àû)(1 ‚àí exp(‚àín/Œ≥)),
                       Œ£i (n) = Œ£i (0) exp(‚àín/Œ≥) + Œ£i (‚àû)(1 ‚àí exp(‚àín/Œ≥)),


where di (0), di (‚àû), Œ£i (0) and Œ£i (‚àû) are all parameters to be estimated. These functional forms
bound the coeÔ¨Écients between di (0) and di (‚àû), and the variances between Œ£i (0) and Œ£i (‚àû) as the
transaction rate varies between 0 and ‚àû. For the sake of parsimony, the positive scaling parameter
Œ≥, is common to all functions.
   Table 7 reports the GMM estimates of the state-dependency model in (29) with Œ≥ set equal
to 100. Attempts to estimate the model with Œ≥ unrestricted gave estimates close to 100 but the
standard errors on all the other parameters were much larger than the values reported in the table.
(Re-estimating the model with Œ≥ set to diÔ¨Äerent values of 90 and 110 had negligible eÔ¨Äects on the
estimated parameters.) The upper portion of the table reports the estimated bounds in the order
√üow polynomial, D(L, n). When compared to the estimates in Table 5, we see that the estimates
of di (0) are generally smaller in absolute value than their state-independent counterparts, while
the estimates of di (‚àû) are generally larger. The estimated range for the individual di (.)s appears
quite large. A Wald test for the null hypothesis of di (0) = di (‚àû) for i = {1, 2, ...6}, reported in the
lower panel, is highly signi√ûcant. This test statistic supports the presence of state-dependency in
the price change dynamics. The di (.) estimates also imply signi√ûcant state dependence in D(1, n),
which measures the long run impact of order √üow on the price level. The estimated lower and upper
limits are -0.15 and 1.32 with standard errors of 0.03 and 0.10 as n ranges from zero to in√ûnity.
   The center of the table reports estimates for the variance parameters. In models where all four
parameters were left unrestricted, the estimates of Œ£Œµ (0) and Œ£œâ (‚àû) were very close to zero (i.e.
< 0.0001), so the table reports estimates where these parameters are restricted to zero. With these
restrictions, V ar(Œµt ) = Œ£Œµ (‚àû)(1 ‚àí exp(‚àín/100)) and V ar(œâ +            ‚àí
                                                             t ) = V ar(œâ t ) = Œ£œâ (0) exp(‚àín/100).

The estimated value for Œ£œâ (0) implies that the standard deviation for the idiosyncratic shocks
slowly falls from 0.047 to approximately 0.006 as n varies from 0 to 200. The estimate for Œ£Œµ (‚àû)
implies that the standard deviations of CK shocks is smaller than V ar(œâ t )1/2 for n less than 35.
As the transactions rate rise beyond 35 the standard deviation increases slowly from 0.042.towards
0.090.
   The lower portion of the table reports the results of various diagnostic tests. The Hansen



                                                   31
(1982) J -test for the over-identifying restrictions of the model has a p-value of 0.96. The table
also reports the results of LM-type tests for misspeci√ûcation in the estimated D(L, n), Œ£Œµ (n) and
Œ£œâ (n) functions. None of these statistics are statistically signi√ûcant. This suggests that the model
did manage to incorporate most of the state-dependency in price dynamics. The model is less
successful in accounting for all the heteroskedasticity exhibited by price changes. The bottom of
the table reports autocorrelations for the standardized estimates of the shocks. If the model had
completely captured the heteroskedasticity in price changes, these autocorrelations should all be
close to zero. As the table shows, this is not the case. In particular, there appears to be signi√ûcant
√ûrst-order serial correlation in the estimates of Œµ2t /Œ£Œµ (nt ).
   Overall, the results in Table 7 show that the state-dependent dynamics of price changes are
reasonably well-characterized by the model speci√ûed in (29). While the model does not identify all
the sources of heteroskedasticity in prices, it does appear to capture the role played by changing
trade intensity.


4.3    Implications

The results above allow us to examine the origins of price changes in several diÔ¨Äerent ways. In
particular, we can (i) study the dynamic response of prices to CK and NCK shocks, (ii) decompose
the variance of observed price changes into diÔ¨Äerent theoretical components, and (iii) examine the
sources of seasonality in price heteroskedasticity.
   The results in Table 7 provide us with estimates of the observed price process:


                                  ‚àÜpot = D(L, nt )xt + Œµt + œâ ot ‚àí œâ ot‚àí1 .                      (19)


Recall from Section 2.3 that equilibrium order √üow can be represented as xt = C(L)vt , where vt
is a common component of customer orders. Although this process could also be state-dependent
with the coeÔ¨Écients in C(L) functions of the transaction rate, the empirical evidence in Table 6
suggests that order √üow follows a reasonably stable process. Thus, as an empirical matter, we can
substitute C(L)vt for xt in (19) to give


                                  ‚àÜpot = B(L, nt )vt + Œµt + œâ ot ‚àí œâ ot‚àí1 ,                      (30)


where B(L, n) = D(L, n)C(L).
   Equation (30) provides us with the means to empirically examine the origins of price changes.


                                                     32
In particular, the state-dependent polynomial B(L, n) identi√ûes the impulse response of prices to
a one standard deviation order √üow shock while trade intensity remains at n. To calculate these
impulse responses, I √ûrst use the estimated ARMA models for order √üow in Table 3 to calculate
the coeÔ¨Écients in C(L). I then combine these values with the estimates of D(L, n) from Table 7 to
compute B(L, n). Panels A, B and C of Figure 3 report the results for n = 5, 20 and 40. As there is
little to choose between the ARMA(2,1), ARMA(1,2) and ARMA (2,2) estimates for order √üow, the
√ûgure plots the impulse responses implied by each speci√ûcation. For completeness, panel D plots
the impulse responses implied by the estimates of D(L) in Table 5 (i.e., without state-dependency).
   Figure 3 displays three noteworthy features. First the impulse responses appear fairly robust to
the choice of ARMA speci√ûcation used in calculating C(L). Second, the dynamic response of prices
seems to vary considerably with trade intensity. When the state of the market is characterized by
low trade intensity, order √üow shocks have comparatively small eÔ¨Äects on prices. Prices rise for the
√ûrst three periods following the shock and then fall back towards their original level. In fact the
total eÔ¨Äect on the price level (i.e., B(1, 5)) is less than 0.002 in all three cases. Thus, order √üow
shocks have small and transitory eÔ¨Äects on prices when transaction rates are low. Panels B and C
show very diÔ¨Äerent responses. Here prices rise for approximately 7 periods (35 minutes) following
the shock. The cumulative eÔ¨Äect on the price level is approximately 0.40 when n = 20, and 0.63
when n = 40. Thus, order √üow shocks have much larger and long-lasting price eÔ¨Äects when trade
intensity is high.
   The third noteworthy feature concerns the time of the peak response. In all cases order √üow
shocks have their largest (positive) eÔ¨Äect on price changes during the 3rd. period, 15 minutes after
the shock. To understand how such a delay might arise, recall from the trading model that the
customer order received by one dealer aÔ¨Äected the price quoted to a counterparty, who in turn used
the information in setting prices next period. In a model with a richer timing structure that more
closely resembles trading in the interdealer market, it may take some time before the transmission of
information through transaction prices aÔ¨Äects the price-setting decisions of a signi√ûcant number of
dealers. Consequently, the delayed peaked response may well re√üect the importance of transaction
prices as a medium for information √üows between dealers and the relatively slow speed at which
such information diÔ¨Äuses across the whole market.
   We can also use equation (30) to decompose the variance of observe price changes into diÔ¨Äerent
theoretical components. In particular, consider the k-period price change, ‚àÜk pot ‚â° Œ£k‚àí1   o
                                                                                     i=0 ‚àÜpt+i .




                                                 33
Substituting for ‚àÜpot with (30), gives

                                                        Xk‚àí1
                             ‚àÜk pot = œâ ot ‚àí œâ ot‚àík +           Œµt‚àíi + B(L, k, nt )vt ,                     (31)

                        Pk‚àí1
where B(L, k, nt ) =      i=0   B(L, Li nt )Li . Since the vt , Œµt and œâ ot shocks are mutually independent
and serially uncorrelated, we can use (31) to write the variance of price changes as

                                                         Xk‚àí1
             V ar(‚àÜk pot ) = Œ£œâ (nt ) + Œ£œâ (nt‚àík ) +                Œ£Œµ (nt‚àíi ) + V ar (B(L, k, nt )vt ) .   (32)
                                                              i=0


The √ûrst two terms identify the contribution of the idiosyncratic sampling shocks to the variance.
These terms can be calculated from the estimates of the Œ£œâ (.) function in Table 7. The contribution
of CK news, given by the third term, can be similarly calculated from the estimates of Œ£Œµ (.). The
forth term identi√ûes the contribution of the order √üow shocks (from the common component of
customer orders). This term can be further decomposed as


             V ar (B ‚àó (L, k, nt )vt ) + V ar (B(1, k, nt )vt ) + 2B ‚àó (0, k, nt )B(1, k, nt )V ar(vt ),


where B ‚àó (L, k, nt ) ‚â° B(L, k, nt ) ‚àí B(1, k, nt ) identi√ûes the transitory eÔ¨Äect on prices over k-periods
of a one standard deviation order √üow shock. The √ûrst term in the expression above gives us the
contribution of such shocks to the variance of k-period price changes. The permanent contribution
of order √üow shocks is shown by the second term. The last term identi√ûes twice the covariance
between B ‚àó (L, k, nt )vt and B(1, k, nt )vt .
    To compute these components we need estimates of B(L, k, nt ) and the variance of the vt shocks.
In light of the state-dependency results reported in Table 6, it is clearly inappropriate to assume
that vt is homoskedastic. I therefore re-estimated the ARMA(2,2) model for order √üow allowing for
a state-dependence variance, Œ£v (n) = Œ£v (0) exp(‚àín/Œ≥) + Œ£v (‚àû)(1 ‚àí exp(‚àín/Œ≥)). With Œ≥ set equal
to 100 (as above), the GMM estimates of the AR and MA coeÔ¨Écients are almost identical to those
reported in Table 3 while the estimates of Œ£v (0) and Œ£v (‚àû) are 0.001 and 0.022 respectively. For the
sake of comparison, I also computed variance decompositions assuming that vt was homoskedastic
with Œ£v set equal to the variance of the innovations from the ARMA(2,2) model. These results are
reported in Appendix C.
    Table 8 reports variance decompositions based on (32) for various horizons k and trade intensi-
ties n. The upper panel reports the fraction of the price change variance attributable to sampling,



                                                         34
Rœâ (k, n) ‚â° 2Œ£œâ (n)/V ar(‚àÜk pot ). According to these estimates, most of the short-term variability
in prices is attributable to sampling unless trade intensity is very high. For example, Rœâ (1, 10)
is approximately 84 per cent. Although Rœâ (k, n) falls at all intensities as the horizon increases,
sampling continues to contribute more than 17 per cent at the 2 hour horizon for intensities of
10 or less. These results indicate that, under most conditions, a majority of the high frequency
variations in observed transaction prices result from the presence of signi√ûcant dispersion in the
equilibrium price distribution.
   The middle panel of Table 8 reports the contribution of the order √üow shocks to the variance
of price changes: Rv (k, n) ‚â° V ar (B(L, k, nt )vt ) /V ar(‚àÜk pot ). These estimates show that order √üow
shocks contribute more to price volatility in states of the market with higher trade intensities.
Order √üow shocks also make a larger contribution to the price variance as the horizon rises. Across
all intensities, order √üow contributes approximately 40 per cent of the variance in prices at the two
hour horizon. The contribution of order √üow shocks are even higher in states where trade intensities
are at least 40.
   These √ûndings are inconsistent with the traditional macro view that stresses the importance of
CK news. According to this view, the estimates of both Rœâ (k, n) and Rv (k, n) should be close to
zero. Of course, the macro view may still be accurate at much longer horizons. To address this
possibility, the right hand column of the center panel reports the contribution of the order √üow
shocks to the variance of the permanent innovations in prices. According to (30), observed prices
can be written as pot = pÃÑt + I(0) terms, where ‚àÜpÃÑt = Œµt + B(1, n)vt . Hence, the relative contribution
of order √üow can be calculated as Rv (‚àû, n) ‚â° B(1, n)2 Œ£v /V ar(‚àÜpÃÑt ). The right hand column of the
table shows that the estimates of Rv (‚àû, n) follow a ‚ÄúU-shaped‚Äù pattern, with a minimum value of
zero when n = 5. At high trade intensities, the estimates of Rv (‚àû, n) are more than 80 per cent.
These estimates are consistent with regression √ûnding in Evans and Lyons (1999) that order √üow
accounts for more than 60 per cent of daily price changes. They also stand in sharp contrast to the
traditional macro view concerning the origins of exchange rate movements.
   Further information on the importance of order √üow shocks comes from the lower panel of
Table 8. Here I report the contribution of order √üow shocks that temporary aÔ¨Äect the price level,
Rv‚àó (k, n) ‚â° V ar (B ‚àó (L, k, nt )vt ) /V ar(‚àÜk pot ). Once again, the estimates of Rv‚àó (k, n) increase as n
rises. The largest estimates of over 22 per cent are found at high trade intensities with the 30 minute
horizon. Across all intensities, the temporary order √üow component contributes approximately 12
per cent to the variance of the prices changes over 30 minutes. This pattern is consistent with the


                                                    35
delayed peak in the impulse responses plotted in Figure 3.
    Finally, we can use the variance components to examine sources of seasonal heteroskedasticity.
Recall from Figure 2 that there are pronounced intraday patterns in trade intensities. Figure 4
combines these patterns with the estimates of Rœâ (k, n) and Rv (k, n) to show how diÔ¨Äerent shocks
contribute to the variance of price changes over a typical 24 hour period. Three features of these
plots stand out. First, sampling variability is a very signi√ûcant source of price variance outside of
European trading hours. For example, panel A shows that the estimates of Rœâ (1, n) are more than
80 per cent before 7:00 hrs. and after 17:00 hrs.. Although sampling contributes less to the price
variance over longer horizons, Rœâ (k, n) remains above 30 per cent even at the two hour horizon. Sec-
ond, although sampling contributes less to the variance of price changes during European Trading,
it continues to be a very important source at the 5 minute horizon; the estimates of Rœâ (1, n) remain
above 60 per cent. Third, order √üow shocks contribute most to price variance during European trad-
ing. The peak values for Rv (k, n) range from 10 per cent at the 5 minute horizon to approximately
50 per cent at two hours. When combined with the values for Rœâ (k, n), these estimates imply a
peak contribution for CK news to the price variance, de√ûned as RŒµ (k, n) ‚â° 1 ‚àí Rœâ (k, n) ‚àí Rv (k, n),
of approximately 30 per cent at the 5 minute horizon, and 50 per cent at 2 hours.


5    Conclusion

The primary aim of this paper has been to provide a new perspective on the source of exchange
rate dynamics. The perspective comes from considering how trading in the FX market actually
takes place. To this end, I presented a theoretical model of FX trading that emphasized how the
lack of transparency in dealer-customer and dealer-dealer transactions can lead to an equilibrium
distribution of transaction prices rather than a single price level. I then showed how the predictions
of this model could be used to develop an empirical framework for studying exchange rate dynamics.
Applying this framework to transactions data for the DM/$, several striking results emerge: First,
there is strong evidence supporting the presence of equilibrium price distribution. Second, CK
news shocks are rarely the predominant source of exchange rate changes over both long and short
horizons. Third, NCK news shocks are an empirically important source of long-term exchange-rate
dynamics.
    The √ûrst of these √ûndings is key to understanding the short-term dynamics of exchange rates.
Unless trading between dealers is extremely active, the dispersion in the equilibrium distribution



                                                 36
is large enough to account for most of the observed variance in high frequency price changes.
This √ûnding puts a new perspective on the high frequency volatility of exchange rates. It implies
that much of the volatility we observe comes from sampling the heterogeneous trading decisions of
dealers in an equilibrium distribution that, under normal market conditions, changes comparatively
slowly.
   The second √ûnding speaks more directly to assumptions that lie at the heart of the traditional
macro view of exchange rate dynamics. Recall that this view assumes (i) all information relevant
for exchange rate determination is CK, and (ii) the mapping from information to equilibrium prices
is also CK. CK news shocks meet both of these requirements but account for only 56 per cent of
the persistent movements in exchange rates across all market states, and 20 per cent when trading
activity is high. Thus, a key implication of my results is that models based on assumptions (i) and
(ii) are simply too restrictive to account for all the persistent exchange rate movements we observe.
In this sense, my √ûndings do direct attention away from the common knowledge framework modeled
in traditional macro exchange rate models.
   Where should our attention be redirected? The third √ûnding points towards NCK news shocks.
The trading model identi√ûed customer orders as one source of such shocks, but this is not a wholly
satisfactory answer: Customer orders are surely determined endogenously by agents outside the
market. Although general equilibrium models have yet to be developed identifying the source of
customer orders, there are suggestions in the literature about their origins. For example, Evans
and Lyons (1999) point out that orders can embody NCK information about valuation numerators
(i.e. future interest diÔ¨Äerentials) and denominators (i.e., anything that aÔ¨Äects discount rates). In
the former case, customer orders could re√üect changes in the expected future path of interest rates.
Moreover, there is mounting microeconomic evidence that private information plays an important
role in FX trading (Lyons 1995, Yao 1997a, Bjonnes and Rime 1998, Cheung and Wong 1998, Ito
Lyons and Melvin, 1988, Covrig and Melvin 1998, and Payne 1999). Customer orders need not be
the only source of NCK news. Public news announcements, for example, may represent NCK news
to dealers because they hold diÔ¨Äering views about its implications for equilibrium prices. If this is
the case, prices and interdealer order √üow will be aÔ¨Äected by these diÔ¨Äering views until a consensus
arises; a implication consistent with the variance decompositions presented above.
   In sum, my results direct attention away from exchange rate models with a common-knowledge
environment dominated by a small number of macro variables and towards models with richer
informational structures.

A     Trading Model Solution

This appendix derives the equilibrium solution to the trading model presented in Section 2. I start
with four lemmas.

Lemma 1 When prices and order √üow follow (11) and (12), the information sets of dealer d
starting her trading cycle in period t, can be characterized by


                                       ‚Ñ¶dt = {qt , cdt , vt‚àí2 , vÃÉt‚àí1
                                                                  d
                                                                      } ‚à™ ‚Ñ¶dt‚àí1 ,              (A.1)
                                     ‚Ñ¶dt+1 = {qt+1 , vt‚àí1 , u‚àót‚àí1 } ‚à™ ‚Ñ¶dt ,                    (A.2)

        d
where vÃÉt‚àí1 = vt‚àí1 + edt‚àí1 , with edt‚àí1 ‚àº N(0, Œ£e ) and Œ£e = Œ£u /(1 ‚àí (Œ∑2 /Œ∑ 1 )2 ).

Proof At the end of period t ‚àí 1 trading dealers learn the values of pt‚àí2 and xt‚àí2 .Combining (11)
and (12) with (1) and averaging across dealers (with the average values of udt and edt set equal to
zero), gives


                               pt‚àí2 = qt‚àí2 + Œ∑ 1 vt‚àí2 + (Œ∑1 Œ± + Œ∑2 )vt‚àí3 ,                     (A.3)
                              xt‚àí2 = Œ∑3 vt‚àí3 .                                                 (A.4)


Since qt‚àí2 is announced publicly at the start of t ‚àí 2, these equations imply that

                                     1                  (Œ∑ Œ± + Œ∑2 )
                            vt‚àí2 =      (pt‚àí2 ‚àí qt‚àí2 ) ‚àí 1          xt‚àí2 ‚àà ‚Ñ¶t .                (A.5)
                                     Œ∑1                    Œ∑3 Œ∑1

    Dealers also receive private information in the form of dealer orders x‚àót and transactions prices
p‚àót‚àí1 . Speci√ûcally, equation (12) implies that


                                            x‚àót ‚àí Œ∑ 3 vt‚àí1 = Œ∑ 3 u‚àót‚àí1 .


By the start of period t + 1, all the terms on the left are known so the dealer can precisely infer
the value of u‚àót‚àí1 as shown in (A.2).
    Finally, combine (11) and (1) to write transaction prices as


                          p‚àót‚àí1 = qt‚àí1 + Œ∑1 (u‚àót‚àí1 + vt‚àí1 ) + Œ∑ 1 Œ±vt‚àí2 + Œ∑2 vÃÉt‚àí2
                                                                               ‚àó
                                                                                   .



                                                         41

De√ûne vÃÉt‚àí1 ‚â°   Œ∑1    pt‚àí1 ‚àí qt‚àí1 ‚àí (Œ∑ 1 Œ± + Œ∑2 )vt‚àí2 as the signal dealer d extracts from p‚àót‚àí1 given qt‚àí1
and vt‚àí2 ‚àà ‚Ñ¶dt . Substituting for p‚àót‚àí1 in this de√ûnition gives

                                     d              Œ∑2 ‚àó
                                   vÃÉt‚àí1 = vt‚àí1 +      (vÃÉ  ‚àí vt‚àí2 ) + u‚àót‚àí1 .

        d
Thus, vÃÉt‚àí1 is equal to the true value of vt‚àí1 plus an estimation error that depends on the id-
iosyncratic shock to the customer order received by dealer ‚àó (d0 s counterparty in t ‚àí 1), and their
                    ‚àó ‚àív
estimation error, vÃÉt‚àí2                                                        d
                        t‚àí2 . Solving this equation recursively implies that vÃÉt‚àí1 ‚àí vt‚àí1 is a in√ûnite

weighted average of the past udt shocks received by a sequence of dealers that have traded with
each other. Since udt ‚àº i.i.d.N(0, Œ£u ) for all d, and |Œ∑2 | < |Œ∑1 | (see below), edt‚àí1 ‚â° vÃÉt‚àí1
                                                                                            d   ‚àí vt‚àí1
‚àº i.i.d.N (0, Œ£e ) with Œ£e = Œ£u /(1 ‚àí (Œ∑ 2 /Œ∑1 )2 ).

   In period t, the dealer chooses pdt to maximize Etd U(wTd ) = Etd wTd ‚àí 2Œ∏ V artd (wTd ). The mean and
variance are calculated from the budget constraint with xdt+1 = Œªdt+1 (cdt + x‚àót ) using the fact that
qt+1 is independent of x‚àót :

Lemma 4 If y1 , y2 and y3 are jointly normally distributed random variables,


                              Cov(y1 y2 , y3 ) = Ey1 Cov(y2 , y3 ) + Ey2 Cov(y1 , y3 ).


Proof From the identity, y1 y2 = Ey1 Ey2 + Ey1 y√ø2 + Ey2 y√ø1 + y√ø1 y√ø2 where y√øi ‚â° yi ‚àí Eyi , we can write


                    Cov(y1 y2 , y3 ) = Ey1 Cov(y2 , y3 ) + Ey2 Cov(y1 , y3 ) + Cov (√ø
                                                                                    y1 y√ø2 , y3 ) .


To show that the last term in these expression equals zero, project y√ø1 and y√ø2 on y√ø3 to get y√ø1 =
a1 y√ø3 + e1 and y√ø2 = a2 y√ø3 + e2 where ei is uncorrelated with y√ø3 and Eei = 0. The projection errors
are also independent from y√ø3 because the y√øi ‚Äôs are normally distributed. Hence,


                      y1 y√ø2 , y3 ) = E [√ø
                 Cov (√ø                   y1 y√ø2 y√ø3 ]
                                                ¬£ ¬§                      ¬£ ¬§
                                    = a1 a2 E y√ø33 + E [a1 e2 + a2 e1 ] E y√ø32 + Et [e1 e2 ] E[√ø
                                                                                               y3 ].


Since y√ø3 is normally distributed with E y√ø3 = 0, and Eei = 0, all the terms in the second line equal
zero.

Proof of Proposition in Section 2 The proof proceeds in two steps. Step 1 is to show that


                                        Cov(‚àÜœÑ wT , x‚àót |‚Ñ¶dt ) = 0,                                            (A.10)

Equations (11) and (12) imply that all the terms in the the covariance functions are normally

for œÄi and Œ≥ i determined below.
   Consider the orders from dealer b in period t : Lagging (A.13) one period with d = b, and
substituting for Etb pat with (A.26), gives

                                               h                       i

Next, we take expectations conditioned on ‚Ñ¶dt (dealer a0 s time t information) to obtain,

Combining these results with the equation above, and simplifying, gives

   Equating coeÔ¨Écients in (A.25) and (A.26) with (A.27) and (A.30) respectively, gives the fol-
lowing set of equations:

This establishes that dealer‚Äôs expectations take the form of (A.25) and (A.26).
   To establish that equilibrium prices and orders follow (11) and (12), √ûrst note that the equations

(A.32) and (A.33) take the same form as the posited process for equilibrium prices and orders in

Together with (1), these equations imply that

When there are no idiosyncratic shocks to customer orders (i.e., Œ£u = 0), Œ£e = 0, Œ¥u = Œ¥ e = 1
œÜ = 0 and œï = 0. Substituting these restrictions into the expressions for Œ∑i implies that pdt =
                Œ±                        Œ≤œàŒ±
qt + Œ≤(vt +   1+Œ≤œà vt‚àí1 )   and xdt = ‚àí 1+Œ≤œà vt‚àí1 so the heterogeneity in prices and orders disappears.
   Finally, we need to establish that |Œ∑ 2 /Œ∑1 | < 1 in order for Œ£e to be √ûnite. I argue by contra-
diction. Suppose |Œ∑2 /Œ∑ 1 | ‚â• 1, so that Œ¥ e = 0. Then Œ∑ 2 = 0 by (A.34) above. Hence, Œ∑1 must also
be equal to zero. According to (A.34), this requires that either (i) Œ≤ ‚â° (Œ∏V artd (x‚àót ))‚àí1 = 0 or (ii)
    ¬°                   ¬¢
1 = Œ∏œï(1 ‚àí Œ±2 œÜ) + œàœÜŒ± Œ±Œ¥ u Œ≤Œû.Condition (i) cannot hold because V artd (x‚àót ) is √ûnite even when
Œ£e is not because |Œ∑3 | < ‚àû when Œ¥e = 0. All that remains is condition (ii). Substituting for Œû with
Œ¥ e = 0, it is easy to check that (ii) cannot hold.

B       Estimation Details

The appendix describers how the GMM technique is applied to produce the estimation results
reported in the tables.


B.1     Autocorrelations

To estimate Corr(wt , wt‚àíi ), let yt = wt ‚àí Œ±0 ‚àí Œ±1 wt‚àíi and zt0 = [1, wt ]. The GMM estimates of Œ±0
                                            0
and Œ±1 are then computed using mt (Œ∏) = yt zt‚àíi with weighting matrix Œì0T ‚àó . Table 2 reports the
estimate of Œ±1 , together with the p-value for the Wald test of the null hypothesis of Œ±1 = 0.


B.2     ARMA Models

To illustrate how the ARMA model estimates in Table 3 are calculated, consider the ARMA(2,2)
case:


                               wt = Œ±1 wt‚àí1 + Œ±2 wt‚àí2 + ŒΩ t + Œ≤ 1 ŒΩ t‚àí1 + Œ≤ 2 vt‚àí2 .                   (B.1)


The √ûrst step is to write the model in the state space form of (23):

The estimates are then computed with mt (k; Œ∏) = yt yt‚àík ‚àí Œ≥(k; Œ∏), for k = 0, 1, ..12, where Œ≥(k; Œ∏)
‚â° Cov(yt , yt‚àík ) is calculated from the state space form. The weighting matrix is Œì0T ‚àó .

          i=k Œ±i xt‚àíi , and zt = [xt‚àík ......xt‚àík ]. The GMM estimates of the Œ±i s, are computed using
mt (Œ∏) = yt zt0 and the Newey-West weighting matrix with Œ∫ = 1, i.e., Œì0T ‚àó + 12 (Œì1T ‚àó + Œì01T ‚àó ). Notice
that this choice allows for both heteroskedasticity and an MA(1) process in ŒΩ t .

B.5    Tests for State-Dependency

The upper panel of Table 6 reports Wald tests for non-linearity in models of the form:


                   ‚àÜp+                                     2             3
                     t = D0 (L)xt‚àíi + D1 (L)nt xt + D2 (L)nt xt + D3 (L)nt xt + ŒΩ t ,


where ŒΩ t follows an MA(1) process that is independent from all leads and lags of xt and Di (L) =
di1 L+di2 L0 +di3 L‚àí1 +...di6 L‚àí4 . Each cell reports the Wald statistic and p-value for the null hypothesis
of dji = 0 for i = {1, 2..6} with j = 1 (left hand column), j = 1 and 2 (center column), and
j = 1, 2, and 3 (right hand column). In each case, the dji coeÔ¨Écients are estimated by GMM for
the speci√ûcation including D0 (L)xt and the regressors listed at the head of each column along the
lines described in B.4.
   The lower panel of Table 6 reports tests for heteroskedasticity in the shocks to the Bivariate
Model and ARMA(2,2) order √üow model. Estimates of the shocks from the Bivariate Model are
obtained as:

where ‚Äúhats‚Äù denote the GMM estimates. The estimated innovations to the ARMA(2,2) order √üow
model are found from (B.1) as

             ¬≥‚âà ¬¥2
              v t = (wt+2 ‚àí Œ±ÃÇ1 wt+1 ‚àí Œ±ÃÇ2 wt ) (wt ‚àí Œ±ÃÇ1 wt‚àí1 + Œ±ÃÇ2 wt‚àí2 )/Œ≤ÃÇ 2 = (vÃÇt )2 + Œ∂ vt .


Under the null of a correctly speci√ûed model, all the error terms, Œ∂ it , have mean zero and are serially
uncorrelated. To implement the Glesjer (1969) tests, I estimate $2t = Œ±0 + n0t Œ± + Œæ t for each shock
$t , where the vector nt includes the terms listed at the head of each column. The GMM estimates
of Œ±0 and Œ± are then computed using mt (Œ∏) = yt zt0 where yt = $2t ‚àí Œ±0 ‚àí n0t Œ± and zt0 = [1, n0t ] with
weighting matrix Œì0T ‚àó . The table reports the Wald test for Œ± = 0 based on these estimates.

As in the Bivariate Model, I use the Newey-West (Œ∫ = 1) weighting matrix, Œì0T ‚àó + 12 (Œì1T ‚àó + Œì01T ‚àó ).
                                                            ¬≥     ¬¥‚àí1
   The Wald test for D(L, 0) = D(L, ‚àû) is computed as ‚àáŒ±ÃÇ0 ‚Ñ¶ÃÇ‚àáŒ±       ‚àáŒ±ÃÇ where


                               ‚àáŒ±ÃÇ = [Œ±ÃÇ1 (0) ‚àí Œ±ÃÇ1 (‚àû), .. .., Œ±ÃÇ‚àí4 (0) ‚àí Œ±ÃÇ‚àí4 (‚àû)]


and ‚Ñ¶ÃÇ‚àáŒ± is the estimated asymptotic covariance matrix of ‚àáŒ±. To test for misspeci√ûcation in
the Œ±i (n) and Œ£i (n) functions, I use the GMM version of the LM test developed by Newey and
West (1987). In the case of the Œ±i (n) functions, I consider alternative speci√ûcations of the form
Œ±ÃÉi (n) = Œ±i (n) + œïi n. To test the null hypothesis that œïi = 0 for all i, I use the two step procedure
suggested by Greene (1997). First I compute the derivative for the GMM criterion function Q(Œ∏)
with Œ±ÃÉi (n) replacing Œ±i (n) at the GMM estimates with œïi = 0. I then calculate the Wald statistic for
the null hypothesis that this vector of derivatives equals zero. In the case of the variance functions
Œ£œâ (n) and Œ£Œµ (n) functions, the alternative speci√ûcations take the form of Œ£ÃÉœâ (n) = Œ£œâ (n) + œïn and
Œ£ÃÉŒµ (n) = Œ£Œµ (n) + œïn.
    The lower panel of the table reports autocorrelations for the estimated shocks. The shocks are
calculated from the GMM estimates as in (B.2), and standardized as $ÃÉ2t = $2t [Œ£ÃÇ$ (nt )]‚àí1 where $t
denotes the shock in question. I then estimate $ÃÉ2t = Œ±0 +Œ±i $ÃÉ2t‚àíi +Œæ t by GMM using mt (Œ∏) = yt zt‚àíi
                                                                                                    0
                                          ¬£       ¬§
where yt = $ÃÉ2t ‚àí Œ±0 ‚àí Œ±i $ÃÉ2t‚àíi and zt0 = 1, $ÃÉ2t with weighting matrix Œì0T ‚àó . The table reports the
estimate of Œ±i and GMM standard error allowing for heteroskedasticity. Under the null hypothesis
that V ar(œÖ t ) = Œ£œÖ (nt ), Œ±i = 0 for all lags i.

Panels A, B, and C plot B (L, n) = D (L, n)C (L) where D (L, n) is the estimated state-dependent
polynomial on order flow from Table 6 and C(L) is the polynomial implied by the estimated
ARMA model for order flow in Table 3. Panel D plots B (L, n ) = D (L)C (L) where D(L) is
estimated the polynomial on order flow from Table 5 (without state-dependence). The solid,
dashed and dotted lines respectively show the impulse response based on ARMA(2,2),
ARMA(2,1) and ARMA(1,2) order flow models.

Notes: The tables report estimates of the transition probabilities for a first-order, 6-state
Markov processes for trade intensities. Panel I reports estimates based on the raw
intensities, while panel II shows estimates for the deseasonalized intensities, where the
latter are computed as nt - nt with nt denoting the sample average rate for observation
period t (plotted in Figure 2). The table reports the lower bounds that define the 6 states, and
the estimated unconditional (ergodic) probability of each state occurring. The transition
probabilities are estimated as the relative frequency that a particular transition occurred
over the sample.

Notes: pt+ is 100 times the last DM purchase price for dollars on the Reuter‚Äôs D2000-1
system during observation interval t. x t is the difference between the number of buyer-
initiated and seller-initiated trades during observation interval t. The autocorrelations are
computed by GMM. The p-values are calculated from Wald tests of the null hypothesis of a
zero correlation allowing for conditional heteroskedasticity (see Appendix B for details).

where Ewt = 0 and Ew t2 = s 2 . The models are estimated from the mean, variance and first 12
autocorrelations of the data (see Appendix B). The right hand columns report the results of
Hansen (1982) J-tests for each specification. The column headed Df. reports the degrees of
freedom associated with each test. The variables are: pt+ , 100 times the last DM purchase
price for dollars on the Reuter‚Äôs D2000-1 system during observation interval t; and x t , the
difference between the number of buyer-initiated and seller-initiated trades during
observation interval t.

Notes: The table reports GMM estimates of the coefficients in the polynomial, D (L) for the
regression:
                             Dpt+ = D (L) x t + e t + w t+ - w t+-1 ,
where pt+ is 100 times the last DM purchase price for dollars on the Reuter‚Äôs D2000-1 system
during observation interval t; and x t , the difference between the number of buyer-initiated
and seller-initiated trades during observation interval t. The GMM estimates and standard
errors allow for the presence of conditional heteroskedasticity and an MA(1) error structure
(see Appendix B). The column headed D(1) reports the sum of the estimated coefficients in
D (L) and its standard error. The right-hand column reports Cumby Huizinga l-test statistics
for the null hypothesis that the errors follow an MA(1) process. The associated p-values are
reported in parenthesis.

Notes: See Table 5 for the definitions of Dp + , Dp - , and x . The upper panel reports Wald tests
for the null hypothesis of zero coefficients on all the terms listed at the head of each column
in models of the form
                      z t = D (L) x t + D (L) x tnt + D (L) x t nt2 + D (L) x tnt3 + wt .

In each case, the model including D (L) xt and the listed terms was estimated by GMM
allowing for heteroskedasticity and an MA(1) error structure. These estimates are then used
to construct the Wald test. P-values are reported below each statistic. In cases where the
change in price is the dependent variable, D(L) takes the form of the 6‚Äôth-order polynomial in
the Bivariate model. For the case of order flow, D(L) = d1L + d2 L2 +..... d6 L6 . The lower panel
reports the results of tests for heteroskedasticity. The center three columns report Glesjer
(1969) tests for heteroskedasticity in the variance of each shock using the variables listed at
the head of each column. vt is the innovation to the ARMA(2,2) model for order flow
estimated in Table 3 above, while e t , w t+ , and w t- are the shocks from the Bivariate model.
The right hand column reports LM statistics for first-order ARCH. In all cases, p-values for
the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity are shown in parenthesis.

Ew t+ = w + , Ew t- = w - , Ee t = 0 . The variances are given by Var (e t ) = S e (nt ) Var (w t+ ) =Var (w t- )
= S w (nt ) with S i (n ) = S i (0) exp( -n / 100) + S i ( ‚Ä¢)(1 - exp( -n / 100)) .The state-dependent   poly-
nomial is D (L, nt ) = d1 (nt )L-4 + d2 (nt )L-3 +....+d6 L . Variables are defined in Table 5. Panel I
shows GMM estimates and asymptotic standard errors corrected for heteroskedasticity and
serial correlation (see Appendix B). Panel II reports the Hansen J-statistic, a Wald statistic
for the null that D (L,0) = D (L, ‚Ä¢) , and LM-type statistics for misspecification state-dependent
polynomial, and variances (see Appendix B). The lower portion of the table reports
autocorrelations, and standard errors, in the estimated standardized shocks.

Notes: Variance decompositions derived from estimates of the State-Dependent Bivariate
model in Table 7         and the ARMA(2,2) model for order flow with state-dependent
heteroskedasticity. The column headings show the horizon k measured in minutes. Rw (k, n )
and Rv (k, n ) respectively measure the contribution of sampling and order flow shocks to the
variance of observed price changes. Rv* (k, n) measures the contribution of order flow shocks
that only temporarily affect the price level.

Notes: Variance decompositions derived from estimates of the State-Dependent Bivariate
model in Table 7 and the ARMA(2,2) model for order flow in Table 3. (Unlike Table 8, this
version assumes homoskedastic variance for order low shocks). The column headings show
the horizon k measured in minutes. Rw (k, n ) and Rv (k, n ) respectively measure the
contribution of sampling and order flow shocks to the variance of observed price changes.
Rv* (k, n) measures the contribution of order flow shocks that only temporarily affect the
price level.
