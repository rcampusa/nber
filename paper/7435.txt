Introduction


       The gasoline retail industry has evolved significantly since the early 1970's. Retail outlets

now sell more gasoline while the total number of outlets has declined. Whereas in the early

1970's the overwhelming majority of stations provided full-service and repair facilities, that is no

longer the case. Beginning in the 1970's, many oil companies have also begun to operate some

of their retail outlets directly, while the number of dealers has declined.2

       In response, several states have banned company-operated stations in the gasoline retail

industry. This unusual restriction, known as divorcement, has been legislated in six states.3

Similarly, several recent lawsuits and other legislation have sought to impose other restrictions

on company-operated stations or on refiner-dealer relationships.

2.     Company-operated stations are typically operated by salaried employees of the
       integrated refiner. The company sets retail price and other operating policies and retains
       profits. By contrast, dealers lease the station and equipment from the refiner, set retail
       prices and retain the profits.

3.     These states include Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Maryland, Nevada
       and Virginia.

       Underlying many arguments for divorcement legislation and other restrictions is a belief

that refiners are attempting to eliminate their retail dealers through predatory practices so that

they can ultimately increase prices and profits to the detriment of consumers. The arguments

deny the possibility that the company operations are simply an efficient response to changing

market conditions. By contrast, the efficiency hypothesis suggests that the decision to operate a

station directly or though a dealer is motivated by cost considerations and that the trend towards

directly operated stations is a response to changes in the economics of gasoline marketing.

       From the economic literature on franchising, we know that lessee dealers are more likely

to be used in those situations where on-site monitoring is important. Lessee dealers are less

likely to be used where the lessor must invest heavily in the site. The number of stations that

provide full automotive service and repairs has declined. Moreover, stations today are much

bigger than they were and are more likely to be configured as self service or convenience stores.

Such changes would mitigate the need for on-site monitoring and so reduce the desirability of a

lessee-dealer compared to a company operated station.

       This study, which relies on a unique national database provided by ten large integrated

refiners, examines whether the investment behavior from 1984-88 of the refiners is consistent

with predatory pricing or whether it is more likely to be an efficient response to market conditions.

More specifically, if integrated refiners were attempting to drive their lessee dealers from

business, they would not be investing in lessee dealer stations. We find just the opposite --

refiners have been investing in these stations through new construction, improvements in

existing stations and by actually converting stations from being company-operated to dealer-run.

       We then attempt to measure the effects of divorcement on investment.4 Specifically, if it

is efficient under some circumstances for refiners to operate stations, then a law that restricts


4.     As mentioned earlier, there have been a number of studies that have documented the
       harmful effects of divorcement on gasoline prices and station hours in Maryland
       (Sorensen, 1988; Barron and Umbeck, 1984). More generally, the U.S. Dept. of Energy
       (1984) concludes (p. iv) the "Divorcement laws ... result in inefficient distribution and
       higher gasoline prices."
                                                -3-


refiner-operated stations should result in refiners investing less in states passing such laws. We

find that in those states the rate of investment in new stations has indeed been lower.

        Next, we investigate whether the decision on whether a newly constructed station will be

company-operated or dealer-operated seems to be driven by efficiency considerations. If market

efficiency determined the form of retail operation, we would expect that company-operated

stations might have different characteristics from dealer-operated stations. Specifically, we

would expect to find relatively more company-operated stations in those instances where

monitoring is less important. We indeed find that company-operated stations are relatively more

prevalent if a station has no service facilities and more gasoline volume sold through self

service. This confirms the findings of Shepard (1993) on a different, more narrow database.

Finally, we show how to use a probit analysis to estimate the cost of divorcement legislation, first

under the assumption that station characteristics are exogenous, and then under the

assumption that characteristics and mode are simultaneously determined.

        We conclude that the evidence is inconsistent with an alleged attempt to drive dealers

out of business. Instead, the presence and growth of company operations appears to be an

efficient response to market conditions. It is therefore highly likely that further divorcement

legislature would be harmful, and that repeal of existing divorcement legislation would be

beneficial.

        Before describing the data and the results, we briefly review the competing hypotheses:

predation vs. efficiency.
                                                -4-


Predation


       Both the proponents of divorcement and those seeking other restraints have argued that

restrictions are particularly needed because of the numerous ways that integrated refiners can

and supposedly have driven their dealers out of business. One dominant theme is that the major

oil companies discriminate against their own retail dealers by charging them too much for

gasoline either relative to the prices charged to independent wholesalers5 or relative to the retail

prices set by company-operated stations.6 Another claim is that the refiners expropriate

excessive rents from their dealers in the form of unreasonably high lease fees.7 In addition, it

has been claimed that the oil companies have imposed other burdensome operating conditions.

As proof of the alleged predatory practices, the critics have pointed to the decline in the number

of retail dealers and reduced profitability. They conclude that only by imposing restrictions on the

majors can these predatory practices be curtailed, thereby enhancing consumer welfare in the

long run.

       These claims have been seriously discredited because divorcement has clearly not

benefitted consumers. Maryland, the first state to legislate divorcement in 1974, has actually

admitted that divorcement has been harmful to consumers because gasoline retail prices were

not lower than they would have otherwise been (Department of Fiscal Services, 1988, p. 1).8

Similarly, alleged "proof" of predatory pricing in non-divorcement states, such as the decline in


5.     As a response to that alleged practice, proposed legislation introduced into the United
       States Senate in 1987 would have permitted dealers to make open market purchases of
       up to 30 percent of sales, even though the current agreements between the companies
       and dealers might require all gasoline to be purchased directly from the company.
       Michigan has recently considered legislation in which a dealer could purchase supplies
       from wholesalers rather than from the company that leases the station to the dealer.

6.     Shepard's (1993) results suggest lower retail prices by company operated stations.

7.     It should be noted that the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (1978) already places
       restrictions on the way refiners can terminate or refuse to renew leases.

8.     In addition, station hours have been reduced thereby further curtailing consumer welfare
       (Barron and Umbeck, 1984).
                                                -5-


the number of dealerships can easily be explained by nationwide trends that show a marked

decline in the demand for car repair services at gasoline stations and a simultaneous increase in

specialty shop repairs (Temple, Barker & Sloane, 1988).9 The evidence also indicates that

contrary to allegations, company-operated stations rarely sell at retail prices below the wholesale

prices charged to dealers.

        Perhaps most importantly, the predation hypothesis is internally inconsistent because

there is no evidence to suggest that an integrated refiner could ever benefit if it were successful

in driving out its dealers. The reason is that there is no compelling evidence of retail market

power: entry is easy, competitors are numerous and brand value is not believed to be

significant.

        There are, nonetheless, testable implications of the predation hypothesis. In particular,

the predation hypothesis implies that refiners will not set up any new lessee dealers and would

certainly not make additional investments in existing lessee dealers. In addition, the predation

hypothesis, by denying that monitoring costs differ across stations would predict that a station's

configuration is unrelated to its operation mode. Indeed the predation hypothesis predicts no

pattern of dealer operations at stations with repair facilities. Our dataset allows us to test these

predictions directly.


Efficiency Hypothesis


        The efficiency hypothesis suggests that the decision to operate a station directly or

through a dealer is motivated by cost considerations. Independent dealers are businessmen

who as residual claimants hire employees, set prices and retain profits. As such, they provide

benefits when local supervision is required, compared to a company operated station where the

manager is not the residual claimant. Dealer operations are efficient, compared to company


9.      The decline of dealerships in gasoline retailing is by no means unique. In some
        industries such as the automobile repair business, dealerships have declined as early as
        the 1960's even though in others, franchises have flourished.
                                                  -6-


operations, when they can improve a company's responsiveness to local market conditions and

can limit inventory and labor costs. This could be true if automotive repairs and services are

provided at the station.

        It would also be true that lessee dealers are an efficient business form in a competitive

environment when rapid price adjustments are required. Dealers are less efficient when labor

costs are low, when customer service is unimportant, or when the refiner must make large site

specific investments. Such conditions are met in high volume self service stations. In those

situations, little if any entrepreneurial skills are needed, and there is a risk that a valuable

expensive facility will be poorly run with no ability (because of numerous legal prohibitions on

terminations) to change management.

        The efficiency hypothesis would predict that dealerships will continue to be established,

but that the decision on operation mode will be a function of cost. Indeed we should expect to

see relatively more lessee dealers with service bays and at low volume stations.


Description of Data


        We collected data from ten integrated refiners who comprised (as of 1986) approximately

half of U.S. retail gasoline sales as well as half of U.S. refining capacity.10 Indeed this is, to our

knowledge, the first national study which examines the question at hand. For each newly

constructed station in the year 1984-1987, the following variables were assembled: year of initial

operation, 1988 mode of operation (dealer or company-operated), 1988 volume as well as

number of service bays in 1988. In addition, we obtained data on investments in existing lessee

dealers, conversions of company-operated stations, and volume data for open (i.e., dealer-

owned stations) vs. lessee dealers (to test the rent predation theory) by state and year.

Results


10.     Our analysis is based on data from ten of the major integrated refiners in the United
        States.

A.     Refiner's Investments in Lessee Dealers


       The predation hypothesis implies that refiners should not be setting-up any new lessee

dealers. As we described earlier, the efficiency hypothesis predicts that refiners will continue to

establish new lessee dealers because they are an efficient mode of distribution in certain

economic circumstances. The data support the efficiency hypothesis and are inconsistent with

the predation hypothesis.

       Between 1984 and 1987, integrated refiners constructed 112 new lessee dealer stations

in non-divorcement states, which amounts to 22 percent of the total of newly constructed

stations (based on information from the nine out of ten companies that provided relevant data).

See Table 1. Many newly constructed stations are run directly by the company for a brief start-

up period until they are attractive enough to lease to a dealer. That is why in 1988 a smaller

percentage of stations constructed in 1986 and 1987 (16 percent) were run by dealers,

compared to the corresponding percentage of stations constructed in 1984 and 1985 (32

percent). The number of newly constructed stations, as described in Table 1, actually

understates the number of new lessee dealer stations because it does not include stations

acquired from other companies, many of which were retained as lessee dealers, nor does it

include new dealerships which were previously operated as company-operated stations.

         Perhaps more interesting is the fact that between 1986 and 1988 nine integrated refiners

chose to convert a total of 646 company-operated stations to lessee dealers, as seen in Table 2.

By contrast, under the predation hypothesis, refiners would never convert company-operated

stations to lessee dealers. Here too, the predation hypothesis is refuted and the efficiency

hypothesis confirmed.

       The predation hypothesis predicts no new investment in existing lessee dealer stations

while the efficiency hypothesis does. As seen in Table 3, integrated refiners invested well over

$1 billion in new and existing lessee dealer stations (based on information from the nine

companies that provided relevant data).

This investment behavior is not the sort that one would expect if the refiners were engaging in

predatory conduct.


B.     Divorcement and Investment


       An additional harmful effect of divorcement is that it could reduce the incentive for

companies to invest in states that forbid the efficient ownership mode. If it is more efficient for

growth to occur in company-operated stations, then rates of investment growth in newly

constructed stations should be lower in states that forbid company-operated stations.

       As Table 4 indicates, the hypothesis is confirmed. From 1984 to 1987, new investments

increased by 153 percent in non-divorcement states (for all ten companies in our survey) but

decreased by 8 percent in divorcement states.

        Table 5 column (1) presents an OLS regression that shows that total investment by state

in newly constructed stations is dependent on the level of company-operated retail sales but not
                                              - 13 -


on the level of dealer sales. For every gallon sold, almost 4 cents of investment will be made.

Therefore, restricting company-operated sales lowers investment. Clearly any policy of

divorcement is harmful to investment.

C.      Determinants of Station Mode


        If predation is not the explanation for the presence of company-operated stations, it is

highly likely that the mode of station organizational structure is an efficient response to market

conditions. If the organization is indeed efficiency based, we would expect to see more

company-operated stations where the capital-labor ratio is high and where monitoring costs are

low, specifically in those stations with high volume gasoline sales but without car repair facilities.

By contrast, the predation hypothesis implies that company-operated stations would be just as

likely to occur at high volume as at low volume stations and that there would be no pattern of

dealer operations at stations with repair facilities.

        As seen in Tables 6 and 7, the evidence supports the efficiency hypothesis. Table 6

shows that newly constructed stations in non-divorcement states are more likely to be run by

lessee dealers when volume is less than 1,250,000 gallons per year than when volume is above

1,250,000 gallons per year. When volume is less than 1,250,000 gallons per year, 27.8 percent

of all newly constructed stations are run by dealers, compared to about 20.3 percent when

volume is greater than 1,250,000 gallons.

        As indicated earlier, many newly constructed stations are run directly by the company for

a start-up period until they are leased to a dealer. For that reason, volume differences among

dealer and company-operated stations constructed during 1984-85 may be more probative than

an analysis of the entire 1984-87 period. For stations constructed in 1984-85, almost half of all

low volume stations are run by dealers whereas 27 percent of the other stations are run by

dealers. A chi-squared text (x2 = 8.11) rejects the hypothesis of no difference in volume by

mode of operation at the 2 percent level.

        Table 7 describes the difference between company-operated and dealer stations in the

number of bays. Only 18 percent of newly constructed stations without service bays are

operated by dealers while more than half of newly constructed stations with bays are run by
                                                       - 15 -


dealers. The hypothesis that dealers and company-operated stations are no different and that

the relative shares of bay and non-bay stations is attributable to chance is strongly rejected

(Χ2 = 33.04).

                 We can further describe the likelihood of a newly constructed station to be run by a

dealer or by the company using a probit analysis. According to the efficiency hypothesis, a

company chooses its mode of operations based on its profits. Profit is a function of volume and

the number of bays as well as other unobserved variables.

                 According to the efficiency hypothesis, conditional on observing the volume and

number of bays, the mode of operation can be predicted. According to the predation hypothesis,

there is no necessary relationship between the mode of operation and the volume and number of

bays. As seen in Table 8, the probit coefficients on volume and bays have the correct signs and

are generally significant. Columns 5-7 focus on stations built during 1984 and 1985. As already

described, data from these stations are the most reliable to use since mode choice in 1988 is

likely to be the intended mode of operation. The results show that both volume and bays are

statistically significant determinants of mode choice. Specifically, low volume and number of

repair bays positively influence the likelihood of a lessee dealer mode of operation. In the

remaining columns, we present results for the entire period. This data set has the drawback that

the mode choice variable is not as reliably measured for stations built in 1986 and 1987 as for

stations built in 1984 and 1985. Still, results generally confirm the findings in Columns 5-7.

(However, to obtain statistical significant for the volume coefficient, it is necessary to add a

dummy variable for one company with a proclivity to open stations that, at least initially, are

lessee dealers.)

The Cost of Divorcement


          We can use the probit analysis to obtain a rough measure of the cost of requiring

divorcement -- that is, of requiring all company operated stations to become lessee-dealer

stations. We use two approaches with the second being more sophisticated and complicated

than the first.


A.        Station Characteristics Are Exogenous


          Assume first that the volume (x1) and number of repair bays (x2) of a station are

exogenous and independent of mode of operation. The choice of mode of operation will depend

on whether the average cost of operation at lessee dealers (c d) exceeds the average cost of

operation at company operated stations (co).

                                 Let c d = γ d + αd x1 + β d x 2 + ed , and

                                   c o = γ o + αo x1 + βo x2 + eo , where

                                 ei 1 are iid random normal variables.

It follows that the probability of a lessee dealer configuration is:


                        P = Prob [ cd < c o ] = Prob (-a - b1 x1 - b2 x2 + e < o), or
                                 P = Prob (+ e < a + b1 x1 + b2 x 2) , or
                                    P = F (a + b1 x1 + b2 x 2 ), where
                                                a =γo -γd
                                             b1 = ∝ o - ∝d and
                                             b2 = βo - βd and
                                                 e = e d - eo

where F(.) indicates the value of the cumulative distribution that describes the distribution of

differences in ei . If we take the distribution of costs to be normal with standard deviation σ, then


                                                a + b1 x1 + b2 x 2
                                   P= N (                          )

                    where N(.) indicates the value of the cumulative normal.11

                                                                                     a        b1 ,

and       . In order to estimate the difference in costs between configurations, it is
       2σ

necessary to know the size of σ, which represents the standard deviation of costs, conditional

on mode of operation, volume and bays. We use an estimate of the standard deviation of price

to figure out how to estimate this standard deviation. Shepard (1993) showed that the standard

deviations of lessee dealer prices in Eastern Massachusetts in 1987 ranged from 4.75 cents to

10.5 cents per gallon for regular unleaded gas according to type of service.12 Controlling for

capacity (presumably strongly correlated with volume), bays and other variables reduces the

standard deviations by about 20 percent.13 Further removing the area specific component of

price dispersion reduces the conditional standard deviation of price for regular unleaded gas at

lesser dealers in the Shepard (1993) sample to a range of 4 to 5 cents.14

         That range, however, probably understates σ. One reason is that the price variation

reflects a truncated distribution of ed as we only observe lessee dealers for whom ed is not very

high. Second, the area specific effect may not be the same across modes of operation, in which

case the variation over time in price will underestimate the σ required to calculate the variation of

ed - eo. However, in private correspondence, we have learned that an idiosyncratic time

component may further reduce the range by up to 50 percent so that the range across all

stations of σ could be as small as 2 to 3 cents (1987 price levels). Again, this reduction in range



11.    If ed and eo are iid, each with variance σ, then ed - eo has variance 2 σ2.

12.    The standard deviations for her much smaller sample of company operated stations (38
       stations vs. 452 lessee dealers) ranged from 3.56 cents to 12.80 cents. See Shephard,
       1993, Table 1.

13.    Shepard, 1993, Table 2, and Table 1.

14.    The comparable range for company-operated stations is 3 to 6 cents.
                                                    - 21 -


likely understates the true σ because the idiosyncratic component likely varies across station

types. This range (which likely underestimates σ ) translates into a range of about 3 to 4 cents in

1998 dollars because the consumer price index rose by approximately 42 percent from 1987

until the first quarter of 1998. Accordingly, we assume conservatively that σ equals 3 cents.

However, our results can readily be scaled to higher, and probably more realistic estimates of σ.

         The average difference in average cost (i.e., E [c d - c o]) between a station now



                  2 σ [E ( a* + b* x1 + c* x2 ) + E ( ed - eo / station was not lessee dealer)],


company operated and one that is switched over to become a lessee dealer is therefore



                                              which exceeds

               2 σ ( a * + b * x 1 + b *2 x 2 ) = . 03       2 ( a * + b *1 x 1 + b*2 x 2 ) , where

         a*, b* 1, b* 2 are the (negative of) the estimated probit coefficients from Table 8.

The total cost difference for a 2 million gallon station (a typical volume for company operated

stations) with no bays is between $50,000 to $90,000 depending upon the specification.15

Based on these estimates, the costs of divorcement legislation, (based on about 15,000

company operated stations) could easily exceed $1 billion annually.16

       The foregoing analysis assumed that station characteristics are exogenous and

independent of the mode of operation. Indeed, other work such as Shepard (1993) also




15.    For example, using column 5 of Table 8, the total cost difference is
          2 (.0 3 ) (.06 + .3 • 2) 2 • 10 6 or about $55,000.

16.    Stations could also cease operation. We ignore the operating cost savings from closure
         and ignore the harm to consumers from closure.
                                               - 22 -


assumed that characteristics were exogenous and that firms choose the type of station to build

based on traffic flow and the level of competition and only later decide the optimal organizational

form for the station. For older stations, it might be appropriate to assume that configuration is

exogenous since the layouts of such stations were presumably chosen long ago and once built it

is hard to enlarge a station. For new stations, however, we expect that the mode of operation

will; be chosen simultaneously with volume and the number of bays. Indeed, we understand

from industry participants that it would be incorrect to assume otherwise. So for those stations it

would be inaccurate to use the coefficients of a probit regression that predicts mode choice as a

function of volume in order to estimate costs, since the probit model explicitly assumes that

volume is exogenous. Instead, it would be appropriate to devise a different model in which

configuration and mode of operation were determined simultaneously in order to estimate the

cost of divorcement legislation.


B.     Characteristics and Mode Simultaneously Determined


         We now construct a model in which configuration and mode of operation are

determined simultaneously. In our model, company-operated and lessee-dealer stations profit

functions are quadratic with respect to volume. The cost incurred from converting company

operated stations to lessee dealer stations is the difference between expected profits under

company operation and dealer management. In order to identify all the parameters, we must

impose some assumptions about zero-profit volumes for company-operated and lessee dealer

stations respectively. A station will be chosen to be company operated if Π o > Π d where Π i

indicates profit to the oil company and i indicates the mode of operation (o = company operated,

d = dealer operated). Assume that Π is a quadratic function of volume so that

           Once all parameters are estimated, we can calculate the extra cost from converting an

already built station from one ownership mode to another but, unlike the previous calculation, we

have explicitly accounted for the simultaneous choice of volume and mode of operation in

estimating the parameters. Since the station is already built, its volume can, as a rough

approximation, be taken as exogenous for purposes of estimating extra costs (though not for

parameter estimation) and we can calculate Π o ( V *o ) - Π d ( V *o ) as the extra cost incurred to

switch each company owned station to a dealer owned. (Notice that                 Πo     is evaluated

       *           *
at V   o   not V   d   ).

           In order to identify all parameters, we must either have some exogenous variable or

impose some assumptions. Because we have no exogenous variable, we are forced to impose

some simplifying assumptions to illustrate our approach. Our calculations should be regarded

as preliminary. Let a0 = ad = a. Then, using the average volume at stations of each type, we

know that

                 where   Vi = average annual volume at stations in operation mode i.


In our sample,     Vo    approximately equals 2 million gallons and   V d approximately equals 1.25
million gallons.

       In our sample, we find very few owner operated stations at an annual volume of 1 million

gallons or below and very few lessee dealer stations at an annual volume of .5 million gallons or

below. Accordingly, we impose the conditions that

                                      Π O (1) = 0 and Π d (.5) = 0,                                  (3)


       Using (1) to estimate the probit, we can estimate (up to a scalar) the constant

           2       2
           b o + b d as .4717. We identify the scalar, as before, by using an estimate of price
co - c d -
           4a 4a

dispersion to estimate in this case the conditional dispersion of profits per unit. Using the same

assumption as before ( σ = $0.03), it follows that on average the standard deviation of the error

term in the profit equation equals .03 times average station volume (approximately 1.5 million

gallons).18 (This implies that the standard deviation of the probit error is at least

  2 • 0.0 3 • 1.5 • 10 .)




17.    I.e., F(.47) = .69 where F is the cumulative normal and .69 is the fraction of stations that
       are lessee dealers in 1988 of stations built in l984-85.

18.    If the standard deviation of profit per gallon is .03, then the standard deviation of profit for
       a typical station is .03 times typical volume.

       Using the probit together with equations (2) and (3), we are able to estimate all the

parameters. Therefore, we can calculate the extra cost resulting from converting company

operated stations to lesser dealer stations as Π d ( V o ) - Π o ( V o ) . That cost is estimated to

be about $70,000 per station. This leads to an overall annual cost estimate (based on 15,000

company operated stations) of about one billion dollars.19

       Using a series of alternative reasonable assumptions, we obtain cost estimates ranging

from 0.6 to 2.1 billion dollars. In the table below, we present alternative cost estimates of

divorcement based on varying assumptions regarding zero profits. 20

       We regard both our approaches to measuring the cost of divorcement as crude but

illustrative of the large cost likely to accompany a policy of divorcement. Moreover, we calculate

the cost of divorcement only for major refiners. The cost for non-major refiners is likely higher

because non-majors typically rely more heavily on company operations than majors in marketing

their brand of gasoline. Divorcement therefore creates a barrier to entry for the non-majors.


19.    Since our estimates were based on the conditions imposed by equation (3), we
       performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how changes in the assumptions about the
       quantities at which profits are zero might affect our estimates. See Table below. Our
       cost estimates range from .06 to 2.0 billion dollars.

20.    A necessary condition for our method to work is that the difference between the average
       and minimum station volume for company operated stations is larger than the difference
       for dealer operated stations. This condition is satisfied in our data set.

       Lastly, we note that, in a recent FTC study using cross-sectional data (across states),

Vita (1999) estimated the overall annual consumer cost (based on 1999 volumes) following

divorcement to be even higher than our estimates (based on early 1990 volumes) -- $2.5 billion.



Conclusions

       We find no evidence to indicate that predation is a motivating factor in the choice

between company operation and dealer operation of gasoline service stations. Indeed, every

test provides robust support for the hypothesis that the refiners are motivated by efficiency

considerations. A policy of divorcement adversely affects investments in gasoline stations and

ultimately consumers. We present two empirical analyses to estimate the likely cost of

divorcement. In one estimate we ignore the simultaneous choice of mode of operation and

station characteristics, while in the other we explicitly account for this simultaneity. Though each

calculation is crude, each indicates that a policy of divorcement is likely to impose significant

costs on society.
