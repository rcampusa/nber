Countries that cannot attract foreigners to invest in their local currency bonds run the risk of currency
mismatches that can result in painful crises. We analyze foreign participation in the bond markets
of over 40 countries. Bond markets in less developed countries have returns characterized by high
variance and negative skewness, factors that we show are eschewed by U.S. investors. While results
based on a three-moment CAPM indicate that it is diversifiable idiosyncratic risk that U.S. investors
shun, our analysis suggests that countries can improve foreign participation by reducing
macroeconomic instability.

1. Introduction

       The ability to attract foreign participation in local currency bond markets has

important benefits for industrial and developing economies alike. Two examples forcibly

make this point. In the United States, foreign participation in the Treasury market has

helped keep U.S. interest rates relatively low despite anemic U.S. savings rates (Warnock

and Warnock, 2005). At the other end of the spectrum are developing economies, which

presumably have a greater need for foreign capital but are unfortunately unable to attract

foreign investors to their local currency bonds. This inability to attract foreign investors has

led to a reliance on foreign-currency-denominated debt (Eichengreen and Hausmann, 2005;

Burger and Warnock, 2006) and a concomitant currency mismatch that has been linked to

the increased likelihood and severity of financial crises (Goldstein and Turner, 2004).

       In this paper, we analyze the ability of countries to attract international investors to

their local bond markets. Data on all foreigners’ investment in local bond markets do not

exist, so we rely on high-quality data on the cross-border holdings of one of the largest

groups of international bond investors, U.S. investors. The data reveal very limited

participation by U.S. investors in local currency bond markets overall, and especially limited

in emerging markets. But there is significant cross-country variation, which leads us to

investigate factors influencing U.S. investor portfolio decisions. We follow work by Kraus

and Litzenberger (1976), Athayde and Flores (2004), and Harvey, Liechty, Liechty, and

Muller (2003) and sketch a model in which investors care about the mean, variance, and

skewness of returns. The model predicts that if these characteristics are priced with respect

to the U.S. investor, country weights in U.S. investors’ international bond portfolios should

be a function of bond market capitalizations and direct barriers to international investment.
To the contrary, we find evidence that U.S. investors avoid local-currency bonds that have

returns with historically high variance and negative skewness. Decomposing these risks, we

find that U.S. investors are avoiding diversifiable idiosyncratic risk, yet another indication

of the home bias in portfolios.

         Our finding that U.S. investors fail to diversify fully and avoid the most volatile

bond markets represents a challenge for emerging economies. The unsavory returns

characteristics in emerging markets are most likely tied to macroeconomic instability.

Burger and Warnock (2006) demonstrate that improved macroeconomic policies increase

the ability to issue bonds in local currency. The results in this paper suggest the same

policies will attract greater foreign participation.



2. Risk and Return Characteristics of International Bond Portfolios

         We are interested in understanding the extent to which global investors’ cross-border

holdings of local currency bonds varies across countries. Portfolio theory predicts

internationally diversified portfolios, but it is well known that investors tend to exhibit a bias

toward local or domestic securities.1 Because the benefits of international diversification

accrue through the returns characteristics of foreign securities, we begin this exploration by

characterizing risk and returns in foreign bonds.

         Not knowing the extent to which international bond positions are hedged, we form

two sets of returns, each from the perspective of a U.S.-based investor. The first, Unhedged,

is comprised of unhedged local-currency bonds for developed countries. For emerging


1
  Much of the extensive home bias literature has focused on international equities (see the surveys by Karolyi
and Stulz (2003) and Lewis (1999)), but there is also a small literature on the potential diversification gains
from holding international bonds (Levy and Lerman (1988), Jorion, (1991), and Levich and Thomas (1993),
among others).


                                                       2
markets, where local-currency bond indices have not generally been available, Unhedged is

the sum of currency returns and bond returns from J.P. Morgan’s Emerging Market Bond

Index (the EMBI is composed of dollar-denominated bonds). Our second set of returns,

Hedged, is comprised of hedged bonds for developed countries and returns on dollar-

denominated bonds for emerging markets.2

         For the 41 countries for which we were able to obtain historical returns data, Table 1

presents statistics on the mean, variance, and skewness of hedged and unhedged historical

returns over the period from January 1998 to December 2001.3 Two features of returns

stand out. First, for developed country bonds, hedged returns are much less volatile than

unhedged returns, but unhedged bonds provide a more attractive skewness profile. Second,

compared to developed bond markets, emerging economy bond markets are much more

volatile and exhibit significantly more negative skewness. We discuss these features next.

2.1 Developed Countries: Characteristics of Hedged and Unhedged Returns

         For developed country bonds, a comparison of hedged and unhedged returns

indicates that hedged returns were much higher (6.9% per year vs. 0.7%) and much less

volatile (0.017 vs. 0.140). The higher return that hedged foreign bonds provided U.S.

investors is clearly sample-dependent; unhedged returns were weighed down by the dollar’s

bull run through December 2001. But the fact that unhedged returns are much more volatile

than hedged returns, on average by a factor of eight, is not sample-dependent. From the

perspective of a U.S.-based investor, unhedged returns are comprised of returns on the

2
  Recently, some emerging market local currency bond indices have been started, but they are very recent and
hence do not have sufficient history to be included in this study. The reader should note that our Hedged series
for emerging markets does not include hedging costs, which may be prohibitively high.
3
  The returns data we use are from various JPMorgan bond indexes (GBI, EMBI Global, and JACI). We end
our sample in December 2001 to correspond with the holdings data from U.S. benchmark surveys, which we
analyze in Section 3. Six countries are included but have somewhat shorter returns series (start date in
parentheses): Indonesia, India, and Hong Kong (Jan. 1999); Hungary (Feb. 1999); Chile (June 1999); and
Singapore (Jan. 2000).


                                                       3
underlying bond and on the foreign currency; the latter component, foreign currency returns,

is notoriously volatile.4

        Although hedged bonds dominated unhedged bonds in a mean-variance sense during

this period, unhedged bonds provided a more attractive skewness profile. The unhedged

returns of every developed country bond market (except for Sweden’s) exhibited positive

skewness, while for most countries hedged returns were negatively skewed. A plausible

explanation of this relationship is that in months when developed country bonds experience

a large negative return, the currency appreciates and eliminates the infrequent bad outcome

for a U.S.-based investor. The case of Japan, with the largest negative skewness among

hedged returns for developed countries, is instructive. In December 1998, long-term interest

rates in Japan surged following the announcement of various fiscal stimulus measures. U.S.

investors holding a hedged portfolio of Japanese bonds experienced a substantial 5% loss

during the month; hence, the negative skewness. But a simultaneous appreciation of the yen

generated by capital inflows enabled U.S. investors holding unhedged Japanese bonds to

earn a positive return in dollar terms. More generally, this relationship is evidence that we

do not see “flight-from-quality” in developed country capital markets. Bond returns might

at times be negative, and sometimes severely so, but this does not tend to coincide with

broad-based capital outflows and, hence, is not associated with currency depreciations.

2.2 Returns Characteristics of Less Developed Bond Markets

        The second regularity is that returns on emerging market bonds were much more

volatile and exhibited significantly more negative skewness than developed country bonds,

whether returns are assumed to be hedged or not. The average variance for unhedged


4
 Were there a negative covariance between currency and bond returns, the variance of unhedged foreign
currency positions would be somewhat reduced (Levich, 2001).


                                                     4
emerging market bond returns was 0.8, nearly six times greater than the developed country

bond returns, and the average skewness was negative (-0.95). Returns on hedged emerging

market bonds were also very volatile and negatively skewed. The higher variance and more

negative skewness of less developed bond markets highlights a distinct difference between

emerging market and developed country bonds: Periods of negative bond returns for

emerging markets do not coincide with currency appreciations. To the contrary, periods of

rising interest rates often occur during an episode of financial flight and currency

depreciation—the makings of a currency crisis.

2.3 Lessons from the Efficient Frontier

        The potential for returns characteristics to impact foreign participation in local

currency bond markets is further demonstrated by the efficient frontier in Figure 1. The

efficient frontier depicts the risk-return profiles of hedged (dashed line) and unhedged (solid

line) bond portfolios for the period from January 1994 to December 2001. On each line,

portfolios vary from 100 percent U.S. bonds (at the end labeled ‘US’) to 100 percent foreign

bonds (at the end labeled ‘ROW’). Figure 1 shows that, even for developed countries,

attracting cross-border investment in local currency bonds is likely impeded by the

significant unrewarded currency risk facing foreign investors. From the perspective of a

U.S. investor, adding unhedged foreign bonds significantly increases portfolio risk.5 The

figure is also suggestive of gains to diversification from adding hedged foreign bonds,

which over this period reduced portfolio risk. Investors will therefore likely prefer cross-

border positions where the currency risk can be hedged.


5
  The mean-variance tradeoffs for various holding periods starting from 1988 and ending in 2001 (not shown)
are very similar. The evidence from an earlier period is similar; for 1977-1990, Levich and Thomas (1993)
find that currency volatility more than outweighed the increased returns and the optimal (ex post) unhedged
bond portfolio would have been composed mainly of U.S. bonds.


                                                     5
3. Foreign Participation in Local Bond Markets

        In this section we analyze the extent and determinants of foreign participation in

local bond markets. We first present the country allocation of U.S. investors’ international

bond portfolios, and compare that allocation with the composition of the world bond market

portfolio. This shows that U.S. investors severely underweight foreign bonds overall—and

the bonds of some countries more than others. We then present a simplified mean-variance-

skewness model that informs our regressions on deviations from world portfolio weights.

        We include in this section data on U.S. holdings of the local currency bonds of 48

countries, every country for which we were able to obtain data on the size of the local bond

market. The data on U.S. holdings, which (like the bond market data) include the holdings

of both corporate and sovereign bonds, come from the comprehensive benchmark survey of

U.S. investment abroad as of December 2001 (Table 16 of Department of Treasury et al.,

2003). The bond market data are discussed in detail in Burger and Warnock (2006).6

3.1 Comparison of U.S. Investors’ Foreign Bond Portfolio and the World Market Portfolio

        Table 2 highlights several facts about U.S. investors’ foreign bond portfolios. The

vast majority ($150 billion) of U.S. holdings of local-currency foreign bonds was issued by

developed countries, compared to only $3 billion of emerging market bonds. Compared to

their weight in the world bond market portfolio (ωm = 46.96%), local currency bonds have

only a very small weight in U.S. investors’ bond portfolios (ωus = 1.2%). This

underweighting is best illustrated in the final column, which shows the ratio of weights in

U.S. portfolios to weights in the world market portfolio. If allocations in U.S. investors’

6
 The positions data are analogous to U.S. data on foreign equity positions used in Ahearne, Griever, and
Warnock (2004) and Dahlquist, Pinkowitz, Stulz, and Williamson (2003). For a primer on the benchmark
surveys, see Griever, Lee, and Warnock (2001). We do not use Coordinated Portfolio Investment Surveys
(CPIS) data compiled by the IMF, because it does not provide essential information on the currency
denomination of bond holdings.


                                                     6
bond portfolios were in line with the world bond market portfolio, this ratio would equal

one, but it is much less than one for every country. The underweighting is severe in

developed countries’ bonds (ωus / ωm = 0.029) and even more so in emerging markets (ωus /

ωm = 0.004). But there are exceptions. For example, the relative weight on South African

bonds (ωus / ωm = 0.029) is greater than the weight on many developed country bonds. In

the next subsection, we exploit the variation in relative portfolio weights to analyze the

ability of countries to attract investors to their local currency bonds.

3.2 Historical Returns Characteristics, Capital Account Restrictions, and U.S. Participation

        Table 2 establishes that U.S. investors’ foreign bond portfolios deviate substantially

from the world market portfolio. In this section we sketch a simple model of portfolio

allocation that encompasses two features of international bond markets—barriers to

international investment and returns that exhibit higher moments—and use the model to

inform cross-sectional regressions of the extent to which U.S. investors’ portfolio weights

deviate from benchmark (market) weights.

        We follow the work of Kraus and Litzenberger (1976), Athayde and Flores (2004),

and Harvey, Liechty, Liechty, and Muller (2003) and allow for the fact that asset returns

exhibit higher moments and that investors with nonincreasing absolute risk aversion should

care about skewness, in particular, in addition to mean and variance.7 Specifically, we

assume that investors choose a vector of portfolio weights, ω, to maximize utility that is a

function of (expected) returns x, variance Vx, and skewness Sx:




7
  As Kraus and Litzenberger (1976) note, while one could include fourth and higher moments, we lack
compelling behavioristic arguments for investor attitudes for those moments.


                                                    7
U (ω , x,Vx, Sx ) = ω ′x − λω ′Vxω + γω ′Sxω ⊗ ω                                          (1)

where Vx = ( x − m)( x − m)′                                                              (2)

         Sx = Vx ⊗ ( x − m)′                                                              (3)

         m = ∑ xi / N                                                                     (4)
                 i =1


and λ and γ are the relative utility weights on variance and skewness, respectively.

Alternatively, investors can determine the optimal portfolio by minimizing variance subject

to expected returns (net of costs) and skewness. Analytical solutions to this optimization

problem are rather complicated—see Harvey et al. (2003) and Athayde and Flores (2004),

who note that feasible solutions can be calculated in most cases—but take the general form:



         +   −     +
ω = f ( x,V x, Sx)                                                                        (5)



where the signs above the arguments indicate that weights should be higher on countries that

add to the portfolio’s expected returns and skewness and reduce the portfolio’s variance.

         In an international setting, we must also control for barriers to international

investment. For example, we analyze U.S. positions in local-currency bonds, but some

countries have capital controls such as restrictions on the repatriation of investment income.

Direct barriers to international investment can be modeled by assuming that they impose a

cost, C, that varies across countries and reduces investors’ expected returns.8 If , in

addition, a separation theorem is invoked [see, for example, Cass and Stiglitz (1970)] and

variance and skewness are fully priced, a U.S. investor’s optimal allocation can be

Cooper and Kaplanis (1986).

represented by a vector of portfolio weights, ωus, that depends on the vector of world market

portfolio weights, ωm, and the vector of costs from barriers to investment, C:



            +   −
ω us = f (ω m , C )                                                               (6)



        Our empirical exercise in this section controls for world market portfolio weights

and barriers to international investment and tests whether the expected mean, variance, and

skewness of returns affect U.S. portfolio allocations. Specifically, we estimate OLS

regressions of the following type:



ω i ,us
        = α 0 + α 1Opennessi + α 2 xi + α 3Vi + α 4 Si + ε i                      (7)
ω i ,m



where ωi,us / ωi,m is the weight of country i in the U.S. bond portfolio (ωi,us) relative to its

weight in the world bond market portfolio (ωi,m); Opennessi is an average of the 2000 and

2001 measures of capital account openness from Gwartney et al. (2003), ranging from zero

(completely closed) to ten (completely open); and xi, Vi, and Si are the expected mean,

variance, and skewness of returns.

        Empirical implementation of this model requires measures of the expected mean,

variance, and skewness of returns. For expected mean returns, we allow for the possibility

that investors use past returns to forecast future returns, but we also rely on past work

indicating that business cycle variables have predictive power for bond returns [Keim and

Stambaugh (1986); Chen (1991); and Ilmanen (1995)]. We construct a de-trended real stock



                                                       9
market variable, Cycle, equal to one if the country’s stock market index is at the long-run

trend, greater than one if the stock market is above historical trend, and less than one if it is

below trend.9 Expected bond returns should be high at a cyclical peak; when stock prices

are high relative to trend, an economic slowdown might be in the offing, which would allow

interest rates to fall and produce higher bond returns. For variance and skewness, evidence

suggests that historical averages have sufficient predictive power, at least in the cross-

section. Erb, Harvey, and Viskanta (1999) suggest as much by noting the constancy of

skewness in emerging market bonds. To confirm that historical averages of variance and

skewness are reasonable proxies for expected future values, we calculate rank correlations

of historical averages (computed over the 1993–1997 period) with future values (1998).

The rank correlations are quite high, 0.67 for historical and future variance and 0.59 for

skewness, indicating that historical values are reasonable proxies for expected values. Not

surprisingly, the rank correlation for historical and future mean is substantially lower (0.31).

           With these observations in mind, our working model is the following cross-sectional

regression (with country i subscripts omitted):



ω us
     = α 0 + α 1Openness + α 2 X + α 3 V + α 4 S + α 5 Cycle + ε                           (8)

where ωus/ωm is based on end-2001 values, Openness is an average of 2000 and 2001 values,

the overbars denote historical values calculated from monthly excess bond returns over the

                                                                                  , where Pt is the real value of a country’s

equity index at time t, is the inverse of a measure used by Ilmanen (1995) to forecast one-month ahead bond
returns. We assume bond investors have a longer time horizon and therefore offer an alternative interpretation.

48 month period preceding December 2001, and Cycle is the detrended stock market value

as of December 2001.10

         The empirical results are presented in Table 3 for the 41 countries for which we have

complete data.11 We lose two more countries (Norway and Switzerland) when we analyze

hedged returns. Because New Zealand is an outlier—U.S. investors hold an exceptionally

large percentage of the local-currency New Zealand bond market—we report results both

with New Zealand [columns (1), (3), (5), and (7)] and without [columns (2), (4), (6), and

(8)]. Throughout the table, evidence of returns-chasing behavior—of either past or

prospective returns—is scarce; historical returns and Cycle are insignificant in most

specifications.

         The left panel of Table 3, which assumes that returns are unhedged, indicates an

aversion to volatile bond markets. To investigate whether this aversion to volatility carries

over in the absence of exchange rate risk, we repeat the exercise using hedged returns in the

right panel. Due to a high degree of collinearity between the variance and skewness of

hedged returns (ρ = -0.60), in columns (3) - (6) we do not include these risk measures

together in the same regression. Columns (3) and (4) report a highly significant coefficient

on the variance of hedged returns, evidence that exchange rate volatility is not the whole

story. Columns (5) and (6) display a positive and statistically significant coefficient for

skewness. In columns (7) and (8), where we include both variance and skewness, the effects

are difficult to disentangle, but skewness remains statistically significant. Chi-squared tests

strongly reject the joint null hypothesis of zero coefficients for both variance and skewness.


10
   Excess returns are calculated by subtracting the 1-month U.S. T-bill rate. Expanding the historical sample
to begin in January 1997, and thus fully including the Asian financial crises, does not substantively change the
results that follow.
11
   See Table 1 for the complete list of countries included in the regressions


                                                       11
         Overall the results in Table 3 suggest that U.S. investors avoid bond markets that

exhibit high historical variance and/or negative skewness. The coefficients in column (4)

indicate that if a country were able to lower the variance of its hedged bond returns from the

emerging market average to the industrial country average, U.S. investors would increase

their holdings by 1.3% of bonds outstanding. Likewise, column (6) indicates improving

skewness from the emerging market average to the industrial country average would attract

an increase in holdings of 1.1% of bonds outstanding. These figures are economically

significant compared to end-2001 U.S. holdings of local-currency emerging market debt

(0.4%) and of developed country bonds (2.9%).

         By avoiding bonds with highly volatile and negatively skewed returns, U.S.

investors are demonstrating an aversion to two measures of risk. But the measures of

returns volatility and skewness in Table 3 fail to separate systematic and idiosyncratic

sources of these risks. To disentangle the two, we follow Kraus and Litzenberger’s (1976)

two-stage approach.12 First, a three-moment CAPM is estimated for each country’s bond

returns. Specifically, let ri be country i’s bond returns, rf the risk-free rate, and rm returns on

the world bond market. For each country i we estimate the following three-moment CAPM

using (at most) 48 months of returns data:



ri − r f = α i + β i (rm − r f ) + γ i (rm − rm ) 2 + ε i                                    (9)



The estimated β and γ coefficients provide measures of systematic variance and skewness,

respectively, while the variance of the residual, εi, proxies for idiosyncratic risk. We use

12
  Harvey and Siddique (2000) estimate a conditional version of the three-moment CAPM. With relatively
short time series, we opt for the simpler approach of Kraus and Litzenberger (1976).


                                                            12
these in a second-stage regression to investigate whether the degree of U.S. investors’

under- or over-weighting in a market depends on systematic or idiosyncratic risk:13



ω i ,us
        = θ 1 + θ 2 Opennessi + θ 3 βˆ i + θ 4γˆ i + θ 5 var(εˆi ) + µ i                            (10)
ω i ,m



         Under the null hypothesis, systematic variance and skewness of returns are priced

and so should not affect (relative) portfolio weights (i.e., θ3=θ4=0). Optimal allocations will

not be as easily calculated as in the traditional two-moment CAPM—Athaydes and Flores

(2004) and Harvey et al. (2003) show just how complicated they can be—but if expected

returns adjust, we should not see a relationship between ωus/ωm and systematic risk.

Similarly, idiosyncratic risk should not matter because it is diversifiable, although the severe

home bias depicted in Table 2 suggests that U.S. investors do not fully diversify.

         Results from the second stage regressions are presented in Table 4. Once again,

unhedged returns are used in the left panel and hedged returns on the right. The coefficients

on the measures of systematic variance and skewness are statistically insignificant

throughout Table 4. The finding that portfolio weights are not impacted by measures of

systematic risk is consistent with the notion that U.S. investors expect to be rewarded with

higher returns for holding higher levels of systematic risk. The coefficient on our measure

of idiosyncratic risk, however, is negative and statistically significant throughout Table 4.

In theory, idiosyncratic risk does not require a return, therefore this result does not suggest a

13
  This regression includes generated regressors, which will cause OLS standard errors to be understated and
bias our results toward rejection of the null hypothesis. However, the variance of these generated regressors
across countries likely far exceeds the noise in an individual country’s estimate, so the estimated θi will be
consistent and unbiased. Put another way, there is enough variation between countries that it should not
materially affect cross-sectional regressions if we estimate country i’s β to be 1.2 when it is truly 1.4.


                                                          13
market failure but rather a failure of U.S. investors to sufficiently diversify.14 This appears

to give countries an option. They can wait until global investors decide to eliminate home

bias, or they can implement policies that are less likely to produce volatile and negatively

skewed returns.



4. Conclusion

         This paper investigates the ability of countries to attract foreign participation in local

bond markets. We find evidence that U.S. investors avoid local currency bond markets that

have returns with high variance and negative skewness.

         High variance and negative skewness are features found predominantly in emerging

markets. Is it possible for emerging markets to attract global investors to their local

currency bond markets? If the macroeconomic instability that produces the less than

desirable returns characteristics owes to external factors, options for emerging economies

are limited. However, if the instability owes to domestic policies, as emphasized in Black

(1981), the path is clear. Improved policies can lead to returns characteristics that attract

global investors. Moreover, such policies can also produce much deeper local bond markets

(Burger and Warnock, 2006), which could enable the creation of derivative markets that

allow investors to transfer currency risk to those more willing to bear it.15




14
   It is possible that U.S. investors eliminate country-specific idiosyncratic risk through holdings of other types
of assets, such as equities. However, regression results (not shown) indicate this is not the case; the more
underweight is a country's bonds in U.S. investors portfolios, the more underweight are its equities.

precondition for successful derivative market development.

                           Table 2. U.S. Investors' Local Currency Foreign Bond Portfolio
U.S. Holdings of local currency bonds are from the December 2001 benchmark survey of U.S. investment in
foreign securities, available at www.treas.gov/tic/fpis. Totals include only the 48 countries listed. U.S. holdings
of U.S. bonds are formed by subtracting foreigners' holdings of U.S. bonds, as estimated in Warnock and
Warnock (2005), from the size of the U.S. bond market. w US and wM refer to the weight (in percent) in U.S.
investors' bond portfolios and the world market portfolio, respectively. The table (which includes U.S. bonds)
lists 97.23% of U.S. investors' overall bond portfolio; not shown is the other 2.77%, which is comprised mainly
of foreign-issued dollar-denominated bonds.

                                   Multivariate Tests of U.S. Investment Using Historical Returns
OLS regression estimates of U.S. Investment in local-currency-denominated bonds on Openness, detrended stock index (Cycle), and the Mean, Variance, and
Skewness of historical excess returns. For information on the underlying returns data, see Table 1. Openness is an average of the 2000 and 2001 values of the
Freedom of the World measure of capital account openness, which ranges from 0 (closed) to 10 (open). Columns (2), (4), (6), and (8) exclude New Zealand.
Columns (3) - (8) exclude Switzerland and Norway, for which hedged returns are not available. Results are similar if returns data back to January 1997 are used,
with the exception that Skewness becomes significant (p=0.07) in the unhedged regressions. The p-value, based on robust standard errors, of the two-tailed t-test
of equality with zero is reported in parentheses below coefficient estimates. χ2(2) reports the chi-squared test statistic (and, in parentheses, the p-value) for the test
that the coefficients on Variance and Skewness are jointly equal to zero.

OLS regression estimates of U.S. Investment in local-currency-denominated bonds on Openness and, from
a three moment CAPM (equation (9), idiosyncractic risk, systematic variance and systematic skewness.
For information on the underlying returns data, see Table 1. Systematic and Idiosyncratic risk measures are
calculated using at most 48 months of returns data. Openness is an average of the 2000 and 2001 values of
the Freedom of the World measure of capital account openness, which ranges from 0 (closed) to 10 (open).
Columns (2) and (4) exclude New Zealand. Columns (3) and (4) exclude Switzerland and Norway, for
which hedged returns are not available. The p-value, based on robust standard errors, of the two-tailed t-
test of equality with zero is reported in parentheses.
