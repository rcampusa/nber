                                              ABSTRACT

This paper exploits a unique ongoing experiment to analyze the effects of early rearing conditions
on physical and mental health in a sample of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). We analyze the health
records of 231 monkeys which were randomly allocated at birth across three rearing conditions: Mother
Rearing, Peer Rearing, and Surrogate Peer Rearing. We show that the lack of a secure attachment relationship
in the early years engendered by adverse rearing conditions has detrimental long-term effects on health
which are not compensated by a normal social environment later in life.

    The importance of the early years in affecting a variety of aspects of later life,
including health, through the “biological embedding” of early experiences is now
widely recognized (see Essex et al., 2011; Fox et al., 2010; Hertzman and Boyce,
2010). Some of the most compelling evidence on the consequences of early ma-
ternal and social deprivation comes from children raised in the adverse settings
of Romanian orphanages of the 1980s and 90s. Lasting physiological and mental
effects have been striking there: the most recent findings (Rutter, 2010) show
a high degree of persistence until fifteen years of age of quasi-autism, disinhib-
ited attachment, inattention/overactivity, and cognitive impairment.1 Another
environment in which children have been deprived of normal maternal relation-
ships is that of the Israeli Kibbutz, where they were raised collectively, living
among peers with the community providing for material needs from a young
age. Lieblich (2010) provides a recent overview of the research on kibbutzim,
concluding that children raised in these environments do not tend to strive for
excellence, that the development of personal identity is hampered, and that the
quality of their relationships when adults is diminished. However, they do not
show emotional problems typically found in other institutionally raised children.
    Apart from these atypical environments, the literature abounds with obser-
vational evidence on children who have been abused or neglected, or who have
somehow not formed secure attachment relationships to their primary care-
givers, and have subsequently displayed maladaptive patterns of development
(see, for example, Cicchetti and Toth 1995; Dube et al. 2003; Nunes et al.
2010). Manipulating environments experimentally, however, is challenging with
data on humans,2 and for decades researchers have employed non-human pri-
mate models to explore the behavioral and physiological effects of early maternal
and social deprivation. While the devastating social consequences of early iso-
lation have been recognized since Harlow’s work in the 1950s and 1960s (e.g.,
Harlow and Zimmermann, 1959), more recent work has begun to uncover the
impact of adverse rearing experiences on more direct physiological measures,
including hormonal changes, brain function and gene expression. For example,
Dettmer et al. 2012 characterize the relationships between rearing conditions,
measures of anxiety, and hair cortisol concentrations. While significant differ-
ences across rearing conditions with respect to both hair cortisol and anxiety-
related behaviors are present, they largely disappear by age two. Alternatively,
Feng et al. (2011) show that the altered cortisol response to acute stressors in
peer-reared monkeys is not reversed after 1.5 years of normal life. Addition-
ally, Spinelli et al. (2009) find that peer-reared monkeys display enlargement in
stress-sensitive brain regions when compared with mother-reared monkeys, and
Jackowski et al. (2011) document that male bonnet monkeys subject to early
stress show effects in brain development in multiple regions involved in emo-
tion processing, such as the corpus callosum and the hippocampus. However,
   1 In addition, in the absence of subnutrition, children whose institutional deprivation lasted
beyond the age of 6 months had a major constraint in head growth. Orphans have been
studied in a number of contexts, see Bakermans-Kranenburg et al. (2008) for a meta analysis
of existing studies.
   2 See Heckman et al. (2010) and Schweinhart et al. (2005) for a recent exception.




                                               2
despite the broad range of studies focusing on behavioral changes and physio-
logical markers, relatively few studies have analyzed the health consequences of
adverse early rearing conditions, focusing either on growth, reproduction and
survival (see, for example Sackett et al., 2002), or on cell-mediated immune
response (like Coe et al. 1989 and Gordon et al. 1992). In a recent review,
Schapiro (2002) summarizes these studies concluding that animate rather than
inanimate enrichment (i.e. social housing rather than feeding enhancements) is
more effective in ameliorating the negative health consequences of adverse early
conditions.
    This paper contributes to the literature by exploiting experimental data
on a sample of rhesus monkeys (macaca mulatta),3 subject to a randomized
early rearing protocol to show evidence that the lack of a secure attachment
relationship early in life has detrimental consequences on physical and mental
health later in life. Furthermore, we show evidence that these effects differ by
gender, and stretch beyond the first year, suggesting that the consequences of
early adversity “get under the skin”, and are not compensated fir by living in a
normal social environment later in life.


1     Data
Our data set was obtained from records collected up to January 2010 on 231
Rhesus Macaques, born between 2002 and 2007 and raised in the Laboratory
of Comparative Ethology, NICHD primate facilities at the National Institute
of Health Animal Center as part of an ongoing randomized experiment. At
birth all subjects were randomized into one of three rearing conditions: Mother
Reared (MR), Peer Reared (PR), and Surrogate Peer Reared (SPR or Surrogate
Reared). MR monkeys remained with their biological mothers from birth and
were raised in large cages with other monkeys, while both PR and SPR were
taken from their mothers and individually raised in a nursery until the 37th day
of life.4 On the 37th day, PR monkeys were placed in groups of 4 with the 3
monkeys closest in age. Monkeys in the same group spent 24 hours together in
a cage and were removed only for testing. SPR monkeys spent 22 hours a day
alone in a cage with a “surrogate” mother (effectively a terry-cloth-covered hot
water bottle hanging from the top of the cage), and were placed with a peer
group of 3 other SPR monkeys in a “play” cage that provided the opportunity
for unlimited social interaction for the remaining two hours each day. Between
6 months and 1 year, all monkeys born in the same year were put together
   3 While they are not our closest genetic relatives among nonhuman primates (they share

about 95% of human genes, while chimpanzees and bonobos share 98-99%), they are like
humans and unlike virtually every other species of nonhuman primates, in their versatility
and ability to adjust to and survive in almost any climate in the world. For more on the
closeness between humans and macaques, see Maestripieri (2007).
   4 While all Nursery Reared (NR) monkeys are not breastfed, formula-feeding cannot be

considered the sole reason for our findings, as we observe differences between types of NR
monkeys (PR vs. SPR).




                                            3
in a single mixed social group.5 MR monkeys constitute just over 50% of our
sample, while PR and SPR monkeys make up just under 25% each (122, 57 and
52, respectively); a slight majority of our sample is male (126), and just under
a quarter of them were firstborn (56) (see Table A1 in the Web Appendix for
summary statistics).
    The five outcomes analyzed in this paper are based on records from two
sources: physical examinations and behavioral observations. Both were first
performed at birth and continued throughout the lifecycle.6 Physical exams
were performed 4 times a year by the facility veterinarians using a standard-
ized worksheet. Items on this worksheet included physiological measures such
as weight, a checklist for problems in various main bodily regions, and a space
for descriptions of particular health issues not explicitly listed in a pre-specified
category. In our analysis, we examine 3 outcomes culled from these worksheets:
a continuous measure of weight, and binary indicators for both health issues
arising from wounds (“Wound”), and health issues not due to external bodily
harm (“Illness”). The category “illness” is constructed by including health issues
recorded in two different parts of the primate physical health worksheet: prob-
lems in various main bodily regions (EENT,7 Mouth/Head, Chest, Abdomen,
Urogenital), and issues recorded in the “Other” section (the main categories
here being diarrhea, rash and hernia). The additional outcome measures that
we analyzed are binary indicators for the occurrence of any stereotypic behav-
ior (“Stereotypy”)8 and the presence of hair loss (“Alopecia”), obtained from
5-minute focal points behavioral observations, performed biannually by a skilled
technician from the NICHD Research Animal Management Branch. For each
dichotomous outcome reported, we construct two measures: one indicator of
overall prevalence, which indicates whether the animal experienced the condi-
tion at any point during the period for which we have data available; and one
indicator of frequency, which indicates the proportion of visits/observations in
which the condition was recorded. Illness and stereotypy have approximately
the same frequency (18% and 21%, respectively), while alopecia is recorded, on
average, in 14% of the observations, and wounds are recorded in 9% of the visits.
In terms of overall prevalence, this amounts to 74% for illness, 48% for wound
and 46% for both stereotypy and alopecia (i.e. 172, 111, 106 and 107 monkeys
have been recorded showing that particular condition at least once during the
full period of observation, respectively; see Table A1 in the Web Appendix).
When breaking down the category “illness” into its various components, we
notice that 171 monkeys experience an illness due to problems in main bodily
regions (henceforth “main illness”) at least once during the period for which we
have data available, with an average frequency of 17%, and that 71 monkeys
   5 Given  that the average life of a monkey is 25 years in captivity, the period spent in
treatment can be thought of as the critical 0-3 years in humans.
   6 Both the examinations and the observations are carried out uniformly across the rearing

groups in our sample.
   7 Ears, Eyes, Nose and Throat.
   8 The full list of stereotypies observed includes: digit sucking (the most frequent behavior),

pacing, head tossing, self-grasping, saluting, spinning, rocking, circling, and swinging.

experience an illness due to other problems (henceforth “other” illness), with an
average frequency of 5%. Among the “other” illnesses, the numbers are fairly
equally split between diarrhea and non-diarrhea-related conditions. A further
breakdown shows that problems related to mouth and head are the most com-
mon pathologies in the “main” category, and that rashes are most common after
diarrhea in the “other” category.


2      Results
We present three main results on the later-life health effects of adverse early
rearing conditions, reported in Tables 1-4. We state and discuss each of them
in turn:

(1) Physical Health: Surrogate Peer Reared male monkeys exhibit a statistically
     significantly higher probability of developing illnesses, both in terms of
     prevalence (p = 0.025) and in terms of frequency (p = 0.004).

Panel (a) in Figure 1 clearly shows that the predicted frequency of illness for a
SPR monkey is 0.274, almost twice as much as for a MR monkey (0.154).9 The
effect on prevalence is much more dramatic, with almost all the SPR male mon-
keys having experienced an illness at least once during the observation period.
The adverse effects of surrogate peer rearing survive the multiple hypothesis
testing correction, as can be seen in the last column of Panel A in Table 1.
     These results provide evidence of a causal link between early maternal and
social deprivation and later life illness;10 additionally, we supplement our anal-
ysis with additional data on cortisol, ACTH and 5-HIAA,11 collected while the
monkeys are still in their respective treatment conditions (i.e., before one year
of age). We show that, consistent with Dettmer et al. (2012), our results are
in line with the large body of observational evidence on humans on the role
played by stress as a mediating factor between childhood adversity and later
life disease (see Gunnar and Fisher, 2006; McEwen, 1998; Repetti et al., 2002):
we find higher cortisol levels among SPR male monkeys, and deficits in both
ACTH (AdrenoCortitropic Hormone, as in Clarke et al. 1998) and in serotonin
metabolism, as they have lower concentrations of 5-HIAA (the primary central
serotonin metabolite), which is linked to aggression and antisocial behavior in
    9 The value for SPR is obtained summing the frequencies in the “Control mean” and “Con-

dit.” columns in Table 1.
  10 Our findings are consistent with those of Lewis et al. (2000), who note lifelong differences in

cellular immune functioning, and higher mortality rates, amongst monkeys reared in isolation
(with a protocol similar to the Surrogate Peer Reared).
  11 Blood (assayed for ACTH and cortisol) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, assayed for concen-

trations of the 5-HT metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid 5-HIAA with gas chromatography-
mass spectrometry) were collected in days 60, 90, 120 and 150, in the first five months of life
of the monkeys, up until 2005 (so they are only available for a subsample). Since they were
collected while the monkeys were still in their separate rearing conditions, it is notable that
visible health effects outlast this initial period.

both humans and primates (see Higley et al., 1996; Moore et al., 2002). No-
tice that all these effects survive the multiple hypothesis testing corrections (see
Panel A in Table A4 in the Web Appendix).
    When breaking down the “illness” category into its various components (see
Table 2),12 we notice that, while the adverse health effects of surrogate peer
rearing seem pervasive,13 only the effects on diarrhea survive the multiple hy-
pothesis testing correction. Due to the importance of diarrhea (which could be
due to bacterial agents (campylobacter and shigella being the most common)
or be chronic in nature) in explaining the noted effects, we exploit additional
information on medicines taken and blood test results for a small subsample
of 34 monkeys to gain more insights into this condition. The medicines most
commonly administered were erythromycin,14 metronidazole,15 baytril16 and
imodium17 . Further the, analysis of the blood test results (reported in Table
A3 in the Web Appendix) reveal that male monkeys affected by diarrhea show
abnormally lower values of sodium and potassium (as consequence of dehy-
dration), abnormally higher values of blood urea nitrogen, and higher values of
hematocrit and glucose (these values were much less altered for diarrhea-affected
females).

(2) Mental Health: Nursery Reared (both Peer and Surrogate Peer Reared)
    monkeys of both genders exhibit a significantly higher probability of devel-
    oping stereotypies, both in terms of prevalence and in terms of frequency
    (p = 0.000 for both genders and rearing groups).

While the development of stereotypic behavior in response to adverse rearing
conditions has been documented since the 1960s (Champoux et al., 1991; Har-
low and Harlow, 1962; Suomi et al., 1974), recent research on humans gives a
renewed importance to understanding this relationship. Bos et al. (2010) ex-
amine the connection between early institutionalization, foster care, and stereo-
typies in a cohort of Romanian children with a history of institutional care.
Their results establish evidence of an association between institutionalization
and stereotypic behavior, as well as between stereotypic behavior and cognitive
and language deficits. They demonstrate the potential for remediation through
foster care. Such work emphasizes the importance of stereotypies in humans,
given the association between stereotypic behavior and both autism and intel-
lectual disabilities (Wolf, as cited in Bos et al., 2010). In light of these findings,
our results serve not only to highlight the parallels between nursery rearing in
monkeys and institutionalization in human infants, but also demonstrate the
power of adverse early experience to produce behavioral abnormalities which
are, at the very least, markers of deeper developmental deficits. It should also

be noted that in males, surrogate peer rearing produces significantly higher fre-
quency of stereotypies, as compared to peer rearing (see Panel (b) of Figure 1),
while in females the two rearing statuses are not significantly differently affected
(see Panel (c) of Figure 1).18

(3) Peer Reared female monkeys exhibit a significantly higher probability of
     being wounded (p = 0.046) and of experiencing alopecia, both in terms of
     prevalence (p = 0.024) and in terms of frequency (p = 0.017), and have
     a significantly higher weight than their Mother Reared or Surrogate Peer
     Reared counterparts (p = 0.043).

Hence, as displayed in Panels (c)-(d) of Figure 1, it appears that female monkeys
raised with males in mixed-gender groups develop patterns of behavior which
are convergent with those of males. Again, we supplement our analysis with
additional data collected while the monkeys were still in their separate rearing
conditions, to investigate the early behavioral origins of these later life differ-
ences.19 We find that PR females display higher levels of aggressivity in com-
parison to MR females (evidence presented in Table A5 in the Web Appendix),
suggesting that alopecia might be partly due to hair pulling by others,20 and
that, contrary to SPR females, they did not show self-grooming (which includes
self-scratching or biting) behavior,21 suggesting that the wounds recorded dur-
ing the physical exam are likely not due to self-harm.22 A similar reduction in
the typical sexual dimorphism is observed with respect to weight: the weight
of peer reared animals of both sexes effectively converges (the mean difference
between the weight of male and female PR monkeys in our sample is a mere
12 grams, which is not statistically significantly different from zero, see Panels
(e)-(f) of Figure 123 ). We interpret this convergence pattern as the result of
the influence of the early social rearing environment (peer groups are of mixed
gender) on the expression of behavioral sex differences.24 We observe converg-
ing patterns for both male and female monkeys, and for neither of them do we
find statistically significant evidence of a stress-related response (no statistically
  18 Feng et al. (2011) also recently showed that peer-reared monkeys have an increase in

stereotypical behaviors as compared to mother-reared monkeys. However, they do not carry
out their analysis by gender.
  19 Given the external nature of wounds and alopecia, we examined whether behavioral dif-

ferences across monkeys allocated to different rearing conditions, as opposed to physiological
changes, could account for this effect.
  20 Novak and Meyer (2009) notice that it can be due to a variety of factors, including

nutritional imbalances and hair pulling by others.
  21 Aggressive and self-grooming behavior were recorded twice per week, in the first 36 weeks

of life of the monkeys.
  22 Lutz et al. (2007) also report that self-biting is more common among SPR than among

MR or PR monkeys. Aggressive behavior and self-grooming was recorded in the first 30 weeks
of life of the monkeys, when they were still in their separate rearing conditions. It is notable
that visible differences manifest so early and translate into later behavioral differences.
  23 We do observe, instead, statistically significant gender differences between MR (459

grams) and SPR monkeys (943 grams).
  24 See Wallen (1996) for a review of the role of nature and nurture on the development of

sexually dimorphic behavior in rhesus monkeys.

significant difference in both cortisol levels, ACTH and 5-HIAA concentration
in the female PR monkeys as compared to the MR ones, as shown in Panel D
of Table A4 in the Web Appendix).25 Importantly, while gender differences in
the effects of early-life experiences on behavior have already been reported in
the literature (see among the earlier studies Sackett 1970 and Sackett 1972, who
show that males are much more affected by early deprivation than females), to
the best of our knowledge our study is the first time to document differential
response by sex with respect to health outcomes.


3     Methods
The strength of our research design stems from the experimental manipulation
of the early environment, as the monkeys are randomly allocated at birth across
different rearing conditions. In this way, we exploit the major benefit of ran-
domization, which is avoiding the problem of selection bias, i.e. ensuring that
(Y0 , Y1 ) ⊥
           ⊥ D, where D is the treatment assignment indicator (where monkeys
can be assigned to either the PR or to the SPR condition), “⊥⊥” stands for sta-
tistical independence, and (Y0 , Y1 ) are vectors of potential outcomes for treated
and control units.26 However, the benefits of randomization in terms of protec-
tion against bias from unknown potentially influential factors are lost when the
allocation of participants to treatment and control units is compromised, i.e.
when treatments and controls have imbalanced covariate distribution. In our
case, this occurs for two reasons: there is imbalance of rearing statuses across
cohorts,27 and first borns are preferentially kept with mothers according to lab
protocol. The assumption of independence between potential outcomes and
treatment assignment has to be modified to read: (Y0 , Y1 ) ⊥⊥ D|X, where X is
year of birth and primipariousness. Since we have knowledge of the variables
which determine assignment to treatment, we can match on them to account
for departures from the randomization protocol.
    Our aim is to test the null hypothesis of no effect of PR and SPR treatment
   25 Another possible explanation for these findings would be related to the dynamics of social

hierarchy after the transition from the respective rearing environments to the common social
group, and its relation to weight gain (see Bastian et al., 2003): unfortunately, the current
unavailability of social dominance data and of information on food consumption and on stress-
related biomarkers after the end of the treatment prevents us to assess the plausibility of this
explanation, so we defer the answer to this question to another occasion.
   26 See Heckman (2005) for a thorough discussion of the scientific model of causality. The

standard model of program evaluation describes the observed outcome for participant i, Yi , by
Yi = Di Yi,1 + (1 − Di ) Yi , where (Yi,0 , Yi,1 ) are potential outcomes corresponding to control
and treatment status for participant i, respectively, and Di is the assignment indicator: Di =1
if treated, 0 otherwise. An evaluation problem occurs because either Yi,0 or Yi,1 is observed,
but not both. Properly designed and implemented randomized experiments can eliminate this
problem because they produce independence between (Yi,0 , Yi,1 ) and Di . Within this setup,
we refer throughout in our analysis to “treatment” as the PR and SPR conditions, and to
“control” as the MR condition.
   27 Older cohorts are more likely to be SPR.

conditions on several later life outcomes, which can be formally stated as follows:

                                         Y ⊥⊥ DP R |X

and
                                        Y ⊥⊥ DSP R |X
where Y is the outcome vector, and D = 0 if MR, and D = 1 if PR or SPR,
respectively. However, our small sample size calls into question the validity of
applying classical tests based on large sample statistical theory. Hence, we use
permutation-based inference as an alternative approach: we perform one-sided
permutation tests28 , applying the Freedman-Lane procedure, and using as co-
variates year of birth and total time spent in the primate center, and restricting
the permutation orbits within strata formed by being first or later born.29 Ad-
ditionally, as we consider several prevalence and frequency measures. To avoid
the problems of multiple hypothesis testing and selecting singly “significant”
results from a set of largely statistically insignificant outcomes, we control for
multiple hypothesis testing using the stepdown procedure developed in Romano
and Wolf (2005).30
    Importantly, throughout we only consider outcomes measured after the first
year, when all monkeys have been placed into a common mixed social group, to
study the long-term effects of adverse early rearing conditions. Additionally, we
exploit supplementary data on intermediate phenotypes to try to understand
the mechanisms – both physiological and behavioral – underlying the observed
changes in later-life health outcomes, in order to dig deeper and go beyond the
estimates of average treatment effects.31
  28 We  allowed for unequal variances across the groups.
  29 This  is the approach that was used in the evaluation of the Perry Preschool Program
by Heckman et al. (2010). This involved testing a null hypothesis (i.e. the hypothesis that
the experiment had no impact) using permutations of the data. Taking permutations of the
data means randomly switching the treatment assignment of the monkeys between the MR,
and the PR and SPR conditions, respectively. The null hypothesis of no treatment effect is
equivalent to the statement that the distribution of the outcomes of the treatment and control
groups are the same. We used 10,000 permutations throughout.
  30 See Heckman et al. (2010) for a recent application. This method corrects for multiple

hypothesis testing using the family-wise error rate (FWER), i.e. the probability of obtaining
one or more false positives out of a set of hypotheses tests. Romano and Wolf (2005) have
shown that this stepdown procedure exhibits strong FWER control, it is less conservative than
traditional procedures, and obtains gain in power from accounting for statistical dependencies
among the test statistics associated with each individual hypothesis. See the Methods section
for details on the implementation of the procedures we adopt.
  31 While we base our analysis on a randomized experiment, we recognize the importance of

understanding the mechanisms to accumulate useful knowledge – which can be used as basis
for implementation of policies. Inferences of causality based on increasing understanding over
time of underlying mechanisms at the basis of observed effects are central to the process
of knowledge accumulation. The successive developments and extensions of the Henle-Koch
postulates, and the corresponding changing guidelines for evaluating the causal role of an
agent in infectious disease, following technical developments in microbiology, provide a clear
example of the difficulties intrinsic to positing “sufficient” conditions for establishing causality
(see Evans, 1976, 1991).

4    Conclusions
While the importance of the early years of life in affecting adult outcomes is
now recognized, establishing the existence of a causal effect on health of early
exposure to adversity can be a challenging task. In this paper, we exploit a
unique ongoing experiment in a colony of rhesus monkeys to provide causal
evidence of the health effects of early maternal and social deprivation. We
show that the lack of a secure attachment relationship in the early years has
detrimental consequences for both physical and mental health later in life, with
long-lasting effects which vary by gender. The persistence of these effects after
the end of the treatment emphasizes the need to intervene early in life to prevent
long-term damage.

Note: n=94 for males, 80 for females. p-values below 0.1 are in bold. Uncond. = unconditional difference in means between the
treatment and the control group. The corresponding p-values are computed in the columns “Asympt.” and “Naive Permut.”.
Condit. = conditional treatment effect with linear covariates year of birth and total time spent in the primate center. The
corresponding p-value is computed in the column “Condit. Permut.”. Asympt. = one-sided p-values for the hypothesis
of no treatment effect based on asymptotic inference - estimated effect size in the “Uncond.” column. Naive Permut. =
one-sided p-values for the hypothesis of no treatment effect based on unconditional permutation inference - estimated effect
size in the “Uncond.” column. Condit. Permut. = one-sided p-values for the hypothesis of no treatment effect based on the
Freedman-Lane procedure, using the linear covariates year of birth and total time spent in the primate center, and restricting
permutation orbits within strata formed by being first or later born - estimated effect size in the “Condit.” column. Cond.
Perm. (Adj.) = p-values from the previous column, adjusted for multiple inference using the stepdown procedure.

inference - estimated effect size in the “Uncond.” column. Naive Permut. = one-sided p-values for the hypothesis of no treatment effect based on
unconditional permutation inference - estimated effect size in the “Uncond.” column. Condit. Permut. = one-sided p-values for the hypothesis
of no treatment effect based on the Freedman-Lane procedure, using the linear covariates year of birth and total time spent in the primate
center, and restricting permutation orbits within strata formed by being first or later born - estimated effect size in the “Condit.” column.
Cond. Perm. (Adj.) = p-values from the previous column, adjusted for multiple inference using the stepdown procedure. Notice the multiple
hypothesis testing correction also includes the other outcomes in Table 1, see Tables A2 and A3 in the Web Appendix for the full set of results.

Note: Weight is a continuous variable measured in grams. In-
cluded above are the coefficients δ1 and δ2 from a linear re-
gression, estimated by ordinary least squares, of the following
form: Yi,t = α + δ1 Di,P R + δ2 Di,SP R + βXi,t + ei,t , where Yi,t
is the weight of monkey i at time t, Di,P R and Di,SP R are two
dummies for treatment status (we set MR as the baseline), and
X is a set of basic controls which include dummies for year of
birth, a binary indicator for firstborn, and age at the time of
the exam. Included in parentheses are robust standard errors,
clustered at the individual level to account for repeated obser-
vations on the same monkey. Peer Reared and Surrogate Peer
Reared are binary indicators of the respective rearing statuses
(Di,P R and Di,SP R , respectively). ∗ p<0.10, ∗∗ p<0.05, ∗∗∗
p<0.01.
