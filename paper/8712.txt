                                              ABSTRACT


        Not surprisingly, big countries trade more than small countries. In this paper we use data on
shipments by 110 exporters to 59 importers in 5,000 product categories to ask: how? Do big countries
trade larger quantities of a common set of goods (the intensive margin), a larger set of goods (the
extensive margin), or higher quality goods? We find that the extensive margin accounts for two-thirds
of the greater exports of larger economies, and one-third of the greater imports of larger economies.
Richer countries export more units at higher prices. These calculations are useful for distinguishing
features of trade models that correspond more or less well to the data. Models with Armington national
product differentiation do not feature the extensive margin, and wrongly predict that greater output will
be accompanied by worse terms of trade. "Krugman" style models with firm level product differentation
fare better, but must be modified to include quality differentiation and fixed costs of trading to match all
of the facts. Estimates based on these modifications imply that differences in goods' quality could be the
proximate cause of about 25% of country differences in real income per worker.

1. Introduction

           Virtually every theory of international trade predicts that, ceteris paribus, larger economies

trade more than smaller economies. Trade theories differ, however, in their predictions for how

larger economies trade more. Models that assume Armington (1969) national differentiation

emphasize the "intensive" margin: a country with double the resources will trade twice as much but

will not trade a greater number of goods. Monopolistic competition models in the vein of Krugman

(1981) stress the "extensive" margin for exports: economies twice the size will produce and export

twice as many goods. Romer's (1994) model displays an extensive import margin because of fixed

costs of importing each variety.1 In his model larger economies import a wider diversity of products

from a wider array of foreign suppliers. Vertical differentiation models such as Flam and Helpman

(1987) feature a quality margin, with richer countries producing and exporting higher quality goods.

           These different predictions matter because they carry with them very different consequences

for welfare. Expanding exports of distinct national varieties on a purely intensive margin can drive

down the prices of those varieties on the world market, worsening a country's terms of trade. In

large-scale CGE models with distinct national varieties, the simulated welfare changes associated

with trade liberalization are dominated by such terms of trade effects (see Brown, 1987). In

Acemoglu and Ventura (2001), these terms of trade effects prevent real per capita incomes from

diverging across countries with high versus low investment rates. These authors argue that such

terms of trade effects exist in the data and are the critical force maintaining a stationary world
income distribution.

           To the extent larger economies export more on extensive margins or export higher quality

goods, adverse terms of trade effects are no longer a necessary consequence. Rather than sliding

down world demand curves for their varieties, bigger economies may export more varieties to more

countries. Or they may export higher quality goods at higher rather than lower prices. If variety and

quality margins dominate, then growth and development economists must rely on other forces to




1   A related model is Melitz (1999), which features fixed costs of production and fixed costs of exporting.

                                                             1
tether the incomes of high and low investment economies together.2 And the welfare effects of trade
liberalization could be very different than is typically found in many CGE models.

           The welfare stakes are just as high on the import side. Romer (1994) shows that the welfare

costs of tariffs can be an order of magnitude larger when available import variety is endogenous. In

the same spirit, geographic isolation could be much costlier if it lowers available import variety.

This would help explain two intriguing results in the literature: Gallup, Sachs and Mellinger (1998)

find that a country's access to navigable waterways is strongly related to its trade and development;.

Frankel and Romer (1999) find that distance from other economies is very negatively related to its

trade and per capita income.3

           Large economies, just like those with low trade barriers or ones near other markets, may have

access to more varieties of imported goods. Evidence on whether larger economies import more

varieties (vs. more per variety) can help quantify one causal channel from trade to income and

welfare. Rich economies tend to be large economies, so differential access to specialized

intermediate and capital goods could amplify differences in income across countries. And because

utility gains from consumption variety are not captured in conventional PPP accounting, differences

in access could mean that the differences we observe actually understate the true differences.

           In this paper we use highly detailed U.N. data on exports in 1995 by 110 countries to 59

importers in over 5,000 6-digit product categories. To check robustness we also examine U.S.

imports in 1995 from 119 countries in over 13,000 10-digit product categories. We decompose the
greater trade of larger economies into contributions from intensive vs. extensive margins. We

measure extensive margins using the number of category-partners, appropriately weighting each

category-partner by the amount of trade involved. We carry out decompositions for both exports and

imports and relate them to country size as measured by PPP GDP (as well as its GDP per worker and

worker components). By comparing the prices and quantities of exports by different countries to a

given market-categories, we also estimate quality differences across exporters.



2   For example, technology diffusion and/or diminishing returns to capital.
3   Rodrik (2001) and others, however, are skeptical that these correlations reflect causal effects of isolation.

                                                               2
       Our investigation builds on the empirical work of many predecessors. Feenstra (1994)

mapped out a method for measuring variety growth. He applied his method to U.S. import price

indices for six manufactured goods, and found evidence of substantial import variety growth.

Klenow and Rodríguez-Clare (1997) estimated very modest variety gains to Costa Rica from its

1986-1992 trade liberalization. Feenstra, Madani, Yang and Liang (1999) related variety growth in

South Korean and Taiwanese exports to TFP growth in 16 sectors over 1975-1991. Feenstra and

Rose (2000) documented a classic product cycle among exporters to the U.S.: countries with faster
growth rates began exporting the products exported by higher income countries. Funke and

Ruhwedel (2001) found that direct measures of product variety are positively correlated with per

capita income across 19 OECD countries.

       Head and Ries (2001) try to empirically distinguish between increasing returns and national

product differentiation models by looking for home market effects in U.S. and Canadian trade. They

examine whether manufacturing industries produce proportionately more of what is locally

demanded (as in increasing returns models) or proportionately less (as with national differentiation

models). They find evidence mostly consistent with national product differentiation. By

comparison, we examine model implications for extensive (increasing returns) versus intensive

(national product differentiation) margins, along with the terms of trade effects that each implies.

       Schott (2001) finds that richer countries export to the U.S. at higher unit prices within narrow

categories. He finds that these unit value premia increased over 1972-1994. Over the same period
he documents a marked decline in the tendency of individual types of products to come exclusively

from poor or rich countries. Navaretti and Soloaga (2001) show that European transition economies

import equipment at lower prices than the U.S. does, suggesting these countries import lower-quality

equipment than the U.S. does. Like these studies we exploit data on export prices in narrow

categories by countries of differing income levels. Unlike these studies, we use quantity data along

with price data to extract information about quality differences.

       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In section 2 we describe how we decompose

exports and imports into respective extensive and intensive margins (and the latter into price and



                                                  3
quantity components). In section 3 we describe the datasets we use. We present the decomposition

results in section 4, and compare them to the predictions of various trade theories in section 5. In

section 6 we offer conclusions and possible directions for future work.



2. Decomposition Methodology

2a. Decomposing Exports
        We decompose each country's exports into the product of extensive and intensive margins.

This enables us to ask: do countries that export more ship larger values of a common set of goods

(intensive margin), or do they ship a larger set of goods to more markets (extensive margin). We

also decompose the intensive margin into price and quantity components in order to evaluate

whether higher export values correspond to more units, or higher priced units.

        We construct measures so that for each country and each year,



          Share of World Exports = Intensive Export Margin • Extensive Export Margin



              Intensive Export Margin = Export Price Index • Export Quantity Index.



After taking logs, we will regress each of the terms on country log GDP (as well as, jointly, log

income per worker and log number of workers). The regression samples will be cross-sections of

exporting countries in a given year. Because OLS is a linear operator, the coefficients from right-

hand-side component regressions sum to the coefficients from left-hand-side regressions. In

effect, the regressions additively decompose the margins along which larger economies tend to

export more. For exporting country 4 in a given year, we define the variables as follows:



(2.1)                           Share of World Exports = B4 ÎB[



where B4 = nominal exports of country 4, and B[ = nominal world exports (from all countries to



                                                  4
all countries).

where B[ 3= = world exports to country 3 in product category =, and \43s = {the set of market-

those market-categories in which it exports.

The extensive margin for country 4 measures the fraction of world exports that occur in those

market-categories in which country 4 exports. This extensive margin is a cross-country and export

analogue of Feenstra's (1994) measure of import variety growth across time for a given country.

Other things equal, if a country concentrates all of its exports in a small number of market-

categories, it will have a higher intensive export margin and a lower extensive margin. If that

country spreads its exports thinly over many market-categories, it will have a lower intensive

export margin and a higher extensive margin.

        An alternative decomposition would define the extensive margin simply as the number of

market categories in which the country exports, with the intensive margin described by an average

of exports per market-category. Such a simple count of market-categories treats small and large

market-categories equally in calculating the extensive margin. That is, selling wind-up toys to

Lichtenstein gets equal weight with selling cars to Germany. Our measure of the extensive margin

(2.3) can be understood as a weighted count, with each market-category receiving a weight equal

to its share in world exports.4


4Because (2.3) weights market-categories by their importance in world exports rather than a country's own exports, it
might overstate the extensive margin if the distribution of exports across market-categories is more left-skewed in

        The intensive margin in (2.2) is calculated using nominal export shares in each market-

category. For each market-category, we break the intensive margin down into price and quantity

components. We then aggregate these components across market-categories to calculate an export

price index and an export quantity index for each country. The export price index for exporter 4 is

where q43= = the quantity of exports from country 4 to country 3 in category =, p43= = B43= Îq43= , qW3=

= the quantity of world exports to country 3 in category =, and p[ 3= = B[ 3= Îq[ 3= . The index is a

geometric-weighted average of two price indices, one using the country's own export quantities to

weight market-categories and the other using world export quantities to weight market-categories.

This is a Fisher Ideal Index, which is widely used for constructing price and quantity indices (e.g.,

U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2001). The export price index in (2.3) summarizes the extent

to which an exporter's prices are high or low relative to other prices in the same market-category.

Price variation within market-categories may be due, in part, to quality variation, but the two are

distinct objects. We elaborate on this point in Section 5.

        We define the quantity price index for exporter 4 compatibly:

differences across exporters in prices and quantities combine to yield differences in nominal

export values on the intensive margin.


larger economies. We find no correlation between a country's size and the skewness of its export shares across
market-categories.

                                                          6
        In our empirical implementation we will also calculate intensive and extensive margins

based on export categories rather than export market-categories. Comparing the two measures of

the extensive margin will allow us to gauge the importance of categories compared to that of

destination countries within categories. Decompositions based on categories replace the set \43=
with the set \4= = {categories = in which B43= > 0 for some importer i}.



2b. Decomposing Imports

        For importing country 3 in a given year, we define the import variables analogously:



(2.6)                             Share of World Imports = 73 Î7[



where 73 = nominal imports of country 3, and 7[ = world imports (by all countries from all

countries).


                                                             73
(2.7)                    Intensive Import Margin =     ! ! 7
                                                                  [ 4=

where 7[ 4= = world nominal imports from country 4 in category =, and Q34= = {source-categories
(4ß =Ñ for which 734= > 0} where 734= = nominal imports by country 3 from country 4 in category
=. The intensive import margin measures a country's share of world imports in those source-

categories in which it imports.


                                                   ! ! 7
                                                              [ 4=
                                                   4Á3 s­Q34=

The extensive import margin for country 3 measures the fraction of world imports that occur in the

source-categories in which country 3 imports.




                                                 7
        Unfortunately, we cannot decompose the intensive margin for imports into price and

quantity components, as we did for exports. The reason is that quantity units may differ across

importers in a particular category.5 This means we cannot determine, for example, the extent to
which richer countries import higher priced products within categories. This is not a problem on

the export side because all calculations are defined relative to world shipments to a particular

importer in a particular category.



3. Data Description

        The trade data we use are drawn from two sources. Worldwide trade data are taken from

UNCTAD's Trade Analysis and Information System (TRAINS) CD-ROM for 1995. The TRAINS

project combines bilateral imports data collected by the national statistical agencies of 76

importing countries, covering all exporting countries (227 in 1995). The data are reported in the

Harmonized System classification code at the 6 digit level, or 5,017 goods, and include shipment

values and quantities. For a subset of these countries (110 of the 227 exporters and 59 of the 76

importers), we have matching employment and GDP data (discussed below). The 59 importers

represent the vast majority of world imports, so total shipments for each exporter reported in

TRAINS closely approximates worldwide shipments for that exporter.

        U.S. trade data with more product detail are taken from the "U.S. Imports of Merchandise"

CD-ROM for 1995, published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. These data are drawn from

electronically submitted Customs forms that report the country of origin, value, quantity, freight

paid, duties paid, and Harmonized System (HS) classification code for each shipment entering the

United States. The 10-digit HS scheme includes 13,386 highly detailed goods categories. There

are, for example, 13 separate lines covering motorcycles, and 140 lines covering various auto




5 Email correspondence from Hiroaki Kuwahara, Chief of the Trade Information Section of the Trade Analysis Branch
of DITC/UNCTAD: "The quantity of imports can only be compared among different exporters in a given market
for a given product in a given year. While in most cases, quantity is given in KG or Metric Tons, other units, such as
litres, square meters etc, are also used, and are NOT consistent among different markets (and sometimes not even in a
same market in different years) for a given product."

parts. The data include all countries shipping to the United States, a total of 222 in 1995. We

have employment and output data in 1995 for 119 of these exporters.6
         In both datasets, we measure prices as unit values (value/quantity). Quantity (and therefore

price) data are missing for approximately 16 percent of U.S. observations and 18 percent of

worldwide observations for 1995.7 When the U.S. data include multiple shipments from an

exporter to an importer in a 10-digit category, we aggregate values and quantities. The resulting

prices are quantity-weighted averages of prices found within shipments from that exporter in that

category.

         Data on national employment and GDP at 1996 international prices (PPP) come from

Summers and Heston (2001). We use PPP GDP, as opposed to GDP at current market exchange

rates, to avoid any "mechanical" association between an exporter's price and GDP through the

value of its market exchange rate. For some calculations in Section 5, however, we need import

shares in GDP at market exchange rates. We obtain GDP at market exchange rates in 1995 from

the World Bank's World Development Indicators.



4. Decomposition Results

4a. Results for Exports
         Table 1 presents extensive vs. intensive margins estimated using 1995 U.N. data on

exports by 110 countries to 59 importers in 5,017 categories. Each exporting country is an

observation (so 110 observations total). All of the coefficients in this and subsequent Tables are

significantly different from zero (p-values below 1%) unless otherwise noted. Table 1 includes

results from regressions on GDP per worker and number of workers jointly, but for brevity we

focus on the third column, regressions on total GDP. The first row shows that countries with

twice the PPP GDP (in 1996 dollars) export roughly twice as much. The second and third rows

indicate that one-third of the additional exporting done by larger economies occurs on the


6The remaining 103, primarily very small or former Soviet-bloc countries, comprise only 6% of U.S. trade in 1995.
7The likelihood that quantity data are missing is unrelated to any of the variables employed in this study, and so our
analyses should not be biased by dropping these observations.

intensive margin (within each market-category) and two-thirds on the extensive margin (exporting

in more categories and to more countries within categories).

       Table 2 sheds light on the extensive margin by calculating it in several different ways. The

first row repeats the last row of Table 1. The second row measures the extensive margin using a

simple count of category-markets in which the exporter ships. Unlike the first row, this gives an

equal weight to all categories and markets, regardless of their size. The second row shows that

larger economies export in a higher number of markets and categories, and that the simple count
of market-categories rises faster with GDP than does the count weighting market-categories by

their share of world export volume (compare rows 1 and 2). This indicates that larger economies

are more likely to export in "small" market-categories.

       The third row calculates the extensive margin using categories rather than market-

categories. That is, if two countries export the same set of goods, but one exports to more

markets, it will have a larger extensive margin in row one, but the same extensive margin in row

three. The extensive margin defined in terms of categories accounts for 44% of the greater

volume of exports of larger economies. Comparing the first and third rows, around two-thirds of

the extensive margin comes from exporting in more categories, while one-third comes from

shipments to additional destinations within categories. The fourth and final row of Table 2 again

defines the extensive margin in terms of categories, but uses a simple count that gives equal

weight to all categories regardless of their importance in trade. It shows that a country with twice
the GDP typically exports in 62% more categories. Because counts rise faster with GDP than do

weighted counts, larger economies must be more likely to export in "small" categories.

       Table 3 breaks the intensive margin into its price and quantity components. Countries with

twice the GDP per worker (but the same employment) export 21% more quantity at 19% higher

prices within market-categories. Also within market-categories, countries with twice the

employment export 27% more quantity at 4% higher prices.




                                                 10
4b. Results for Imports
          Table 4 presents extensive and intensive margins for the imports of 59 countries (from 110

exporters in 5,017 categories in 1995). Twice the GDP per worker is associated with almost twice

the imports (94% more according to the first row). In contrast to exports, we find a larger

intensive margin (72%) than extensive margin (28%), i.e. for imports we find that greater imports

mostly take the form of more imports per source-category rather than more source-categories.

          Table 5 provides alternative estimates of the extensive margin for imports (see the Table 3

discussion for details). Comparing the first two rows of Table 5 reveals that simple counts of

source-categories rise more quickly with importer size than do the counts of these source-

categories weighted by their share in world imports. This tells us that larger economies are more

likely to import in "smaller" source-categories. Looking at the final two rows of Table 5, we can

see that economies twice the size import in 17% more categories, but that the greater range of

categories accounts for only 9% of their additional imports. Larger economies have a greater

propensity to import in categories accounting for a small share of world imports.



4c. Robustness to Using U.S. Import Data

          Our results with the U.N. data might understate the extensive margin if there are multiple

varieties within 6-digit U.N. product categories to a given market from a given source country.

For example, Japan exported 56 distinct car models to the U.S. in 1995.8 For this reason (and to
check overall robustness), we examine U.S. imports, which are available in 10-digit category

detail (13,386 categories compared to the 5,017 in the 6-digit U.N. data).

          Table 6 decomposes exports for a sample of 119 countries exporting to the U.S. in 1995.

The extensive margin in Table 3 accounts for 54% of additional exports to the U.S. by larger

economies. The extensive margin here is categories (rather than market-categories) because the

U.S. is the only destination market. The results are therefore not directly comparable to the results

with the 6-digit U.N. data. We can, however, compare extensive margins at different levels of

aggregation for a single dataset. Table 7 does this for the U.N. dataset and the U.S. dataset. For

the U.N. dataset the measure of the extensive margin is categories. The two datasets display

similar rates of decline of the extensive margin when moving from the 6-digit level to the 4-digit

level and 2-digit level.9 In the U.S. dataset, Table 7 shows that the extensive margin is notably
higher at the 10-digit level (54%) than at the 6-digit level (46%). Bigger economies export to the

U.S. in more 10-digit categories within 6-digit categories.

           Table 8 decomposes each country's exports to the U.S. into their price and quantity

components, and regresses on exporter size. Richer economies export higher quantities to the U.S.

at higher prices, and countries with more workers export higher quantities at no lower prices.

Exports by 119 countries to the U.S. in 1995 tell a remarkably similar story to that told by exports

by 110 countries to 59 countries in 1995 in the U.N. data.



4d. Other Robustness Checks

           We carried out a number of other robustness checks on our results. First and foremost, we

explored whether the results change when we include measures of trade barriers. For the U.S.

dataset, we used (total duties + total freight)/(nominal exports). We calculated this for each

exporter 4 in each 10-digit category =, then weighted by the share of category = in U.S. imports

from all countries to obtain a barrier 74 for country 4's exports. When we add this variable as a

control to all of the Table 6 and Table 8 regressions, none of the coefficients on exporter size is
altered by even one standard error, and the barrier measure is always insignificant. The same

statements apply when the barrier measure is constructed from a country's barrier in category =

relative to the average barrier across all exporters in that category.

           For the U.N. countries and categories, data on tariffs and freight costs are not readily

available. In their stead we deploy crude proxies for barriers. One proxy, in the spirit of Frankel

and Romer (1999), is a country's distance to markets. For exporter 4, the distance to market 3 is

weighted by country 3's share of world output in 1995 at market exchange rates. The weights are


9   The extensive margin is zero, of course, at the economy (0-digit) level.

                                                             12
normalized to sum to one for each exporter 4 and produce a 4-specific measure of distance to

markets. The other two barrier proxies we construct are averages of (4ß 3) indicator variables

denoting a common language and a common border, both also summed across 3's (again weighting

by 3's share of world output). When we included these three proxies as controls in the Table 1 and

3 regressions, it had no material effect on any of the exporter size coefficients.

        As another robustness check, we examined decompositions for consumption goods and

intermediate plus capital goods separately.10 Smaller countries may have a narrower range of
industries (because of fixed costs of production) and hence no demand for imports of certain

intermediates and capital goods. For example, a country without a steel industry would have no

demand for imported steel-making equipment. On the grounds that people are generalists in

consumption (vs. specialists in production), this argument has much less force for consumer

goods. The results, both for exports and imports, were very similar to those reported in Tables 1

through 5. We view this as crucial evidence that the (moderate) extensive margin we estimated

for imports in Table 4 is not due to the absence of industrial demand.

        We performed a variety of other robustness checks. We split the sample into the top and

bottom halves of GDP. Again, the results were qualitatively similar to those with the entire

sample. We redid Table 1 using only the 59 exporters for which we also had import data. The

results changed very little. This means that the difference in the size of the extensive margin on

the export size (around two-thirds) versus the import size (less than one-third) is not due to

different samples of countries. For Table 2 in particular, we replaced the GDP per worker

regressors with GDP per worker relative to the category mean. The idea was that an exporter's

relative price should depend on whether the exporter was rich relative to other exporters in the

category. The coefficients changed very little. Finally, we redid the U.S. import regressions using

1990 data. The results were very similar to those reported in Tables 6 and 7 with 1995 data.




10 We use the UN's Broad Economic Classification system which provides a split of trade categories into capital,
intermediate, and consumption goods.

5. How Various Models Stack Up Against the Decompositions Results

        In this section we compare the predictions of five trade models to the facts we documented

in the previous section. We do not consider these to be "tests" in the formal sense, and the models

we choose are deliberately stark in their predictions. Our goal is twofold: first, to use the

structure of these models to interpret our facts and highlight potential welfare implications;

second, to identify features of these models that fit our facts more or less well, with the hope that

this can point future work in a useful direction.
        The models we consider are as follows: a simple Armington model of nationally

differentiated goods, Acemoglu and Ventura's (2001) model of the world income distribution, a

simple Krugman model of increasing returns in production, a simple model of endogenous quality

differentiation, and Romer's (1994) model of fixed costs of importing each variety. In Table 9 we

summarize the data and each model's implication for the size of intensive vs. extensive margins

for exports and imports. In Table 10 we summarize the data and model predictions for the price

and quantity components of the intensive margin for exports. We now lay out one model at a time

to explain the corresponding entries in the Tables.



5a. A Simple Armington Model

        In this subsection we describe a simple model embodying the Armington (1969)

assumption that goods are differentiated by national origin. There are N countries, with country 4
producing a unique variety. Consumer preferences are identical across countries. All workers

within a country have the same income and preferences. A representative worker/consumer in

each country 3 chooses q34 for 4 = 1, ..., J to maximize


                                                    N

                                                    14
Here q34 is the number of units of country 4's variety purchased by country 3, and 5 > 1 is the
elasticity of substitution between varieties. In (5.2) p4 is the world price of country 4's variety, q3
is the number of units that country 3 produces of its variety, and ]3 is GDP in country 3. There are

no tariffs, transportation costs, or other trade barriers.

        Since all consumers in the world face the same prices and have the same preferences,

world demand reflects individual consumer demand. From (5.1) and (5.2) we get that relative

demands are decreasing in relative prices:

                                                            -5

        A representative firm produces a country's variety with the production technology



(5.4)                                         q4 = E4 L4 ,


where E4 and P4 are labor productivity and the number of workers in country 4. The model has no

physical capital. (In each country, the representative firm is a stand-in for a continuum of

competitive firms operating with this linear technology.) The firm hires labor (taking the country
wage rate a given) to maximize profits



                                              p4 q4 - w4 L4 ,


where w4 is the wage in country 4. A competitive market for each variety ensures that price equals

marginal cost:


                                                           w4
(5.5)                                             p4 =     E4   .



                                                      15
Substituting (5.5) for countries 3 and 4 into (5.3) yields

                                                                     5

This expression incorporates both preferences and technology. It says that, conditional on wages,

country 4 produces more units (relative to country 3) the higher the country's process productivity.

         Combining (5.4) and (5.6) pins down the market-clearing wage as

Using (5.7) in (5.5) and (5.6) gives

Having a large economy drives up the quantities produced of each variety (5.9), thereby driving


                                                            16
down their unit prices (5.10). This important property of the Armington model arises because

each country is assumed to produce a unique variety. Producing more drives consumers down a

single demand curve for the national variety, adversely affecting the country's terms of trade.

(This terms of trade effect dominates welfare calculations of trade liberalizations conducted in

CGE models with Armington preferences, see Brown (1987)). The price effect only partially

offsets the quantity effect, however, because demand is elastic (5 > 1). Thus a bigger workforce

lowers GDP per worker but increases GDP (5.8). Higher GDP per worker occurs as a result of
higher process productivity E.

       This simple Armington model predicts that larger economies trade more entirely on the

intensive margin. Without an extensive margin the model misses two-thirds of how larger

economies export more, and one-third of how they import more. (See the first and second rows of

Table 9.) The model also predicts that countries with higher GDP will export higher quantities at

lower prices. In the data, countries with higher GDP do export higher quantities, though not

nearly to the extent predicted by the model (elasticities around a quarter in the data vs. greater than

one in the model). The price facts are similarly at odds with the predictions of this Armington

model. Richer countries export at higher prices, and countries with more workers export at no

lower prices than countries with fewer workers. (Compare the first and second rows of Table 10.)



5b. Acemoglu and Ventura's Model of the World Income Distribution
       Acemoglu and Ventura (2001) add endogenous capital accumulation and an endogenous

number of varieties to the Armington model of the previous section. They posit constant returns

to capital in the production of each variety, and a fixed labor requirement for producing each

variety. In equilibrium the number of varieties a country produces is proportional to its

employment, and countries with higher income per worker have lower export prices. The terms of

trade are a crucial mechanism in their model. Absent counterbalancing terms of trade effects,

incomes of high investment rate countries would diverge from low investment rate countries. This

is an important point as their story challenges the traditional view that diminishing returns to



                                                  17
capital prevent income divergence. With a strong enough terms of trade mechanism their model

does not require any externalities, such as technology diffusion across countries, to maintain a

stationary world income distribution.

        Acemoglu and Ventura's model contains an extensive export margin with respect to the

size of the labor force but not an extensive import margin: countries with more workers will

produce and export more varieties, but all countries import all varieties. Their model contains no

extensive margin with respect to GDP per worker, and this is critical to their explanation for why
the world income distribution remains stationary. In the model, richer countries export higher

quantities of each variety, driving down their prices on the world market. In contrast, the data

reveal an important extensive margin with respect to GDP per worker. Exporting in more market-

categories accounts for over two-thirds of the greater exports of richer countries.

         Acemoglu and Ventura report that their model comes close to generating the observed

variation in income across countries if 1% higher GDP per worker goes along with 0.7% lower

export prices. This requires an elasticity of substitution of around 2.3 between the varieties of

different countries. If the elasticity is higher than 2.3 then the terms of trade effects will be

weaker. If richer countries produce more varieties, this too will weaken the terms of trade effects.

Whatever the cause, if the evidence does not support a terms of trade elasticity in the

neighborhood of -0.7%, then their model generates more variation in income per worker across

countries than we observe in the data.
        The third row of Table 10 summarizes these predictions for export prices and quantities.

Comparing the first and third rows, it is clear that the Acemoglu and Ventura model matches only

the fact that countries with more workers have no lower export prices. Just like the simpler

Armington model of the previous subsection, they predict that richer countries export much higher

quantities of each variety and at sharply lower prices. In the data, richer economies export

modestly higher quantities of each variety at modestly higher prices. This suggests that

diminishing returns and technology diffusion may be needed to ensure a stationary world income

distribution because terms of trade effects alone are insufficient (and indeed, go the wrong way).

5c. A Krugman Model
           Krugman (1980, 1981) modeled countries as producing an endogenous number of

varieties.11 In these models, love of variety in utility and/or production plus free entry by firms
leads to a proliferation of varieties. This is tempered by fixed costs of production, so the number

of varieties produced in a country is increasing with country size. We sketch a simple model with

these properties.

           Country 4 produces R4 varieties, each selling for the same price and having the same

Conditional on prices, relative demand is proportional to the relative number of varieties.

Expression (5.20) is familiar in the literature: the size of the fixed cost (9ÎE4 ), combined with the
elasticity of substitution, pins down employment per firm. Using (5.20), the number of varieties a

country produces is proportional to the product of its labor force and process productivity:


                                                        E4 P4
(5.22)                                       R4 =        95 .



         Equating (5.21) to (5.16), relative wages are


                                               w4        E4
(5.23)                                         w3   =    E3 .



Substituting (5.23) into (5.18) and (5.19) we obtain


                                     p4                  q4         E4 P4
                                     p3   = 1 and        q3     =   E3 P3 .



In turn relative GDP's are
                                              ]4       E4 P4
                                              ]3   =   E3 P3 .



Here a larger workforce or higher process productivity do not drive down the relative price of a

country's varieties. Higher GDP increases the number of varieties produced (5.22) rather than the

quantity produced per variety.

         This simple Krugman model is consistent with larger economies exporting more mostly on

the extensive margin and importing more mostly on the intensive margin. The model goes too far

in these directions, however, relative to the data. On the export side, it predicts only an extensive

margin, and only in the form of exporting in more categories, as opposed to more categories and




                                                    21
more markets.12 In the data, larger economies export to and import from more countries per
category (sees Table 2 and 5). A fixed cost of importing each variety, as in Romer (1994), might

help fit these patterns.

         Table 10 shows the Krugman model's predictions for export prices and quantities. They

are closer to the data than were those of the two preceding models. Yet several discrepancies exist

between the model and the data. Richer economies reap higher export prices and export higher

quantities in each market-category. Countries with more workers export higher quantities at no

lower prices. Of these, the hardest for the Krugman framework to explain may be the higher price

of rich country exports. Quality differentiation, as in Flam and Helpman (1987) or Grossman and

Helpman (1991), would seem to be necessary. The higher quantities exported to each market-

category, however, could be reconciled with this Krugman model. Just as larger economies export

to the U.S. in more 10-digit categories within each 6-digit category (see Table 7), larger

economies may export more varieties per 6-digit category to a given market.



5d. A Simple Quality Differentiation Model

         Here we provide a simple Armington model modified to include endogenous choice of

quality. This allows us to make predictions about the equilibrium interactions between quantity,

quality, and price, as well as the relation of each to the size of the work force and GDP per worker.

         Consumers maximize utility

12In Krugman's original (1979) model, 5 is a function of income so that, in equilibrium, larger economies export
more on both margins (extensive and intensive). Dinopoulos and Xu (2000) obtain the same result in a model with
non-homothetic preferences.

where U4 is the quality of country 4's variety.13 Based on this we obtain

                                                                 -5

so that relative demand is decreasing in quality-adjusted relative prices.

         A single firm produces a country's variety. The firm's production technology is


                                                              -U
(5.27)                                       q4 = E4 exp( ^44 ) L4 .


Conditional on E4 and ^4 , producing at higher levels of quality U4 lowers the number of units

produced per worker, q4 ÎP4 . Higher E4 scales up productivity uniformly for all quality levels,

whereas higher ^4 raises productivity more at higher quality levels.

         The firm is a monopolistic competitor in the world market of N firms, and is a price taker

in the local country labor market. The firm hires workers P4 and chooses quality U4 to maximize



(5.28)                                             p4 q4 - w4 L4 ,


where w4 is the wage in country 4. Using (5.26), (5.27) and (5.28), one can show that the profit-
maximizing levels of P4 and U4 satisfy

According to (5.29), higher ^ induces a higher U. Expression (5.30) shows that a firm's profit-


13 GDP will exceed the wage bill here because we do not impose a zero profit condition in what follows. We assume
that each consumer/worker receives an equal share of economywide pure profits.

maximizing level of labor input is increasing in both productivity indices (^4 and E4 ) and
decreasing in the wage (w4 ).
         Combining (5.26), (5.27), (5.29) and (5.30) yields the profit-maximizing price conditional

on the choice of quality:


                                                   5              -U4

Because U4 is proportional to ^4 in (5.29), for a given w4 ÎE4 the price does not vary with quality.

Combining (5.29) and (5.31) yields


                                                    p4        w4 ÎE4

Substituting (5.32) into (5.26) yields

                                                                    5

Equation (5.33) incorporates both preferences and technology. It says that, conditional on wages,

country 4 produces more units the higher are country quality and process productivity.

         Using (5.30) we can pin down the market-clearing wage as


                                                         -"Î5                   "-"Î5

Countries with higher "quality productivity" ^4 produce higher quality products (5.29) and charge

higher prices (5.35) rather than sell more units of each variety (5.36). This leads to higher GDP

per worker in proportion to their higher quality (5.37).

         Like the simple Armington model, this quality differentiation model has no extensive

margin so it is at odds with the facts in Table 9. But it has a shot at explaining some of the export

price and quantity facts in Table 10. Absent quality differentiation, an output expansion must

drive consumers down the demand curve for the national variety, lowering prices. With an

endogenous quality choice, larger economies need not experience a terms of trade deterioration. It

is possible to export higher quantities at the same or higher prices if resources are also invested in

improving product quality. We can use (5.26) to infer the cross-country differences in quality

necessary to reconcile our Table 3 facts on price and quantity with this model.

         To illustrate, consider U.S. imports of new assembled passenger cars by country of

origin.14 In 1995, Japan's exported models sold 19 times as many units in the U.S. as Sweden's

exported models to the U.S. did (2172k vs. 114k). Sweden's models were 37% more expensive on

average ($25,194 vs. $18,371). Japan exported 56 models vs. 5 for Sweden (so 11.2 of the factor

of 19 was more models).15 Japan sold 1.7 times as many units per exported model (38,800 units
per Japanese model vs. 22,800 per Swedish model). Reconciling these facts with (5.26) requires

that Swedish models were 20% higher quality if the elasticity of substitution between models 5 =

5. Note, however, that Japanese cars have lower quality-adjusted prices (Swedish cars are 37%

14 The data is from Ward's Motor Vehicle Facts & Figures, which distinguishes domestic production from imports by
model. We include domestic production of models exported to the U.S. in "sales of models exported to the U.S."
15 There are only 7 6-digit categories covering passenger motor vehicles in the U.N. data, so Japan exported at least 8
car models to the U.S. per 6-digit car category. This underscores the possibility that larger economies export more
varieties to a given market within 6-digit categories.

                                                              25
higher price but only 20% higher quality) — this explains why sales per model were higher for

Japanese models despite their lower quality.16
         Using (5.26) in this way, Table 11 shows how much quality would need to differ with

country size in order for this model to explain export prices and quantities. The calculations

require a value for 5 , the elasticity of substitution between different country varieties within

categories. Based on estimates by Hummels (1999) we consider 5 = 5 and 5 = 10, which

correspond to markups of 25% and 10%, respectively. Table 3 suggests that countries with twice

the GDP per worker export 19% higher quantity at 21% higher prices within market-categories.

Table 11 indicates that, with 5 = 5, these facts can be reconciled with the model if countries with

twice the GDP per worker export products of 25% higher quality. With 5 = 10, twice the GDP per

worker would need to be associated with 23% higher quality. If a country's exports are

representative of their production, as in this model, the implication would be that quality

differences explain about a quarter of the differences in GDP per worker across countries.17

         A country with twice as many workers (but the same GDP per worker) exports 27% more

quantity at 4% higher prices to a given market-category. Table 11 reports that doing so would

require products of 7% to 10% higher quality. Although this is possible, the model sketched

above provides no reason why it should be so. The model also provides no reason why quality-

adjusted prices should be slightly lower in larger economies, as Table 11 also reports. The

inference that quality-adjusted prices must be lower follows from the higher quantities exported
within market-categories. An alternative interpretation is that quality-adjusted prices are no lower

for larger economies, but larger economies export more varieties within 6-digit U.N. market-

categories. If so, then a hybrid of this quality differentiation model and the Krugman model in the

previous subsection would fit all of the Table 10 facts.18

16 For Japanese vs. South Korean models in 1995: Japanese firms sold 11.8 times as many units, 7 times as many
models (56 vs. 8), and 1.7 times as many units per model at about 2.4 times the average unit price ($18,371 vs.
$7,768). The implication from (5.26) is that Japanese models were 2.7 times as good as South Korean models if 5=5.
If so, Japanese models sold for a lower quality-adjusted price than South Korean models (2.7 times the quality for 2.4
times the price), thereby explaining the higher units sold per Japanese model.
17 To the extent that prices of same-quality products are compared, producing higher quality should be reflected in
higher measured PPP GDP in a country.
18 An appendix with such a model is available upon request.

5e. Romer's Fixed Costs of Exporting Model
         Romer (1994) modeled a small open economy facing fixed costs of importing intermediate

good varieties. A model with this flavor could explain why larger economies import in more

categories and from more countries within categories. Calibrating his model, Romer found the

welfare and productivity losses from applying a tariff to be an order of magnitude larger with

endogenous import variety than without it: a loss of 10% of GDP, compared to 1% of GDP in a

more standard model, in response to a 10% tariff on all imports.

         In Romer's model, lowering import tariffs increases demand for foreign varieties, allowing

more of them to enter the local market and sell enough units to cover local fixed costs. A larger

domestic economy should do the same thing. We therefore ask how big the variety gains to

importer size appear from our estimates in Tables 5 and 6. To translate these extensive margins

for imports into welfare gains, we adapt Feenstra's (1994) methodology for estimating welfare

gains from import variety growth. Feenstra showed that, if imports are inside a CES aggregator

separable from domestic goods, then the GDP-equivalent of the welfare gains from greater import

variety can be expressed as



(5.38)            (share of imports in GDP) • (the extensive import margin)"/(5-1)



where 5 is the elasticity of substitution between import varieties in utility and "the extensive
import margin" is represented by expression (2.8) in section 2 above. Romer's model yields this

same expression (5.38) for intermediate import variety gains with respect to importer size. In his

model imported varieties are symmetric (the same price and quantity) so the extensive import

margin equals the number of varieties imported. But (2.8), based on Feenstra's methodology, is

the appropriate generalization for asymmetric prices and quantities.

         Earlier we estimated a modest tendency for larger economies to import in more categories

(see Table 5). When we distinguished imports by country of origin as well as category, we found

a larger extensive margin (see Table 4). Treating each import source-category as a different



                                                  27
variety, we use (5.38) to calculate import variety gains with respect to importer size. We translate

them into equivalent percentage point increases in GDP. We calculate gains separately for

consumer imports and capital plus intermediates imports, based on estimates of their extensive

margins and import shares. We do this because one might worry that the extensive margin for

capital goods and intermediates reflects Krugman increasing returns in production (more domestic

industries translate into more demand for specialized inputs) rather than Romerian increasing

returns due to fixed costs of importing. The average level of imports relative to GDP at market
exchange rates across the 59 importers in the U.N. data is 6% for capital and intermediate goods

and 21% for consumer goods.

       The top panel of Table 12 provides variety welfare gains based on (5.38). We estimate that

an economy double the size enjoys variety gains between 1.5% and 3% of GDP. Most of these

gains come from consumption imports, largely because they account for most imports but also

because the extensive margin is larger for consumption imports. The bottom panel of Table 12

details why our estimates fall so far short of the 50% of GDP welfare gain in Romer's calibrated

model. First, Romer used a smaller elasticity of substitution between varieties (5 = 2, implying a

markup of 100%) than we prefer (5 = 5 and a markup of 25%). Even using 5 = 2, however, our

variety gains are between one-fourth and one-eighth of Romer's. Most of the remaining difference

stems from our using an import share equal to 27% of GDP (the average across our 59 countries).

Romer assumed an import share of 100% of GDP. Using 5 = 2 and Romer's import share, we get
similarly large gains from having twice the GDP per worker, but gains only half as big as his with

respect to employment. These remaining discrepancies come from the elasticity of variety with

respect to importer size, which is 0.5 in Romer's calibration versus 0.45 for GDP per worker and

0.22 for employment in our Table 4. An important caveat is that our estimates understate the true

variety elasticity if larger economies import more varieties from a given source-category.

6. Conclusion

       Larger countries trade more than smaller countries do. In this paper we decompose a

country's share of world trade into margins that account for these differences. We ask: do larger

economies trade higher volumes of each good they export and import (intensive margins)? Do

they trade a larger set of goods with more partners (extensive margins)? Do they trade higher

price/higher quality goods?

       Using 1995 trade data for many countries in many product categories, we find that the
extensive margin accounts for two-thirds of the greater exports of larger economies, and one-third

of the greater imports of larger economies. For both imports and exports, larger economies trade

in more categories, and trade with more partners. Price and quantity decompositions indicate that

richer countries export more units at higher prices (controlling for category and partner),

consistent with producing higher quality. Our estimates imply that quality differences could be the

proximate cause of about 25% of country differences in real income per worker.

       These calculations, apart from providing a new decomposition of cross-sectional

differences in trade patterns, are useful for distinguishing features of trade models that correspond

more or less well to the data. Such distinctions can be extremely important in determining the

welfare consequences of access to trade.

       Armington models of national product differentiation include no extensive margins for

export expansion, and so fail to explain the largest margin by which the trade of large/small
economies differ. Because they lack this margin, these models also imply that output and trade

expansions will be accompanied by adverse terms of trade effects. In the Acemoglu and Ventura

model (2000), these terms of trade effects result in a stationary world income distribution despite

divergent investment rates. We find that countries with more workers export higher quantities to

each market-category at no lower prices. This is consistent with a model in which larger countries

avoid terms of trade deterioration by enlarging the set and/or increasing the quality of the goods

they produce .




                                                 29
       "Krugman" style models with increasing returns to scale and products differentiated by

firms come closer to fitting the facts on intensive/extensive export margins. However, matching

facts on the relationship between goods' prices (and quantities) and exporter income per worker

requires modifying these models to include quality differentiation. Similarly, matching facts on

intensive/extensive import margins requires modifications such as fixed costs of importing each

variety a la Romer (1994). We find that economies twice the size may enjoy greater import

variety worth the equivalent of several percent more GDP per person.

Notes: All variables are in logs. Number of exporting countries = Number of observations

see equation (5.26) in the text. s = the elasticity of substitution in utility or production
between different varieties (imports from different source-categories). Quality adjusted
prices are simply the price elasticities from Table 3 minus the quality elasticities.
Lj = Employment in exporting country j. Yj = 1996 PPP GDP in exporting country j.

Notes: Welfare gains from import variety (expressed in terms of % of GDP) =
(import share of GDP)*(imports extensive margin)1/(s-1). See the discussion
surrounding equation (5.38) in the text. The top panel is based on estimates of the
form of Table 4, only using separate regressions for consumption imports vs. imports
of capital and intermediates. The variety elasticity equals the estimated elasticity of
the extensive margin with respect to the size variable. Lj = Employment in exporting
country j. Yj = 1996 PPP GDP in exporting country j.
