The Sad Truth About Happiness Scales: Empirical Results
Timothy N. Bond and Kevin Lang
NBER Working Paper No. 24853
July 2018
JEL No. D63,I31

                                          ABSTRACT

We replicate nine key results from the happiness literature: the Easterlin Paradox, the ‘U-shaped’
relation between happiness and age, the happiness trade-off between inflation and unemployment,
cross-country comparisons of happiness, the impact of the Moving to Opportunity program on
happiness, the impact of marriage and children on happiness, the ‘paradox’ of declining female
happiness, and the effect of disability on happiness. We show that none of the findings can be
obtained relying only on nonparametric identification. The findings in the literature are highly
dependent on one's beliefs about the underlying distribution of happiness in society, or the social
welfare function one chooses to adopt. Furthermore, any conclusions reached from these
parametric approaches rely on the assumption that all individuals report their happiness in the
same way. When the data permit, we test for equal reporting functions, conditional on the
existence of a common cardinalization from the normal family. We reject this assumption in all
cases in which we test it.

   For several of the most prominent research areas in the happiness literature,
we test empirically the conditions for rank order identi…cation described in Bond
and Lang (forthcoming). As discussed there, and our results below con…rm, the
conditions under which the ranking of the mean happiness of two groups is nonpara-
metrically identi…ed are unlikely to be satis…ed in practice. Therefore we are forced
to rely on parametric identi…cation.
   The most common parametric assumption is that there exists a cardinalization
under which the happiness of each of two groups is distributed normally. If we assume
normality and the two groups have di¤erent means and variances, then if group A
has a higher mean than group B, there also exists a cardinalization of happiness
using the family of log-normal distributions under which group B has a higher mean
than group A. We provide tests for, and reject, equal variances for each of the cases
we consider.
   We then explore empirically the types of cardinalizations that are required to
reverse the major results in the happiness literature. While it is impossible for any
single result to be irreversible, some results require more dramatic deviations from
normality than others. Additionally, some results are only reversible by skewing the
distribution to the left, while others are only reversible by skewing the distribution to
the right. Our exercises indicate that the set of results one can claim from the happi-
ness literature is highly dependent on one’s beliefs about the underlying distribution
of happiness in society, or the social welfare function one chooses to adopt.
   Any conclusions reached from these parametric approaches rely on the assumption
that all individuals report their happiness in the same way. When the data permit,


                                           1
we test for equal reporting functions, conditional on the existence of a common
cardinalization from the normal family. We reject this assumption in all cases in
which we test it.
    In section 1, we discuss the methods we will use to implement our assessment.
Section 2 reviews our data sources. Our main results lie in section 3, where we test for
rank-order identi…cation and determine the cardinalizations (within the log-normal
family) that reverse nine key results from the happiness literature: the Easterlin
Paradox, the ‘U-shaped’relation between happiness and age, the happiness trade-o¤
between in‡ation and unemployment, cross-country comparisons of happiness, the
impact of the Moving to Opportunity program on happiness, the impact of marriage
and children on happiness, the ‘paradox’of declining female happiness, and the e¤ect
of disability on happiness. Section 4 concludes.



1     Methods

1.1       Distribution-Free Comparisons

We begin each case by asking if it is possible to say anything about the groups
being studied without assuming happiness can be cardinalized along some parametric
probability distribution. Consider two groups A and B who report their happiness
in three categories, where r0i ; r1i ; and r2i are the fraction of responses in each category
for group i. As we discuss in Bond and Lang (forthcoming), in the absence of a
distributional assumption, the ranking of A over B is identi…ed only if r0A = 0; r2B = 0;
and r2A    r1B . We thus look at the distribution of responses to the happiness question


                                             2
across each of the groups being studied, and see if any two pairs of groups satisfy
this condition. In no case is this condition satis…ed.


1.2    Normal Cardinalization

We then ask if we can make comparisons across groups assuming there exists a car-
dinalization of happiness under which the distribution would be normal within each
group. As discussed in Bond and Lang (forthcoming), provided that the standard
deviation of happiness does not vary across groups, the ranking of the means pro-
vided by the normal cardinalization would hold for any alternative cardinalization.
In other words, the rankings are identi…ed by this parametric assumption.
   When happiness is recorded on a three-point scale, it is straightforward to calcu-
late the means and variances under normality as the model is just identi…ed. How-
ever, in some of our applications we will be interested in estimating the distribution
of happiness net of factors such as income or employment status that vary across
groups. To do this, we estimate a heteroskedastic probit model using the oglm com-
mand in STATA created by Williams (2010). Denote S 2 f0; 1; 2g as an individual’s
answer to a 3-point subjective well-being survey. The model assumes that S is de-
termined by a latent variable h ,


                               S = 0 if h < k0

                               S = 1 if k0      h    k1                           (1)

                               S = 2 if k1 < h




                                           3
and that
                                 hi =     m Di   +     m Xi      + "i                               (2)

where k0 and k1 are cut-o¤ values of the latent variable that determine the observed
response, Di is an indicator for the group we are studying, Xi is a vector of individual
speci…c controls and "i is a normally distributed error term with mean 0 and variance

 i   with

                                 i   =    exp( s Di +             s Xi )                            (3)

In other words, the model varies from the classic ordered probit in that it allows the
observable characteristics to in‡uence the variance of the error term in the latent
variable.
     Just as with a textbook ordered probit, one cannot separately identify the cut
points from the variance. The oglm routine normalizes                      = 1 and estimates   s;    s;

am      (   m=   ); and bm   (   m=   ). It easy to transform the oglm estimates into
their equivalents under our preferred normalization, where k0 = 0 and k1 = 1. The
estimated mean and variance for our control group Di = 0 will be


                                         ^0 =        k^0 (^ o )                                     (4)
                                                       1
                                         ^0 =                                                       (5)
                                                 k^1       k^0

and for Di = 1;


                                      ^1 = ^0a
                                             ^m + ^ 0                                               (6)

                                      ^ 1 = ^ 0 exp(^
                                                    as )                                            (7)

                                                 4
These produce estimates for the mean and variance of the distribution only at a
speci…c set of values for controls, namely X = 0. When applicable, we de-mean
the controls, so our estimates can be thought of as characterizing the distribution of
happiness for individuals who di¤er in their group membership, but otherwise pos-
sess the mean characteristics throughout the entire population (regardless of group
membership). This method extends easily to more groups.
   Having estimates of the standard deviation across groups, we then perform a joint
test of equality. Provided we reject that test, alternative cardinalizations will reverse
the ordering of means provided by the normal. However we strongly emphasize that
a failure to reject this test does not mean that the ranking is identi…ed. Rank order
identi…cation through the normal assumption requires the standard deviations across
groups are exactly equal, a hypothesis that we may fail to reject but can, of course,
never accept.


1.3    Applying Other Cardinalizations

Once we have estimated         and     under the normality assumption, we can re-
cardinalize happiness. We limit attention to cardinalizations that transform the
distribution from normal to left-skewed and right-skewed log-normal distributions.
Recall that for a given constant c, the mean of happiness once re-cardinalized to a
right-skewed log-normal distribution will be

                                              1
                                     = exp(c + c2    2
                                                         );                          (8)
                                              2




                                           5
while for a left-skewed log-normal

                                                       1
                                           =   exp( c + c2           2
                                                                         ):                    (9)
                                                       2

As the transformed mean of the right-skewed log-normal distribution is increasing in
the variance of the normal cardinalization, and the mean of left-skewed log-normal
distribution is decreasing in the variance of the normal cardinalization, so long as
    2          2
    1   6=     2,   there will always be a c such that one of these transformations reverses the
original ordering of two groups, where


                                                 2(    1    2)
                                            c=        2    2
                                                                 :                            (10)
                                                      2    1

A negative term within the absolute value indicates a left-skewed log normal is re-
quired.
            We will explore how adopting various left-skewed and right-skewed log-normal
transformations a¤ects the conclusions one would draw from data and, when ap-
plicable, what c is required to reverse the result. Because of the nature of the
transformations, increasing c increases the skewness of the resulting distribution. To
provide some context to the amount of skewness our transformations imply, we will
provide comparisons to the skewness of the income and wealth distributions of the
United States, where the means are at the 74th and 80th percentiles, respectively
(Diaz-Gimenez, Glover, and Rios-Rull, 2011).1 These are reference points for the
     The percentile position of the mean for the lognormal distribution of transformation c is 21 +
        1
1
2 erf( 2cp2 ). This implies that the transformation that would generate equivalent skewness to the
income distribution (as measured by the percentile ranking of the mean) is c = 1:29 , and c = 1:68
for the wealth distribution.


                                                      6
reader, not a guideline. If a researcher were willing to ignore our warnings and try
to draw inference from assumed distributions, knowing full well that the results are
identi…ed only through functional form assumptions and only for a subset of car-
dinalizations implied by these assumptions, we believe it would still be exceedingly
di¢ cult to argue that results from other distributional assumptions that resemble
real-life distributions of economic variables are not just as valid. The converse is
certainly not true. Moreover, by limiting ourselves to log-normal transformations,
we are not determining the minimum amount of skewness necessary to overturn any
result. Instead we ask how extreme a transformation from a very restrictive class of
distributions is required to reverse the result.


1.4       Reporting Function

The analysis thus far has rested on the assumption that individuals from di¤erent
groups report their happiness in the same way. With a 3-point scale, such as the
popular GSS question, we do not have su¢ cient degrees of freedom to identify dif-
ferences in reporting separately from di¤erences in the latent variable.2 In other
words, such data cannot distinguish between men being happier than women and
men having lower standards for reporting their happiness.
       Adding a fourth categorical response, as is the case in the Eurobarometer Trend
File and World Values Survey data we will use below, grants us the freedom to
   2
     We have referred throughout this article to the way in which an individual transforms subjective
feelings into a numerical value or category reported on a survey as the “reporting function,”and that
if two individuals transform their feelings into numerical values di¤erently they lack a “common
reporting function.” This follows the language used by Oswald (2008). The problem has been
alternatively referred to as “di¤erential item functioning”by King et. al (2004), “scale recalibration”
by Adler (2013), and “heterogeneous standards” by Fleurbaey and Blanchet (2013).


                                                  7
test this hypothesis, conditional on the true distribution being in the normal family
(including members of the lognormal family), using a likelihood ratio test. Our
unconstrained model estimates ordered probits separately for each group. The …rst
two cut-points are normalized to 0 and 1, while the mean, variance, and highest cut-
points are estimated from data. Our constrained model is a heteroskedastic ordered
probit that allows for group-speci…c means and variances, but forces the highest cut-
                                          2
point to be identical. This generates a       -statistic with degrees of freedom equal to
the number of happiness categories above three, multiplied by the number of groups
minus one.



2     Data

We use and describe here data common in the happiness literature.


2.1    General Social Survey

The General Social Survey (GSS) is the most widely used data to study happiness in
the United States. It has surveyed a nationally representative sample of Americans
on a variety of social attitudes annually or biennially since 1972. It asks, “Taken
all together, how would you say things are these days – would you say that you
are very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy?” This language and its 3-point
scale has been commonly adopted by other studies, including the assessments of
the Moving to Opportunity project (MTO) which we discuss in the next section.
While the question remains constant over time, its position in the survey does not,


                                          8
which could lead to biases in responses in di¤erent years.3 We therefore use the
publicly available replication …le provided by Stevenson and Wolfers (2009), who use
split-ballot experiments to modify the data to account for these di¤erences.4


2.2     Eurobarometer Trend File

The Mannheim Eurobarometer Trend File 1970-2002 combines and harmonizes sev-
eral di¤erent annual surveys of the European Community, thus enabling within-
and cross-country comparisons over time. The surveys included a question on life
satisfaction in 1973 and then continuously from 1975-2002. There were some slight
di¤erences in question wording in some years, but in general it asked, “On the whole,
are you very satis…ed, fairly satis…ed, not very satis…ed, or not at all satis…ed with
the life you lead?”The survey included Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland,
France, West Germany, the United Kingdom, East Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and Sweden, but typically only in
years when these countries were members of the European Economic Area.


2.3     World Values Survey

Wave 6 of the World Values Survey (WVS) is a comprehensive global survey on
prevailing beliefs and social attitudes across a large number of nations. This wave
was conducted from 2010-2014 and included the following question on happiness,
   3
     For example, Stevenson and Wolfers (2009) note that in every year but 1972, the question fol-
lowed a question on marital happiness, which may cause di¤erences in the impact of one’s marriage
on his or her response to the general happiness assessment. See also Smith (1990).
   4
     For details of this process, see appendix A of Stevenson and Wolfers (2008b).



                                                9
“Taking all things together would you say you are: very happy, rather happy, not
very happy, or not at all happy.”5


2.4       British Household Panel Survey6

The British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) is a panel survey which began in 1991
with a representative sample of 10,300 individuals. The BHPS included a question
on life satisfaction in the waves from 1996 to 2008, with the exception of 2001.7 The
survey asked “Here are some questions about how you feel about your life. Please tick
the number which you feel best describes how dissatis…ed or satis…ed you are with
the following aspects of your current situation.” (Box 1 is marked “Not satis…ed at
all” while box 7 is marked “completely satis…ed.”) After questions about particular
aspects of life, the survey continues “Using the same scale how dissatis…ed or satis…ed
are you with your life overall?”

      The 2001 wave surveyed life satisfaction with a question that was worded slightly di¤erently
than the other years, and represented the scale with faces rather than simply by boxes. Most
researchers have felt these di¤erences were su¢ ciently minor to ignore. We are less sanguine and
did not even download the data from that year.

refer to, for example, values of c =      1; :5; 0; :5 and 1 rather than explaining that
the …rst two are left-skewed log normals, the third is standard normal and the last
two right-skewed log normals.


3.1      Easterlin Paradox

No question in the happiness literature has received more attention than the “Easter-
lin Paradox,”the observation that in some settings higher incomes are not associated
with higher levels of happiness. Easterlin (1973, 1974) found that income and subjec-
tive well-being assessments were strongly and positively correlated within a country
in a given year, but not over time and across countries. This, and subsequent studies,
led Easterlin (1995) to conclude, “Will raising the incomes of all increase the hap-
piness of all? The answer to this question can now be given with somewhat greater
assurance than twenty years ago... It is ‘no’.” Easterlin instead concludes that the
individuals judge their happiness relative to their peers and not on an absolute scale.
      The paradox was recently called into question in a comprehensive study by
Stevenson and Wolfers (2008a).8 They use ordered probit both across countries
and over time within countries and …nd a strong relation between happiness and
economic development. However, they …nd that the United States is an exception.
Happiness has not increased despite substantial growth in per capita income. They
attribute this to the substantial rise in income inequality over the last 30 years which
occurred simultaneously with the rise in real GDP.
  8
    See also Deaton (2008) who …nds similar results from the Gallup World Poll using OLS on a
basic 10-point scale.


                                             11
    These ordered probit results implicitly assume the existence of a cardinalization
in which happiness is distributed normally across all years, and that under that
cardinalization the variance of happiness is constant across years. Using happiness
data from the GSS and per capita income data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis, we …rst examine whether it is possible to make such a claim without relying
on a distributional assumption. Unsurprisingly, this is not the case. Each year, a
positive fraction of individuals report their happiness in each category, violating the
condition expressed in Section 2.1 of Bond and Lang (forthcoming).

    It may still be possible to determine the relation under the assumed normal
cardinalization. The …rst column of Table 1 estimates the marginal e¤ect of log per
capita on happiness via ordered probit assuming a constant variance. Consistent with
both Easterlin (1973,1974) and Stevenson and Wolfers (2008a), we …nd that national
income is negatively associated with national mean happiness in the United States.
However, in column (2) we allow the variance of happiness to also be in‡uenced
by log per capita income. We …nd a strong negative impact of national income on

the variance of happiness, and can reject the constant variance assumption.9 Thus
any conclusion about the relation between per capita income and happiness will be
determined by the cardinalization assumed through a functional form assumption.
       As per capita income decreases both the mean and the variance of happiness under
normality, we know the paradox can be reversed if happiness is cardinalized to follow
a left-skewed log normal distribution. To …nd such a cardinalization, we calculate
the mean and variance under normality for each year and estimate the OLS relation
between these means and the log of per capita GDP, which we display graphically
in Figure 1. We then search across values of c to …nd a left-skewed log-normal
   9
    This may be somewhat surprising given the increase in income inequality over the time period,
but is consistent with previous work by Stevenson and Wolfers (2008b) and Dutta and Foster
(2013). Clark, Fleche and Senik (2014, 2016) argue that this is a standard pattern – growth
reduces happiness inequality.

transformation that reverses this positive relation. We …nd that the marginal case is
approximately c =    :68; at this transformation there is a positive but approximately
0 correlation between mean happiness and log per capita GDP. For any c <            :68
then we …nd the expected positive relation, and the strength of the relationship will
increase as we allowed the distribution to become more skewed. At c =       1:87, the
relation becomes statistically signi…cant at the 10% level, and at the 5% level for
c=    2:25. By point of comparison, the skewness of the happiness distribution for
the average year in the sample resembles the income distribution at c = 2:10, and
the wealth distribution at c = 2:74. We display the c =    2:25 case in Figure 2.
   Even these conclusions are subject to the caveat that they assume the reporting
function of happiness does not itself vary with per capita income. There is no way to

                                         14
test this assumption given that the GSS only reports happiness in three categories.


3.2       Happiness over the Lifecycle

There is a substantial literature that …nds happiness is U-shaped over the lifecycle.10
Individuals begin their adulthood fairly happy, see a decrease during much of their
working life, and then rebound in happiness as they reach retirement. Blanch‡ower
and Oswald (2008) obtain this result across over 70 countries, and there is even
some evidence that it holds in apes (Weiss et al., 2012). This claim is, however, not
without controversy. In some data sets, the shape depends on the choice of control
variables, and whether one uses …xed e¤ects or a pooled regression (e.g., Glenn, 2009;
Kassenboehmer and Hasiken-DeNew, 2012).
       Of course, such conclusions rely on particular cardinalization assumptions. To
test the robustness of these results to alternative cardinalizations, we utilize the
Eurobarometer, which as previously discussed uses a 4-point life satisfaction scale.
We restrict attention to men in the twelve members of the European Union as of
1986, as these countries have the most years of data. Following Blanch‡ower and
Oswald (2008), we group individuals into 5 year age bins, although we group all
individuals over 80 into single bin due to the small number of people in this age
range.
       We …rst ask whether it is possible to rank age groups by their mean happiness
without making any assumptions on the underlying distribution, applying the cri-
terion laid out in Section 2.1 of Bond and Lang (forthcoming). In fact, it is not
  10
    For some recent reviews, see Frijters and Beatton (2012), and Steptoe, Deaton, and Stone
(2015)

                                            15
possible to rank any two age groups within any country. All age-country groups
have a positive number of respondents in each category.
       We then turn to whether we can rank age groups assuming that the distribution
of happiness is distributed normally within each country-age group. We estimate
an ordered probit for each country allowing the means and standard deviations to
di¤er by age group. In Figure 3, we plot the lowess smoothed results of this exercise.
To emphasize the shape of the patterns, we normalize both sets of estimates to be
distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 within country. We observe a U-
shaped pattern of means in a majority of countries, although it is more pronounced
in some than others. West Germany and Luxembourg appear more consistent with
an upward sloping age-happiness pro…le, while Portugal is more consistent with a
downward sloping pro…le.11
       However, these conclusions about the age-happiness pro…le in means are inde-
pendent of cardinalization choice only if the variances are constant with age. While
there is no consistent pattern across countries in the age-standard deviation pro…le,
there is clear variation across age groups. In West Germany, Denmark, Greece, and
the Netherlands, the standard deviation of happiness appears to increase in age.
Luxembourg, Italy, and Spain are more consistent with a U-shape. France, Ireland,
and Portugal in contrast seem to have a relatively stable relation between age and
the variance of happiness. A joint test of the standard deviation being independent
                                      2
of age in these countries yields a    156 -statistic   of 545; we can reject the hypothesis
at any conventional signi…cance level.
  11
    The Eurobarometer continued to survey the areas of the former West Germany as a separate
unit after reunifcation.


                                            16
Figure 3: Mean and Standard Devation of Happiness under Normal Cardinalization




   Since, under the assumption of normality, the variance of happiness changes with
age, alternative cardinalizations will yield di¤erent patterns in the means. Given
the average variance across country-years, a transformation of c = 4=3 would pro-
vide similar skewness to the wealth distribution. We plot the age-happiness pro…le
by country under the left-skewed and right-skewed version of this cardinalization,
as well as the normal, in Figure 4. We again subtract the average age-group mean
and divide by the standard deviation of these averages within country and transfor-
mation (so that our estimates have a distribution of mean 0, standard deviation 1)
to ease comparison of the shapes. The patterns di¤er dramatically under di¤erent
cardinalizations. Italy, and the Netherlands, which are U-shaped under the normal,
become downward sloping with a left-skewed transformation. This same transforma-


                                        17
         Figure 4: Age-Happiness Pro…le under Di¤erent Cardinalizations




tion moves West Germany from upward sloping to hump-shaped. Denmark, which
was approximately U-shaped under the normal, is monotonically upward sloping un-
der a right-skewed transformation and monotonically downward under a left. The
United Kingdom gains a stronger U-shape when left-skewed, but becomes closer to
hump-shaped under a right. In contrast, Spain, France, Ireland, and Portugal have
fairly stable relations across transformations, though di¤erent patterns from each
other.
   There are many equally plausible conclusions one could draw from Figure 4. If
we had a strong prior that happiness is always normally distributed within age group
and country, then we would believe that most countries have U-shaped happiness/age
pro…les but that Portugal, Luxembourg, and West Germany violate this pattern. If


                                        18
we had a strong belief that happiness follows a U-shape across the lifecycle (and that
the skewness of the distribution does not change with age), then we would have to
conclude that happiness is right-skewed in Luxembourg, but must not be in Denmark.
In the absence of any prior, we might conclude that Spain, France, Portugal, and
Ireland have a well-determined happiness/age relation, but that we lack su¢ cient
evidence to say anything with con…dence about the other EU countries
       However any such conclusions would have to be made with a giant caveat; they
assume a stable relation between experienced happiness and reported happiness
throughout the life-cycle. An alternative view of Figure 4 might state that hap-
piness is constant throughout the lifecycle, but that in most EU countries, middle
aged-individuals have a higher standard for reporting satisfaction with their life.
Fortunately, this hypothesis is testable with the 4-category life satisfaction question
under the maintained assumption that happiness can be cardinalized to be in the
normal family (including the log normal).
       In Figure 5, we plot the implied thresholds (normalizing the …rst two cuto¤s to
be zero and one) from a series of ordered probits for reporting life satisfaction in the
highest threshold across age and country. While we again see no consistent pattern
in the relation between age and reporting function across countries, we see sub-
stantial variation within countries. To test formally for reporting function stability,
we perform a likelihood ratio test between these ordered probits and the country-
speci…c ordered probits that allow for the mean and standard deviation of happiness
to vary with age but forces the highest cuto¤ to be stable.12 This test generates a

   In other words, we test a model where the reporting function is age- and country-speci…c against
a model where the reporting function is country-speci…c.

3.3     The Unemployment-In‡ation Trade-o¤

Many happiness researchers have advocated evaluating policy based on its ability to
raise the ‘average’ response on measures of subjective well-being. The application
that has perhaps received the most widespread interest is correcting the misery in-
dex. While the misery index was developed as a political slogan, the idea that both
unemployment and in‡ation are costly is intuitive. But it is by no means obvious
that the proper weights, even assuming linearity, are equal.
   Di Tella, MacCulloch, and Oswald (2001, hereafter DMO) provide one prominent
attempt to use subjective well-being data to determine the appropriate trade-o¤


                                             20
between unemployment and in‡ation. They match estimated national well-being
from happiness surveys with time-series data on in‡ation and unemployment across
countries. They …nd that both unemployment and in‡ation are negatively related to
national happiness but that the cost of unemployment is 1.7 times that of in‡ation.
Thus the politically-derived “misery index” (in‡ation plus unemployment) biases
policy towards too much unemployment relative to in‡ation.
       To explore the robustness of this result, we follow DMO and use happiness data
from the Eurobarometer Trend File, and national unemployment and in‡ation data
from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). DMO
study the time period 1975-1991. However, the OECD currently only o¤ers harmo-
nized unemployment data for European nations beginning in 1983.13 We therefore
focus on 1983-2002, which is slightly later than DMO but of similar duration. We
exclude any country which we observe for fewer than 6 years, since our method
requires the estimation of 5 parameters: e¤ects of in‡ation and unemployment on
both the mean and the variance of life satisfaction, and the threshold for reporting
life satisfaction in the highest category. This yields a sample of 14 countries: Aus-
tria, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
       Making a determination on the appropriate calibration of the misery index re-
quires much stronger conditions than those we consider in Bond and Lang (forth-
coming). An e¤ort to evaluate the e¤ect of in‡ation and unemployment must …rst
  13
    These data are also not complete. For example, most countries have no data until they enter
the European Union, while Greece (which we exclude because of sample size) is not available until
1999.



                                               21
be able to rank various years based on their average happiness either absolutely or
within a country. The condition in Section 2.1 of Bond and Lang (forthcoming) lays
out when such comparisons are possible without making a distributional assumption.
Analyzing the yearly data from the Eurobarometer we …nd there is not a single year
in which a single country had a single life satisfaction category that did not have a
positive number of responses. Thus even determining if high unemployment years
are less happy than low unemployment years must rely on assumptions about the
distribution of life satisfaction.
   Assuming the existence of a normal cardinalization, we can at least determine
whether in‡ation and/or unemployment lowers happiness provided that these vari-
ables do not in‡uence the variance of happiness. To test for a constant variance,
for each country we estimate an ordered probit that allows the mean and variance
to be a¤ected by in‡ation and unemployment. We then perform a joint test that
neither in‡ation nor unemployment has any e¤ect on the variance of happiness in
                                               2
any country in our sample. This yields a       28 -statistic   of 611, and we can easily
reject the null hypothesis at any conventional level. Thus even the statement that
the national unemployment and in‡ation rates lower average life satisfaction, a much
weaker statement than the optimal policy trade-o¤ between in‡ation and unemploy-
ment, is only true for some cardinalizations of happiness.
   To explore conclusions that can be drawn from alternative distributional as-
sumptions, we …rst estimate country-speci…c heteroskedastic ordered probits using
individual-level data on life satisfaction from the Eurobarometer Trend File. In these
regressions we control for marital status, education, a quadratic in age, and a set


                                         22
of year dummies.14 From these, we calculate the mean and standard deviation of
happiness in each country in each year (at the mean of our controls in the EU) using
the estimated coe¢ cients on the year dummies by the method discussed in section
1. We then follow DMO by estimating a pooled regression of mean happiness on
annual unemployment, in‡ation, a set of year …xed e¤ects, country …xed e¤ects, and
country-speci…c time trends, which represents DMO’s preferred speci…cation.15 We
also estimate this regression under alternative right-skewed and left-skewed trans-
formations of happiness. To provide comparability across estimates, we normalize
each transformation so that the distribution of happiness is mean zero with standard
deviation one across country-years.
       In the …rst panel of Table 2, we report the e¤ect of in‡ation and unemployment
on the mean and variance of happiness under the assumption of normality. Despite
the di¤erent time horizon, our result is remarkably similar to those in DMO. Both
in‡ation and unemployment have large and statistically signi…cant negative e¤ects
on national happiness. The e¤ect of unemployment is larger, suggesting that a 1
percentage point increase in unemployment would have the same negative impact on
welfare as a 1.73 percentage point increase in in‡ation, nearly identical to the ratio
  14
      Unlike DMO, we do not control for unemployment status in these …rst stage regressions. This
would cause our second stage to understate the true welfare cost of national unemployment. DMO
recognize this problem and adjust their results using the estimated e¤ect of unemployment on
happiness in the …rst stage. However, changes in the distribution of happiness will also change the
estimated e¤ect of unemployment on individual-level happiness, so performing such an adjustment
would be inappropriate in our context.
   15
      DMO use 3-year moving averages of in‡ation and unemployment rather than the annual values.
It is not clear whether this is due to a data limitation or a preference for smoothing year-to-year
variation in these variables. We use the annual …gures as our results more closely resemble DMO’s
under a normal distribution than when using 3-year moving averages.




                                                23
estimated by DMO.16 However, as we show in the second row, unemployment also has
a statistically signi…cant and positive impact on the variance of happiness. Therefore
transformations that skew happiness to the right will decrease the estimated impact
of unemployment on national happiness, while those which skew left will increase its
estimated impact.
       In Panel B, we …rst explore right-skewed distributions using the standard log-
normal transformation used throughout this document. Remarkably, the “misery
index,”where employment and in‡ation receive equal weight, becomes optimal pol-
icy with a very modestly right-skewed distribution of c = 0:375.                As we increase
right-skewness to approach the income distribution (c = 1:075), unemployment be-
gins to have a positive e¤ect on national well-being, though neither its e¤ect nor
that of in‡ation is statistically signi…cant. Thus, another interpretation is that, if
happiness is log-normal, the key macroeconomic variables targeted by policymakers
are inconsequential. Increasing skewness to that of the wealth distribution (c = 1:4)
makes the positive e¤ect of unemployment statistically signi…cant, consistent with
arguments that recessions are “good for your health”(Ruhm 2000).
       In contrast, as we show in Panel C, when we allow happiness to become left-
skewed, unemployment becomes more important for well-being. At c =                         0:375,
a one percentage point increase in unemployment lowers happiness by 2.05 times
as much as a one percentage point increase in in‡ation, and similarly 2.1 times at
c=       1:075 and 2.07 times at c =      1:4.
  16
    DMO estimate the trade-o¤ as 1.66 after adjusting for the direct e¤ect of being unemployed on
well-being, which is unnecessary for us given that we did not control for employment status in the
…rst stage.

       On a somewhat optimistic note, our results make intuitive sense. We would ex-
pect that unemployment would generally make people less happy, a result consistent
with a large literature using self-reported happiness (e.g. Clark and Oswald, 1994;
Blanch‡ower, 2001; Blanch‡ower and Oswald, 2004). It is at least plausible that
those who are most directly a¤ected by unemployment are located in the left-tail
of the happiness distribution. Increasing the left-skewness of happiness is equiva-
lent to using a social welfare function that places more weight on the least happy
individuals relative to the happiest. When unemployment increases, there are more
unhappy unemployed individuals, and the more weight we place on these individu-
als, the larger the social cost will appear. In contrast, a right-skewed transformation
increases the weight on the happiest individuals relative to the least happy. Since the
happiest people will disproportionately hold stable jobs, increases in unemployment
are unlikely to bother them. Even a positive e¤ect of unemployment is plausible for
a highly right-skewed social welfare function if, as some have suggested, individuals
report happiness based on their relative circumstances.17 When many are without a
job, those still employed may report particularly high levels of happiness.18
       Even if there were some strong a priori reason to adopt a speci…c cardinalization,
these results would still require the assumption that the reporting function itself is
stable across time. This assumption is testable as the Eurobarometer life-satisfaction
questions uses a 4-point scale. Applying the method discussed in section 1.4, we per-
  17
     See Clark, Frijters, and Shields (2008) for a review of the empirical evidence that social com-
parisons are important for happiness.
  18
     While Clark (2003) presents evidence that macro-level unemployment has a negative impact
on the average well-being of the employed, this does not necessarily mean that macro-level unem-
ployment has a negative impact on the well-being of the happiest employed individuals, who would
be weighted most heavily by a right-skewed social welfare function.

form a likelihood ratio test for equal reporting functions across year within country,
and construct the joint test across these countries. That is we allow the reporting
function to vary across country, but not within, an even weaker assumption than
                                                         2
that required to estimate Table 2. This yields a         197 -statistic   of 491, and we can
thus strongly reject the hypothesis that the data support the existence of a normal
cardinalization with a stable reporting function across time.


3.4    Cross-Country Comparisons

In previous sections we found that the ranking of happiness across groups is highly
sensitive to distributional assumptions. To explore this sensitivity in a larger context,
we use the WVS to rank nations based on mean happiness. Constructing such a
ranking without a distributional assumption requires the data to satisfy the condition
from section 2.1 in Bond and Lang (forthcoming). Looking at the distribution of
responses by country, remarkably none of the 1,300 Malaysian respondents report
being “not at all happy”with their life. However, every other country’s respondents
utilize every category; consequently, we still are unable to rank Malaysia against any
other country or to form a ranking of countries in general.
   Assuming happiness is distributed normally in each country, we can rank these
countries based on their estimated means so long as the variances are identical across

reject it at any conventional level (   58   = 2920). Thus the ordering of the countries
will always depend on the chosen cardinalization.
   We explore alternative cardinalizations in Table 3. The order of countries rep-

resents their happiness ranking when happiness is assumed to be normally dis-
tributed; the columns give their ranking under log-normal transformations with
c = 1:72; :5; :5; and   1:72; given our estimated variances, c = 1:72 would make
the average country’s happiness as skewed as the U.S. wealth distribution. Although
the implied degree of skewness varies across countries, moving from left to right in
the columns represents moving from a more right-skewed to a more left-skewed dis-
tribution. Doing so has dramatic e¤ects on the rank-ordering of happiness. The
…ve happiest countries when happiness is right-skewed are Nigeria, Ghana, Mexico,
Trinidad and Tobago, and Pakistan. Remarkably, Nigeria becomes the least happy
country under the left-skewed transformation, and Ghana and Pakistan also fall
into the bottom ten. The top …ve under the left-skewed distribution of happiness
(Qatar, Uzbekistan, Malaysia, Kyrgyzstan, and Sweden) fare relatively better under
right-skewed happiness, though only Uzbekistan remains in the top ten. The rank-
correlation between the log-normal transformations with c = 1:72 and c =     1:72 is
:19.

    There are some countries whose rank remains fairly stable across the transforma-
tions. Uzbekistan is the second happiest country under a normal distribution and its
rank varies between 2 and 8 under the skewed distributions. Iraq, the world’s least
happy country under the normal distribution, is never able to rise out of the bottom
ten in the skewed transformations. These cases are counterbalanced by countries
like the previously mentioned Nigeria, as well as South Africa, which falls near the
middle of the distribution when happiness is normally distributed, is able to rise as

high as 7th when happiness is right-skewed, but falls all the way to 3rd lowest when
happiness is left-skewed.
   All of these rankings relied on the reporting function of happiness being stable
across countries, a heroic assumption in light of the questionnaires being administered
in a large number of di¤erent languages. In Figure 6, we relax the common reporting
function assumption and construct a density plot of the thresholds for reporting in
the highest happiness category. The variation is substantial. Using a likelihood
ratio test, we can strongly reject common reporting functions at any conventional
          2
level (   58   = 593). The …fth column of Table 2 ranks our countries from highest to
lowest based on their threshold for reporting being very happy, assuming normality.
The happiest countries in our normal ranking were substantial benefactors of having


                                            32
populations with low thresholds for reporting “very happy”; 3 of the top 5 ranked in
the bottom 10 for cuto¤s, while the two others ranked in the bottom twenty. On the
other hand, Qatar’s 8th ranking under normality appears quite remarkable given its
residents had the second highest standard for reporting in the top category.


3.5       Moving to Opportunity

Happiness data have also been used to evaluate micro-level policies, as in the case
of the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) program. Motivated by the positive results
of the Gautreaux desegregation program in Chicago, the MTO experiment targeted
families living in public housing in high poverty areas.19 Eligible families were invited
to apply for the chance to receive a Section 8 housing (rental assistance) voucher.
Applicants were randomly assigned to three groups: no voucher (Control group),
Section 8 voucher that could only be used in an area with a poverty rate below 10%
(Experimental group), and a standard Section 8 voucher (Section 8 group). The
program has been assessed at multiple stages.20 A long-term follow-up (Ludwig et
al., 2012, 2013) emphasizes that subjects in the experimental group were substan-
tially happier than those in the control group. We reexamine the evidence for this
conclusion.
       The participants in the long-term MTO evaluation study were asked the standard
GSS happiness question, “Taken all together, how would you say things are these days
–would you say that you are very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy?” Ludwig

     The Gautreaux program came out of a court-ordered desegration program in Chicago in the
1970s. See Rosenbaum (1995) for a detailed analysis.

et al. (2012, table S2) report the distribution of responses across the experimental
and control group, which we reproduce in Table 4. They calculate intent-to-treat
estimates using intervals of 1 unit between the categories, as is common in the liter-
ature, but also ordered probit and logit. In all three cases, they …nd positive e¤ects
on average happiness that fall just short of signi…cance at the .05 level.

       From the distribution of responses in Table 4, it is clear we cannot form a ranking
without imposing a parametric distribution. Assuming the distribution is normal, we
…nd that the control group has a lower mean (.44 v. .60), but also a higher variance
(.79 v. .63).21 The cdfs cross at the 83rd percentile, which is 1.20 units of happiness
(and also in the extreme left tail of the distributions). Thus if we simply transform
the underlying happiness data to increase the values above 1.20 we can reverse the
mean happiness. This cardinalization would explain the data equally well.
       Since the control group has a higher variance of happiness, it will be possible to
reverse this result by applying a right-skewed distribution. From our point estimates,
the required transformation is just slightly more skewed than a standard log-normal;
we need only apply a c = 1:33. We plot the resulting distributions in Figure 7. Both
  21
    We cannot formally test for equal variances as the underlying data from which Ludwig et al.
(2012) calculated the distribution of their responses are not publicly available.

distributions are less skewed than the income distribution, with the mean of the
control group lying at the 70th percentile, and the mean of the experimental group
at the 72nd percentile. One plausible interpretation of the data is that moving to
a low poverty area increased happiness for most people, but that there is a group
of people who were extremely happy in their old environment who could not match
positive aspects of their former social environment in their new community. Of
course, this all assumes that moving to a new environment did not in‡uence the way
in which individuals report their happiness, a possible scenario that is not testable
given that the happiness scale used by the researchers has only 3 points.

3.6       Marriage and Children

One of the most robust results in the happiness literature is that married individuals
are happier than non-married individuals. This phenomenon has been observed both
across countries and across time (e.g., Stack and Eshelman, 1998; Diener et. al, 2000;
Blanch‡ower and Oswald, 2004).22 In contrast, happiness researchers generally …nd
that individuals with children are less happy than those without (e.g., Alesina et. al,
2004; Blanch‡ower, 2009; Stanca, 2012; Deaton and Stone, 2015).23 These con‡icting
results present a bit of a conundrum. As both getting married and having children
are actions that individuals (generally) take voluntarily, revealed preference suggests
they should both raise happiness although as Deaton and Stone (2015) point out, if
only people who expect children to make them happier become parents, in a cross-
section having children and happiness might be unrelated. Likewise, most parents
are unwilling to express publicly that their children are a source of unhappiness.
       In this section we explore the robustness of cross-section comparisons between
those who are married and those who are not, and those who live with and without
children using the BHPS. We restrict attention to those aged 16-60 and separate
individuals by gender. In our analysis of married individuals, we exclude those who
are widowed, separated, or divorced; for our analysis of children we focus only on
those who are married.
  22
     Note this is a distinct question from whether marriage causes individuals to become happier,
which is a much more controversial claim. Lucas et al. (2003), for instance, present evidence
consistent with the idea that becoming married causes a short term increase in one’s well-being,
but that the individual eventually ‘adapts’and returns to his or her pre-marital happiness.
  23
     There are important exceptions however. For example, Angeles (2010) …nds positive e¤ects of
children on the happiness of married individuals in Britain.




                                               36
   We …rst ask if it is possible to make any comparison without assuming a functional
form for the distribution of happiness by comparing the distribution of responses
within each of these groups. In no case is this possible. Regardless of gender,
marital status, or child cohabitation status, we …nd in every case a positive number
of responses in every life satisfaction category. Therefore we cannot say anything
about the impact of marriage or children on life satisfaction without a parametric
assumption.
   We next test for equality of variances, a necessary condition in order to have
rank-order identi…cation under normality. We estimate the mean and variance by
gender and marital status, and then conduct a joint test that these variances are
                                                      2
equal conditional on gender. This generates a         2   = 122, and we can thus reject
the hypothesis at any conventional level. We perform the same test for those living
                                              2
with and without children and obtain a        2   = 95, and thus we can again strongly
reject. Any conclusion one would draw on the relation between marriage, children,
and happiness would therefore depend on choice of cardinalization.
   We display the estimated distributional parameters assuming a normal by gender
in Table 5. We …rst consider the impact of marriage in Panel A. Both married men
and married women appear to be happier on average than their single counterparts.
However, we also observe that married men have a lower variance of happiness than
single men. Thus, we can reverse this relationship with a right-skewed log-normal
transformation. The required transformation itself is quite modest; with c = :32,
single men become happier. By comparison, the distribution for single men would
not reach the skewness of the income distribution until c = :54. In contrast, married

women appear to have a higher variance of life satisfaction than single women. We
thus require a left-skewed log-normal to reverse. For any c                              2:69, we would
conclude that single women are happier than married women. These distributions
are skewed substantially to the left; the mean of married women lies within the .1th
percentile. However, transformations outside the lognormal family could certainly
reverse the result with less skewness, and there is no particular reason to believe that
getting married does not itself a¤ect the skewness of happiness.
    In Panel B, we turn to the impact of children on life satisfaction. Consistent with
most of the literature, we …nd that, assuming normality, both men and women who
live with children are less happy than those who do not. However, in both cases we
estimate that individuals living without children have a higher variance of happiness
than those living with children. Thus, we can reverse these results with a left-skewed
log normal. The required transformations are similar, for men we require c =                             :74,

                                                     38
for women c =       :64, and produce distributions with skewness similar to the wealth
distribution of the United States (though in the opposite direction).24
       Finally all of these results assume a common reporting function. It is plausible
that marriage and having children change the way that people report their happiness.
Because the BHPS measures life satisfaction on a 7-point scale, this assumption is
testable. For each of our outcomes, we perform a likelihood ratio test of equality of
the reporting function for men and women separately, and then calculate the joint
test. That is, our null hypothesis allows gender, but not family status, to a¤ect the
                                                                                           2
reporting of happiness. For marital status, our resulting test statistic is                8   = 84;
                                         2
for living with children we …nd          8   = 21. We can thus reject a common reporting
function for both cases at the 1%-level.


3.7       The Paradox of Declining Female Happiness

One surprising result from the happiness literature, documented by Stevenson and
Wolfers (2009), is that in the United States women’s happiness appears to have fallen
relative to men’s from 1972-2006 despite the great social and economic progress
women made during this period.25 We explore the robustness of this result using
these same data.
       Fundamentally, the question seeks to order the average happiness of women’s
happiness by year relative to men. As discussed previously a necessary (but not
  24
     Under the reversing transformations, the mean of the child-less male distribution falls in the
18th percentile, 19th percentile for male with child, 20th percentile for child-less female, and 21st
percentile for female with child.
  25
     By labeling this “surprising,” we do not mean to imply that it could not be true. In a related
area, Black et al. (2009) suggest that apparent black-white earnings convergence was accompanied
by black mobility to higher cost localities, suggesting much less convergence in real incomes.

                                                 39
su¢ cient) condition to be able to make such a comparison without imposing a distri-
butional assumption on happiness is that there are some groups which never report
in the highest category, and some which never report in the lowest. Analyzing the
data year by year, we see this criterion is never met for men or women in any year
of the GSS. Thus comparisons cannot be made without distributional assumptions,
and any conclusion will rest on the functional form assumed.
   If we are willing to assume a cardinalization exists in which, in each year of the
data, both men and women’s happiness is distributed normally, we can make com-
parisons that are robust to any alternative cardinalization provided the variance is
constant across all years for each gender. Using a heteroskedastic ordered probit,
we estimate the means and standard deviation of happiness by gender for each year
assuming normality and test whether the standard deviation is constant. This gen-
           2
erates a   51   = 144, and we can reject equality of variances at any conventional level
of statistical signi…cance. Thus conclusions about trends in relative male to female
happiness will depend on the cardinalization chosen by the researcher.
   In Figure 8 we plot the mean happiness for men and women under the normal-
ity assumption. Consistent with Stevenson and Wolfers, we see a sharp decline in
women’s happiness, while men’s remains relatively constant, indicating that under
this cardinalization, women have lost ground relative to men. However, in Figure
9, we plot the standard deviations across time, and consistent with our above test,
…nd substantial changes here as well. While the standard deviation has generally
declined for both genders, women’s has fallen relative to men’s. Thus the pattern in
means can be reversed by a left-skewed log-normal.

                                     Figure 11:

   In Figure 10 we plot the estimated linear (10-year) trend in relative happiness
from an OLS regression as a function of the c chosen in the left-skewed log-normal
along with the 95% con…dence interval. As we add more skewness, the trend begins
to favor men less and women more. By c =          :35, the trend is already statistically
insigni…cant at the 5% level, which would involve substantially less skewness than
the income distribution (c = 2:10). It is, however, not until c =    4:7 that the trend
reverses in sign.
   We note several strong caveats. First, our transformations assume that the skew-
ness of the distribution (as measured by c) is constant over time. Wealth and income
and have become more skewed over time, thus it would make sense to allow car-


                                         42
dinalizations of happiness to become so as well. Because women have lower mean
and variance of happiness in the later years, allowing for a more skewed distribution
would raise their happiness relative to men in these years, and thus ‡atten any esti-
mated trends. Second, we assume that men and women report their happiness in the
same way, and that the way in which they report their happiness does not change
overtime. An equally plausible explanation is that over time the social and economic
progress made by women has led them to raise the standard with which they evalu-
ate happiness, which would arti…cially lower their reported happiness. Because the
GSS only measures happiness on a 3-point scale, we cannot test for changes in the
reporting function.


3.8    Adaptation to Disability

One of the most striking results in the happiness literature is the …nding that people
adapt to disability. Kahneman (2011) suggests that the experienced utility of para-
plegics and nonparaplegics is fairly similar after a period of adaptation. Whether
adaptation is complete is controversial, but partial adaptation is widely accepted.
For example, Oswald and Powdthavee (2008) argue that the widely cited Brickman
et al. (1978) study has been misinterpreted and also …nd notable but only partial re-
covery of happiness from what they de…ne as moderate and severe disability. Yet the
question of adaptation to disability and other adverse events is, perhaps, unusually
sensitive to concerns about the reporting function. Individuals may reconcile them-
selves to such events either by becoming less unhappy about them or by reducing
the standard for reporting themselves as happy.


                                         43
   We approach this question using the BHPS, which includes the measure on life
satisfaction discussed before and asks respondents about their disabilities. We note
there are some inconsistencies in the disability question across waves that we are
forced to ignore in the interest of having an adequate time series. From 1996 to
2000, we use the question “Can I check, are you registered as a disabled person,
either with Social Services or with a green card?”For 2002 and 2003, we use “Can I
check, are you registered as a disabled person?”Finally, from 2004 on, we use “Can
I check, do you consider yourself to be a disabled person?”On the face of things, we
would expect the largest di¤erence to be between 2003 and 2004 when the question
shifts from being purely factual to one of self-image. In fact the di¤erence between
2002-3 and 2004-8 is negligible. There is a large jump between 2000 and 2002, but
this seems largely to re‡ect an upward trend between 1996 and 2002.
   Unfortunately, the BHPS does not have a large enough sample of long-term dis-
abled individuals to test for adaptation within an individual. Instead, we construct
a sample of individuals who ever report being disabled, and compare the distribution
of responses in years where these individuals were disabled with the distribution of
responses in years where they were not. We limit the sample to individuals ages
16 to 60, and exclude anyone who was disabled upon entering the sample. If the
information on disability was missing in any given year, we used the response from
the previous year or, if that was missing either because of non-response or because
the missing year was the respondent’s …rst in the sample, we use the response from
the following year. Any remaining missing cases were recoded as not disabled.
   We …rst test if it is possible to conclude whether disabled years were less happy


                                        44
than non-disabled years (or vice-versa). Comparing the distribution of categorical
responses, we observe that both the disabled and the non-disabled utilize all of the
seven categories of life satisfaction. Thus, under the condition derived in section 2.1
of Bond and Lang (forthcoming), it is not possible to determine whether the disabled
or non-disabled are happier without a parametric assumption.
   Conclusions drawn from assuming a normal are robust to other cardinalizations
only if the variance of the distribution is independent of disability status. A simple
                                   2
test of this assumption yields a   1   = 43, and we can easily reject it. In Table 6, we
show the estimated parameters of the happiness distribution, assuming normality,
for disabled and non-disabled years. While disabled people appear to be less happy,
they also have a higher variance of their happiness. Therefore, we can reverse this
relation with a lognormal transformation. For any c         1:41, we …nd the opposite,
that becoming disabled makes people happier. This would result in a happiness
distribution for disabled people which was substantially more skewed than the wealth
distribution (c = :65). We again emphasize that this does not prove robustness to
all cardinalizations or even those with no more than this level of skewness. We only
explore cardinalizations from a restrictive class of distributions and other plausible
distributions might reverse the result. On the other hand, we do not …nd it di¢ cult
to believe that under a broad range of cardinalizations average happiness would be
lower among the disabled.
   The above analysis assumed that disability has no impact on the scale on which
individuals report their happiness. As discussed above, an alternative theory to the
widely cited adaptation literature is that individuals adapt their reporting function.

Once disabled, they lower their thresholds for reporting the highest levels of life
satisfaction. Because the BHPS measures life satisfaction on a 7-point scale, we can
again test, under the maintained normal cardinalization, whether the disabled and
the non-disabled use the same reporting function. A likelihood ratio test generates a
 2
 4   = 23, and thus we can reject equal reporting functions at any conventional level
of signi…cance.
     In Table 7, we report the estimated cuto¤ values for the latent life satisfaction
variable for reporting in the 7 di¤erent categories. The …rst two cuto¤ values are
normalized to be 0 and 1. We see strong evidence that disabled individuals have
lower standards for reporting satisfaction with their life, particularly for the highest
two cuto¤s. This suggests that applying the standard normality assumption will
…rst lead us to underestimate the negative e¤ects of disability on happiness, and
second to overestimate adaptation to disability. At least some ‘adaptation’ comes
from changes in the reporting function rather than the true level of happiness.

4      Closing Remarks

We demonstrate clearly the empirical problems of the happiness literature. In not a
single case could we draw any conclusions from the data without a parametric as-
sumption. In no case did following the literature and assuming a normal distribution
lead to a robust conclusion. Even if we were to restrict ourselves to distributions in
the log-normal family that are no more skewed than the U.S. wealth distribution, we
would …nd alternative cardinalizations that reverse or eliminate nearly all the major
results in the happiness literature. The sole exceptions are that the disabled are less
happy than those who are not disabled and that married women are happier than
unmarried women, but even here, we remind the reader that we have not ruled out
the possibility of transformations outside the lognormal that would be less skewed.
In every case where we could test for reporting-function equality across groups, we
rejected this assumption.
    We note that our exercises take nothing away from studies addressing similar
questions using objective data. While we cannot rule out that MTO had no impact



                                                      47
on the average happiness of voucher recipients, we still know from Ludwig et. al
(2013) that it reduced the prevalence of diabetes among adults and mental health
problems among young girls. Likewise, while the pattern of a ‘U-shaped’ relation
between age and happiness depends heavily on the cardinalization choice of the
researcher, we know that anti-depressant usage peaks at mid-life across 27 European
nations (Blanch‡ower and Oswald 2016) , and that the age distribution of admittance
to psychiatric hospitals is ‘hump-shaped’(Le Bon and Le Bon 2014).
   This presents the possibility that one could use objective measures to calibrate
cardinalizations of happiness, as Bond and Lang (2018) do with test scores. However,
this would not address the fundamental problems associated with the use of discrete
categories. Moreover, it is unclear why using the subjective well-being data would be
better than using objective data if these objective outcomes are what we care about.
