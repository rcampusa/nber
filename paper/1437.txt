                               ABS TRACT

        This paper analyzes inevitable transitions between fixed and

floating exchange-rate regimes in a balance—of—payments model where

individual preferences are explicitly specified. The goal is to assess

the analogy between speculative attacks in foreign exchange markets and

attacks on official price—fixing schemes in natural resource markets.

In discrete time the analogy with resource markets is only partially

correct, for in a deterministic model the collapse of a fixed rate may

be characterized by two, successive attacks. The two-attack equilibrium

is peculiar to discrete-time analysis, however. In the continuous-time

limit of discrete—time models there is a single attack timed so as to

rule out an anticipated discrete jump in the exchange rate.

         Balance—of—payments models differ from nonrenewable resource

models in that foreign exchange reserves may be borrowed from abroad.

The paper therefore asks whether there are limits to central-bank

borrowing possibilities. In an idealized world where all private income

is subject to lump—sum taxation, central-bank reserves can become infinitely

negative with no violation of the public sector's intertemporal budget

constraint. Nonetheless, a growth rate of domestic credit exceeding the

world interest rate, if maintained indefinitely, leads to violation of the

constraint in the paper's model.

Introduction


      When a central bank's foreign exchange reserves are limited,

excessive domestic credit expansion must eventually undermine any attempt

to maintain a pegged exchange rate through official intervention. A

growing literature, beginning with the work of Krugman (1979), studies

aspects of the process through which the collapse of the fixed exchange

rate occurs.1 Under rational expectations and unrestricted private

capital mobility, the transition between fixed and floating exchange

rate occurs on a well—defined date and is forced by a speculative attack

in which private wealth owners suddenly acquire the entire central-bank

reserve stock.

      The literature on balance—of-payments crises grows directly out

of Salant and Henderson's (1978) insight that a government attempt to

fix the real price of an exhaustible natural resource will generally

lead to a speculative attack on the official stockpile. Salant (1983)

elaborates on this result and extends it in several directions. In

Salant's (1983) setup, speculators maximize the discounted value of profits

from the sale of an exhaustible resource; the discount rate is exogenous.

When the government first pegs the resource price at a level greater that

the competitive level, speculators sell their stocks to the government. But

they repurchase the entire remaining government stockpile (thereby destroying

the price-fixing scheme) on the first day that the resource's free-market price

equals or exceeds its official price. Any delay would result in a resource-

price path offering returns exceeding the exogenous market rate.2

      It is tempting to proceed by analogy and argue that a balance-of-
                                       2




 payments crisis must also occur as soon as the floating exchange rate

 that would equilibrate markets in the wake of a speculative attack equals or

 exceeds the official parity. There are two problems with this analogy.

 First, the world supply of any exhaustible resource is fixed at a point

 in time, whereas a central bank facing a perfect world capital market

 can always create (gross) foreign exchange reserves by borrowing.    Thus,

 negative reserve positions are feasible. Second, the speculative attack

 in resource markets is derived essentially by imposing the condition that

perfectly substitutable assets-—that is, resource stocks and "other

wealth"--must yield the same rate of return in equilibrium. Balance—

of—payments crises, however, involve arbitrage between domestic money

and foreign bonds, assets which presumably are not perfect substitutes.

Continuous-time analyses such as Krugman's (1979) rely on the asset-price

continuity principle (Calvo 1977), arguing that any discrete anticipated up-

ward jump in the exchange rate would induce agents to flee the domestic cur-

rency "an instant before," and thus would be arbitraged away in equilibrium.

As in the exhaustible resource literature, therefore, the speculative attack

occurs as soon as the "shadow" market exchange rate exceeds the peg. But

while this argument is plausible in continuous time, it is unclear that

it extends to discrete—time models.3

      This paper analyzes inevitable transitions between fixed- and

floating-rate regimes in a balance-of-payments model where individual

intertemporal preferences are explicitly specified. The equilibria

studied are perfect-foresight equilibria in which (i) agents maximize

utility, given expected prices and net government transfers; (ii) the
                                  3




government's policies staisfy its intertemporal resource constraint,

given private money demand and shared expectations about prices and

transfers; and (iii) markets clear on each date at the prices expected.

Beside throwing light on the nature of balance-of-payments crises, the

framework also yields insight into the limits to external borrowing by

central banks.

      With respect to balance—of-payments crises, the paper shows that

in discrete time the analogy with resource models is partially correct.

A speculative attack always occurs on the first date such that the

"shadow" floating rate equals or exceeds the fixed rate; but equilibrium

may be characterized by two attacks on successive dates. If there are

two attacks, the first of these occurs the period before the exchange rate

first floats as agents reduce their real balances in anticipation of the

subsequent depreciation. A second speculative attack, in which the re-

maining official reserves are acquired by the market, collapses the fixed

rate and validates the marketts expectations.   The two-attack equilibrium

turns out to be peculiar to discrete—time analysis. In continuous time,

there is a unique attack timed so as to rule out an anticipated discrete

jump in the exchange rate. Thus, the solution procedure used in the

descriptive continuous—time literature is supported.

      With respect to central—bank borrowing possibilities, the paper

shows that in an idealized world where all private income is subject to

lump-sum taxes, central-bank reserves can become infinitely negative with
                                                               L4

no violation of the government's intertemporal budget contraint. Even in

this setting some limits to domestic—credit expansion exist, however.

The government budget constraint implies that domestic credit must grow
                                    4




 at a rate below the world real interest rate when the exchange rate is

 fixed and there is no economic growth. In this sense, an announced and

 credible policy of excessive domestic-credit expansion may leave the

 central bank unable to borrow reserves abroad.

       The paper is organized as follows. Section I discusses the

 individual's optimization problem. Section II discusses the consolidated

 public—sector intertemporal budget constraint and the intertemporal

 material balance that must obtain for the economy in perfect—foresight

 equilibrium. Section III shows that domestic credit growth rates below

 the world interest rate need not lead to a breakdown of the fixed—rate

 regime or any violation of the official budget constraint. Section IV

 studies discrete—time equilibria in which crises occur, while section

 V extends this analysis to continuous time by allowing the market period

 of section IV to shrink to zero.

       An important limitation of the present framework is the

nonstochastic environment assumed. Section VI discusses this limitation (as

well as some others), emphasizing that in a stochastic model any number

of speculative attacks may precede the fixed exchange rate's collapse.

An appendix containing technical details concludes the paper.

I. The Individual's Problem


        The analysis is set in a small economy whose residents consume

a single perishable commodity, available domestically in a fixed supply

y. Agents may hold wealth in the form of domestic money, bonds denominated

in domestic currency, and bonds denominated in foreign currency. A dom-

estic—currency bond is an instrument that yields r units of domestic

currency after a period and has a fixed face value equal to one unit

of domestic money. A foreign—currency bond pays r* units of the foreign

currency after a period and has a face value of one foreign-currency unit. The

exchange rate S is the domestic-currency price of foreign money. In this

single—good world, the domestic price level P and the foreign price level

p are linked by the relation P =                SP.   p* and r* are constants, and P =

        There is a single representative agent who maximizes a discounted

sum of future instantaneous utilities. Real domestic monetary balances are as-

sumed to yield direct utility (perhaps because they reduce transaction costs,

as in Brock [1984] ,            Feenstra   [1984], or Gray [1984]); and, as ususal, instan-

taneous utility is derived also from consumption of the single commodity.

If M denotes nominal money holdings and m real money holdings M/P, the

individual's objective takes the form


        =     t [u(c)                                                             (1)
        t=o
                          +   v(m) I,

                                                                                   S
where         =   1/(1   + 5)   and , the rate of time preference, is positive.

        A typical agent begins each period t holding Mt_i units of domestic

money, 3t-l units of domestic—currency bonds, and                    units of foreign—
                                                        6




 currency bonds. The agent then receives his endowment y, the nominal

 interest payments r1B1 and r*B1, and a money transfer Ht from the

 government he decides on consuniption c; and he allocates his implied

 end-of-period nominal assets At among Mti B; and B. More formally,

 the individual's accumulation program satisfies the constraints



       At -           =         + r1B1 + (r*St + St —                   + H -
               At_i        Sy                               St   i)B*            (2)




      AtMt+Bt+5B*.                                                               (3)




      An appendix shows how to derive necessary conditions for an optimal

individual program. If corner solutions are not optimal, the conditions are



      u' (ce)       v' (m )          u' (c1)
                =               +
       s              s                   s
           t           t                      t+l



      u'(c )
                =
                    (l     + r )u'(c

           t                                                                    ()
                                                    '
                                S
                                    t+l




      u'(c) =       B(l + r*)u(c1).                                             (6)




Condition (4) states that an individual following an optimal program cannot

raise his utility by adding a unit of domestic money to his portfolio at

time t and spending it at time t+l. Condition (5) states that along an

optimal program, utility is not raised if a domestic-currency bond is

added to the portfolio at time t and sold at time t+i. Condition (6) is the
                                        7




analogous requirement for foreign—currency bonds.

     Equations (4)-(6) naturally imply relations between the required

marginal returns on the three assets. In particular, (5) and (6) yield

the uncovered interest parity condition



      (S+i/S) (1 + r*) = (1 + r) ,                                       (7)



which equates the real returns on domestic- and foreign-currency bonds.

      It is convenient .to assume that the subjective time-preference rate

6 satisfies



                                                                         (8)




Equations (6) and (8) imply that the representative agent will choose a

constant level of consumption, c.6 Optimality requires that c be the

highest constant consumption level consistent with the individual's

available lifetime resources.

      To derive the lifetime resource constraint, define real assets

a (Mt + Bt)/S + 8* and real transfers h E H/S. Constraint (2) may

now be written in real terms (using (7)) as



      a =     (1 + r*)at   +   + ht -
                                        c-   [r*   + (St -

Through successive substitutions, (9) implies

                                                                                      S1)/5]rn}.              (11)




Inequality (11) restricts the present value of spending on consumption

and on the services of real balances to the value of real wealth at the

beginning of period 0. The latter consists of initial real marketable assets

(1 +
       r*)a1   plus the present value of current and future endowments and

government transfers.           (Note that a1 is the ex-dividend real value

of marketable assets at the end of period -1. In period 0, before inter-

est payments are made, the value of those assets is (1 +                                              If an

individual's plan is optimal, c (and the path of real balances implied

by (4)) will be such that (11) holds with equality.

II. The External Constraint


      The previous section described the intertemporal budget constraint

of the typical individual. That budget constraint restricts discounted

lifetime expenditure to the present value of lifetime resources, and

thus rules out unbounded consumption financed by ever—increasing

borrowing. This section takes up the analogous intertemporal budget

constraint for the public sector, viewed as a composite entity comprising

both the fiscal and monetary authorities. As will be shown, there is no

limit on the level of the government's external debt in a world with

lump—sum taxation. However, the rate at which this debt grows must be

less than 1 + r* if the government is to satisfy its intertemporal

budget constraint. Because domestic credit creation in excess of any

increase in money demand leads to foreign reserve losses-—that is, to

external borrowing by the central bank—-an upper bound on the feasible rate

of domestic—credit expansion is implied.

      The government's objective is to finance an exogenous path of

real consumption            .   Government consumption g does not enter the

private utility function directly. To finance its consumption, the

government may levy lump—sum taxes, spend the interest earnings on the

central bank's foreign reserves, or print money (thus expanding somestic

credit). Let D denote the nominal stock of central-bank domestic credit

and R* central-bank reserves. The government's flow budget constraint is



         =
             r*R1
                    -
                        h + (Dt - Di)/S.                                  (12)
                                                10




Implicit in (12) is the assumption that the fiscal authority does not

itself issue debt to private agents, domestic or foreign.

      Excessive domestic credit growth will lead to official foreign

borrowing through central—bank reserve loss, however. Let Md denote domestic

demand for nominal balances and assume foreigners do not hold domestic money.

By the central-bank balance sheet, the change in the money supply M5 is



         -         =        -                    -
             M1        Dt              + St(R        R1).                                  (13)




After equation of MS and Md, (12) can be written



        =
             r*R1
                       -
                           h + (Md - Mi)/St           -
                                                            - R1).                         (14)




      Equation (14) reveals that government purchases can be financed through

money issue only to the extent that the demand for money is increasing.

Private money demand thus limits the available revenue from seigniorage.

Money creation in excess of this limit leads directly to reserve losses; and

when official reserves are declining, government purchases are being

financed in part through external borrowing.

Accordingto (16), the government's real outlays (consisting of government con-

sumption and net transfers to the private sector) cannot exceed the sum of its

initial foreign reserves (1 +                             and its discounted seigniorage. The

government collects seigniorage by supplying the money necessary to accommodate

increases in desired real balances (at a constant price level) , and by

providing the money agents need to maintain a given level of real balances

in the face of inflation.

       Assume now that the public correctly anticipates the path of govern-

ment transfers and, given a price path {s}0i chooses consumption and

real-balance paths maximizing (1) subject to (11) ,                      given a1 and m1.
Assume further that government outlays satisfy inequality (16) when

 Because a =   m   + (B/S) + B*, the foregoing inequality simplifies to



       (1 + r*) [(B1/S1) +                                      -t

 It follows that in perfect—foresight equilibrium, the present value of

aggregate (private plus public) consumption cannot exceed the present

value of the economy's total nonmonetary assets: net claims on foreigners

held by the public and the central bank and the present value of output.

If foreigners demanded domestic money, the government's resources could

be augmented through the sale of domestic money abroad. As money is

a nontraded asset, however, all seigniorage is extracted from domestic

residents.


      Given an exchange—rate path and the associated path of real

money demand, a particular domestic-credit growth rule determines a

path of external borrowing by the central bank. That path must be

consistent with the government's intertemporal resource constraint in

equilibrium. The next section examines the implications of this

requirement for domestic-credit growth in the context of a fixed

exchange rate regime.
                                   13




III. Fixed Exchange Rates and the Limit to Domestic Credit Growth


      The preceding discussion of the sectoral and aggregate constraints

has been developed without reference to the exchange—rate regime. Its

implications may, however, be exploited to throw light on the limit to

domestic-credit creation under a pegged—rate regime. For this purpose, it

is assumed that the central bank pegs the exchange rate on each date t at

the constant level S.   (A moving peg could be analyzed as easily, but the

fixed—rate case is assumed to economize on notation.) The central bank

undertakes whatever foreign exchange market intervention is necessary to

enforce the target rate S.

      Discussion of the limit to domestic-credit expansion under this

regime requires a determination of the path of real money demand. If the

central bank does not "overaccumulate" foreign reserves-—that is, if

lim (1 +
t-         r*)tR =   0—-then (16) holds with equality. Because (11) neces-
                                                14




   sarily holds with equality along an optimal individual program, (17)

   must hold with equality in equilibrium. The equilibrium constant consumption

   level          associated with the government consumption path in (17) is

   thus the highest constant conumption level such that (17) is an equality

   when c = c for all t > 0.              By (4), equilibrium real balances in   under the
   pegged-rate regime are constant and satisfy



           v'(rn) = (1 —         )u'(c)                                              (18)




   for this equilibrium consumption level c. It is important to note for

   future reference that c is invariant across exchange—rate regimes.7

           Consider now the consequences for the bank's reserve position of

  alternative transfer policies fh}0 , given the paths of money demand

  and government consumption. A natural benchmark transfer rule is



           ht =   r*R*   1
                             -
                                                                                     (19)


  under which the public sector rebates to citizens real foreign reserve

  earnings net of government consumption. Domestic inflation is zero under

  the fixed—rate regime, so (14) shows that reserves are constant under rule
  (19) 8


           The foregoing transfer rule is a member of the broader class



           h =               — g
                  r*R1                +   (0 — 1)
                                                    (D1/S)                          (20)




where 0l > 0 is the domestic-credit
                                                 growth rate. By (14), the reserve flow
                                           15




under (20) is



                 —       = (1 - c)



so that



                        =       + (1   —
                                           c)(D1/S)     (1 +   c +
                                                                          2
                                                                              +    ...   +   0t)

                        = *—1   +   (D ,/s) (1 —       t+l)                                        (21)




If 0   exceeds   unity, the public sector in effect finances part of its

spending by borrowing abroad. Because equilibrium real money demand is

fixed, money transfers in excess of the value given by (19) must be

purchased by the central bank to maintain the fixed exchange rate. It

follows that excessive transfer payments lead to a private capital out-

flow which has as its counterpart the official reserve loss given by (21)

        What limits does the intertemporal budget constraint (16) place on

such official foreign borrowing? The program described by (20) is con-

sistent with (16) if and only if



        urn (1 +
                     r*)tR =    —(D0/S)
                                           lim [c/(l +        r*)]t   >       0,
        t-*c                               t--°

that   is, if and only if a < (1 +         r*)    .   Thus, provid1 the rate of domestic

credit growth is smaller than the world real interest rate, the implied

path of external borrowing is consistent with the government's resource

constraint. In particular, there is no lower bound on the leve of
                                             16




 international reserves: these can become increasingly negative over

 time as the central bank defends the exchange rate. But there are rates

 of domestic—credit expansion sufficiently high that defense of the fixed

 exchange rate is inconsistent with the government's budget constraint.

Only in these cases is there a sense in which excessive domestic—credit

expansion necessarily leads to the collapse of the exchange—rate regime.

      The intuition underlying this result is quite simple. As the central

bank borrows reserves so that it can buy money from domestic residents,

the government's external interest bill grows and the public's external

interest income grows by the same amount. The government can therefore

service external debt by taxing away the public's foreign interest earnings.

If domestic credit is growing, however, the government is financing part

of its expenditures through fresh external borrowing. Only if the rate

of domestic credit growth is smaller than the world interest rate r* is

the accumulated interest on official external borrowing paid off

entirely through domestic taxes Over the government's planning horizon.

      More formally, write the discounted present value of transfer pay-

ments to the individual as



               —t                      -t                         r*) -t          (Dt_i
    to(l+r*)        ht =       to(l+r*) r*R1        +         +
                                                                           [(a_l)L    ]
                                                                                          -gJ.   (22)



With the aid of (21)       ,   the first sum on the right-hand side of (22) can be
written




     t0 (1 + r*) -tr*R*tl        = (1 +   r*)R*—l   +
                                                        D_1   cor*(l_at
                                                              2
                                                         s t0 (1 +         r*)t
                                               17




The second sum on the right-hand side of (22) equals


                                                            D—l                t

If o < (1 +   r*)   ,    (22) can now be written


                        -t                     —
                                                       c.            -t

                                                             r* (l + r*)        -
                                                                            + (o 1)
                                                                                      (1 +   r*)
                               ÷        (1 +   r*)     —




                               = (1 +
                                        r*)R1
                                                   -              + r*) -tg


Provided the external debt does not rise "too quickly," the path of

transfers individuals expect has a present value just equal to the govern-

ment's initial assets minus the present value of future government con-

sumption. In the long run, therefore, all official foreign debt is

repaid through domestic taxation.

       The preceding analysis has assumed an idealized environment in

which lump-sum taxes are available and all private income is subject to

taxation. In practice, however, the limits to domestic-credit growth

will be much more stringent than indicated above. Consider, for example,

an economy in which output is produced according to the linear technology

y =   , where       Z is labor supply and agents derive utility from leisure

  -   I.   If only labor income is subject to taxation, the amount of revenue
                                    18




that can be generated from taxes is limited. In this case, even rules of

the form (20) with 1 < a <   (1 +   r*)   are inconsistent with the official

resource constraint, for the latter requires that tax revenue grow

without bound.

      The foregoing example is an extreme one, but it illustrates an

important practical point. Ongoing domestic credit growth, even if

moderate, causes a continual redistribution of external interest income

from the government to the private sector. A necessary condition for

government solvency is that private external interest earnings be ob-

servable by the government and taxable. It is precisely because this

necessary condition does not hold in practice that massive capital flight

so often foreshadows external financing difficulties for the government

involved.

IV.   Equilibrium with a Speculative Attack



      This section studies the equilibrium path of an economy whose

fixed exchange rate must eventually be abandoned. The previous section

demonstrated that a continually declining stock of official foreign

reserves need not, in itself, force the abandonment of a fixed exchange

rate s. For some paths of domestic credit growth, the central bank can

borrow indefinitely and meet its interest charges through domestic

taxation. However, I will assume here that this is not the case, and

that the central bank is unable to borrow externally after its reserves,

initially positive, reach zero. For example, credit might be unavailable

to the bank if it announced its intention of allowing domestic credit

to grow at a rate c > (1 +   r*)   forever. Potential creditors would then

know that the government planned to avoid paying its foreign debts in the

long run. The assumption that the central bank cannot borrow reserves is

quite arbitrary, though. A satisfactory discussion of the credit con-

straints faced by governments would require a much more complex model.9

      The exchange rate must be allowed to float once reserves have

been exhausted, and I will assume here that the floating-rate regime that

follows the fixed rate's collapse is permanent.'0 To characterize the

transition between regimes, it is first necessary to characterize the

economy's equilibrium path under the float. This can be done with the

help of the solution to the individual's problem developed above.

      From equation (4) ,   the equilibrium path of real balances must

satisfy
                                           20




      u'(c)rn =          v'(m)m + uv(c)mtl(MS/Ms)                          (23)




under the foating—rate regime. Because central-bank reserves are zero

if the exchange rate floats, high-powered money is backed entirely by

domestic credit:



            =        =
                Dt       otD0.                                             (24)




Implicit in (24) is the assumption of conveneience that the breakdown of

the fixed—rate regime entails no change in the domestic-credit growth rule.

Together, (23) and (24) yield



      [u'(c) —                   =
                     v'(m)]m         (3/o)u'(c)m1.                         (25)




As in Brock (1974) and Obstfeld and Rogoff (1983), standard regularity

conditions ensure that the unstable difference equation (25) possesses a

unique positive stationary solution m. This stationary solution is the

economy's saddle-path equilibrium. Given the path (24) of monetary growth,

m determines the equilibrium path St =          (GtD)/m   for the floating exchange

rate. It is assumed thatwhile the exchange rate floats, the economy is at

its saddle-path equilibrium.11' 12

      Let T denote the first period of the floating-rate regime.            If the

regime—invariant growth rate of domestic credit o were 0, we would have

T =    in   the present model. I will now argue that for            > 0, there is a

unique T <       consistent with perfect—foresight equilibrium.        As will be
                                          21




shown below, the equilibrium path involves a sharp reduction in private

money balances (and hence in official reserve holdings) at time T-l. Any

reserves remaining in the central bank's portfolio after this speculative
                                                                  13
attack are acquired by the public in a second attack at time T.

      The argument again centers around Euler condition (4) and the

fact that c must equal c, for all t, in equilibrium.' Consider the unique

t such that



      vI(ctlD0/S) > u'(c)[l -                                            (26)
                                        (Sm/atD0)]


but



      v' (ctD0/S) <   u' (c)   [1 -
                                      (Srn/ot+lD0)].                     (27)




Figure 1 illustrates its determination, demonstrating existence

and uniqueness subject to familiar regularity conditions.15 The figure

implies that the date determined by conditions (26) and (27) is the unique

date T on which the exchange rate first floats. This is in fact the case,

and the proof must show that (i) the economy is not in equilibrium on

every date if the exchange rate first floats before period T, (ii) the

economy is not in equilibrium on every date if the exchange rate first

floats after period T, and (iii) the economy is in equilibrium on every

date if the exchange rate first floats in period T. The date of the initial

speculative attack, T-l, is thus uniquely determined.

Suppose the exchange rate first floats in period T' < T.        This means that

R, = 0.      Because (27) does not hold for t =   T',   (28) implies



      u'(c)       V1 (r4,/S)       u' (C)
                                                                          (29)
                               +
                                    T' +1




If (29) holds as an equality, the economy is in equilibrium if STe = S.

The central bank can thus succeed in holding the exchange rate fixed at

S by selling all the reserves remaining at the end of period T'—l. This

implies that the exchange rate does not float until period T'+l, in con-

tradiction to what was assumed. If (29) is a strict inequality, indi-

vidual plans cannot be optimal at time T'--that is, equation (4) cannot

hold——unless the market—determined exchange rate STe < S.         (This follows

from the assumed strict concavity of v(rn).) We therefore need to ask

whether the exchange rate can appreciate in the first period of floating

along an equilibrium path. The answer is that it cannot. In period

T'-l, there will be a private capital inflow——and a rise in official re-

 serves——in anticipation of the appreciation at T'. If the exchange

rate is to float in period T', agents must have an incentive to purchase

the central bank's reserve stock at the period's beginning. But if they

expect the exchange rate to appreciate to S, instantaneously, no such in-

centive exists. Therefore the central bank can continue to peg through

period T' if (29) is a strict inequality.

      (ii)    Suppose the exchange rate first floats in period T' > T.
                                        23




As figure 1 shows, (27) must then hold for t =            T'—l.    Since the exchange

rate, by hypothesis, does not float until period T', it is fixed at S

during T'—l and further, R,,1 >       0.      Therefore, by (28) and concavity,



      u'(c)
                  v'(M,1/S)        u'(c)                                         (30)
                               +
                      S
                                   ST,



An exchange rate path satisfying (30) cannot be an equilibrium, as it violates

Euler equation (4). Even if reserves were zero at time T'-l, individuals

would have an incentive to reduce their real balances by one unit in

period T'-l, consuming the proceeds in that period and replenishing their

real balances on date T'. Since consumers cannot do this in the aggregate

without moving the exchange rate, the exchange rate would have to float on

date T'-l, contrary to what was assumed.

      (iii) Consider now the case in which the exchange rate first floats

at time T. Prior to date T—l equation (4) holds if m =               rn   (see equation

(18)). Up until T-l, therefore, the nominal money supply is constant and

reserves steadily decline. On date T-l there is a sharp reduction in the

nominal money stock in anticipation of next period's depreciation. But

by (26) there is a nonnegative reserve level R1 such that



     u' (c)       v' (SR +     T-10
                                    0
                                        )/S]          u' (c)
              =                                   +            .                 (31)
                          s



Thus (4) can hold through time T—l with no collapse of the exchange rate,

although it is possible that            =    0.   Equation (27) now implies that

on date T, there would be an excess supply of real balances at the ex-
                                            24




change rate S even if the central bank used all its remaining reserves

to purchase domestic money. The equilibrium floating exchange rate ST

therefore exceeds S, as agents expected at time T—l. In contrast to the

case discussed above in the proof of Ci), the public now has an incentive

to acquire any remaining central—bank reserves, and does so. At the

beginning of period T, agents sell domestic money in an attempt to bring

their real balances to the desired level. The central bank buys as much as

it can, given its remaining reserves, but this does not stem the exchange

rate's rise. Agents lucky enough to have purchased reserves from the bank

at price S reap a capital gain ST —              S   per unit. If it so happens that

     =    0, there is no second attack: :ecause agents cannot reduce their
nominal balances in this case, the money market is equilibrated entirely

through the depreciation of the currency. In any tvent (28) and the defini-

tion of m imply



         u' (c)       v' (M/ST)       Su' (c)
                  =               +

          ST             ST            ST+l


so that (4) holds on each date. Accordingly, the path along which the

exchange rate first floats on date T is an equilibrium path for the economy.1

         The proof that the first date of floating is uniquely determined is

now complete. A potentially bothersome aspect of the equilibrium con-

 structed is that the central bank may hold positive reserves at the end

 of period T-l even though speculators who acquire them at the beginning

 of period T profit at the bank's expense.17 It is worthwhile making

 sure that an individual cannot gain by reducing his money balances
                                                       25




in period T—l through the additional purchase of official reserves.

Consider an individual who reduces his nominal balances by a unit in

period T-l, buying reserves and then selling them for money on the

market at time T. This individual forgoes monetary services worth

v'(mTl/S)/S in terms of utility, but acquires interest-bearing assets

worth ut(c)/S ex dividend in utility terms (recall that P* =                                 1).   The

tirne—T cost of repurchasing the money sold at time T-l has a present

value of u' (c)/ST .               In   terms of present-value utility at time T-l,

the sequence of transactions described yields a net gain of



           u' Cc)      v' (mTl)          u' (c)

                           s




But by (31), this net gain equals zero. The individual therefore has no

incentive to acquire further central-bank reserves in T-l, even if

       >    0.
           How does the domestic nominal interest rate behave along a path

involving a crisis? Because real balances are constant at m from time

T onward, the exchange rate must rise at the same rate as the nominal

money supply. Thus (1 +                 r)   =   a(l   +   r*)   for t > T is implied by the

interest-parity condition (7) .                    Similarly,       (1 +   r)   (1 +   r*)   for t <

T-1.       So it remains to determine the nominal interest rate in period T—l.

           First note that, by (25) ,             m    is given implicitly by



           v' (rn) =   u' (C) [1   -    (3/a)).                                                     (32)
                                           26




Second note that, by (31), the ratio                         can be no greater than 0;

for   if it were, we would have mT <
                                               mTl
                                                         <   , contradicting              the fact that

        rn.   Finally note that if                   =       0, ST/S = o, and so cT_iD /s                  =
mT =
m.    In this case the nominal money supply grows exactly by the factor c

between T—l and T, and if prices rose by less than this factor we would

need T+iT <      T'     <    c to induce agents to hold higher real balances

in period T than in T—l. This againcontradicts the fact that the economy

must be in its new steady state, given by (32) ,                         in   period T.

        The upshot of this is that if                        =   0,   (1 +
                                                                              rT_l)
                                                                                      =   a(l   +   r*).
If RT1 > 0,     (1 +   r*)      (1 +
                                       rT_l)
                                                <   o(l       +   r*).        In the first case,

the economy is in its new steady state after the single speculative

attack in period T—l. As will be shown in the next section, this is

always true in continuous time.

V. Speculative Attacks in Continuous Time


      To study attack equilibria in continuous time, I briefly rework

the preceding discussion in terms of a market period of arbitrary length

n. (The previous sections implicitly assumed n =                       1.)   Let t now denote

calendar time measured in steps of length n. A continuous—time model

will be obtained by taking the limit of discrete-time models as n+O.

      The representative agent must consume at a constant rate c over

period t, and he derives utility nu(c) from doing so. Similarly, he

derives utility nv(m) from holding a constant level of real balances

rn over period t. The agent's intertemporal objective takes the form



                +   n) -t/nn[u(c)         +
                                               v(m)]

and it is maximized subject to the constraints




      At_At =Stny +                 nrB+ (nr*St+St_ S )B* +H - Snc
and (3). The argument in the appendix can be extended to yield necessary

conditions for an optimal individual plan. The ones that will concern us

here are the analogues of (4) and (6) ,                     respectively:

      u'(c )
            t ——     nv'(m )
                                t   +
                                          u'(c
                                                 t+n
        S
            t          S
                           t            (1 + nó)S
                                                 t+n
                                                        '




      u'(c) =         (l    +   nr*)/(l    +   fló)JU'(C).                               (34)
                                                       28




If once again =           r*    (assumption (8)), (34) implies that the path of

consumption is flat. The equilibrium constant consumption level c

is determined by a national intertemporal resource constraint similar

to (17)

      To analyze attacks in continuous time, it is again helpful to first

analyze the behavior of the economy under a regime of pure floating.

Let the fixed, regime—invariant growth rate of domestic—credit growth

be p; thus,




      Dt/Dt =      1 +         nii.                                                         (35)




The analogue of equation (25) follows from (33) and (35)



      [U'   (C) — nv' (m )]m = u'
                        t  t
                                                (c)m
                                                       t+n
                                                             /(l +   n) (1   +   nii)   .   (36)



Equation (36) has a unique positive stationary value, denoted m(n).

This constant level of real balances defines the economy's saddle-path

equilibrium. m(n) is given implicitly by the equation



      v'[m(n)]    =       u' (c) [n( +
                           n(l +     (1 +
                                          +
                                           n)
                                                )   n)
                                                        n2uI     .                            -
                                                                                            (37)


By taking the limit of the right-hand side of (37) as n-O, one finds

that the equilibrium level of real balances in the continuous-time

floating—rate model, m(O) ,                 satisfies


      v' [m(O)I       =    5 +        U.
          u' ()                                                                             (38)
                                       29




      We may now study the transition between the fixed- and floating—

rate regimes. Consider again a model with market period of length n.

As in the previous section (equation (26)), the exchange rate first

floats on the latest date T(n) such that



      v'f(l +   n) [T(n)_n]/nD0                 1
                                       >    n       l -   [s/(l   +
                                                                      T(n)1   (39)
                 u' Cc)




T(n) is a continuous function of the market period n.

      As was demonstrated at the end of the previous section, the

exchange rate on the first day of floating, STr must satisfy the

inequality



      ST/S <       1 +    np.                                                 (40)




Only when R() = 0         is (40) an equality; and in this case (39) holds

with equality as well. It is clear that ST() is a continuous function

of n and that



      lim S     = S.                                                          (41)
      n-O  T(n)


     Now T() = [(1 +
                            fl)T(n)/nD0]/(fl),        and, by (37), m(n) is a con-

tinuous function of n for n >     0.   Equation (41) may therefore be written



     urn [(1 +     )T(n)/nD]/()        =
                                           eT()D0/(O)         = S.            (42)
     n--O
                                  30




According to (42), the regime change for a continuous-time model occurs

on the unique date T(0) such that e4T(O)D0/s =   m(0).   This date alone has

the property that a single speculative attack in which the public acquires

all the central bank's reserves moves the economy to its new saddle—path

equilibrium with no jump in the exchange rate.

      To summarize, the present continuous-time maximizing model supports

the exchange-rate continuity condition invoked by Krugman (1979) and

others to study crises in descriptive models. In contrast to the

previous discrete—time analysis the regime change involves a single

speculative attack, timed so as to move the economy to its floating-

rate equilibrium with no discrete jump in the exchange rate.     With

continuous trading and perfect foresight, therefore, the analogy between

attacks in resource markets and in the foreign exchange market is quite

close. The reason is that it is only in continuous time that an anticipated

discrete asset-price jump generally entails "abnormal profit opportunities.
                                  31.




VI. Limitations and Extensions


       This paper has described the collapse of a fixed exchange rate in

an intertemporal general-equilibrium model with perfect foresight. The

goal of the exercise was to examine critically the analogy between speculative

attacks in resource markets, as studied by Salant and Henderson (1978) and

Salant (1983), and attacks on a moribund fixed exchange rate. While the

analogy was found to be close in continuous time, a discrete—time model led

to the possibility of two, successive speculative attacks, the first occur-

ring the period before the exchange rate begins to float.

       An important limitation of the analysis is the deterministic environ-

ment assumed throughout. A feature of the discrete-time equilibria studied

above is that there is exactly one period in which the exchange rate is

fixed but the equilibrium domestic interest exceeds the exogenous world

rate. In this period before the exchange rate first floats, domestic

residents reduce their real balances, possibly (but not necessarily) driving

the central bank's reserves to zero. In a stochastic model such as that of

Flood and Garber (l984a), the domestic interest rate exceeds the

world rate whenever there is a possibility of an exchange—rate collapse

next period. If speculation is defined as any private acquisition of reserves

in anticipation of a possible collapse, it is clear that a stochastic setup

in which money demand is a decreasing function of the home interest rate can

be characterized by arbitrarily many speculative "attacks" The sharp contrast

with the single attack of the resource model arises here because money

and bonds are not perfect substitutes. But it is possible that a similar

result could be derived in resource models such as Salant's (1983) if
                                   32




additional assets with stochastic returns were introduced and if the

speculator's portfolio decision were addressed explicitly.

       A further limitation of the analysis is that it is restricted to

a policy environment of a particularly simple nature: the central bank

pursues a constant rate of domestic credit expansion regardless of the

exchange—rate regime, and makes no effort to avoid the fixed rate's

collapse other than intervening until its reserves are exhausted.

No claim is made that this policy is an any sense optimal. Rather, the

aim is to create a situation, similar to that arising in nonrenewable resource

markets, in which a breakdown of the price-fixing scheme is inevitable.

It would be enlightening to introduce official preferences and study

whether speculative attacks can result from the authorities' pursuit of

optimal policies. As a preliminary step it would be useful to extend

the analysis of this paper to more general, but still exogenous, policy

environments.

       The paper devoted considerable attention to the official inter-

temporal budget constraint and its implications for feasible domestic—

credit growth under a fixed exchange rate.   In principle there need be no

lower bound on a central bank's foreign reserves. External borrowing in

support of the exchange rate can continue indefinitely provided domestic

taxes rise sufficiently to service the debt incurred.   There are rates

of domestic—credit growth so high, however, that the indefinite support of

the exchange rate is inconsistent with public-sector solvency.

         This appendix shows how to derive the necessary conditions (4)—(6)

in the text. Let                      denote the utility shadow price of nominal saving

 (2) at time t and                    the Lagrange multiplier for the portfolio constraint

(3). Necessary conditions for an optimal individual program are found by

maximizing the Lagrangian expression

         Equation (4) follows immediately from (Al) ,                              (A2), and (A5). One
obtains (5) by combining (Al), (A4), and (A5). Similarly, combination of

(Al) ,   (A3)   ,    and (AS) leads to (6)

Cumby and van Wijnbergen (1983), Flood and Garber (1984a), Obstfeld (1984a, b),

and Wyplosz (1983). Flood and Garber (1984b) study a related tooic, the pos-

sible collapse of a gold-standard monetary regime.



2. In the free—market equilibrium of Salant's (1983) model, the resource

price rises at a rate equal to the exogenous discount rate; consumption

demand is a declining function of price; and the initial equilibrium

price equates the total supply to cumulative consumption demand over

the horizon of the economy.   If an attack occurs on the first

date that the "shadow" free—market price of the resource exceeds the

official price, the remaining stock equals cumulative demand if the

market price rises at the rate of interest thereafter. If speculators

delay theirattack (by one period, say), next period's consumption, a

function of the official price, exceeds the level that would have prevailed

if the attack had already occurred. Since the remaining supply of the

resource is then lower a., well, its price must jump by more than the rate

of interest when the attack takes place. Otherwise, cumulative future

demand would exceed the initial supply. In continuous time, the integer

problem peculiar to discrete-time modeling disappears and the speculative
                                       35




attack takes place with no jump in the resource price. A similar integer

problem lies behind the "two-attack" equilibrium of the monetary model dis-

cussed below. That problem, too, disappears in continuous time. Note that

Salant (1983), in an appendix, offers a maximizing rationale for his model.



 3. Flood and Garber (1984a) ,   for   example, argue in a discrete-time context

 that the attack must occur as soon as the "shadow" market rate exceeds the

peg S because "agents may purchase reserves from the central bank at price

S and resell those reserves immediately on the post—collapse market" at

a higher price. (A similar argument appears in Flood and Garber 1984b.)

The foregoing argument shows at best that if the collapse of the fixed

rate is expected, it will not pay for a single individual to refrain from

joining the attack.    But it does not demonstrate that there is no other

equilibrium.   Obstfeld (l984b) gives an example of an economy with multiple

equilibria in which the "shadow" exchange rate can exceed the peg without

necessarily inducing a run. Because of the particular policy environment

assumed by Flood and Garber (1984a), the exchange rate must indeed float

on the first day that the "shadow" rate passes through S. For a complete

proof, see Obstfeld (1984b) .    Not surprisingly, the proof parallels the
discussion in section IV, below.



4. McCallurn (1984) derives a similar result in a closed—economy model.

He shows that even if the inflation tax is not used, the stock of govern-

ment debt can rise forever (at a rate less than the real interest rate)

provided other taxes are raised over time to meet debt service.       See also

Liviatan (1984) and Sargent (1984).

5. As ususal, u(c) and v(m) are strictly concave, twice continuously

differentiable, and satisfy the Iriada conditions.



6. With an arbitrary nonseparable utility function U(c,m), it is no

longer true that the constancy of the marginal utility of consumption

implies that consumption is constant. Thus, the separability assumption

embodied in (1) purchases simplicity, but it is not innocuous. This

issue is pursued further, in context, below; see footnote 14.



7. This follows from the assumed sparability of the instantaneous utility

function. See footnote 6.



8. If P* were rising, or if the pegged exchange rate were adjusted upward

over time by the central bank, the authorities would be able to collect

seigniorage equal to rn times the rate of domestic price inflation.



9. Imperfect information problems of the sort studied by Stiglitz and

Weiss (1981) would be at the heart of such a discussion.



10. Obstfeld (l984a) studies a transitory floating-rate regime.



11. Obstfeld and Rogoff (1983) show that the saddle—path quilibrium is

the unique equilibrium of the economy if the government guarantees some

minimal real redemption value for its currency.
                                      37




 12. Once reserves are zero and the exchange rate floats, the transfer

 rule (20) becomes h =     + (a   -   1)   (Di/s) =     —
                                                                    (Mi/si)
=      - Sti)/S]m.    Thus (14) holds in the saddle—path equilibrium, with

all government consumption being financed through lump-sum taxes and

seigniorage. Constraint (15) holds trivially because reserves are con-

stant at zero.




13. One could argue that even if the exchange rate remains at S in

period T—1, T—1 is really the first period of floating if the initial

attack drives reserves to zero. The proofs below could be modified to

reflect this alternative definition, but no substantive differences would

emerge. This inconsequential ambiguity disappears in Continuous time.



14. If the instantaneous utility function in (1) were not separable in

c and m, this would not be true (see footnote 6)      Even though

equilibrium consumption is invariant with respect to unanticipated,

permanent changes in inflation, it is not invariant with respect to anticipated

changes if U     0.   While consumption would therefore be flat after

the regime change, both consumption and real balances would be moving

beforehand in anticipation of the heightened inflation to come. Further,

the current account would not be balanced. The constant value of con-

sumption prevailing after the regime change would depend on the country's

stock of net foreign claims at the commencement of floatinc, and thus on

the history of the current account.
                                 38




15. If the two curves in figure 1. do not intersect at a positive t,

an attack must occur at t = 0.



16. Along with the necessary conditions for individual optimality, the

ususual sufficient conditions also hold along the path constructed

(Arrow and Kurz 1970).



17. These profits disappear in the continuous-time model. Strictly

speaking, the analysis of the individual's problem should have incorporated

his expectation of being able to buy reserves from the bank on date T

at a price below the market price. Aside from the usual distributional

issues, this modification would raise no problems provided the individual

anticipated buying a finite, exogenous quantity of underpriced official

foreign reserves.   In particular, the necessary conditions exploited

above would still hold: by offering speculators a one-sided bet on

date T, the central bank in effect offers them a transfer payment. It

should be clear that for this reason, the equilibrium consumption level

c, which is determined by (17), is unaffected.



18. This result will play a key role in the next section.
