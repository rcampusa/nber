Is Home Bias in Assets Related to Home Bias in Goods?

                                             ABSTRACT

Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) have reinvigorated an old literature on the link between home bias in the
goods market and home bias in the asset market by arguing that trade costs in the goods market can
account for the observed portfolio home bias. The key link between home bias in the two markets
is the real exchange rate. Home bias in consumption implies a different expenditure allocation across
countries, which leads to different inflation rates when measured in the same currency. This leads
investors from different countries to choose different portfolios to hedge against inflation uncertainty.
An older partial equilibrium literature argued that such hedge portfolios are not large enough to produce
substantial home bias. We link the general equilibrium and partial equilibrium literatures and show
that in both the resulting home bias in the equity market depends on a covariance-variance ratio: the
covariance between the real exchange rate and the excess return on home relative to foreign equity,
divided by the variance of the excess return. Empirical evidence shows that this ratio and the implied
home bias are close to zero, casting significant doubt on a meaningful link between home bias in the
goods and asset markets. General equilibrium models that conclude otherwise imply a covariance-variance
ratio that is at odds with the data.

1       Introduction
A literature dating back to the late 1970s and early 1980s suggests that the optimal
international portfolio allocation is related to the allocation of consumption expen-
diture across countries.1 In the most extreme and well-known case, when agents
are in…nitely risk-averse and local-currency output prices are constant, optimal
portfolio shares are identical to expenditure shares because such portfolio shares
provide the best in‡ation hedge. This literature therefore suggests that home bias
in the goods market may be related to home bias in the asset market. The link
is the real exchange rate: a di¤erent expenditure allocation leads to di¤erent in-
‡ation rates (when measured in the same currency) which leads to di¤erent hedge
portfolios.
    The literature that has followed has restated the issue in general equilibrium
(GE) terms. A substantial number of papers have analyzed the optimal home bias
in the context of two-country GE models with traded and non-traded goods.2 A
well-known result is that when utility is separable in traded and non-traded goods
a country should be perfectly diversi…ed in equity issued by the traded-goods sector
but hold the entire equity supply of the domestic non-traded goods sector.
    Recently fresh wind was blown into the argument linking portfolio shares and
expenditure shares by the provocative contribution of Obstfeld and Rogo¤ (2000).
They argue that costs to international trade in goods, which lead to home bias in
trade, can explain many puzzles in open economy macroeconomics, including the
portfolio home bias puzzle. This has lead to renewed theoretical interest in the
topic. Recent contributions by Coeurdacier (2005), Heathcote and Perri (2005)
and Kollmann (2006b) study the home bias issue in the context of two-country
GE models with trade costs or home bias in preferences.3 Di¤erent authors reach

di¤erent conclusions, though, depending on details of the model and parameter
assumptions.
    There is a small empirical literature that has investigated the impact of in‡ation
uncertainty on optimal international portfolios in the context of partial equilibrium
models with trade in equity and bonds. Adler and Dumas (1983) show that the
component of the optimal portfolio that depends on in‡ation risk (the hedge port-
folio) is close to zero and therefore does not di¤er signi…cantly across countries.
Cooper and Kaplanis (1994) develop a more formal test of in‡ation risk as an
explanation for home bias and strongly reject it. These studies have not received
any attention in the general equilibrium home bias literature with trade costs or
non-traded goods. There are at least two reasons for that. First, the models in
the empirical papers are quite di¤erent from the more recent models in that they
are partial equilibrium and adopt N -country, 2N -asset frameworks (bonds and eq-
uity). Second, home bias in the GE models can be computed without considering
the asset pricing implications of the model. The covariance between asset returns
and in‡ation risk, which is a key relationship in the partial equilibrium papers,
receives no attention in the GE literature.
    The main goal of this paper is to develop a link between the burgeoning GE
literature and the much smaller empirical partial equilibrium literature. To develop
this link we …rst frame the question of portfolio home bias with real exchange rate
uncertainty in the context of a two-country partial equilibrium portfolio choice
model. As a starting point we only consider trade in equity (as in most of the GE
literature). We show that portfolio home bias depends on a covariance-variance
ratio: the covariance between the real exchange rate and the excess return on
home relative to foreign equity, divided by the variance of the excess return. When
also introducing a forward market or trade in nominal bonds, we show that the
home bias expression still depends on the covariance-variance ratio, although with
di¤erent conditioning variables to compute the moments.
    By adopting a partial equilibrium setting in which the stochastic processes of
asset returns and the real exchange rate are exogenous, the link between portfolio
home bias and the covariance-variance ratio develops naturally. The same link
must apply in two-country GE models, but the GE literature does not discuss it.
    Any explanation for portfolio home bias in the context of GE models only makes
on the extent of risk sharing across countries. Uppal (1993) is an earlier paper that investigates
the impact of trade costs on portfolio home bias in a two-country general equilibrium setup.


                                                2
sense if the resulting covariance-variance ratio is consistent with the data. In an
application of the two-country setup to the United States versus the rest of the
world (21 other industrialized countries) we …nd that the covariance-variance ratio
is close to zero. This implies that very little portfolio home bias can be explained
through home bias in trade. We then illustrate that conclusions of large portfolio
home bias (or foreign bias) in the context of GE models are based on speci…cations
in which the implied covariance-variance ratio is grossly at odds with the data. Any
GE model that matches this feature of the data will come to the conclusion that
there is no link between home bias in goods markets and home bias in …nancial
markets.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we discuss
the partial equilibrium portfolio maximization problem for a two-country setup
under di¤erent asset market structures. Section 3 provides empirical results on
the covariance-variance ratio and the implied home bias. Section 4 develops a link
with the GE literature and section 5 concludes.


2       Home Bias Measures
In this section we derive home bias measures under three asset market structures:
(i) trade in equity only, (ii) trade in equity plus a forward market, (iii) trade in
equity and nominal bonds. We adopt a static (1-period) framework.4 Without
loss of generality, denote all asset returns, prices and in‡ation rates in terms of the
currency of country 1.

Trade in Equity

    First consider a setup in which the only assets are equity issued by both coun-
tries. The gross nominal return of country j equity is Rj . Country n investors
face the following portfolio maximization problem. The initial wealth is W (n), of
which a fraction j (n) is invested in country j equity. The in‡ation rate is e (n) ,
so that the real portfolio return is

                      Rp (n) = (   1 (n)R1   + (1    1 (n))R2 ) e
                                                                    (n)
                                                                                         (1)
    4
    In a multi-period setup a hedge against changes in future expected returns can be another
source of home bias, but Tille and van Wincoop (2006) …nd that the home bias from this source
is small and we will abstract from it.


                                              3
Country n investors consume end of period wealth W (n) = Rp (n)W (n). Expected
utility from end of period wealth is

                                         EW (n)1 =(1                 )                                        (2)

The …rst order condition for optimal portfolio choice is

                             E (Rp (n))            (R1       R2 )e       (n)
                                                                               =0                             (3)

Indicating log returns with lower case letters, the …rst order condition becomes

                                 r p (n)+r1        (n)             r p (n)+r2      (n)
                           Ee                            = Ee                                                 (4)

Now adopt a …rst order log-linearization of the real portfolio return5

                          rp (n) =       1 (n)r1   + (1           1 (n))r2             (n)                    (5)

After substituting in (4) and assuming normality of log returns and in‡ation, some
basic algebra yields the following optimal portfolio:

                                                         1 cov(r1 r2 ; (n))
                             1 (n)   =     +                                                                  (6)
                                                             var(r1 r2 )

When is one, investors have logarithmic preferences and the optimal portfolio
(the so-called logarithmic portfolio) is given by , which depends on …rst and
second moments of asset returns but is the same for investors in both countries:
                   E(r1     r2 ) + 0:5(var(r1 ) var(r2 )) + cov(r2                                r1 ; r2 )
               =
                                           var(r1 r2 )

   We adopt a standard de…nition of home bias: the fraction invested by country
n investors in country n equity ( n (n)) minus the share of country n’s equity in
the world equity supply ( n ). Under perfect diversi…cation this measure of home
bias equals zero. The average home bias across the two countries is
                                 1                                 1
                      home bias = (            1 (1)         1)   + (          2 (2)         2)               (7)
                                 2                                 2
   5
    Engel and Matsumoto (2006) use the same approach to solve optimal portfolios. An al-
ternative, which gives the same solution, is to take a second order approximation of the log
portfolio return and then derive the …rst order condition and optimal portfolio. See, for example,
Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2006).


                                                         4
    Let q = (1)         (2) be the change in the real exchange rate. A rise in q
represents a country 1 real appreciation; that is, an increase in prices in country 1
relative to country 2 (when expressed in a common currency). Let er = r1 r2 be
the excess return. Using (6) and noting that 1 + 2 = 1 and 2 (2) = 1            1 (2),
the average home bias can be written as
                                                1 cov(er; q)
                          home bias = 0:5                                            (8)
                                                    var(er)
This is a very simple and powerful equation. With log preferences ( = 1) there is
no home bias. More generally, (8) shows that that the average home bias depends
on a covariance-variance ratio: the covariance of the excess return and the real
exchange rate divided by the variance of the excess return.
   While derived from a simple partial equilibrium portfolio maximization prob-
lem, the home bias expression (8) will hold in any two-country GE model with
constant relative risk-aversion and trade limited to equity. It is therefore key that
GE models match the moment
                                       cov(er; q)
                                         var(er)
in the data.

Adding a Forward Market

    Now consider adding a forward market to cover against nominal exchange rate
‡uctuations. Let next period’s nominal exchange rate be S and the current spot
and forward exchange rates be S and F (currency 1 per unit of currency 2). When
country n investors purchase forward m(n)W (n)=S units of currency 2 in exchange
for currency 1, the real portfolio return becomes
                                                               S       F
               Rp (n) =   1 (n)R1   + (1   1 (n))R2   + m(n)               e   (n)
                                                                                     (9)
                                                                   S
Using math similar to that above (see Appendix A for details) and letting s be
the change in the log exchange rate, the optimal fraction invested in country 1
equity is
                                      1 cov s (r1 r2 ; (n))
                      1 (n) =  +                                           (10)
                                           var s (r1 r2 )
Here the second moments cov s and var s refer to the covariance and variance
based on the components of returns and in‡ation that are orthogonal to s. Only

                                            5
the parts of asset returns and in‡ation that are orthogonal to changes in the nom-
inal exchange rate matter for the equity portfolio choice since nominal exchange
rate risk can be separately hedged through the forward market. The parameter
measures the logarithmic portfolio that depends on …rst and second moments of
returns and exchange rates, but is the same for both countries’investors.
    Applying the same home bias formula for the equity market as before, we get
                                                     1 cov s (er; q)
                          home bias = 0:5                                                 (11)
                                                         var s (er)
The only di¤erence is that now the home bias formula is based on the components
of the excess return and real exchange rate that are orthogonal to the nominal
exchange rate. Introducing a forward market is important because in the data
nominal and real exchange rates are highly correlated. When changes in the nom-
inal exchange rate can be hedged through a forward market, only the component
of real exchange rate ‡uctuations that is orthogonal to nominal exchange rate
‡uctuations matters for home bias.

Equity and Nominal Bonds

   Finally, consider a setup in which each country’s equity and nominal bonds are
traded. This is equivalent to trade in equity, plus a forward market, plus a nominal
bond from either country. The nominal interest rate in country n is in . Let b(n)
be the fraction invested in country 2 nominal bonds by investors from country n.
Then the portfolio return is


    Rp (n) = (1 + i1 )e   (n)
                                +                                                                    (12)
                                                                              S                       (n)
       1 (n)(R1   (1 + i1 )) +      2 (n)(R2    (1 + i1 )) + b(n) (1 + i2 )       (1 + i1 )      e
                                                                              S
    Leaving details of the algebra to the Appendix, the optimal fraction invested
in country 1 and 2 equity is
                                                    1 cov s;r2 (er; (n))
                            1 (n)   =   1   +                                             (13)
                                                        var s;r2 (er)
                                                    1 cov s;r1 (er; (n))
                            2 (n)   =   2                                                 (14)
                                                        var s;r1 (er)
Here cov s;rj (x; y) denotes the covariance between the components of x and y that
are orthogonal to both s and rj . These orthogonal components can be obtained

                                                6
from the error term of a regression of x and y on both s and rj . The log portfolios
( 1 and 2 ) depend on …rst and second moments of asset returns and exchange
rates and are the same for both countries’investors.
    The home bias measure (7) used so far can be written as the average fraction
invested in domestic equity, 0:5( 1 (1)+ 2 (2)), minus the average share of domestic
equity supply, 0:5( 1 + 2 ) = 0:5. With trade in nominal bonds portfolio shares
are now a fraction of total …nancial wealth, which is larger than equity wealth. We
therefore de…ne home bias as
                                           1 (1)   +   2 (2)
                        home bias = !                           0:5                      (15)
                                                   2
where ! is the ratio of world wealth to the world equity market. This is consistent
with the measure of home bias without trade in bonds, where ! = 1.
    De…ne w1 as the share of country 1 in world wealth. Using the equity market

There are two changes relative to home bias measures (8) and (11). First, the
home bias is scaled upwards because ! > 1. Second, the moment

                                        var(er)

is now replaced by a weighted average of the same moment based on two di¤erent
orthogonal components of the real exchange rate and excess return, the …rst with
respect to s and r2 and the second with respect to s and r1 .

Data Description

     We compute the covariance-variance ratios in (8), (11), and (16) using monthly
data for the period 1988-2005. The two-country framework in the previous section
is interpreted as a model of the United States and the rest of the world (ROW). For


                                           7
our purposes, ROW will be composed of an equity-market-capitalization-weighted
combination of twenty-one industrialized countries that have complete data.6
    The calculation of the home bias expressions require data for U.S. in‡ation,
U.S. equity returns, as well as three ROW market-capitalization-weighted indexes:
a nominal dollar index, an index of foreign equity returns, and a foreign in‡ation
index. In‡ation (both U.S. and foreign) and equity returns are expressed in dollars.
We use identical weighting schemes to compute the ROW indexes; weights are
given by the relative weight of each foreign country in total ROW equity market
capitalization.7 Equity indexes, which include both capital gains and dividends
and are converted into dollars, are as of month end from MSCI Barra. The excess
return is computed as the log …rst di¤erence between the U.S. and ROW equity
indexes: er = rU S rROW . Nominal exchange rates are month-end data from Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System’s G.5 Report (as compiled by Haver
Analytics). Consumer price indexes are from the IMF’s International Financial
Statistics database. The ROW dollar price index is computed by …rst multiplying
the local currency price indexes of each country with the nominal exchange rate
to convert to dollars and then applying the equity market capitalization weights.
The change in the real exchange rate q is equal to the di¤erence between U.S.
and ROW in‡ation rates, both expressed in dollars.

Covariance-Variance Calculations

    Calculations of the covariance-variance ratio in the …rst home bias expression
(8) are given in column (1) of Table 1. The ratio is 0.32. This implies that the
maximum home bias (for in…nite risk-aversion) is one-half of that, or 0.16. For a
rate of risk-aversion of 5, the bias would be 0.13. While not negligible, the bias is
substantially below existing estimates of home bias.8 More importantly, this bias
is almost entirely the result of nominal exchange rate ‡uctuations that identically

      The countries included in ROW are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Fin-
land, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom.

      The weights are based on closing values as of December 31 of the previous year. Annual
updating of weights is in line with the methodology used by the Federal Reserve Board in forming
its monthly trade-weighted dollar indexes. See Loretan (2005).
    8
      U.S. home bias has ranged between 0.4 and 0.5 over the past decade. See Ahearne, Griever
and Warnock (2004) and Kho, Stulz and Warnock (2006).

a¤ect the real exchange rate and the excess return. Once we introduce a forward
market, this disappears.
    In column (2) we implement the home bias formula (11) in the presence of a
forward market, using the components of the real exchange rate and excess return
that are orthogonal to the nominal exchange rate. Now the covariance-variance
ratio falls to near zero (0.0052). A similar result applies when introducing both
Home and Foreign nominal bonds in addition to trade in equity of both countries.
The covariance-variance ratios embedded in home bias formula (16), shown in
columns (3) and (4), are very small. Even after scaling these numbers up by any
reasonable estimate of total …nancial wealth to equity wealth (represented by ! in
the home bias formula), the result remains close to zero. We can conclude that
portfolio home bias associated with hedging real exchange rate risk is essentially
zero.
    The data underlying Table 1 are 216 monthly observations. One could argue
that timing issues put undue burden on data of a relatively high frequency. In Table
2 we recomputed the covariance-variance ratios using data sets with overlapping
12-month cumulative returns, quarterly data, and annual data. The story remains
the same: the relationship between relative equity returns and the real exchange
rate is too weak to generate substantial home bias. The evidence is clearly not
supportive of a link between home bias in assets and home bias in goods.


4    Link to the General Equilibrium Literature
In the preceding sections we have analyzed the home bias based on partial equi-
librium solutions to portfolio choice. But it nonetheless closely connects to the
GE literature on home bias in the presence of trade costs, non-traded goods or
home bias in preferences. We have adopted a two-country model, as is standard
in the GE literature. The assumed constant relative risk-aversion utility function
is also standard in the GE literature. While we have taken the stochastic process
of asset returns and the real exchange rate as exogenously given, the resulting
home bias expression is exactly the same when asset returns and the real exchange
rate are endogenously determined in GE models. Finally, most of the GE liter-
ature assumes that trade is limited to equity. Therefore the home bias equation
(8) connects closely to the GE literature. However, none of the GE home bias


                                         9
papers mentioned in the introduction draws the link between home bias and the
covariance-variance ratio, nor does any compare the implied covariance-variance
ratio to the data.
    The conclusions in GE models about the magnitude of home bias in the pres-
ence of trade costs or home bias in preferences range from large home bias (e.g.
Heathcote and Perri (2004), Kollmann (2006) and Obstfeld and Rogo¤ (2000)) to
substantial foreign bias (Coeurdacier (2005)). The question then is how these …nd-
ings can be reconciled with our conclusion that home bias based on hedging real
exchange rate uncertainty is close to zero. The reconciliation consists of two steps.
First, the GE models do not introduce a forward market or trade in nominal bonds
denominated in the currencies of the countries.9 We showed that introducing such
assets reduces the implied home bias to essentially zero. Second, by ignoring the
covariance-variance ratio, GE models can derive home bias results that are not at
all constrained by data on these moments.
    To make this second point a bit more precise, consider for example the GE
model in Coeurdacier (2005), which nests the case studied by Obstfeld and Rogo¤
(2000) as a particular example. The model in Coeurdacier (2005) is a static two-
country GE model with the same constant rate of relative risk-aversion preferences
as assumed in section 2. Each country produces a di¤erent good with one …xed
factor, so that it is essentially an endowment economy. Productivity shocks in
both countries determine the level of output. The two countries trade claims on
the output of both goods. The consumption index in the Home country is
                                      1                           1=
                             C=           CH + (1       )1 CF                                 (17)
where CH and CF are respectively consumption of Home and Foreign goods,
0:5 is a parameter of bias in preferences toward the Home good and 1=(1 ) is the
elasticity of substitution between Home and Foreign goods.10 In addition, there is
a trade cost that is of the iceberg type, such that 1 good arrives if 1 + goods
are shipped. The model in Obstfeld and Rogo¤ (2000) is the same, but adopts the
additional restrictions = 0:5 (no home bias in preferences) and = 1       (overall
utility is separable in both goods).
   9
     Nominal exchange rate risk is often absent from GE models because they usually do not
introduce money or nominal rigidities.
  10
     Coeurdacier (2005) allows for a continuum of goods produced in each country, with a constant
elasticity of substitution between them. But that feature plays no role in the subsequent analysis,
so we omit it.

                                                10
    While Coeurdacier (2005) does not draw a link between home bias and the
covariance-variance ratio, the portfolio home bias in this model is exactly that in
(8) with the covariance-variance ratio equal to

                            cov(er; q)
                                       =                                                   (18)

Here we followed the notation of Coeurdacier (2005). The home bias in preferences
and trade costs are jointly captured by < 1.
    First consider the preferred parameterization by Obstfeld and Rogo¤ (2000):
  = 0:25, = 0:5, 1=(1       ) = 6 and = 1       . This leads to a covariance-variance
ratio of about -0.10. This is clearly inconsistent with the data, where we found a
positive covariance-variance ratio of 0.32 with trade limited to equity. Obstfeld and
Rogo¤ (2000) generated a positive home bias with a negative covariance-variance
ratio because their assumption = 1          implies a rate of relative risk-aversion of
less than 1 ( = 1=6). This near-zero rate of relative risk-aversion is at odds with a
substantial body of empirical evidence, but together with the negative covariance-
variance ratio of -0.1 implies a home bias of 0.25.11
    The preferred parameterization in Coeurdacier (2005) is = 0:7, 1=(1 ) = 5,
  = 2 and = 0:35. This generates of negative home bias of about 0.15, or a foreign
bias of 0.15. In this case the covariance-variance ratio is -0.58, also signi…cantly
di¤erent from that in the data. In fact, even if we vary from 0 to 1, from 1 to
10 and 1=(1      ) from 1 to 10, the model is not able to come anywhere near the
observed 0.32 covariance-variance ratio.12
    Conclusions about home or foreign bias from GE models with trade costs or
home bias in preferences should therefore be considered as suspect as they are not
…rmly grounded in data on the covariance-variance ratio that is the ultimate source
  11
     Obstfeld and Rogo¤ (2000) report a home bias of 0.31 in this case. The small discrepancy is
the result of the …rst order approximation of the model in Coeurdacier (2005), on which (18) is
based.
  12
     Positive numbers can be attained, but they are always much greater than one.

of the home bias. If GE models are parameterized to match this key feature of the
data, and are rich enough to allow for a forward market or trade in nominal bonds,
then one must conclude that home bias in the goods market cannot account for
home bias in …nancial markets.


5    Conclusion
We conclude that the answer to the question in the title of the paper is “highly
unlikely”. Home bias in the goods market is linked to home bias in the asset
market through the real exchange rate. When the expenditure allocation di¤ers
across countries in the presence of a bias towards domestically produced goods,
the real exchange rate ‡uctuates and in‡ation rates (when measured in the same
currency) di¤er across countries. This leads investors from di¤erent countries to
hold di¤erent hedge portfolios to protect against in‡ation uncertainty. We have
shown under various asset market structures that the resulting home bias depends
on a covariance-variance ratio: the covariance between the real exchange rate and
the excess return divided by the variance of the excess return. Empirical evidence
shows that this ratio is close to zero, casting signi…cant doubt on trade costs as an
explanation for portfolio home bias. GE models are subject to the same covariance-
variance ratio; those that produce substantial home bias do so through an implied
covariance-variance ratio that is at odds with the data.

A        Home Bias with a Forward Market and Equity
         Markets
In this Appendix we derive the home bias formula (11) in the presence of a forward
market. There are now two …rst order conditions, with respect to 1 (n) and m(n),
which in the log-return notation are

                                       r p (n)+r1      (n)            r p (n)+r2   (n)
                              Ee                             = Ee                                              (19)
                                       r p (n)+   s    (n)            r p (n)+(f   s)    (n)
                              Ee                             = Ee                                              (20)

where s is the change in the log exchange rate. The linearized log-portfolio return
is now

             rp (n) =   1 (n)r1    + (1             1 (n))r2      + m(n)( s        (f     s))      (n)         (21)

   To solve for the optimal portfolio allocation 1 (n) and m(n), …rst substitute
the log portfolio return into the …rst order conditions to get

     1         1 (n)var(r1      r2 )       (1          )cov(r1       r2 ; (n))           m(n)cov(r1         r2 ; s) = 0
     2         1 (n)cov(r1     r2 ; s)            (1         )cov( s; (n))               m(n)var( s) = 0

where

                 1   = E(r1        r2 ) + 0:5(var(r1 )              var(r2 )) + cov(r2          r1 ; r2 )
                 2   = E( s         f + s) + 0:5var( s)                    cov(r2 ; s)

The parameters 1 and 2 are the same for investors from both countries.
   Solving for m(n) from the second …rst order condition and substituting into
the …rst one yields

                  1 (n)var(r1  r2 ) (1     )cov(r1 r2 ; (n))                                                   (22)

                     cov(r1 r2 ; s)             cov( (n); s)cov(r1                              r2 ; s)
         +     1 (n)                  + (1    )                                                             =0

where
                                                              cov( s; r1 r2 )
                                     =        1           2
                                                                  var( s)
    For any variable x, de…ne x^ as the residual of a regression of x on                                       s. Therefore

                                                   cov(x; s)
                                       x=                    s + x^                                                    (23)
                                                    var( s)

Applying this to x = r1           r2 and x = (n), (22) becomes

                        1 (n)var(^
                                 r1               r^2 )       (1        )cov(^
                                                                             r1         r^2 ; ^ (n)) = 0               (24)

This implies (10) with
                                                  =
                                                          var(^

Using (7), which can be rewritten as average bias = 12 (                                 1 (1)       1 (2)),    then yields
(11).


B         Home Bias with Bond and Equity Markets
In this Appendix we derive the home bias formula (16) in the presence of both
bond and equity markets.
   In log-return notation, the …rst order conditions for 1 (n), 2 (n) and b(n) are

                             r p (n)+r1       (n)                     r p (n)+ln(1+i)    (n)
                    Et e                              = Et e                                                           (25)
                             r p (n)+r        (n)                     r p (n)+ln(1+i)    (n)
                    Et e                 2
                                                      = Et e                                                           (26)
                             r p (n)+ln(1+i        )+ s         (n)               r p (n)+ln(1+i)    (n)
                    Et e                                              = Et e                                           (27)

and the log-linearized portfolio return is

    rp (n) = i1 +   1 (n)(r1        i1 ) +        2 (n)(r2            i1 ) + b(n)(i2 +           s   i1 )       (n)    (28)

    Substituting (28) into the …rst order conditions (25)-(27), we get

                      1   = Er1     ln(1 + i1 ) + 0:5var(r1 )
                      2   = Er2     ln(1 + i1 ) + 0:5var(r2 )
                      3   = E s + ln(1 + i2 )             ln(1 + i1 ) + 0:5var( s)

    The …rst step towards solving the home bias formula is the same as with a
forward market. Again de…ne x^ as the component of x orthogonal to s, as in
(23). Applying this to returns and in‡ation rates after substituting the solution
for b(n) from the last …rst order condition into the …rst two …rst order conditions,
we get

           1        1 (n)var(^
                             r1 )           2 (n)cov(^
                                                     r1 ; r^2 )   +(                r1 ; ^ (n)) = 0 (29)
                                                                              1)cov(^
           2        1 (n)cov(^
                             r1 ; r^2 )        2 (n)var(^
                                                        r2 )      +(                r2 ; ^ (n)) = 0 (30)
                                                                              1)cov(^

where 1 and 2 depend on …rst and second moments that are the same from the
perspective of investors of both countries.
   Substituting (30) into (29) gives
                                                         cov(^r1 ; r^2 )2
                1         1 (n)var(^
                                   r1 )   +     1 (n)
                                                           var(^ r2 )
                                                            cov(^ r2 ; ^ (n))cov(^
                                                                                 r1 ; r^2 )
               +(        1)cov(^
                               r1 ; ^ (n))      (        1)                                 =0      (31)
                                                                        var(^
                                                                            r2 )
where 1 is the same for investors of both countries.
     Now de…ne r~1 and ~ (n) as the components of r^1 and ^ (n) that are orthogonal
to r^2 . Again applying (23), (31) becomes

                     1         1 (n)var(~
                                        r1 )   +(          1)cov(~
                                                                 r1 ; ~ (n)) = 0                    (32)

Since r~1 and ~ (n) are the same as the residuals of regressions of respectively r1
and (n) on both s and r2 , (13) follows. Equation (14) follows by symmetry.
   Using the equity market clearing conditions

                                i (1)w1   +   i (2)(1       w1 ) =     i =!                         (33)

for i = 1; 2, (??) becomes

         home bias = 0:5! [(        1 (1)       1 (2))(1       !1) + (    2 (2)       2 (1))! 1 ]   (34)

Substituting (13) and (14) yields (16).

Notes. The covariance-variance ratios correspond to those in equations (8), (11), and (16). Specifically, in
column (1), corresponding to the expression below equation (8), straight excess returns and real exchange
rate changes are used; in column (2), corresponding to the expression in equation (11), er and q are
orthogonal to changes in the nominal exchange rate; in column (3), corresponding to the first term in
equation (16), er and q are orthogonal to changes in the nominal exchange rate and rROW; and in column
(4), corresponding to the second term in equation (16), er and q are orthogonal to changes in the nominal
exchange rate and rUS. There are 216 monthly observations underlying each calculation.
