                                        ABSTRACT




               Empirical tests of the life cycle model have focused on its

          implications for the level of a household's total net worth and paid

          little attention to changes in portfolio composition over the life

      cycle. In this paper, we examine a new survey of the asset holdings

      of 6,010 U.s households and show that there is a pronounced life-cycle

      pattern to both the number and value of assets held by U.S.

      households. Direct survey evidence suggests that incomplete

      information is a significant determinant of household portfolio

      composition. We test the hypothesis that information about investment

      opportunities arrives stochastically over time, estimating a Poisson

      model for the arrival of new information.

1.   Introduction

     Empirical tests of the life cycle model have focused almost

exclusively on its implications for the level of a household's total net

worth. Relatively little attention has been paid to changes in portfolio

composition over the life cycle. Although this emphasis is understandable,

it obscures some important features of household savings behavior. As we

show below, there is a pronounced life-cycle pattern to both the number and

value of assets held by U.S. households. In this paper we examine the

factors that are responsible for the small degree of diversification that

is observed in household portfolios.

     To examine the extent of diversification we present evidence from a

new survey of the asset holdings of 6,010 U.S. households. The survey

distinguishes thirty-six different assets and liabilities, and contains a

large number of wealthy households. We are, therefore, able to explore the

changing composition of household portfolios over the life cycle in some

detail. The evidence suggests a degree of incompleteness in portfolios

that is difficult to reconcile with conventional portfolio theory.

Transaction costs almost certainly play some role but in themselves are

inadequate to explain the lack of diversification of such a high proportion

of the rich. To explain the degree of incompleteness in portfolios, we
                                      2

focus on one aspect of bounded rationality, namely incomplete knowledge of

the investment opportunities that are available. In section 4 we develop

and test a simple model in which the flow of information about new

investment opportunities is stochastic and arrives with a constant

probability (conditional on household characteristics) each period.

     This model is related to the concept of "noise traders" employed by

Black (1986), Shiller (1984), Glosten and Milgrom (1985), and De Long et

al. (1987). In those models noise traders are assumed to engage in

purchases or sales of assets for exogenous reasons unrelated to the factors

that determine the "optimal" portfolio decisions of informed traders.

Incomplete information about investment opportunities will lead to certain

features of behavior characteristic of noise traders, in particular, entry

into, but not exit from, the market. The arrival of information about

investment opportunities will induce purchases of assets that would not

occur in a conventional model of portfolio choice with complete

information. The evidence presented in this paper provides some empirical

justification for this aspect of the behavior of noise traders.

     The process for the arrival of information about new investment

opportunities described above implies that age will be an important

determinant of portfolio composition. Such life cycle effects will vary

among assets according to the importance of information for the acquisition

of different assets. Previous empirical studies of the life-cycle model

have focused on two questions more concerned with the total size of a

household's wealth than with its composition. These are, first, can the

model explain the observed level of savings in the economy, and, second,

can it explain the observed age-profile of wealth-holdings? Neither

question has been fully resolved.1 Apart from the now voluminous
                                      3

literature on the effects of pensions and social security on private

saving, remarkably little attention has been paid to the changing

composition of household portfolios over the life-cycle. Moreover, social

security and pension wealth are probably the assets over which a household

has least discretion.

     Those studies that have tested for changes in the composition of

household portfolios over the life cycle found little evidence of any

significant age effect. Using data from the Oxford Savings Survey

conducted in 1953, Lydall (1955) found that in the UK only equity in

housing and the value of liabilities declined after retirement. The former

result is contradicted by the more recent studies for the US and Canada of

Bernheim (1984) and King and Dicks-Mireaux (1982) respectively. Moreover,

the Oxford study distinguished only four categories of assets and

liabilities and consequently provides little information about portfolio

composition. Uhler and Cragg (1971) used data from the 1960-62 Michigan

Surveys of Consumer Finances to estimate a logit model for the number of

assets owned by a household and found age to be an insignificant

explanatory variable for each of the four alternatives considered (owning

one, two, three or four or more assets). Likewise, Blume and Friend (1975)

found no effect of age on the extent of diversification of portfolios for

households in the 1962 Federal Reserve Board Survey.2 In contrast,

Dicks-Mireaux and King (1984), using data for 10,118 Canadian families in

1977 found that the probability of owning each of the eleven assets

distinguished in the survey was higher for households where the age of the

head was greater than forty than for younger households, with the exception

of business equity and registered home ownership savings plans.

     There are two main reasons that may explain why these studies (with
                                      4

one exception) failed to capture any life cycle influences on portfolio

composition. First, they imposed a simple linear relationship between

portfolio composition and age, or they employed a single age dummy. This

specification may fail to detect a true nonlinear relationship. Secondly,

the number of assets distinguished in the studies was small. The survey

analyzed here enables us to overcome this problem.

     In section 2, we describe the survey data and present some summary

statistics. The evidence on the life cycle behavior of portfolios is

examined in section 3. In section 4, we develop and estimate a model of

the impact of the arrival of new information on asset accumulation.



2.   The Survey Data on Household Portfolios

     Our data are drawn from the 1978 Survey of Consumer Financial

Decisions conducted by SRI International.3 This was a survey of 6,010 U.s.

households based on a stratified random sample which "oversampled" high

income units. It provides, therefore, an especially valuable source of

information on the portfolio behavior of wealthy households. No fewer than

2,4.0 households (40 percent of the sample) reported a figure for 1978 net

worth in excess of $100,000. The mean net worth of the sample was $223,188

(over $400,000 at 1987 prices). The largest value of reported net worth

was $73 million, and the sample contains 204 millionaires. Assets were

valued at market values in May and June 1978. Information was recorded on

the holdings of 23 different types of asset and 13 types of liability, and

these 36 categories are shown in Table 1.

     The assets include checking accounts, various types of savings

accounts, money market funds, bonds of various types, stocks, mutual funds,

IRA-Keogh accounts, convertible securities, owner-occupied housing, real
                                      5

estate and other tangibles, life insurance, tax shelters and other assets.

The liabilities include home mortgages, personal loans, and other loans

specifically related to particular assets. Certain assets were excluded

from the survey, namely entitlement to future social security payments and

some types of private pensions (primarily defined benefit plans), the value

of future inheritances, and ordinary consumer durablesA

     Table la summarizes the asset holdings of households in the sample.

Columns one and two show the shows the mean value of each asset holding in

dollars and as a proportion of the mean net worth of households in the

sample, respectively. The most important assets owned by households in the

sample (as a proportion of net worth) were homes (33 percent), stocks (23

percent) and investment real estate (22 percent). Other assets held in

large amounts include pension plans, municipal bonds, and closely-held

stock. It is worth noting that all of these are assets that received

favorable tax treatment. In Table lb we present the corresponding

population estimates of household asset holdings using the weights provided

by SRI. Over half the net worth of the population is held in owner-

occupied housing, just under one-fifth in investment real estate, and only

one-tenth in stocks and stock mutual funds. Over ten percent is held in

savings and credit union share accounts and another eight and a half

percent in savings certificates and savings bonds.

     In the final column of Tables la and lb is shown the percentage of

households owning each asset. Certain assets were owned by almost

everyone--over ninety percent of the sample (and 88 percent of the

population) had checking accounts. Similar proportions held savings

accounts. Almost 60 percent of the sample, but only about 40 percent of

the population had pensions or retirement plan accounts. Annuities were
                                          6

purchased by just one percent of the sample and one-half of one percent of

the population.

       Almost one-half of the sample owned corporate equity either directly

or indirectly through a mutual fund. About 10 percent of the sample held

corporate bonds. The proportion of households owning tax-exempt municipal

bonds was also about ten percent of the sample, although the average

holdings were significantly higher than for taxable bonds. Eighty-four

percent of the sample owned their own home and almost 10 percent owned a

second home. Over 40 percent invested in miscellaneous tax-preferred

assets including tax shelters, closely-held stock, convertible securities,

investment real estate and tangibles such as art and gold (owned by a

surprisingly high 1,230 households). Well over half the sample had both a

home mortgage and some other liability. Personal loans and credit card

accounts were the most common form of other liabilities.

       In contrast, only one-quarter of the population held equity either

directly or through a mutual fund, only three percent held corporate bonds,

and three percent municipal bonds. Sixty-five percent of the population

owned their own home and less than one-quarter invested in special tax-

preferred assets such as investment real estate, tangibles and closely-held

stock. More than a third of the population had home mortgages and 37

percent had credit card liabilities.

      As a test of the quality of the survey data we compared the estimated

population total for asset holdings (using population weights to gross-up

the survey figures) with the aggregate holdings of assets in the year-end

balance sheets published by the Federal Reserve. This comparison is shown

in   Table   2. The two sources use different classifications of assets, and

it was possible to make a direct comparison for only nine asset categories.
                                      7

There is also a difference in the dates to which the two sources refer. The

SRI survey was conducted in the spring of 1978 and the Federal Reserve data

shown in Table 2 refer to the end of 1977.

     The population totals for assets and liabilities implied by the survey

data are very close to Federal Reserve balance sheet totals. Total net

worth estimated from the full sample is 100.2 percent of the balance sheet

figures. This degree of accuracy is, however, fortuitous and the

comparison is more varied if we look at the estimates for individual

assets. Nevertheless, for checking accounts, savings accounts, equities,

municipal bonds, home mortgages and other liabilities, the two sets of

estimates are close. The largest discrepancies are for taxable bonds

(where the survey data are about 50 percent of the balance sheet total) and

the residual category "other assets" (where the survey data are about

two-thirds of the balance sheet figure). The first may well be due to

under-reporting (although the Federal Reserve data include holdings of

foreign bonds, which were not recorded in the SRI Survey) and the second to

a difference in the definition of "other assets" which in both sources is a

residual item. It is also interesting to note that the survey estimates of

home values are higher than the balance sheet estimates. The rapid

increase in house prices in the two year period immediately prior to the

survey is more likely to show up in survey responses than in the balance

sheet totals where the price indices for structures and land used to

compute value estimates may not reflect the rise in the price of

second-hand dwellings.

     Given the very different sources of the estimates, and the fact that

many of the Federal Reserve balance sheet totals for the household sector

are obtained as a residual, the matching between the two sets of wealth
                                         8

estimates is surprisingly close. This increases our confidence in the

value of the survey data to examine portfolio composition.



3.       Evidence on Portfolio Composition and the Life Cycle

     The figures in Table la document the variety of assets owned by

wealthy households in the US. They also demonstrate a surprising lack of

diversification by such households. Over 50 percent of the sample did not

own corporate equity either directly or through a mutual fund.5 Fewer than

10 percent of the sample exploited the tax-exempt nature of municipal

bonds. The size of average liabilities in different categories suggests

that the majority of households did not take advantage of the opportunity

of tax-deductible borrowing to purchase assets taxed at concessionary

rates.

     The extent of diversification is illustrated in Table 3 which shows

the sample and estimated population frequency distribution of the number of

assets and liabilities in household portfolios. No household in the sample

held more than 23 out of the possible 36 types of asset andl iability. The

median number of assets and liabilities owned by the sample was only eight

(six using population weights). Given the very high average wealth of the

households in our sample (almost a quarter of a million dollars), it is

surprising that households held such a small number of assets.

     There is also a clear life cycle pattern to the number of assets

owned. Figure 1 shows the average number of assets and liabilities held in

each five-year age group of the sample. There is a pronounced

"hump-shaped" profile that peaks at the age of sixty. The number of assets

owned increases rapidly in the early stages of life, reaches a plateau in

the age ranges forty through sixty and then declines rapidly in old age.
                                      9

For some assets, such as IRA and Keogh plans and home mortgages, there is a

natural life cycle in their acquisition and disposal. The pronounced

nature of the hump-shaped pattern suggests, however, that this can only be

part of the story.

     We shall try to distinguish between two competing explanations for

this apparent lack of diversification and its variation over the life

cycle. These are (i) transaction costs and (ii) incomplete information

about investment opportunities.

     In the presence of transaction costs, individuals face a trade-off

between the benefits of a particular investment, including the

diversification it offers, and the costs of the additional transaction. The

acquisition of an asset will, therefore, be justified only if the size of

the desired investment exceeds some critical minimum. Thus, individuals

will typically hold only a subset of the assets available in the market.

More importantly, the number of assets held will be an increasing function

of net worth. A hump-shaped profile for net worth could, therefore, induce

a similar pattern for the number of assets held.

     It is commonly supposed that the "hump" age profile for wealth implied

by the life cycle model has received little support from surveys of

household wealth. Lydall (1955) and Mirer (1979), for example, concluded

that there was no significant tendency for wealth to decline with age.

Among the problems with these early studies was their failure to control

for differences in permanent income. More recent studies, however, have

shown that there is some, albeit limited, decumulation of wealth after

retirement. Bernheim (1984) and Hurd (1986) for the United States, and

King and Dicks-Mireaux (1982) for Canada, all found rates of decumulation

on the order of 2-3 percent per year. Using panel data from the Retirement
                                     10

History Survey, for example, Hurd (1986) estimated that the annual rate of

decumulation of wealth excluding housing was 3.2% per year for households

where the head had retired, and 1.5% per year for wealth including the

value of housing. Although panel data have some advantages over cross-

section data they also have disadvantages. The volatility of asset prices

means that the estimated rate of decumulation is compounded with changes in

asset values resulting from unanticipated revaluations. The quality of the

survey data may also be lower.

     The evidence from our survey is summarized in Figures 2a and 2b. To

analyze the wealth-age relationship it is important to control for

differences in permanent income. As a proxy for permanent income we

constructed an estimate of normal age-adjusted annual earnings, which we

call "permanent earnings". This differs from current earnings in two ways.

First, current earnings contain a transitory component. Secondly, there is

an age-earnings profile over the life cycle. We adjust for both. With

only cross-section data we are unable to distinguish between the pure age-

earnings profile and the cohort effect. Hence we impose an estimate of the

cohort effect in our computation of permanent earnings. Details of this

and the procedure we used to estimate permanent earnings are described in

the Appendix. Figure 2a shows the median ratio of net worth to permanent

earnings in each five-year age group. There is clear evidence of

decumulation at the end of life. Figure 2b shows the same ratio when

permanent earnings are defined without any imposed cohort effect. Again

the hump-shaped profile for net worth is evident. The observation that

wealth is run down after retirement is not, therefore, sensitive to the

particular cohort adjustment used in this study. It is plausible,

therefore, that the interaction between transaction costs and the age
                                     11

profile for wealth could induce a life-cycle pattern in the number of

assets owned. The rate at which wealth is decumulated between the ages of

70 and 80 implied by the profile shown in figure 2a is 3.4% per year.

Given the quality of the survey data, this finding, together with the

similar results of Bernheim (1985) and Hurd (1986), suggest that the

conventional wisdom that wealth does not decline after retirement requires

modification. The low observed rates of decumulation contradict the

predictions of a simple life-cycle model with a nonstochastic date of

death. They are, however, consistent with the life-cycle model if the

length of life is uncertain and annuities markets are imperfect (Davies

(1980), King (1985)).

     The second factor that influences the degree of diversification is the

stock of "investment opportunities"; that is, the information that an

investor possesses about purchasing and holding assets. Conventional

models of portfolio choice assume that individuals allocate net worth among

a fixed number of available assets with a known distribution of returns.

The assumption that investors start from a fixed list of known investment

opportunities is strong. It is probable that the information possessed by

many individuals about sophisticated investment opportunities is

significantly incomplete. For such "information-intensive" assets the

probability of ownership will increase with age as information is acquired

over time.

     In contrast, if transaction costs are the major cause of incomplete

portfolios then both the probability of ownership of any given asset, and

the total number of assets owned, will be determined primarily by the level

of wealth. In section 4 we set out a simple model of the arrival of new

information about investment opportunities to demonstrate formally that the
                                        12

two explanations of the extent of diversification--transaction costs and

incomplete information- - can be tested in terms of wealth and age effects

respectively.

     To identify the effect of information on portfolio composition we

examine a subset of the financial assets identified in Table 1 for which

information would seem to be most relevant. Seven "information-intensivett

financial assets are identified, corresponding to categories 6 through 15

in Table 1. These are:

                1. Corporate equity

                     (categories 11 and 12).

                2. Municipal bonds.

                3. Corporate bonds.

                4. Savings certificates and savings bonds

                     (categories 6 and 7).

                5. Treasury bonds.

                6. Money market funds and instruments

                     (categories 8 and 9).

             7. Single-premium annuities.

     One simple way to test for lack of diversification and the possible

importance of information is to examine the portfolio composition of

households with substantial liquid assets. Table 4 examines the 729

households in our sample (12.1 percent) with "substantial liquid assets"

defined as more than $30,000 (about $55,000 at 1987 prices) in checking

accounts, savings accounts, and credit union share accounts. One in four

of these households (one in two if population weights are used) held no

equity. Three quarters held no corporate bonds and a similar proportion

held no municipal bonds (89 and 92 percent, respectively, with population
                                      13

weights).6 It would appear that such households would have benefited from

diversifying their portfolios and it is difficult to believe that

transaction costs are a sufficient explanation for their failure so to do.



 4.    A SimDle Model of Information and Asset Accumulation

      The survey presents some direct evidence on the importance of

information in determining the acquisition of assets. For each of four

different assets--stocks, stock mutual funds, bonds, bond funds--

households      owning the asset were asked "y doesn't anyone in your

household hold any [stocks, etc.]?". Table 5 shows the proportion of

households who responded "[I/We] don't know enough about it". The first

column shows the number of households who chose that response as a

percentage of the total number of households who did not own that asset.

The second column shows the number of households who chose that response as

a percentage of the total sample of 6,010 households. More than a third of

those who did not own stock or stock mutual funds said that it was because

they did not know enough about it. This figure accounts for almost one-

fifth of the sample in the case of stocks and almost thirty percent for

stock mutual funds. The numbers for bonds and bond funds are similar and

even larger in magnitude. Columns three and four present the estimated

population responses using the weights provided by SRI. Not surprisingly,

correcting for the oversampling of high-income households reveals that lack

of information is an even more important deterrent to asset accumulation

than the sample responses suggest.

      Consider a simple model of the impact of information on asset

purchases in which the arrival of new information about investment

opportunities is exogenous. Households start life with some initial stock
                                     14

of "investment opportunities" that describes the information available to

the household about the assets in which they might invest. In each

subsequent period information about new investment opportunities arrives

stochastically. The number of new investment opportunities that arrives

each period is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution. Given the

augmented stock of investment opportunities the investor may (when

transaction costs are taken into account) decide to add another asset to

his portfolio.

     The stochastic process for the arrival of new information has two

testable implications. The first is that, conditional upon wealth, the

probability that an "information-intensive" asset will be owned increases

with age. The second is that the model generates a frequency distribution

for the number of information-intensive assets held by a cross-section of

households drawn from the population. For the information arrival process

described above, the distribution of the number of assets owned by the

population is a mixture of Poisson distributions.

     To test the first implication, we estimate a probit model for the

ownership of each of the seven information-intensive assets. The maximum

likelihood estimates are shown in Table 6.   The model was estimated on the

sample of 5408 observations for which data on the age of head of household

and total net worth were recorded. The explanatory variables include the

log of age, the log of wealth and the square of the log of wealth, the

marginal tax rate, and six dummy variables representing household

characteristics. The risk aversion dummy variable is based on responses to

a question regarding the head of household's current attitude toward risk.7

The theoretical specification implies that after controlling for the effect

of wealth and other characteristics age should have a positive influence on
                                            15

the probability of ownership. In six out of the seven cases the age

coefficient is positive (the exception being Treasury bonds) and in five

cases the coefficient is significantly different from zero at the 5% level.

     The second test of the model relates to the cross-section frequency

distribution of asset ownership. Suppose that the arrival of new

investment opportunities can be described by a Poisson distribution with

parameter Pjr for investor i at age r. The data that we observe are for

the stock of assets owned rather than the purchases in earlier periods. If

the stochastic arrival process is independent across periods, then the

stock of investment opportunities at age t, 6it' is also given by a Poisson

distribution with parameter




                                 9jt
                                       =                                   (1)
                                           T1


     In   principle, the value of Pir may be a function of age if the

relevant household characteristics vary with age. Such a model could be

estimated with panel data. Because we are limited to the use of cross-

section data, however, we shall assume that the expected value of the

number of investment opportunities arriving each period varies across

households according to the specification

where Xj is a vector of household attributes determining access to

information,    the associated parameter vector, and g(r) is positive,

allowing age to influence the rate at which information arrives. We choose

the exponential form to ensure that Pir > 0, a necessary condition for a
                                               16

Poisson process. Thus, (1) becomes



                       t
                   =            Xi',9
                           g(r)e 1      =(
                                         T=1
                                               g(r)) e 1   f(t)   eX.'/3
                                                                    1      (3)



where f(.) is a monotone increasing function of age.

     The use of cross-section data means that we cannot distingush between

age and cohort effects. Some cohort effects are captured by observable

variables such as education, but the particular effect that is of most

relevance here is the change in the set of financial instruments available

to investors that has occurred over time. The classification of the seven

information-intensive assets was made partly to minimise this problem. Any

remaining cohort effect will be in the opposite direction to the

information-based age effect identified above, and so the estimated age

effect may be biassed downwards.

     The number of assets owned at age t will be determined jointly by the

number of investment opportunities and the level of transaction costs. At

low levels of wealth, individuals may, because of transaction costs, hold

only a subset of the assets about which they have received information. We

assume that the proportion of opportunities in which investors choose to

invest is denoted by p. The number of assets owned by investor i at age t

is then described by a Poisson distribution with parameter



                                             = pOit                        (4)




      The ratio p will depend upon wealth and any other attributes that

affect the influence of transaction costs on the number of assets owned.
                                                     17

For simplicity, and to ensure that p > 0, we assume p                       eZir where Z is a

vector of household characteristics relevant to transaction costs and r the

associated parameter vector. We have assumed that the rate at which new

information arrives is exogenous and hence                      represents a pure transaction

cost effect. It is possible that the intensity of search for investment

opportunities is a function of wealth. If this is the case then will

reflect also the effect of wealth on the set of investment opportunities,

This will not, however, affect the estimate of the information-based age

effect.

     The probability that a household will own n assets is given by



                                                      e1t) it
                                         Pr(n1=n) =
                                                          n!                               (5)


For a sample of H households the log likelihood is



     L =      - (A
               H

              i= 1
                     -




               H              /   +zit
          =   -(f(t)ex   it               -
                                              n(ln   f(t) +    X/3 + Z1r)   ÷ ln(n!))      (6)




      In this model, Ajt is a deterministic function of the household

characteristics X1 and                        The stochastic nature of the specification

comes from the assumption of a Poisson process for the arrival of new

information. Because the parameter of the Poisson process is a function of

household characteristics, the predicted frequency distribution is a

mixture of Poisson distributions.

    Table 7 presents estimates of this model. The first column shows the

means and standard deviations of the data. The second column shows OLS
                                     18

estimates for the simple regression model in which the dependent variable

is the natural logarithm of the number of information-intensive assets

owned.8 The third column presents the maximum likelihood estimates of the

Poisson model when the age term f(t) is approximated by eta. The model

predicts that a>O.

     In both the OLS and the Poisson specifications the age term is highly

significant even after controlling for wealth and other household

characteristics. The value of ,   reported   in column 3 of Table 6, is

significantly greater than zero, as predicted by the model (even though it

may, as noted above, be biassed downwards because of changes in the

availability of assets over time). It is also less than unity suggesting

that the rate of arrival of new information decreases with age.

     The goodness of fit of the Poisson specification is illustrated in

Figure 3 which shows the actual and predicted frequencies of the number of

assets owned by households in the sample. The fit is rather good given the

simplicity of the model.



5.   Conclusions

     The evidence presented in this paper shows that there is an

interesting life-cycle pattern to both the number and type of assets owned

by US households. We have suggested that this pattern reflects not only

the importance of transaction costs but also incomplete information about

investment opportunities. The probit estimates for the ownership of

"information-intensive" assets show that in all cases but one, the

probability of ownership increases with age, even after controlling for

changes in wealth, marginal tax rate, and household characteristics. A

simple Poisson process for the arrival of new information seems to fit the
                                     19

data surprisingly well. Information about investment opportunities is

necessary for the construction of the optimal portfolio and arrives over

time. Hence age is an important determinant of portfolio composition. The

concept of a stock of investment opportunities, which is augmented by the

stochastic arrival of new information, is consistent with the existence of

a nontrivial group of "noise traders" in the market.

                                       APPENDIX




     To examine the life-cycle profile of the ratio of net worth to

"permanent earnings" for households in the sample, we require estimates of

the permanent earnings for each household in the sample. We define

permanent earnings as normal age-adjusted annual earnings. Permanent

earnings, Y1, are assumed to be described by the following model:



                            in Y = Wj& + si -     c(Ai)                  (Al)




where Wj is a vector of observable variables, such as occupation,

education, religion, and race, for individual i, and S the associated

parameter vector. The second term, s, represents unobservable

characteristics such as motivation, aptitude, and luck, and, by

construction, has zero mean for the population and variance a. The third

term, c(A), is a cohort effect that represents factors such as capital

accumulation and technical progress which imply that for a given set of

characteristics W, younger generations have higher earnings than their

elders.

     Current earnings different from permanent earnings because (1) there

is a transitory component to earnings and (2) earnings vary systematically

over the life cycle (the age-earnings profile). Current earnings for year

t, Ejt, are given by



                       in Eit =   in   Y + h(At - A*) + ujt              (A2)
                                              21

where h(.) represents the age-earnings profile (taken to be constant across

the population) with A* some standard age with respect to which permanent

earnings are defined. The transitory component, Ult, is assumed to be

uncorrelated with sj, and to have zero mean and variance uj.

     From (Al) and (A2), we derive the earnings equation



                      ln Ejt = WjS + g(A) + Si + Ujt                           (A3)




where g(A) =   h(At   -
                          A*)   -
                                    c(Ajt).   Given our previous assumptions, the

error term s + ujt has mean zero and variance            + o.
     Least squares estimation of (A3) will yield consistent estimates of &

and g(.), although if the uit are correlated across households, the

estimates will be inefficient. It is clear that the cohort effect and the

age-earnings profile cannot be separately identified from estimation of

g(.). We therefore follow King and Dicks-Mireaux (1982), who used data

from outside the sample to impose a cohort effect. Our estimate of the

cohort effect is described below. We may construct an estimate of

permanent earnings for each individual in the sample, using the estimates

of S and g(.), provided that we can impute a value for sj, the unobservable

individual-specific effect. From the residuals of (A3), we have an

estimate of (Si + Ujt). The minimum variance estimator of 5i given (i +

Ult) is



                                       = a(Si + Ujt)                           (A4)
                                         22

where


                                         a2S
                                                                               (A5)
                                         +


     Hence the estimate of permanent income is



                           in Y =   Wj   -        +                         (A6)



where, from (A4), j is the product of a and the residual from the earnings

equation. Thus, given values for         and a?j, the King and Dicks-Mireaux

procedure yields estimates of permanent earnings for each individual in the

sample.

     With longitudinal data, it would be possible to obtain estimates of

and ci by estimating a fixed-effects model. Since our data come from a

single cross section, however, we must assume a value for a. The magnitude

of a depends upon the variables included in W; the more relevant variables

that are included, the smaller will be the residual variance. From a

survey of longitudinal studies of earnings, King and Dicks-Mireaux

concluded that a reasonable value for a, given the variables available to

them, was 0.5. Since our data is comparable in scope to theirs, we adopt

the same value.

        We estimated separate earnings equations (A3) for male and female

earners.      In an attempt to limit the sample to those in full-time work, we

excluded individuals whose reported annual earnings were less than $4,000.

We corrected for the resulting sample selection bias using the two stage

procedure suggested by Heckman (1976, 1979). This procedure yields

consistent estimates of the parameters (provided g(.) is linear in
                                       23

parameters). The results of both the first-stage probits and the second-

stage OLS estimates of the earnings equations are available on request.

       To construct the estimate of permanent earnings, we take a standard

age of 45. In estimating the cohort effect, we follow King and Dicks-

Mireaux in assuming that one-half the growth rate of real earnings resulted

from improvements in eduction, changes in occupational structure, and other

factors represented by the explanatory variables in the earnings equation,

and the other half resulted from capital accumulation and technical

progress. The latter is the cohort effect. Data on growth rates in

earnings and consumer prices in the U.S. indicate that between 1929 and

1978 the annual growth rate of real earnings was l.8%. We therefore take

the annual cohort effect on earnings to be 0.9%.

       The final estimate for permanent earnings is given by (A6), with =

0.5;   that is, natural logarithm of permanent earnings equals the age-

adjusted predicted value of the log of earnings based on the observable

variables, plus one-half the estimated residual from the earnings equation.

For those individuals omitted from the estimation because of low earnings,

permanent earnings was predicted using the estimates of (A6) and taking i
= 0.   Household permanent earnings is simply the sum of the estimates for

husbands and wives.

grateful to the following for helpful comments and discussion, Daniel
Feenberg, John Flemming, James Poterba, and Lawrence Summers.

(1984). On the second question see Atkinson (1971), Atkinson and Harrison

1984), Lydall (1955), Mirer (1979), Shorrocks (1975), and White (1978).


2. Feldstein (1976) also used the 1962 FRB Survey and estimated portfolio
composition equations that included dummy variables for each age group,
but since the study focused on the effects of tax rates the age
coefficients were not reported in the paper.


3. The survey was made available for academic research through the
auspices of the National Bureau of Economic Research.


4. More expensive durables such as boats, planes, and works of art are
included.


5. The nature of indirect ownership through contractual savings is
unclear; to the extent that the returns on such schemes do not reflect the
risks of the fund (as with defined benefit pension plans), there is no
genuine indirect equity stake.


6. Even among those households with more than $50,000 (about $90,000 at
1987 prices) in liquid assets, more than two-thirds held no municipal
bonds, three quarters held no corporate bonds, and one in five held no
equity (86, 90, and 43 percent, respectively, when population weights are
used).


7. The "Risk aversion" dunmiy takes the value one if the head of household
chose either "I wish to reduce financial risks to the barest minimum" or
"I am willing to take a small amount of financial risk hoping to realize a
fair return on my investment" and takes the value zero if the response
chosen was either "I am willing to take moderate financial risks hoping to
achieve about average financial gains for investments" or "I prefer to
take substantial financial risks hoping to realize substantial financial
gains from investments'T.

8. It is possible that the number of information-intensive assets owned is
zero. In this case we define the dependent variable to be zero and add a
dummy variable that takes the value unity when the number of such assets is
                                     25

zero to the set of regressors. For further discussion of the analysis of
count data see Hausman et al. (1984).

Source: Own computations based on SRI survey.
Notes: 1. This table is based on the responses to four questions in
        the attitude section of the survey. The questions were: "Why
        doesn't anyone in your household hold any stocks (stock mutual
        funds, bonds, bond funds)?". The figures presented above
        reflect the number of households who chose response (1):
        "Don't know enough about it".
        2. Column one is derived by dividing the number of households
        who chose response (1) by the number of households who
        responded to the question.
        3. Column two is derived using the same numerator and the total
        number of households in the survey (6,010) in the denominator.
        4. Columns three and four present estimated population
        responses using weights supplied by SRI.
