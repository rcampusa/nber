                                          ABSTRACT

This study uses data from Academic Analytics to examine gender differences in promotion to
associate professor in economics. We found that women in economics were 15% less likely to be
promoted to associate professor after controlling for cumulative publications, citations, grants and
grant dollars. In contrast, we found no significant gender differences in promotion in other fields
including biomedical science, physical science, political science, mathematics and statistics, and
engineering. We separated the sample by the research intensity of institutions and found
suggestive evidence that these results were being driven by less research-intensive institutions.

                 Women in Academic Economics: Have We Made Progress?


The paucity of women in tenured ranks of economics in the US has led to concern that there may

be inequities in the tenure process. The AEA's Committee on the Status of Women in the

Economics Profession (CSWEP) annually compares the percent female of synthetic cohorts as

their careers progress. In 2019 they concluded, "The female share of associate professors is

consistently about 5% lower than the share who were assistant professors seven years earlier."

(CSWEP 2020). In other words, women are less likely than men to be tenured. We ourselves

have contributed to the literature on tenure in economics at several points in the last decades

(Kahn 1993, Ginther and Kahn 2004, Ginther and Kahn 2014), primarily using the National

Science Foundation's longitudinal Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) that follows STEM

PhDs post-PhD. Although the SDR sample of economists was small, we found significant gender

differences in promotion to tenure, first among PhD recipients 1971-­1980 and continuing

through PhD recipients 1981­2003. This work was limited in its ability to control for

productivity measures since the SDR had only self-reported numbers of publications and only in

some survey waves (the last being 2008).

       The current study turns to a different source of information about academic careers ­ the

research firm Academic Analytics ­ to study recent gender differences in promotion in

economics. We find that women in economics have almost achieved parity in promotion to

associate professor in research-intensive institutions, but that significant gaps remain at

institutions that are less research focused.

       Other researchers have also examined gender differences in promotion in economics.

Heather Sarsons (2017) collected data on economists who went up for tenure between 1985 and

2014 at the 30 top economics departments, including productivity variables. In her sample,



                                                      1
women were 69% as likely as men to have received tenure (6­8 years post-PhD, p=0.001) and

those who did took half of a year longer to receive it (p=0.012). A major reason for these

differences were that women who coauthored with men received practically no credit for those

papers, and less than half as much credit for papers coauthored jointly with men and women.

Antecol et al. (2018) measured the gender gap in receiving tenure in a top 50 economics

department (for hires 1980­2005) focusing the effect of a stop-the-tenure-clock policies. Their

data show the tenure gender gap was approximately 7 percentage points at its narrowest in 1995

(out of an average 25% tenure rate), but grew substantially since then, partially due to gender-

neutral stop-the-clock policies.

       So why measure the gender difference in promotion in economics once again? First,

because the articles on promotion are about earlier PhD cohorts, and there might have been

substantial change since then. Second, the more recent studies described above are limited to

economists at top schools, yet only 8.5% of tenure-track assistant economists with PhDs 2014­

2013 were at universities rated by Carnegie as "very high research" (calculated from the SDR).

Third, recent research has shown that increased mentoring has increased women's productivity

and likelihood of being promoted (Ginther et al. 2020).



       I.       Data and Methods

       We use data collected by Academic Analytics, a company that provides data and analysis

to higher education institutions including publications, grants, citations and awards to benchmark

their faculty's productivity. Our sample includes annual data of all faculty provided by 323

higher education institutions in the US, including 131 institutions listed by the Carnegie

Classification of Higher Education Institutions as "Research Very High" and 114 institutions




                                                     2
classified as "Research High." We identified faculty who received PhDs from 2005-2011, were

observed as tenure-track assistant professors during that period and appeared in three or more

separate years of Academic Analytics data. We follow individuals across universities that were

part of the Academic Analytics universe.

         There were 798 assistant professor faculty members in economics departments (including

agricultural economics but excluding economists in business schools not part of an economics

department). We followed faculty who entered the sample starting in 2009 and ending in 2018,

or whenever they left the Academic Analytics sample. The data set included information on each

faculty member's journal publications each year from 2004­2018 and total citations to each

article accrued by 2018. We allocated each publication's citations to the years through 2018

based on the typical citation pattern over time since publication in the field (using this data set).

We also observed federal research grants and the dollar amounts of those grants 2004­2018 (or

whenever the person permanently exited the Academic Analytics sample. 1)

         We estimated a Cox proportional hazard model of the time between PhD and either

promotion to associate professor 2 or being right censored, as a function of gender, PhD degree

year; whether the university was public or private; whether the university was categorized by

Carnegie as "Very High Research" (669 people), or as "High Research" (122 people) or other

Carnegie categories (7 people); dummy variables for department (general economics: 655

people; agricultural economics: 117 people; or applied economics: 26 people) and time-varying

variables for the cumulative number of publications, of citations, of grants received, and the

  Ideally, we would observe when a person receives tenure. However, Academic Analytics only has verified tenure
status for a subsample of individuals. As a result, we use promotion to associate professor as a proxy for promotion
to tenure.

cumulative amount of grant dollars received from 2004 until that date. We use an inverse

hyperbolic sine (IHS) transformation of productivity numbers (given the presence of many zero

values).

           II.      Results

           Hazard ratios are shown in Table 1. Column 1 includes a female dummy only and shows

women were 18.5% (p<0.03) less likely to be promoted to associate professor. Controlling for

institution type (public/private, Carnegie) in column 2 does not narrow the gender difference.

           To compare, we estimated a similar regression for approximately the same period (survey

years 2006­2017, PhD years 2004­2013) using the NSF's SDR, including anyone observed as a

tenure-track assistant professor and calculating the time from PhD to when last observed. The

sample included only 399 economists, some seen only once. This is a smaller, less longitudinal

sample than we had used in previous studies because of a 2015 major restructuring of the SDR.

Results controlling for the same institutional variables as column 2 are in column 3, with a larger

although somewhat less significant gender difference in promotion to tenure (hazard ratio 0.617,

p=0.071). Ginther and Kahn (2014) for 1981­2003 PhD cohorts with basic covariates found a

larger hazard ratio on female of 0.788.

           The Academic Analytics data allow us to control for productivity. Adding productivity

measures to the model (column 4) somewhat narrows the female's disadvantage in tenure receipt

to 15% and lowers its significance (p-value= 0.08.) Figure 1 illustrates the predicted survival

function for men and women controlling for all covariates. 3 The gap between genders is obvious

by 5 years from PhD and continues to be substantial at least through 12 years from PhD.

    Figure was estimated as a log-logistic model for a smoothed survival curve and graphed at the covariates' means.


                                                                4
The productivity measures that were important in this equation were numbers of publications and

number of grants. Very high and high-research universities were much more likely than lesser

ones to award tenure, but that is relative to a very small sample in other types of universities.

       Some of the previous studies were limited to the best research universities. We therefore

separately estimated the hazard analysis for two samples: those who entered academia into

"Research Very High" institutions and those that did not. The results are in the last two columns

of Table 1. The majority of the observations were in the Very High Research universities (which

is primarily informative about the clients interested in Academic Analytics services). We were

stunned by the results. The gender tenure gap was small and insignificant in very high research

institutions. However, in less research-intensive universities it was huge, with women's rate of

receiving tenure (with all controls) 46% lower than men's (p=0.055). Although the difference

between the universities does not attain significance at standard levels, the huge point estimate of

the tenure penalty at these less research-based universities and colleges is remarkable.

       Previous studies of gender differences in tenure and promotion compared economics to

other science and social science fields (Ginther and Kahn 2004, 2014; Ceci et al. 2014; Sarsons

2017; Lundberg and Stearns 2019). In these, economics fared quite poorly. Table 2 compares the

economics results including productivity and institutional variables (Column 4 in Table 1) to

other fields, including fields used in our 2004 study. In the top panel of Table 2, economics has

the largest gender promotion gap after controlling for institution and productivity characteristics

and is the only field whose difference was even marginally significant (p=0.08). In results not

shown, both political science and biomedical science had statistically significant gender

promotion gaps, but these differences are fully explained by controls for publications, citations,

and grants that each significantly increase the likelihood of promotion to associate professor.




                                                      5
        The next two panels of Table 2 divide the sample into Research Very High and Research

Less-Intensive. The middle panel of Table 2 indicates no significant gender differences in any

field in promotion at Research Very High institutions. The bottom panel shows that economics is

the only field with a significant promotion gap at Research Less-Intensive Institutions.

        III.    Conclusions

        We can only guess at why less research-intensive colleges and universities are so

different. Could it be that in less-research-oriented institutions, the criteria for tenure are less

clear, since research is less important? Yet the coefficient on cumulative publications in the

economics models was practically identical in Research Very High (1.58, p<0.001) and Research

Less-Intensive (1.51, p<0.04), which belies that conjecture. Our results parallel those found in

the CeMENT mentoring experiment (Ginther et al. 2020). There, women who received the

mentoring treatment were significantly more likely to be promoted to tenure at top 50 economics

departments but significantly less likely to receive tenure at unranked economics departments.

Our results for Research Very High institutions may differ from previous studies because other

researchers measure promotion at a particular university, and we measure promotion to associate

even if people move universities within the universe of Academic Analytics.

        In an atmosphere where success is difficult to assess, bias may be more likely to prevail.

In contrast, the academic hiring literature has found that for positions where the criteria and

qualifications are clear ­ as in an assistant professor hiring experiment by Williams and Ceci

(2015) ­ there is actually a preference for hiring women relative to men. Nevertheless, the lack

of clear criteria in lower-research universities cannot explain why the stark difference between

very high research institutions and others appears only in the field of economics. Sarsons (2017)

argues that the alphabetical ordering of author's names ­ which makes it impossible to know




                                                       6
each individuals' contributions ­ distinguish the tenure process in economics from most other

science and social science fields. She studied only highly-rated research institutions. Is this

imperfect information about people's individual contributions even more important in less-

research-intensive institutions, and if so, why? Teaching may be a more important criteria in

less-research oriented universities, and there is some evidence of gender bias in student

evaluations (Buser, Hayter, and Marshall 2019). Also, women may be more likely to engage in

low-promotable tasks (Babcock, Recalde and Vesterlund 2017). Yet once again, it is unexplained

why this pattern does not extend to other fields.

       We have no answers. We hope these findings open new avenues for research and new

conversations about how to make promotion decisions more equitable in economics in all

academic institutions.
