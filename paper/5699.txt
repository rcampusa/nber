        The U.S. Treasury’s     $20 billion loan to Mexico in January 1995 from the Exchange

Stabilization Fund (ESF) brought to public notice the fund that had functioned in obscurity since its

authorization by the Gold Reserve Act of January 31, 1934. The design of the ESF, as set forth in

the statute, contributed to its obscurity. Its stated mission was to stabilize the exchange value of the

dollar, but it has also assumed a role that had no mandate, that of lender to favored countries. ESF’S

intervention    activities and the Federal Reserve’s warehousing of ESF foreign currency assets are

questionable.    A statistical profile of the ESF accounts for the growth of its working balance from

$200 million in 1934 to $42.6 billion in assets in 1995.

From    Obscurity        to Notoriety:          A Biography          of the Exchange        Stabilization           Fund




MA      J. SCHWARTZ




         The     Exchange       Stabilization          Fund    (ESF),       an institution        that has      been       in

operation        since    shortly       after    it was       established       by the Gold        Reserve      Act       of

January     31, 1934,         was    remarkably        little       known    before    January      1995,   when      the

U.S.    Treasury        loaned      Mexico     $20 billion          from    the ESF as part         of a rescue

package.        What   made     the loan notorious             was    that    it did not     require

Congressional           authorization          but   could     be made       at the discretion         of the

Secretary        of the Treasury,             with   the approval           of the President.         In February

1996,     the Treasury          Department       announced          that    it was    suspending      payment        of

interest        on government          securities       in the ESF’S          portfolio     in order        to create

additional        borrowing         power     for the government             under     the debt     ceiling     that

Congress        was    refusing      to raise.       These     actions       brought     the fund     to public

notice     after       it had     remained      so long       in obscurity.

          The    fund began         operations        as of April          27, 1934,     financed     by $2 billion

of the $2.8 billion              paper      profit     that    the government           realized     from

devaluation,           that    is, from       raising    the price          of gold     to $35 an ounce         from

$20.67.     This       sum was      deposited        to its account          with    the Treasurer      of the United

States     (Treasury          AR 1935,       Exhibit    40, p. 265).          The    fund was      authorized        to deal

in gold     and foreign           exchange      in order       to stabilize          the exchange      value        of the

dollar,     to invest          any portion       of the fund not             currently     required     for

stabilization           purposes       in direct       obligations          of the United        States,      and    to add

any earnings           from    sales    and    interest       on its investments           to the sum         available

for its use.1

        Of the $2 billion           set     aside      for ESF capital,        only    $200 million           was made

available     for its working            fund.    The    $1.8 billion       was    shown     in the gold        asset

and   liability       statement     of the Treasurer             of the United        States     as gold       credited

to the ESF, The residual             $200 million          was    presumably       initially       deposited         in a

special     account      at the New       York    Federal       ReseNe     Bank,   but by June         1934     the ESF

had   reduced     the deposit       by     investing       $38 million      in U.S.       Treasury     bonds,        $20

❑illion     in gold      (the bulk       held    at the U.S.       Assay    Office),       and    $30 million         in

silver.

        The ESF was        established          at a time when       the dollar        was   pegged      to the

price   of gold but not           to the exchange          value    of other       currencies.        It was

expected      to function        in just     such      an international        monetary       system.     The

expectation,       however,       proved     false,      and    the ESF had       to adapt       to the changing

international         monetary     system       over    the six decades        that    followed,

        The    rest     of the paper        is organized         as follows.       In section        1 I examine

the design       of the ESF       as set     forth      in the statute,        in particular,           the

provisions       that    contributed        to its obscurity.            In section       2 I describe         the

mission     of the ESF as defined               in the statute       and as the mission              developed        in

the unexpected          circumstances        in which       it operated.       I conclude         the section         with

a statistical         profile     of the ESF        that    reflects      the missions        it serves.        In

section     3 I assess      the    influence        of the ESF      in a broader          context     than     its role

in the 1995 Mexican             bailout.

1. DESIGN       OF THE    ESF

          The act creating         the ESF excluded             it from the congressional

appropriation         process     once     its initial         capitalization       was    in place.      It was

intended      to be     self-financing,          and was not       required       to seek     annual
                                                              5

congressional        funding      for    its operations,z             me     self-financing          arrangement

contributed       to the secrecy          of ESF actions,            since    the fund       did not have              to

justify     its expenditures            during    annual      appeals       to Congress          for appropriations.

The ESF has       increased       the    $200 million         working      balance      it started         with        in 1934

to $42 billion          in June     1995.3       The   statistical         profile      that     I present            at a

later    point    shows     how   the    ESF    achieved      this increase,

         The    fund was     conceived         to operate         in secrecy     under      the exclusive              control

of the Secretary           of the Treasury,            with   the approval          of the President,                 “whose

decisions       shall    be final       and not    subject         to review     by any other            officer        of the

United     States”       (PL 87-73,      sec.    10(b)).      The    intention       was    to cloak       foreign

exchange       market     intervention.         However,      the Secretary          of the Treasury              was

willing     to reveal       information         on stabilization            loans    to favored          countries           that

the ESF negotiated           -- loans      that had        no mandate         in the statute         yet       essentially

created     a foreign       affairs      role    for the Treasury.

         The    secrecy     promoted      two objectives.            One was     to conceal         from        the public

and Congress        the exchange         rates    at which         foreign     currencies         were    bought        and

sold,    particularly        if they      involved       losses.      A second       objective       was        to permit

the Treasury,        if it so desired,            to conceal         information        about      any other

operations       the ESF might          undertake,4       The     ESF in any event           could       base     the

secrecy     of its operations            on the British            Exchange     Equalisation         Account           (EEA),

formally       initiated     July    1, 1932,      It was         described     as “an anonymous                and    secret

body    whose    actions     are not      open    to continuous            scrutiny     and criticism”                (Hall

1935,    p. 81), The House           of Commons         did not know          and could      not be       told        what    the

EEA was     doing       (Drummond     1981,     p, 188).      One    feature     of the model            was     not,

however,       copied.     To operate        the EEA,      Parliament         appropriated         175 million

pounds     in Treasury       bills,      an amount       that      in later     years      was    sizably        increased
                                                             6

(Sayers    1976,       II, p. 427,       pp.   487-88).5

         Suspicion        of the purpose          of the EEA was          a motive    for     the establishment

of the ESF. U.S.           officials       believed     that      the EEA was       used    to depreciate         the

pound,    not to smooth           fluctuations        in its exchange            rates,    its official         purpose

(Drummond       1981,    p. 195).       Each   fund would         have    liked    to know    what     the other’s

intentions       and actions        were.

         The    secrecy     in which       both     the ESF and the EEA were               designed        to operate

was    subsequently        modified.       A 1977     amendment         to the Gold       Reserve     Act    (31U.S.C.5

5302(b))       provided     that    an ESF     loan    or credit         to a foreign       entity     or government

for more       than    6 months     in any      12-month     period       required    the President           to give

Congress       “a written        statement     that    unique      or emergency       circumstances           require

the loan or credit              for more     than    6 months. “ A 1978           amendment     (31 U.S.C.S        5302

(c)(1)    provided        for a monthly        statement         to the House       and    Senate     Banking

Committees       by    the Treasury         “on all agreements            made    or renewed,        all

transactions          occurring     during      the month,        and all projected           liabilities”        of the

ESF.

         No change        has    occurred      in the status        of the Secretary’s              decisions     as

final,     and not      subject     to review.        In testimony         before    the House        Banking

Committee       in 1990,        however,     a Treasury      official       indicated       that     the department

would    be amenable        to review        by Congress         of this    “veil    of the greatest            secrecy”

(Mulford,       Hearings        1990,   p. 62).

         The ESF’S        administrative          expenses       have    been    subject    to the budget

process     since      1979.     In addition,        the ESF      is audited       annually,       with     the report

originally       submitted        to the President,          not    to Congress.          Later,     Section     $5302

(c) provided          that Congress         should    also   receive       reports    on the ESF’S

operations      ,
                                                                 7

         The response           of the Republican            Congress        to the President’s              authorization

of the ESF       grant     of $20 billion           in medium-term             loans      to Mexico     in January          1995

less    any outstanding           short-term        loans       and    securities         guarantees        was    to pass

the Mexican       Debt     Disclosure        Act    of April          5, 1995.      It directed        the

administration           to provide        a broad       range       of docments,          some of them           classified,

about    the bailout,           before     Mexico       could    obtain      more     money    from    the ESF.

         Although        Congress      has    required       the President            to give    it information

about    ESF    transactions,          the constitutionality                 of the ESF has not been

challenged.       The     ESF    in its original            design      as a creature          of the Executive

Branch,     inunune to legislative                oversight,          breaches      the separation           of powers.          It

is hard     to believe          that   a fund with          similar      powers       would   win     legislative

approval       currently.        In 1934,      of course,            New Deal     legislation         by and       large    was

initiated       by the administration,                  Congress       rubber-stamping          what    was       put before

it. Ordinary        citizens       have      no standing         to mount        a challenge        to the

constitutionality           of the ESF,           and    sixty       years    after    its creation,          it is

unlikely       to happen.

2. MISSION       OF THE     ESF

A. Foreign Exchange Market Intervention

         The    statute     authorized         the ESF to deal               in golde and       foreign      exchange.        To

a limited       extent     it was        involved       in such       transactions         during     the    1930s,    but       it

was    not until     1961 that           it became       active       in the     foreign      exchange       market.       The

reason     was that,       except        during     its initial         years,      the    international           monetary

system     in which       the ESF existed           did     not conform          to the expectations               of the

de~igners       of the     agency.

          The record       of ESF        foreign     exchange         market     intervention         thus    falls     into

two periods:        the period           before     1962,    when      little     opportunity         for intervention
                                                              8

arose,    and the period          that     followed,         when    the ESF enlisted           the Federal             Reserve

to join     it in intervening            in the       foreign       exchange     market.       I begin       by

summarizing       the    few highlights           of the      first     period.

Pre-1962 Intervention. The ESF dealt                         in foreign        exchange       only    prior       to World

War    II. A statement       by Treasury             Secretary       Morgenthau       on February           11,    1935,

apparently       alluded    to the       ESF’S       first    and only       foreign     exchange       purchaae          until

1936    -- 9terling       amounting        to $21,000:         “When we saw that              the external          value       of

the    dollar    was    rapidly       going    out    of control,          we put the        stabilization          fund       to

work    on a moment’s       notice,        with      the   result     that     for the paat          four    weeks       we

have    successfully       managed       the value         of the dollar          in terms      of foreign

currencies.       The country          can go about          its business        with     assurance         that    we are

prepared       to manage    the external             value    of the dollar           as long    as it may          be

necessary”       (Treasury       AR    1935,    Exhibit       40, p. 235).

         The decline       in buying          ratea    for the pound           from November          1934    through

March    1935 apparently           led Morgenthau            to believe        that    the    British       were

deliberately       depreciating          the pound.          Why    he concluded        that    he had

“successfully          managed    the value          of the    dollar”       is not obvious           since       the    pound

did not     strengthen      for six weeks             following       hia    self-congratulatory              statement.

Another     example      of Horgenthau’s             readineaa       to believe        that    exchange       rate

movements       were    designed       to be destabilizing              when    in fact they          were    routine

occurred       in September        1936.      The Rus9ians          then    offered     to sell       1 million          pounds

which     the ESF bought          on the      Treaaury’a       off-hand        assumption       that    the       sale    wag

intended       to drive    down       the pound,       a result       that     ita purchage          thwarted.          That

very    day the Treasury           changed      ita mind        about      the Russian        motive     (Paria         1938,

p. 31).

         The    secrecy    of ESF       operations         was breached         in June       1935,    when       the    franc
                                                              9

waa    under    attack    and the president           of the        French       central       bank    publicly      thanked

Morgenthau       for the ESF purchase              of francs,        much       to Morgenthau’s           embarrassment

(Paris     1938,    p. 31).

Tripartite Agreement of 1936. In September                           1936       the U.S.,       U.K.,     and French

governments        simultaneously          issued    declarations              accepting       a devaluation         of the

French    franc     and agreeing          to use appropriate              available        resources         to avoid

disturbance        of international          exchanges        resulting          from the       readjustment.         The

appropriate        available       resources       were    those     of their          exchange       equalization

funds,    the    French     having    used more        than       half    of the devaluation              capital     gain

to establish        a newly     created      stabilization           fund.       The    three     governments        agreed

to guarantee        exchange       rates    for 24 hours           at a time,          authorities        of the

stabilization        funds     announcing      each       morning        the    price    at which       they    would

convert     into gold       at the end of the day                 on a reciprocal             basis    the    foreign

currency       balances     the others       had acquired.           The       U.S. , which       had previously           sold

gold    at $35 an ounce,           plus    handling       charges,        only    to gold-standard             countries,

announced       it would     sell gold       to stabilization              funds.       The    arrangement

eliminated       exchange      risk   for the       authorities           while    preserving          exchange-rate

flexibility.        Belgium,       the Netherlands,           and Switzerland              were    soon      added   to the

nations     complying       with    the Tripartite           Agreement          and eligible          to buy gold       from

the United       States.

         By World     War    II the ESF had           sold    off modest          amounts       of sterling,         francs,

and belgas       it had     acquired       by participating              in the Tripartite             Agreement.

During     the war the ESF held             Swiss     francs       and balances          in foreign          currencies      at

depositories        abroad.     It made      the    Swiss     francs       “available          for governmental            and

humanitarian        purposes, ” according             to the       Treasury’s          statement        (Treasury     AR

1945,    p. 95).
                                                               10


Post-Bretton Woods Change in ESF. As early                                as 1943 the Treasury              Department

tentatively       proposed        the establishment             of an international                 stabilization         fund

poetwar     to which       all United          Nations     members         would    belong       -- the original          model

of the    IMF, of which           Harry    Dexter       White       was    the designer          (Treasury       AR    1943,    p.

116;    1944,    pp. 96-7;        1945,    pp.    95-6).7

         The U.S.       Bretton        Woods    Agreement       Act       (PL 171-79)          of July    31, 1945,       made

a change       with    long-term        effects    on ESF operations.                   That    change    was    the

provision       in Sec.     7 that       amended       the Gold       Reserve       Act .S The      amendment         directed

the    Secretary       of the Treasury           to use       $1.8 billion          of the ESF          capital       (shown    on

the balance        sheet    as cash       in the       form    of gold       held       by the Treasurer          of the

United    States)       to pay part        of the        $2,750      million       U.S.    subscription          to the    IMF.

         By June       1946,     the    United    States       had paid        $275,000         of its subscription

(Treasury       AR 1946,       p. 83).     It completed             payment       of its subscription             on

February       26, 1947,       in the     form of 5687.5             million       in gold,        $280.5    million      in

cash,    the    remaining        $1,782    million        in nonnegotiable               noninterest-bearing             notes,

payable     on demand       in dollars          when     needed      by the       IMF    (Treasury       AR 1947,       p. 48).

         From    1946 until        1961 the       ESF held          no foreign          exchange     of the

industrialized          countries.        A role       for an exchange             stabilization          fund would       seem

to have been          obviated     once    the     IMF was      in place          to manage       exchange       ratea,    but

the ESF regarded           the    IMF as needing           its support.

Balance-of-Payments              Concerns. A deterioration                    in the U.S.          balance      of payments,

as measured        by outflows          of gold    and dollars             to countries          in surplus,          aroused

the concern        of the Kennedy          administration             when     it took         office    in January       1961.

The    10SS of gold        to foreigners           in that month            was    seen    as an expression             of a

lack of confidence             in the     administration’s                commitment       to a dollar          convertible

into gold       at a fixed price.              The twin       goals       became    to eliminate          the balance-of-
                                                            11

payments     deficit       and to check          speculation       against      the dollar.         To achieve        the

second     goal    the Treasury        wanted       to be in the same position                as other        countries

that    influenced        the exchange          value    of their     currencies.          That    required

reaourcee       to buy     and sell other           currencies       or,    in official       parlance,        ealea       and

purchaaes       of dollars.

         To that       end the ESF began            to operate       directly       in the    foreign       exchange

market.     By June       1961    it had bought          spot    $25.4 million        sterling,       $20.1       million

D-marks,     and $65 million           Swiss      francs    to counter        threats       againgt    the dollar.

         In March        1961,    after     revaluations         of the D-mark        and the Dutch          guilder,

the ESF made        forward       gales     of D-marks      to drive        down    the    forward    premium       on the

mark     (discount       on the dollar).          The Treasury’s           forward    mark    commitments          were

liquidated        by early       December;       it used    marks     it had acquired             in April     1961    from

a German     debt      repayment     to the       United    States     to settle          in part    forward

contracts       that     were    maturing       in the    fall of 1961.

         There     were    similar     forward       operations       by the Treasury             in Swiss     francs

and Dutch       guilders        to bring     down    the premium       on these       currencies.          A9 a

responge     to the rise          in the exchange          value    of the     Italian       lira in 1961          to its

upper    limit     against       the dollar,        the Treasury       took    over       forward    lire contracts

from the     Italian       foreign    exchange          office    and drew     on a $150 million             line     of

credit    in lire        it obtained       by    isguing    three-month        certificates          of indebtedness

to support        spot    and    forward     operations         in lire.     As a result          dollar

accumulating           in Italy     were     lessened.

         Even     these    limited    operations          strained     the resources          of the ESF.          In June

1961    it had     $200 million       capital       plus    $136 million           in net earnings          accumulated

over    its 27-year        life.    Average       annual    net earnings           approximated       $5 million,

from    income     on gold       bullion     sales,      gold    and exchange        transactions,         and
                                                            12

interest     on its government             securities       portfolio.          To finance       its foreign

exchange     purchases         of roughly     $100 million          in 1961, the ESF             had reduced        its

account     at the      Federal    Reserve     Bank     of New York         by $91 million           and    sold U.S.

government       securities.

         The Treasury’s          immediate     aim waa       to find ways          to supplement           ESF    foreign         ~

currency     balances.9        It did ao first        by persuading              the G-10     countries      to create

a facility       that    would    expand     the    IMF’s    ability       to lend.       The    IHF held        only

about    $1.5 billion          in currencies        other    than       dollars.     The new       facility,

established        in December      1961,     was    the General          Arrangements          to Borrow        (GAB) ,

which    provided       the    IMF with     a $6 billion          line of credit          from     central       banks       in

surplus     to assist         countries     in deficit,          in particular,          the United        States.       The

U.S.    quota    in the       IMF was nearly        $6 billion,          so it could        not draw       enough       to

meet    its reserve       needs;    the GAB was         intended         to serve       as a supplementary

source     of liquidity         for the United        Stateg.       The    IMF    would     sell    to the United

States     for dollars         foreign     convertible       currencies          borrowed       from other

countries.       These    currencies        would    enable       the United       States       to buy up dollars

offered     in the market         and to redeem         dollars         foreign    central       banks     did not want

to hold,     thus    maintaining          U.S. monetary          gold    reserves.

         The Treasury          next persuaded        the    Federal       Reserve       to serve     as its partner

in exchange        market      intervention.        So begins       the    second       period     of ESF

intervention        operations.

The Federal Reserve as ESF Partner. The Federal                             Open     Market      Committee        (FOMC)

authorized       open    market    transactions         in foreign         currencies        for the account             of

the    Federal     Reserve      System     on February       13,    1962.       Before    that     date    the Federal

Reserve     Bank    of New York       served       as the    agent       only    of the ESF        in executing          its

limited     foreign      currency     transactions.          Since       that    date    it has served           both    the

ESF and the Federal           Reserve       System.       In support        of its decision        to engage            in

intervention       operations,        the    FOMC       cited    “the need to supplement              the     relatively

small    resources     which      the Treasury           Stabilization        Fund had available              and had

been    using    to defend     the dollar          from    speculative        attack     in the    foreign

exchange    markets     since      1961”     (Board       AR 1962,       p. 11).

         Since    this paper       is a gtudy           of the ESF, I ghall           refer     to the      Federal

Re8erve’9       operations     only      in relation        to the conduct           of the ESF.        The    first

imperative       for the     Federal       Reserve,       once    it determined        that     it had      the     legal

authority       to intervene,        was    to acquire          foreign     currencies     for itg       future

operations.       It did     so by purchasing             from the ESF        in 1962 dollar          equivalent             of

$32 million       in D-marks,        and of one-half             million     dollars     each    in Swiss         francs,

Dutch    guilders,     and    Italian       lire    to open       accounts     at the central           banks       that

issued    these    currencies.

          This    initial     Federal       Reserve       purchase       of currencies        owned     by the ESF

has been     cited    as the origin          of    “warehousing,”           the euphemism        that    later       came

into use to describe           the    provigion          of funds     to the ESF outside           the

Congressional        appropriation           process        (Todd 1992,       pp.    132-33).10 It was            not

until    1977,    however,     that      warehousing        of foreign        currencies        for the ESF was

formally     authorized       by the       Federal       Reserve.     I shall       digcuss     warehousing          in a

moment     as one of the ways            that     ESF    funds    its currency        acquisitions.

         During    the Bretton        Wood9       period,       except     for forward     purchaseg          and    zaleg

of foreign       currencies,       the     ESF    rarely    participated        in interventions,              which

were    for the most       part    financed        by drawings        on Federal       Reserve     zwap       lines.ll

It was only       beginning       in 1978,        after    the    formal     authorization        of warehousing

that    the ESF    jointly     intervened          with    the Federal        Reserve.     The prearranged

share    of the ESF     varied       from    a little       more     than    10% of the foreign             currency
                                                           14

purchase     or sale     to half     (more than       half       in the case         of marks,       since      the ESF

had    a swap    line with       the Bundesbank),          and the Federal            Reserve     took     the

remaining       share.    Shares    tended     to be equal         during      the    limited     interventions               of

1981-85.     Since     1987,     shares    have    varied       from equal      percentages          to three-

quarters     for the ESF,         one-quarter       for the Federal            Reserve.       In addition          to its

swap    line with      the    Bundesbank,      the ESF      alBo    had a line with            the    central       bank

of the Netherlands,            1962-69.

The ESF as Principal. There                are nuances          in the relation         of the ESF         as

principal       to its agent,       the Federal       Reserve.          Paul Volcker       emphasizes           that     the

Treasury     does    not have      authority       to instruct          the Federal       Reserve      to spend          its

own money       on intervention       and to take          the    attendant       risks,      and that       the

Treasury     would     be reluctant        to intervene          over    strong      objections       of the Federal

Reserve     (Volcker      and Gyohten,       1992,    p. 234).          The   FOMC,    at its March          27,    1990,

meeting,     argued      in favor    of continuing          to intervene,            despite    misgivings          about

the    effectiveness         of intervention,        as a means          of moderating         Treasury

initiatives         (Transcript,     1990).

         At the     start     in 1962 of Federal           Reserve participation                for its own

account,     it was      an eager    agent,       ready    to support         the principal          and

enthusiastic        about     defending     the dollar          under    the Bretton       Woods      system.       Even

as disillusion         with    the results        emerged    when       foreign      currency     balances

ballooned       in the    late    1980s,    there    was    no consensus          in the FOMC         to end       its

supporting       role. It clearly          did not want          to challenge         the Treasury’s            role     as

its superior.

Sources     of ESF Funds. Since the ESF sought                     to expand         its operations          after

1961,     despite     limited     resources,       it developed          a range      of means       to do so. The

Treasury     in addition         to the establishment             of the GAB         relied     for the most           part
                                                               15

on other       forma    of borrowing          that    of course        had to be repaid.

         One means       was    a U.S.       drawing     on its IMF quota,               by which     it purchased

foreign     currencies         for dollars,          payable        over    a 3- to 5-year          period.    These

drawinga       that    were    turned    over       to the ESF occurred              during     1964-66       ($1.6

billion),       1968    ($0. 2 billion),            1970-72     ($1.7 billion),             and 1978    ($3 billion).

         Warehousing          by the Federal          Reserve        of ESF      foreign     currencies       was

formally       authorized       on January          17, 1977,        for up to $1.5 billion,              increased            in

1978    first    to $1.75       and then       to $5 billion,              limited    to 12 monthg,        with      no

limit    on the term          in 1980.       The    ceiling     was    raised      to $10 billion         in 1989,         and

to $15 billion          in 1990.       The    amounts     held       in the warehouse          tended     to rise with

the    authorized       amounts.       In 1991 the        ceiling          was   lowered     to $10 billion          and       in

February       1992 to $5 billion.             The ESF        repurchased         amounts     in the warehouse             in

1990-92     when      it was emptied.          The    ceiling        wag    raised    to    $20 billion       in January

1995    at the time       of the Mexican             bailout.        No use has,         however,     been made       of the

warehouse       since    1992.

         Another       source    of ESF       funds    was     the    sale of Treasury          securities

denominated        in foreign      currencies.           These       issued      in 1962-74     were    known       as Roosa

bonds    and in 1978-79          as Carter          bonds,     in the       former    years    to official

institutions          in half    a dozen       countries        (Austria,         Belgium,     Germany,       Italy,

Netherlands,          and Switzerland)             and the     Bank    of International             Settlements,          in

the    later    years    to German       and Swiss        private          investors.       Net amounts       issued       in

different       foreign       currencies       in the     former       period      totaled     $4.67    billion,          $6.44

billion     in the      later    period.       By      1983    all    issues      had been     redeemed,       with

losses     on Swiss      francs    in 1972-73,           1978-79,          and   1981.     The ESF’S    net losses             in

1972-73     were      S165 million;          in 1978-79,        $1 billion;          and in 1981,       $573 million.

         The one new          gource    of funding        that       created      a net addition        to the E.SF’s
                                                               16

resources       waa    the    is~ue    of Special        Drawing       Right9     (SDRS)       by the     IMF.

Allocations       to the Treaaury           in 1970-72          amounted        to $2.29       billion,       in 1977 to

$0.87    billion,       and    in 1980-81        to $1.73       billion.        The Federal       Re8erve        monetized

SDRS    for ESF use,          crediting     dollar       amounts       of the     SDRS    to ESF deposit           balanceg

at the Federal          Reserve,       and these        dollar       mounts      appear       ag SDR assets        on ESF

balance     sheets.      Table     1 below       shows    the       importance        of the SDR contribution                to

the growth       of ESF resources.

Record of Intervention. During                    the    Bretton       Woods     era    intervention          was directed

to protect       the value       of dollars        held       by foreign        central       banks    in order       to

deter    their    exchange       for U.S. gold.           Rather       than     sell gold,       the United        States

borrowed     foreign         currencies     to buy dollars             held     abroad.       To repay     the borrowed

foreign     currencies,         the proceeds        of the          sale of Treasury           bonds    denominated          in

foreign     currencies         were    used.     As the decade          of the        1960s    progressed,        the

authorities       intervened          massively     in every          major     currency.       The defense        of the

dollar     during      the    Bretton     Woods    period,          however,     failed,       since    the policies          to

correct     the U.S.         balance    of payments           and dollar        overvaluation          were    inadequate.

When    the United       States       closed     the gold       window       on August        15, 1971,       it turned

from    defense       of the dollar        valued       in gold       at $35 an ounce           to dollar

devaluation.

         With    the demise        of Bretton       Woods       and the        coming    of floating          exchange

rates,     the ESF      and the Federal           Reserve       have    nevertheless           persisted       in efforts

to manage       exchange       rates,     despite       the    interval        from    1981 to early          1985 when

intervention          lost political        favor.       The    record       since     then     suggests       that     large

and    reversible       transitory        movements       of some       exchange        rates    and widening           of

bid-ask     spreads      may    be temporarily           reduced       by intervention.           There       is no

indication,       however,       that,     the    frequent          action     of the    U.S.    authorities          to
                                                                17

quell    disorderly          marketa,       haa had     any permanent           effect.

         Whether       the    dollar       is deemed        strong     or weak,       intervention        does    not deal

with    the    fundamental          economic       conditions         that underlie       medium-term         changes       in

the exchange          value    of the       dollar.     The     feared       changes    of medium-term           variations

in the dollar’s          exchange          value     have    not materialized.           The    supposedly        gro6aly

overvalued       dollar       in 1981-85        did not deindustrialize                 the U.S.       economy      and

usher    in a service          economy       of low-income            occupations.       Similarly,        concern        that

a weak     dollar      would    induce       domestic        inflation        has not been        substantiated.           In

general,       the costs       of floating           exchange        rates    should    be compared        to the     costs

of the alternative,             which       is fixed        or pegged        exchange    rates,     vulnerable        to

speculative       attacks       and bigger           adjustments.

Why Warehousing?              Two    aspects       of intervention            merit    comment.     One    is the

practice       of warehousing             by the Federal           Reserve     and     the Treasury.         It seems       to

contravene       the    statutory          prohibition        of the direct           financing     of the       Treasury

by the Federal          Reserve        (Todd    1992,       pp.140-41),        The transcript          of the     FOMC’S

March    27, 1990,       meeting          reveals     members’        doubts    about    the    legality     of

warehousing,          despite       the    claim     that    the     Federal    Reserve    General        Counsel     in

1962 had       issued    an opinion          that     justified        warehousing       as an open        market

purchase       of foreign       exchange        from the Treasury.              The concern       was     that

warehousing       removed       from       Congress     the     appropriation          power,    eliminating         the

necessity       for the Treasury             to turn        to Congress        to obtain       funds    it did      not have

to acquire       foreign       currencies.           Nevertheless,           at that meeting        the    FOMC

increased       the    limit    on warehousing              from     $10 billion       to $15 billion.’z

         AS mentioned          earlier,        the    ceiling        in 1992 was       reduced    to    $5 billion         when

the ESF       repurchased       its foreign           currencies        in the warehouse.           However,       the     role

of warehousing          remains       very     much    in question,           since    the FOMC     raised       the upper
                                                                18

limit    to $20 billion          on January         31,    1995       (FRB May    1995,    p. 447).      The expansion

of the warehouse          was    intended      to help          the ESF participate          in the Mexican

rescue    program       but,    in the event,         it has not availed                itself   of this provision.

Just    as the courts          have   not tested          the    constitutionality          of the ESF,         there       hag

been    no test       of the    legality      of warehousing.

Why Intervention?          Empirical         evidence       offers       no support       for intervention

operations.        No theoretical        model       is able to predict             exchange       rate movements               at

short    horizong,       let alone      explain       exchange          rate movements       ex post.         What

justifies       the    hubris    of monetary         authorities          that    they    know   the    secret       of the

foreign     exchange      market?

         In a recent       essay      the president             and senior       vice    president      of the       Federal

Reserve     Bank      of Richmond      argue    the       case       for separating       the Federal         Reserve

completely       from    foreign      exchange       operations          on the ground       that      they    imperil

the    credibility       of monetary         policy       (Broaddus       and Goodfriend         1996).       They    do

not,    however,       recommend      that    the    nation          should   forsake     foreign      exchange

operations.        In my view,        intervention          has proved        to be a pointless           activity,             so

I see no purpose          in a continued            role    for either         the Federal       Reserve       or the       ESF

in this     connection.

B, ESF as Lender

          The ESF       early    on discovered            a purpose       for its existence            other    than

exchange       market    intervention         -- stabilizing             not the value       of the dollar            in

exchange       for the    currencies         of the major             industrialized       countries,         but    lending

dollars     to LDCS      to stabilize         their       currencies,         initially     to compensate            for the

damaging       effects    of the U.S.         1934    Silver          Purchase    Act.    Before     1961 the only

foreign     currencies         in the post-World            War       II ESF portfolio       were      currencies          of

LDCS    with    which    it negotiated         intermittent             stabilization       loan programs,            a form
                                                                19

of foreign        aid.

         What     wa8 the geneaia             of the     idea of stabilization                loans?        The    prototype

may    have been       the     stabilization          creditg        extended       to central       banks        during    1924-

31 to facilitate             their     return       to the gold        standard.          Benjamin     Strong       and

Montagu     Norman       actively       promoted        the   stabilization             of the newly         restored

European     exchange          rate    structure        post-World          War    I by means       of credits         from the

Federal     Reserve       and other          central     banks       (Clarke       1967).

         The selection           of countries           to which       the ESF extended              loans    was    obviously

a political        decision       made       by the Treasury.           Harry       Dexter    White’s        memoranda,

written     between       1936    and       1944,    found    among     his unpublished             papers,        supporting

loans    to various          countries,        attest       to his     influence          on which     ones       the ESF

selected     during       this    period.       The     countries       included          China,    Mexico,        other    Latin

American     countries,          and Russia          (Harry     Dexter       White      Papers     in the     Seeley       G.

Mudd    Manuscript        Library,          Princeton       University,           box    1, items     3a,    3b; box       6,

items     14a,    14b,    14L,     19a; box         11, item 28a).

Stabilization Loans. Ten Latin                       American        countries          at one time     or another

during     the period          1936-61       had exchange        stabilization             agreements,        often       with

renewals.        The    countries       in this       group     were    Argentina,          Bolivia,        Brazil,       Chile,

Cuba,    Ecuador,        Mexico,       Nicaragua,        Paraguay           and Peru.       Mexico     had    the     longest

record     of agreements,             the    initial     ones mot. vated            by the disturbing              effects       of

the U.S.     Silver       Purchase          Act of June        19, 1934,          which    led to a trebling              of the

market     price       of silver       between       1933     and 1935.

          During       World    War    II the mission           of the ESF was expanded                 to    include

provision        of dollars        to countries          deemed       worthy       of such assistance              for their

importance        in the war          effort.       In Europe        only    Iceland       had an exchange

stabilization           agreement,          but the ESF provided              the USSR with           dollars       during
                                                          20


World    War    II in exchange         for gold.       In Asia     there      were    agreements        with    China

with    respect     to silver,       gold,     and yuan     from    1936 to 1943.            The ESF     had wartime

agreements       with     India,    Iran,     and Egypt     to sell gold         in exchange           for local

currencies       for use by U.S.         personnel       stationed       there.       It provided        Liberia       with

U.S.    currency     when    it converted        its monetary          system    from       British     coins.

         During     the postwar       years     ESF    stabilization          loan programs        were    combined

with    IMF standby        arrangements,        Export-Import          Bank    (EXIM bank)        foreign       currency

credits,       and assistance         from the    International          Cooperation          Administration           and

the Agency        for International           Development       that    was    established        in 1961.       These

overlapping        authorities       represented        different       executive        departments       including

Commerce       and State.     The ESF        contribution       to these       credit       packages     was    small.

One    advantage     of combining        the ESF       loan with       others    was that        the    latter    often

provided       the LDC recipient         with    the means       to repay       the ESF.

         In the period        since     1962 stabilization             agreements        for the       first    time

provided       for reciprocal         swap    facilities.       Previously,          when    the ESF gave        dollars

to LDC     countries,       a provision        of the    agreement       required        the country       to

repurchase        in dollars       any of its currency           that    the ESF might           have    acquired.

Many    of the     same    countries     that    had    stabilization          agreements        with    the ESF

before     1962 were       again    represented        in the    later     period.       There    were    also     some

newcomers       in Europe,     Asia,     and Africa,        but Latin         American       countries

predominated.        As was    characteristic           of the earlier          Bretton       Woods     years,     ESF

agreements       were     usually     combined    with    loans     from      international        or other       U.S.

agencies.

         Latin     American    countries        with    stabilization          agreements        during    part     or

all of the period           included     Argentina,       Bolivia,       Brazil,       Chile,     Colombia,        Costa

Rica,    Dominican        Republic,     Ecuador,       El Salvador,        Guyana,       Honduras,       Mexico,

Nicaragua,       Panama,     Peru,    and Venezuela.              European    countries        included        Hungary,

Poland,     Romania,      and Yugoslavia.           Jamaica        was the sole West           Indies       country,           the

Philippine       Republic     the    sole Asian          country,     Nigeria       the    sole African            country

with    a stabilization        agreement.

         An appendix,        available       on request           from the author,           presents       the

published       information       in official           sources     about    the    stabilization           and other

agreements       the ESF     signed       with    foreign     countries       before       and after        1962.     A

notable     omission      is any reference              to the     interest     rate      that these        countries

were    required    to pay     for dollar          loans.

         The country       with     the    longest       and most     continuous          record     of ESF

agreements,       as in the period           before       1962,     is Mexico. A knowledgeable                     observer

has noted:       “Since    1976     [in fact,       much    earlier,        as shown       in the     appendix],           the

international        financial       community,          led by the U.S.           authorities,         has    come       to

the    financial    assistance        of Mexico          on numerous        occasions.        The    size     and novelty

of these     operations       may    have    suggested        to investors          that     Mexico    was     a

different,       if not unique,           sovereign       borrower”        (Truman     1996,    p. 202) . In the

case    of Mexico,     since      1967,     the    Federal       Reserve     as well       as the ESF         have

duplicate       short-term     loan       programs.

         Examination       of the     list of countries              that    have been        granted       loans     over

the years,       as detailed        in the       appendix     leads me to doubt              that   they      have

resulted     in stabilization.             What    evidence        is there     that      repeated      extensions             of

loans    helps    these    countries        to advance       their     economies?          The message         of the

loan packages       seems     to be that          mismanaged        countries       have     a friend       at the        ESF,

which    will    arrange     a rescue.       Servicing        and amortizing           the    loans     seem       to add to

the borrowers’       problems.        Loans       may   be a fruitless          policy       for countries           that

have yet to develop           institutions          that    observe     the eternal           financial        verities
                                                             22

of sound     fiscal    and monetary         management.

c.   Conspectus      on ESF Asset Holdings

         Aa the preceding           discuaaion        haa    shown,       the biography          of the ESF         fall~

into two perioda.           That    break    is also        reflected          in its atatiatical            profile

(Table     1). It began       operationa        in 1934 with            $200 million.           By 1960      it held       S330

million     in aaaeta,       the cumulative           net    income       of $130 million            over    the twenty-

five   intervening         years    accounting        for the       increase.          The   slow    growth       was

indicative       of the     atrophy     of a foreign          exchange          role    for the ESF during               its

initial     quarter    century       and the rise           of stabilization             lending      that    it nurtured

to fill the void.

         The principal        noncash       asset     of the ESF          in the       first    period      was    its gold

account,     acquired       for transaction            with       foreign       monetary       authorities         and with

the market,        as the    statute     authorized.          The ESF          continued       to hold gold         in a

special     account    of the Secretary             of the Treasury              at the      Federal     Reserve         Bank

of New York        until    December     9, 1974       (Treasury          AR    1975,    Exhibit      54, p. 501).             The

Treasury     on that       date    consolidated        three       different          gold   accounts,       including

ESF gold,        in its general        account      in anticipation              of the gold         auctiona       it

conducted        in 1975    and    1978-79.     ESF    gold       was   sold to the Treasury                at its par

value.     The gold     category      was then        eliminated          from ESF       assets.

          U.S.   government        securities       and     foreign       exchange       assets      were    minor

components        of ESF    noncash     assets      in the        first    period.       Foreign      exchange

included     currencies       of LDCS       at par,       not market,           values,      and minimal          amounts       of

currencies        of industrialized          countries.

          It was    in the    second     period,       after       1960,       that    the main      growth       in ESF

aasets     occurred.       By 1995 ESF       assets       amounted        to $42.6       billion.      Of the       increase

of $42.3     billion       post-1960,       the main        contributors          to faster         growth    of ESF
                                                             23

a08ets    were    an increase        of $29 billion           in foreign       exchange       assets       and the

addition     of the new asset           of Special          Drawing    Rights       (SDRs)    amounting          to     $11.9

billion.     Though     listed    as SDRS       on the ESF balance             sheet,    they       are    ordinary

dollar     amounts,     available       for any use the ESF chooses.

         In addition      to the      $4.9 billion           IMF allocation         to the     United       States,          the

ESF   acquired      $2.6 billion        SDRS    from    other      IMF participants           (IMF    1995,       p. 53).

The difference        between     the    1995 dollar          value    of SDRS      and the dollar              value      of

the   initial     acquisitions        represents        the net       increase      in SDR valuation              in

dollar    terms     from parity       in 1970 to $1.49             in 1995.

         Accompanying       growth      of cumulative          net    income    amounting       to $26.6          billion

in the     second    period    was    an increase           in foreign       exchange    asset       growth,          which

was   a policy      objective,       presumably        reflecting       the    influence       of Treasury

officials     who    negotiated       the Plaza        Agreement       of September          1985    and the Louvre

Agreement     of February        1987.    The    increases         in foreign       exchange        assets       was

concentrated        in the period        after    the       late   1980s.     The assets       encompassed             major

country     currencies      as well      as those       of LDCS.

         Holdings     of U.S.     government          and    foreign    securities       rose       relative          to

their    representation        in the portfolio              in the earlier         period,     but       at most

accounted     for a third        of total       assets       during    the    second    period.       Because          ESF

investments       in foreign      securities          were    either    combined       with    U.S.       government

securities       or foreign      exchange       or,    if separately          shown,    assigned          the    label       of

other    securities,      it is not possible                to present       them   as a separate           category.

D. Rate of Return on ESF Assets

         Table    2 shows     capital     gains       ( osses)       on gold    before       1975 and       amounts          on

foreign     exchange,     minor      before     1975,       more   substantial       since.     If the          table      were

annual,     losses    on foreign        exchange,       totaling       $1.7 billion,          would       be shown         for
                                                             24

1972-73, 1978-79, and 1981. These                      lo8aes      were    incurred,        aa mentioned       above,

when    the    liability        for U.S.      Treasury      securities        denominated         in foreign

currencie~       was extinguished.             Interest      earnings       on foreign        exchange,       and on

U.S.    government        and foreign         securities       are    separate       categories.

         Finally,        the table      shows    SDR valuation            changes     and    interest       earnings          on

SDRS . The      IMF currently          uses    a basket      of five       currencies        for determining             SDR

valuation.       The     same basket        is also     used      to determine        the    interest       rate    on

SDRs . Before         1981 the basket          included      16 currencies.           The valuation          is a

weighted       average     of the exchange           rates     of the      five currencies.

         The ESF posts           a liability         item of SDR certificates                that    it owes       the

Federal       Reserve     for its SDR holdings,              and a liability           item of SDR allocations.

representing          its obligation          that   would     arise      if the     IMF were       to cancel       SDRS.

To date       no cancellation          has occurred.         The     sum of these         liability        items    on June

30, 1995,       was     $15.7    billion.      Deducting       that    amount      from     reported       assets    of

$42.6    billion       establishes        ESF net worth           as no more       than     $26.9    billion       on that

date.

         Table       3 shows     the   rate of return          of net      income     on total       ESF    assets,

1935-95, and of total              return      on individual          assets,      summing     capital       gains

(losses)       and    interest     earnings      of the      asset     categories.          The data       for the

separate       asset     categories       are available         only      beginning       1940.

         The rate        of return      on total      ESF    assets       at the     five-year       intervals       the

table    presents,        with    three    exceptions,         varied      between     less than        1 and 4

percent.       Exceptional        years     are 1945 when          there    was    a windfall        on gold

holdings,       and     1990    and 1995, when         foreign       exchange,       securities        investments,

and SDRS       all yielded        5-9 percent        returns.        I have    not    seen    an explanation             in

official       sources     of the gold windfall              in 1945.
                                                             25

         Although     there    were     loeses       on foreign       exchange       and SDR revaluation                in

the    first quarter        of 1990,     for the year             ending    June    30, 1990,       the    results       were

highly    favorable.        Similarly,        foreign      exchange        losses    and losses        on SDR

revaluation     were       recorded     in the       last quarter          of 1994,    but     for the      year    ending

June   30, 1995,      the results        were       even   more     favorable       than    in 1990.       In the

quarter     ending    September        30,    1995,    the    last one        for which       information         has been

releaaed,     the ESF       sustained        a $2 billion          realized     loss on its foreign               exchange

portfolio     and a $168 million              loss    for change       in valuation          of its SDR          holdings.

         Foreign     exchange       asseta     in 1990       included       besides    marks     and yen,         small

amounts     of sterling       and Swiss        francs,       and an assortment             of LDC    currencies

(Mexican     pesos,    Hungarian        forints,       Guyana       dollars,       Honduran     lempuraa).         By    1995

the portfolio        waa    restricted        to marka       and yen and Mexican             pesos.       With    a weak

dollar,     the value       of foreign        currencies          appreciated,       and    increases       in SDR

aaseta    accompanied        increases        in revaluations              of the SDR against             the    dollar

between     1990 and       1995.

         The ESF does        not pursue        positive       rate of return          results.       Negative

results     apparently       are compatible           with    the missions          it fulfills.          It has    not,

however,     consistently          lost money.

3. AN ASSESSMENT           OF THE     INFLUENCE       OF THE ESF

         The ESF was        originally        established          for a two-year          period    and

subsequently        given    repeated        two-year      extensions        until    it was made          permanent.

It waa    not exposed        to scrutiny        by either          Congress     or by Democratic            and

Republican     Administrations           until       the events       of January       1995.

         The belated        attention        paid    to the ESF because             of its role        in the Mexican

bailout     misses    a broader        measure       of its influence.              The true     significance            of

the ESF     lies not       in its domestic           aspect       -- a small       agency     in the      U.S.    Treasury
                                                           26

Department,       engaged       in masterminding          foreign       exchange     market    intervention         and

acting    ae a benevolent             lender    to small       troubled     countries.        What     is more

noteworthy       is the     influence        of ESF practice           on the way        the postwar

international          monetary       system,    with    the    IMF at its center,           has operated.

         The ESF appears           to be the prototype            of the     IMF.        “The germ    of the     idea

of combining       regulatory          and   financial     provisions        that    is so prominent        a

feature      of the     IMF” has been          linked    to the bilateral           ESF agreement        of November

1941 with       Mexico.        Like    the ESF     agreement,       “the basic       transactions        of the     IMF

to assist       its member        countries      also    involve       exchanges     of currency”        (Gold     1988,

p. 1127).        The    IMF is said to have             adopted    the ESF        form    of exchanges     of the

currencies       of the two contracting              parties      and not     loans       by one party     to the

other,    to avoid       the     “indignity      that    might    seem     to attach       to borrowing.    ”      This

may   be IMF decorum,           but    no one believes          that    the exchange        of pesos     for dollars

is a transaction          other       than   a loan of dollars.

         The    legacy    of the ESF         is that     lending       programs     dominate    the operation           of

the   IMF.     Support    for weak       currencies       that    the     IMF provides       raises     problems     of

moral    hazard.       Whether     IMF lending       has good      or bad     consequences       is a question

beyond    the    scope    of this       paper.’]

Assistant       Secretary       of the Treasury,             1945-46)        was    appointed      on December         15,

1941,    to manage       the operation          of the ESF and to act as liaison                       between        the

Treasury       and the State          Department       on all matters              having    a bearing       on foreign

relations       (Treasury       AR 1942,       Order     No.    43,    335).       In an unpublished,           undated,

memorandum       on stabilization             funds    and     international          trade,    he described

stabilization          funds    as “a convenient             instrument        to countries”          to insulate

their    economies       from    changes       in “international              balances,       which    immediately

reflect       foreign    disturbances          and developments,”              and, more        important,       to

influence       day to day, week           to week,       and seasonal             fluctuations       of exchange

rates , “especially            those    arising       from     the operations          of speculators,          ” to

facilitate       “the transition           from    one    level       of exchange       rates      to another, ” and

“within       certain    limits       to set the level           of exchange          rates.     . , The

determination          and maintenance          of the external              value    of its currency           is the

main    task    of a Stabilization             Fund”     (see the Harry             Dexter    White    Papers        in the

Seeley       G. Mudd    Manuscript       Library,        Princeton       University,         box    2, item      6.e).


2.     The    suggestion       that    Congress       might    be requested           to appropriate           additional

funds    to be used by the ESF,                to my knowledge,              was made       on only    one     occasion.

On January       14, 1948,       in testimony          before     the Senate          Foreign      Relations

Committee       on financing          the European        Recovery       Program,       Treasury       Secretary        John

W. Snyder       proposed       extending       stabilization           loans       to European      countries,

adding,       “At the appropriate             time,    Congress        may    then be requested           to

appropriate       additional          funds    to be used        by    the United       States      Stabilization

Fund    to make    those       loans”    (Treasury        A.R.    1948,       p. 300).


3. Unlike       the Federal        Reseme,        the ESF       is not required             to transfer        any    of its

earnings       to the Treasury          General       Fund.
4. One     example       of a use of the ESF other                than    for foreign        exchange       market

intenention         or stabilization           loans     is that,        before    fiscal     1980,      “the

administrative           expenses     for international           programs,        formerly       funded     by the

Exchange      Stabilization          Fund,   became      a separate        international          affairs

appropriation”           (Treasury     AR 1980,     p. 105).

      Until      1980    ESF annual     and quarterly           reports     show     gross    income,       expenses        to

operate     the ESF,       and net     income.     Thereafter,           only    ESF net     income      has been

shown     in its reports,           as its expenses        were     shifted       to the general           government

budget.


5.      In Britain        lagged     publication        of EEA     figures       began    in 1937.         In June

1937,     the Chancellor           disclosed     total    holdings        of gold       in the EEA and          Issue

Department        on March       31, and subsequently            made     similar       announcements        every      six

❑onths     (Sayers       1976,     II, p. 490).         Foreign     exchange       balances       on March       31,

1937,    were     stated    as “not more         than    a trifling        amount. ”       They     were    actually

about     E7m.


6. Gold was held           as an ESF asset         only    until       1975.     See the discussion             in

section     2C. below.       Note,     however,     that    at IMF gold           auctions     in 1977,         the

Treasury      purchased      gold which         it sold    to the ESF           (Treasury     AR 1977,       p. 158).

The   official      source       does not explain         why    the ESF acquired            this    gold    and how        it

disposed      of it. An entry          for gold     appears        on the ESF balance             sheet     at the end

of the first        three    quarters        of 1977     and not       thereafter.


7. In 1941 Morgenthau               instructed     the Treasury           staff    to begin       work     on postwar

international           monetary     problems     (Treasury       AR     1945,    Exhibit     51, p. 415).             Harry

Dexter     White    was    the author        of the U.S.        Treasury        draft    of the Bretton          Woods

Agreement.

8. A second        change    made     by the Bretton        Woods        Agreement       Act was     the creation           by

Section     4(a)    of a National        Advisory        Council       “to coordinate         the policies            and
operations      of the representatives              of the United         States     on the Fund          and    the

Bank    and of all agencies            of the Government          which    make    or participate            in making

foreign     loans    or which      engage      in foreign       financial,     exchange          or monetary

transactions      .“ The      Secretary       of the Treasury       was    chairman        of the Council,                and

the Secretaries          of State      and Commerce,        the Chairman       of the Board          of Governors

and of the Board          of Trustees         of the Export-Import           Bank were       members.       The

agencies     covered     by the act were           to inform      the Council        of their       activities.

(As an aside,        one may      question      the appropriateness           of including          the Chairman

of the Federal         Reserve     System      in this    roster     of Executive          Branch

representatives        .)

         According       to the Council.          “The International          Monetary       Fund was projected

to help     achieve      stability       of exchange      rates”      (Treasury      AR    1946,    302), hence

might    have   been     expected      to preempt      the ESF role.         In fact,       the ESF role             before

1962 was hardly          diminished.       Despite     its exchange-rate           implications,           the Anglo-

American     Loan    Agreement        dated    December     6, 1945     (approved         July    15, 1946,          by

joint    resolution       of Congress),         that   authorized       the Secretary            of the Treasury

to make     $3,750     million     available       as a line      of credit       to the United          Kingdom,

did not     involve      the ESF, presumably           because      the size      of the loan was           clearly

in excess       of the capacity          of the ESF       (Treasury    AR 1947,       51).

         In May     1976,     however,     the ESF had       the capacity         to lend        the Bank       of

England     $1 billion.         The Federal      Reserve     lent    a like    amount       (Treasury       AR       1976,

p. 86).     Since    the Federal        Reserve    had    a $3 billion        swap    line with          the Bank          of

England,     it could        itself    have    provided     the $2 billion.          However,       then Chairman

Arthur     F. Burns      insisted      on ESF participation            as the price         for his       agreement

with    a Treasury       plan    to enforce      British     financial       discipline          (Burk.and

Cairncross       1992,      p, 42).

9. ESF balances          of foreign       currencies      are    to be distinguished              from    foreign
currency        balances       held     in Treasury       and    in agency         accounts       that were       acquired

without     purchase          with    dollars,


10. Two     official          statements        support      this    interpretation.           In Section         VI on

“Methods        of Acquiring          and Selling        Foreign      Currencies”          (see the document,

“Authorization           Regarding        Open Market        Transactions           in Foreign          Currencies”),           the

FOMC    included        transactions          with    the ESF.       In Section       4,    “Transactions           in

Forward     Exchange”          (see the document,             “Guidelines          for System        Foreign      Currency

Operations”)          , referred        to the Federal          Reserve      Bank    of New York,          where

authorized,           taking    over     from    the ESF      “outstanding          contracts        for forward          sales

or purchases           of authorized          currencies”        (Board      AR,    1962,    pp.     59, 63) .


11.     These     were     lines      of credit       the Federal       Reserve       established          with     the

central     banks       of the leading           European       countries      providing          for    the right        of the

U.S.    to draw        on a foreign        currency       up to a specified            ceiling          for a specified

term,     and    the reciprocal           right      of the foreign          central       bank    to draw     on U.S.

dollars     at the current             exchange       rate    for a matching          sum and        term.


12.     Chairman        Greenspan       was     eloquent      in 1991      in opposing         the Treasury’s

proposal        that would       authorize        the Federal         Reserve       Banks     to lend up to $25

billion     to the FDIC          to absorb        losses      sustained       by the Bank          Insurance        Fund       in

resolving        failed       banks.    He stated:         “Not only would           use    of the Resene            Banks

for funding           the BIF    serve     no economic          purpose,      it could        create      potential

problems        of precedent          and perception          of the Federal          Resene.           In particular,

the proposal           involves        the Federal       Reserve      directly       funding       the government,              The

Congress        has    always    severely        limited      and,    more    recently,        has      forbidden        the

direct     placement          of Treasury        debt with       the Federal         Reserve,        apparently          out of

concern     that       such    a practice        could    compromise         the independent             conduct     of

monetary        policy     and would       allow      the Treasury         to escape        the discipline           of

selling     its debt          directly     to the market.            . . . In addition,              if implementation
of the proposal        created    a precedent          for further        loans    to the BIF or to other

entities,     the liquidity       of the Federal             Resene’s      portfolio       could     be reduced

sufficiently       to create     concerns       about    the ability        of the Federal           Resene     to

control     the supply      of resemes         and,    thereby,    to achieve           its monetary     policy

objectives”      (FRB June      1991,    pp.    435-36).

        Chairman     Greenspan     has    not been       equally        opposed    to Federal        Reserve    loans

to the ESF.      In what     respect     does    warehousing       differ     from       lending     to the BIF?


13. To balance       the suggestion        made       here    of a greater        ESF    influence     than    is

commonly    assigned     to it, let me note             an erroneous        attribution         of greater      ESF

influence     than   it actually        had.     A recent       paper     asserts       that   the ESF played         a

domestic    monetary     role    in the control          of excess        reserves       in 1936-37      (Calomiris

and Wheelock       1996).     Inactive     gold       was held    in the Treasury’s            General     Fund,

not   the ESF.
