                                   ABSTRACT

     Almost all developed economies at some time during the 1970s seemed
supply—constrained. Even much of measured excess capacity was arguably
redundant due to energy price shocks, environmental policy, and other struc-
tural flux of the 1970s. Little analytical work has been carried out on the
macroeconomics of open economies under such supply constraints. This paper
attempts a beginning. Its focus is on the international transmission of
various macroeconomic shocks, and on their implications for the current
account, capital account, and exchange rate. The paper captures both the
foreign repercussions and the terms—of—trade effects of various shocks.

     Conclusions are based on an analytical model that assigns behavior to
each of two regions relating to one nontradeable input, one tradeable output,
and one tradeable financial asset. International exchange between the two
regions is characterized by sequential "temporary equilibria," each con-
sistent with economically and institutionally constrained optimization, yet
each simultaneously consistent with failure of output and input markets to
clear. International transactions take place in capital markets and through
a foreign exchange market that do clear continuously through flexible exchange
rates.

     The abstract reduced form of the model is derived, then applied empirically,
using parameters and initial values that incorporate data and consensus beliefs
about the U.S. and the rest of the world in the 1970s. The most important
conclusions of the exercise are:

     (1) Floating exchange rates fail to insulate either supply—constrained
economy from unanticipated shocks in the other. International transmission
is direct —— the impacts on the two regions of any shock have the same sign.

     (2)   Exchange rates and the terms of trade between the supply—constrained
economies are moderately sensitive to incomes policies and changes in technology!
productivity trends (elasticities of 0.5 to 1.5 in absolute value) and relatively
insensitive to fiscal policy and distributionally neutral wage—price guidelines.
Wage—favoring incomes policies, liquidity—financed fiscal expansion, tighter
wage—price guidelines, and slackening of technology/productivity growth all cause
depreciation of the domestic currency and deterioriatlon of the terms of trade.

     (3)   These same shocks all promote "internationalization" of commodity
and financial markets. Export volume, import volume, claims on foreigners,
and indebtedness to them all grow as a result, sometimes by significant
amounts (elasticities as high as 1.5 in response to each shock taken inde-
pendently of the others, and larger elasticities in response to combinations
of shocks).

                          I. INTRODUCTION



     The analytical foundation of traditional international macroeconomics

has been as shaken by recent events as that of closed—economy macroeconomics.

Its usefulness has been clouded by enduring stagflation, globally parallel

declines in capital formation and productivity trends, synchronous cyclical

movements even under floating exchange rates, and puzzling volatility and

unpredictability of exchange rates.

     One of several problems with traditional international macroeconomics

is that it often supposes stylized equilibrium states of the world, with

thoroughgoing market—clearing. Yet its concerns have much more the flavor

of "disequilibrium" states of the world, especially during the past fifteen

years, with measures of excess capacity, unemployment, inflationary gaps,

labor shortages, and current—account flux suggesting enduring excess supply

or demand.

     A "disequilibrium" characterization seems especially appropriate to

the recurrent global overheating in the 197 Os, coupled with widespread

recourse to wage—price guidelines and incomes policies. To the extent that

such policies were successful (President Carter's were enforced by Federal

purchasing threats, for example), output markets have been frequently supply—

constrained (with transactions rationed or deferred), and input markets have

featured unemployment or shortages depending on whether incomes policies

over— or undervalued factors of production.

     During the late 1970s, almost all developed economies seemed supply—

constrained. Even much of measured excess capacity was arguably redundant
                                      12



 due to energy price shocks, environmental policy, and other structural flux

 of the 1970s. In the U.S., labor markets seemed
                                                   similarly supply—constrained

 even in the presence of unprecedented unemployment, because of the large

 number of job—seekers who were "structurally unemployed" ——
                                                               possessing skills
 or preferences that made them a non—competing group for vacant positions at

 ruling wages. In European labor markets, by contrast, excess supply seemed

 more aptly to characterize the l970s, given the rapid 1972—74 run—up in real

 wages that was preserved by inertia and indexation (International
                                                                     Monetary
 Fund (1980), Chapter 1).

      Little analytical work has been carried out on the macroeconomics of

open economies under such constraints, despite the intriguing

correlation of widespread wage—price guidelines, exchange—rate volatility,

and the explosion of international trade and investment relative to other

economic activity in the early 1970s. This paper attempts a beginning..

Its focus is on transmission of various macroeconomic shocks between
                                                                        output—
supply...constrajnd economies and on their implications for the current account,

capital account, and exchange rate. For empirical relevance the paper

abandons the small—country and fixed—exchange—rate assumptions that have

characterized antecedent related research.1 Unlike the latter, the

analysis in this paper treats both the foreign repercussions and the terms—

of—trade effects of various shocks.

      Section II of the paper describes an analytical model that assigns

behavior to each of two regions relating to one nontradeable input, one

 tradeable output, and one tradeable financial asset. International exchange
                                   13




between the two regions is characterized by sequential "temporary equilibria,"

 each consistent with economically and institutionally constrained optimi-

zation, yet each simultaneously consistent with failure of some markets to

clear. International transactions take place through a foreign exchange

market that does clear continuously through flexible exchange rates.

     Section III and the Appendices describe the reduced form of the model

and apply it empirically, using parameters and initial values that incorporate

data and consensus beliefs about the U.S. and the rest of the world in the

late 1970s. The most important conclusions of the exercise are:

     (1) Floating exchange rates fail to insulate either supply—constrained

economy from unanticipated shocks in the other. Their international

transmission is direct ——   the impacts of any shock on the two regions

are qualitatively similar. Cross—region spillover effects are, however,

quantitatively small relative to the own—region effects.

     (2) Exchange rates and the terms of trade between the Supply—constrained

economies are moderately sensitive to incomes policies and changes in technology!

productivity trends (elasticities of 0.5 to 1.5 in absolute value).    They are

relatively insensitive to fiscal policy and to distributionally neutral wage—

price guidelines (elasticities of 0.0 to 0.2    except that the terms of trade

are moderately sensitive to the wage—price guidelines).    Wage—favoring incomes
policies, liquidity—financed fiscal expansion, tighter wage—price guide-

lines, and slackening of technology/productivity growth all cause deprecia-

tion of the domestic currency and deterioration of the terms of trade.

      (3) One percent changes in incomes policies and technology/productivity

trends in the supply—constrained economies have quantitative impacts on all
                                   14



variables that are generally 3 to 5 times the impact of one percent changes

in government spending or in distributionally   neutral wage—price guidelines.

     (4) Wage—favoring incomes policies, liquidity—based fiscal expansion,

tighter wage—price guidelines, and slackening of technology/productivity

growth all promote "internationalizatio&' of commodity and financial markets.

Export volume, import volume, claims on foreigners, and indebtedness to them

can grow significantly in response to each (elasticities up to 1,5), and

especially so in response to several taken together.

                       II. AN ABSTRACT MODEL


     The abstract model that we work with is a structurally symmetric

generalization of Malinvaud (1977). Malinvaud explores a closed economy

with one input (labor), one output (goods), and one asset (money, also the

numeraire). His focus is on the temporary equilibrium attained when

economic agents optimize subject to quantity constraints consistent with

sluggish prices and the absence of barter.

     Our model posits for each economy one input (with others,

entrepreneurship and fixed physical capital, implied), one output,

one asset (liquid wealth or money), each unique to that economy. Input

markets are bounded by national borders; output markets and asset—holding

span them. All international transactions are financed through a foreign

exchange market with a potentially flexible exchange rate. The model pushes

beyond other "internationalizations" of Malinvaud's model by Dixit (1978)

and Neary (1979): (i) by eschewing their small—country assumption (which

allows them to ignore the terms of trade and foreign repercussions that are

an important focus of our work, and to lump exportables and importables into

one aggregate "commodity"); and (ii) by analyzing floating in the foreign

exchange market in addition to their fixed—exchange—rate regimes.

     Each of the two trading economies is subject to potential price sluggish-

ness or government policies that cause output and input markets to clear

only slowly compared to foreign—exchange and financial capital "markets".

When this happens, the short side of the input or output market rules, in

the sense that the volume of transactions carried out matches the smaller

of supply and demand. Frustrated sellers or buyers on the
                                11—2




long side of such markets are induced by their rationing there to alter

their demands for and supplies of different goods elsewhere, alterations

that are referred to as "spillover effects."

     Each economy is populated by three groups of agents: households, firms,

and government. Households and firms act as price—takers, although the

economy as a whole (being large) influences the world price for the unique

commodity it produces. The foreign currency price of each country's output

is flexible to the extent that the exchange rate is.2 Governments have

the capacity to alter prices and wages by legislative decree. Expectations

of future prices and wages are formed taking this into account, but only

unanticipated shocks are examined below.

     Households are buyers in two markets, for the outputs of firms in

both countries. They are sellers in one market, for inputs to domestic

firms. The only such input is labor services, the supply of which is fixed

exogenously. Households may be constrained in any of these markets in

principle, as buyers of either good or as sellers of labor. If rationed

as buyers in a product market, households will tend to increase demands in

other markets. If rationed as sellers in the labor market, i.e., if un-

employed, households will tend to reduce demands in other markets. These

are spillover effects of rationing. Households hold liquid financial claims

denominated in both domestic and foreign currencies. If such claims pay

interest, the interest rate is taken to be invariant given the assumptions

of stable wage—price trajectories and a fixed physical capital stock mentioned

above. These claims are the means of transferring purchasing power to

the future. Households are never rationed in their acquisition of liquid

assets, making them and whatever deferred purchases they represent a sink
                                          11—3



for current spillover effects.

     Firms are sellers in one market, selling their (domestic) output to

households in both countries and to the domestic government, and buyers in

one market, purchasing only domestic labor services. Firms may be rationed

as buyers of labor, in which case their output will be less than they would

like, or as sellers of output, in which case the spillover effect is a

reduction in their demand for labor services. Firms hold domestic

financial claims in an amount equal to current profits

(the reward to the implied factors, entrepreneurship and fixed

capital), which are then fully distributed to household—shareholders in the

subsequent period (see below).

     Governments purchase domestic output only (government imports are

neglected), and are never rationed. They finance their purchases by

creating new domestic money or other liquid assets. Taxes and transfers

(including any interest payments on liquid debt) are assumed to balance.

     The optimizing behavior of the three groups of agents is expressed in

algebraic detail as follows:

     Households: Households maximize utility that is defined over current

and future3 consumption of commodities.


                            Max         V (X ., X   .,   N   .,   M..);
                   ii' ji' ii' ji

where I =   1,2   as j       2,1; and                              -




                  V.1   = an index of household welfare;


                  X     =   domestic consumption of domestic output;
                        =   domestic consumption of imports;
                                           11—4




                 M.. = household stocks of domestic liquid assets;
                  ii-


                 N..    = household
                                    stocks of foreign liquid assets, net
                          (i.e., net foreign—currency claims).


        Household stocks of domestic liquid assets at the beginning of each

period are equal to the amount then in existence less the sum of holdings

by foreign households and holdings by domestic firms for subsequent dis-

tribution to domestic households (see below):


        (1)                       M. =   L — (M?. +           where


                 L. =        country i's stock of financial assets
                             outstanding;

                  if.
                        =    profits of firms, distributed to household!
                             shareholders the period after firms earn them;

                 zero superscripts denote beginning—of—period values.


When households are not rationed in any market, the maximization is

carried out subject only to the budget constraint:



(2.1)                   p1X11 + rp2X21 +              rM21 = w1N1 +       + M + rM1
(2.2)            (p1/r)X12 + p2X22 + N12/r +              =
                                                              w2N2    +ir + M2/r + N22

where:


                p. =        the nominal domestic price of the commodity produced
                            in country 1;

                r = the exchange     rate, the price of country 2's financial
                        assets in units of country l's financial assets;

                w. =    country    i's wage rate;

                N1 =    country i's labor force (exogenous), implicitly
                                                                        aggre-
                        gating across identical households;
                                               11—5



 When households are rationed as sellers of labor
                                                  services, excess supply
 and unemployment characterize labor markets, and wiNi is replaced in (2)

 by wi (1 — u1), where:

                 u. = 1 —   N./N.     =
                                          country     i's unemployment rate; and
                      = employment
                 N1                in country i, again implicitly aggregating
                        across identical households.


Households may be rationed in principle as buyers of country l's commodity,

or of country 2's commodity, or of both. Excess demand then exists in

commodity markets. In these cases, household maximization is further

constrained in that consumption cannot exceed available supplies:4


(3.1)                 + C12 <        —
                C11             Y1        C1


(3.2)           C21 ÷ C22 <          —




where


                C = rationed     (constrained) consumption of country l's
                        output by country j's residents;
                Y. = domestic        output;

                C1 = government          purchases of domestic output.

      Firms: Firms maximize current profits, Tr, as in


(4)              Max rr.(N.,Y.),
                      1 1
                N.,Y.
                 11
implicitly   aggregating across identical firms. When firms are not rationed

In any market, the maximization in (4) is carried out subject only to the

(aggregate) production function:
                                        11—6




(5)              Y. =   Y.(N.)

When firms are rationed as buyers of labor services, excess demand and

labor shortages characterize labor markets, and N (the labor force)

replaces N (employment) in (5). When firms are rationed as sellers of

commodities, incipient excess supply characterizes output markets. Opti-

mizing firms will produce only what they can sell (X.. + X.. + C1,    which
is predetermined from their point of view), and will employ the minimal

amount of labor necessary to do so:


(6)              N. =
                  1      1   (X..
                               1]   + X..   + Ci );
                                       1J


where Y.(    )   is   the inverse of the production function in (5), and X,

X... take into account any rationing of good j.


      Government:     Governments do not optimize, but are responsible in

their fiscal, monetary, price, and incomes policies for the values of

four important exogenous variables: G, L.,, p, w.,. Fiscal, monetary,

and price—control policies are necessarily interdependent..     Choice of

any two implies the third, as revealed in the government's budget constraint:


(7)              p.G.=L—L
      The Foreign Exchange Market. The foreign exchange market is a

financial market that is the locus for trade between the two countries'

financial assets and that establishes their relative price (r). This

price, the exchange rate, is never sluggish, and therefore the foreign

exchange market always clears.5 These observations are reflected in the

          III. AN APPLICATION TO A U.S./REST—OF-WORLD
           REGIME OF BINDING OUTPUT SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS



     As outlined in the introduction, the model of Section II can be

usefully applied to global settings of recent vintage (the 1970s), that

may also characterize the near future. "Supply constrained" economies

are those with measured and "repressed" inflation (Malinvaud (1977)) in

markets for their output, where the elements repressing inflation, i.e.,

rationing or deferring demand, might include contractual sluggishness and

any price guidelines or incomes policies of a central government. These

same elements plus explicit wage guidelines might lead labor markets to

be similarly supply—constrained, but can conceivably cause excess supply as

well, for which case the label "classical unemployment" is usually applied

(Malinvaud (1977)), and Europe in the 1970s cited as an example.

     In this setting both commodity and factor markets will fail to clear,

the first being characterized by excess demand, and the second by either

excess supply or demand. All these excesses will spill over into markets

that are not subject to rationing. These will include financial and

foreign exchange markets that seem realistically to clear continuously.

Spillovers into financial markets are more accurately thought of as

spillovers into future purchases, one counterpart to deferred purchases

in current periods.

     Since price controls and guidelines are not traditionally applied

to exports and imports, excess commodity demand domestically will also

spill over into current imports, a spillover that will be accommodated

readily by foreign suppliers who are not constrained in export sales and
                                111—2



pricing. Thus although domestic buyers may find themselves rationed,

foreign buyers (importers) will not. This last phenomenon has the

potential to create infinitely profitable arbitrage, since the prices

that suppliers receive on foreign sales can rise relative to those they

are allowed on domestic sales. But since export markets for most suppliers

are usually smaller than domestic markets, modest reallocations of sales

toward exports will generally be sufficient to reduce the export price to

its traditional relationship to domestic price,7 and the arbitrage

opportunity will be eliminated. This elimination of infinite arbitrage

profits should be immediate and continuous, even when overall markets

do not clear. (Suppliers will, of course, make profits on infra—marginal

sales adjustments due to arbitrage, thus justifying the arbitrage.)

     There is more than a suggestion in this discussion that supply—

constrained regimes may be afflicted with volatile responses of exports,

imports, capital movements, and exchange rates to wage—price guidelines

and other familiar policies. And indeed the potential for volatile inter-

national transactions and exchange rates can be confirmed in the abstract

using the appropriate version of the model of Section II. But any such

demonstration is worthless if these spillovers could not even in principle

be quantitatively important determinants of observed volatility. Empiri-

cally sensible measures of their impact are not immediately clear.

     To address both the empirical and the abstract concerns, we describe

below the results from investigating a "central—value version" of Section

II's model. Parameter values were chosen "centrally" in the sense that
                                      111—3



they reflect well—established empirical regularities: approximate medium—

term invariance of budget and factor shares to most changes, and the

tendency of estimated own—price and income elasticities of demand to center

(in absolute value) around one. Log—linear utility and production functions

yield precisely these properties, and, as side benefits, both empirical
                                                             8
measurability (shares) and analytical tractability:


(9.1)           V1(X11, X21, M1, M21) = v1
                                                     +   log X11 +   l   log X21


                                                     +    log N11 + y21 log N21;

                V2(X12, X22, M2, M22) =


                                                     + l2 log M12 + 22 log N22,


as the specific forms of V1( )       to    be considered, where a's, s's, and '"s

denote budget shares, and V's denote constants, and


(10)            log Y. =   log   a. + 5.   log   N
as the specific form of (5), where 6. denotes a factor share and a1

denotes a constant.

        Maximization subject to the constraints that characterize supply—

constrained economies as described above, in which all consumers are

rationed, yet only in their respective domestic markets, yields the

following system of equations. For country l's commodity exports and im-

ports (2's imports and exports, respectively), effective demands are:
                                           111—4




(11.1)         p1X12 =
                         (l)    Cr)        (w2N2 +    + N°2/r ÷       -
                                                                          p2C22);


(11.2)         p2X21 =
                         (l)    (l/r) (w1N1 +         +      + rM1 - p1C11).


       Spillover effects on trade as a result of domestic rationing are

reflected in the first and last terms on the right—hand side of (11).               If

wages and prices could vary to clear markets, then the denominators l_2

and 1—a2 would be replaced by 1, and the pVC.. terms would vanish.

Unrationed international commodity trade in turn feeds back on domestic output

rationing, as reflected in the last term of the domestic demand equations,

given the assumed constraints:


(12)              C..
                   11
                      =Y.

                                      ij


This sets commodity trade apart from international capital movements, which

are subject to spillover influences from domestic output rationing, but do

not feed back on It. Net international claims (stocks) are given by:


(13.1)        M12 =   (') Cr)      (w2N2 +         + M2/r + M2 - p2C22);


(13.2)        M21 =   (f') (l/r)   (w1N1 + +              + rM1 -
                                                                    p1C11).

The exchange rate is sensitive to the spillover effects of domestic ration-

ing on trade and capital movements, as well as reflecting its standard role

in valuing relative asset stocks (implicit in the             and 1l2 influences
          9
below):
                                       111—5



                                        +           + rM1 —              -
                  (i2l)      (w1N1 +                            p1C11)       rM1

                                        + M2/r +            -            -
                  (2l2)      (w2N2 +                            p2C22)       M2/r

In the absence of rationing and spillovers, the exchange rate would reflect

only the relative nominal output trends and valuation of national financial

asset stocks, in a manner familiar from the monetary/portfolio approach to

floating exchange rates)°

        Wages (w.), prices         government spending (p1G.), and beginning—of—

period values (superscript o) are exogenously fixed by assumption. When

firms are rationed in the labor market (repressed inflation), then einpioy—

ment (N.) and output supply (Y.) are fixed by the exogenous labor force

Ci) and by the rule that quantities are dictated by the short side of the

market. When households are rationed in the labor market (classical un-

employment), then employment and output vary as determined by the production

function and the labor demand curve implied by profit maximization. In

any event, other variables that are determined endogenously and simultaneously

by the system include commodity trade (X12, X21), rationed domestic purchases

(C11, C22), international financial claims (M12, M21) and the exchange rate
       12
(r).

        The simultaneity of the system would be reduced in a fixed exchange—rate

regime, as discussed in Appendix A.            Reduced—form equivalents of (11) through

(14) are derived in Appendix B. Empirical approximations to the reduced form

of (l1)—(l4) are calculated

in Appendi,c C. Parameters and initial values were chosen to create a

stylized but "central—value" representation of the U.S. and the rest of

the world in the late 1970s.   The discussion below is based on this

empirically stylized reduced form, the elements of which are summarized

in Table 1.


     The multipliers of exogenous variables on endogenous are displayed

in elasticity form in Table 2. The table is divided, the left—hand side

recording the impact of shocks in country 1, the "stylized U.S.," and the

right—hand side recording those in country 2, the "stylized rest—of—the—

world."3 Each column on each side represents a different experiment:

     Columns labelled "—w.,p" display the impacts of an unanticipated one

percent tightening of wage/price guidelines in some overall price controls

program.

     Columns labelled "WI" display the impacts of an unanticipated incomes

policy that favors labor by one percent (specifically a policy that allows

wages to rise one percent faster than prices).14 Without intending to

prejudice we will occasionally refer to such policies below as "progressive"

incomes policies.

     Columns labelled "a11' display the impacts of an unanticipated one
                                                                     15
percent increase in growth due to disembodied technological progress.

     Columns labelled "gj" display the impacts of unanticipated one—percent

fiscal expansion, financed either by monetization or by borrowing in liquid

financial instruments (see equation (7)).

     It is an interesting property of the log—linear utility and production

functions employed to establish central values that the results of Table 2

are, with two exceptions, invariant to whether the labor market features

excess demand or excess supply. In the former case, employment (N1) and

output (Y.) are unaffected by any of the shocks (being fixed at    and

        in the latter, both respond negatively to an increased wage (w1),

but in a quantitatively offsetting way.'6

     Table 2 reveals the following conclusions:

     (1) Cleanly floating exchange rates do not insulate either supply—

constrained region from shocks in the other. They would have done so only

if financial claims on foreigners and indebtedness to them had been zero.

With positive international claims and indebtedness, each exogenous change

causes exchange—rate—related capital gains and losses on national portfolios

that alter real demands for goods and assets.

     (2) The international transmission of shocks between supply—constrained
regimes under floating exchange rates is direct. Each policy, and productivity—

based growth as well, generates an effect abroad that is qualitatively sim-

ilar to that at home. Additional rationing at home causes increased spillover

purchases of unconstrained imports from foreign producers (at flexible prices)

and these ration out additional foreign buyers. In symmetric fashion, relief

from domestic rationing creates repercussions abroad that relieve foreign

rationing as well. Such "rationing repercussions" increase the sensitivity

of domestic shortages to any given domestic policy or change.

     (3) The quantitative size of this international transmission is important

only for real welfare (national purchasing power).   Otherwise, own—country

influences are generally 3 to 40 times larger than cross—country influences)7

The results provide little practical support for international policy

coordination that is rooted in avoiding the import of foreign vice (e.g.
                                     111—12




 imported rationing and inflationary pressure) or In encouraging the import

of foreign virtue (e.g. locomotive or convoy approaches).

      (4) The quantitative impacts of what might be loosely called "supply—

side" policies —— towards factor shares (w. columns) and growth (a

columns) ——   are,   with a few exceptions, from 3 to 5 times larger than the

quantitative impacts of more traditional wage—price controls (—w.,p.) and

fiscal initiatives (g.).

      (5) Distributionally neutral wage—price guidelines, "progressive" (in

the sense of favoring wages) incomes policies, and liquidity—based fiscal

expansion all have qualitatively similar effects. All such policies weaken

a nation's currency in the foreign exchange market, with consequent terms—

of—trade deterioration and a decline in its standard of living (as measured

by national purchasing power). (The impacts on real national welfare are,

however, quantitatively small.) Technology—based output growth, by contrast,

strengthens a nation's currency, improves its terms of trade and standard

of living, and loosens up the ration that constrains domestic purchasers,

thereby reducing shortages and order backlogs.18 Under fixed exchange rates

the national welfare effects of these policies are hidden in official—

reserve changes, as Appendix A implies.

     (6) Tighter wage—price controls, more "progressive" incomes policies,

and fiscal expansion all ration domestic consumers more tightly (reduce

      as one would expect. And...

     (7) ...frustrated purchasing power spills over toward unconstrained

imports of commodities (rp2X21 for 1; p1X12/r for 2) and toward claims on

future commodities (M11 and rM21 for 1; N22 and M12/r for 2);

    (8)   ...   such international spillovers of purchasing power cause
                                       111—13




exchange—rate depreciation that, in turn, causes

     (9)   .   . .real   exports of both commodities and ownership of domestic

assets (X1 and M. stocks for country i) to vary positively with wage—price

controls, "progressive" incomes policies, and fiscal expansion, counter to

casual intuition, but consistent with the remarkable burgeoning of export

volume and international liabilities during the inflation—prone early l970s

in which each of these policies enjoyed some unanticipated prominence.

     (10) Finally, because these policies cause spillover increases in

imports and claims on foreigners, as well as exports and liabilities to

them,19 they could all be characterized as increasing the "international-

ization" of commodity and financial capital markets, in a way that again

seems consistent with observation in the 1970s.

      (1l)—(15) Conversely to (6)—(10), technological progress, productivity

growth, and supply expansion shrink supply constraints and rationing

dramatically, leading to currency appreciation, larger imports

and exports, symmetric changes in international asset positions, and

declining "internationalization" of world commodity and asset markets.

them, with (14) being overruled by the authorities' exchange—rate target,

enforced by the requisite foreign—exchange—market intervention. The

     Table Al records selected results from a "central—value" version of

equations (llA)_(l3A),A2 where the parameters underlying the calculations

are those described in Table 1 of the text and in Appendix C. Table Al is

directly comparable to Table 2 of the text, the former giving results under

rigidly fixed exchange rates and the latter under cleanly floating exchange

rates.
     The conclusions from Table A2 are qualitatively the same as those

from Table 2. Even the absolute size of the quantitative differences is

not great, suggesting that supply—constrained economies as large and

"closed" as these do not respond very differently to unanticipated shocks

from exchange—rate system to exchange—rate system. Two differences are

notable, however, and are summarized in the following:

     (1) Floating exchange rates do provide a measure of insulation. Under

floating, domestic shortages and rationing are less affected by foreign

influences than under fixed exchange rates.

     (2) Under floating exchange rates, wage—price guidelines, incomes

policy, growth/technology flux, and fiscal/monetary initiatives all have

less pronounced effects on imports of goods and ownership of assets, and

more pronounced effects on exports of goods and ownership of assets than

under fixed exchange rates. Exchange rate adjustment wipes out a large

portion of the import effect and creates most of the export effect.

simultaneously with (11) and (12) for r, X12, X21, C11, and C22. The

In the absence of arLy international financial claims or liabilities (M2 =

      =   0),
H21             floating exchange rates would guarantee insulation: X12, C11, and

H12 would depend on the country 1 variables in Z1 alone, and not on

X21, C22, and          would depend on Z2 alone, and not on Z1. A peculiarity

of such insulation would be that each supply—constrained region could

independently influence its real exports and the domestic—currency value of

its liabilities to foreigners, but would have no ability to influence its

real imports or the foreign—currency value of its claims on foreigners.

wages to a degree given by the product of the last two elasticities:

     1Related efforts that apply temporary—equilibrium or "disequilibrium"
insights to international macroeconomics include Brito and Richardson
(1975, 1977), Cuddington (1979, 1980), Dixit (1978), Gordon (1977),
Grossman, Hanson, and Lucas (1977), Owen (1979), Neary (1979), and
Steigum (1979).



      2 the usefulness of the assumptions of price—taking agents and
"price—setting"       large open economies, see Muellbauer and Portes (1978,
pp. 817—818).

     3Financial assets are the means by which consumption can be trans-
ferred between the present and the future. Current household stocks of
assets thus vary directly, ceteris paribus, with intended future consump-
tion, and can be taken to represent it. That is one reason why they appear
in the household utility function. Another is any intrinsic "utility value"
that they may have. Expectations are, as mentioned, assumed to be stable
because of our principal focus in this paper on shocks that are difficult
or impossible to anticipate.

     4When both countries' households are rationed in either goods market,
then rationing rules must be defined to allocate available supplies (Y1 —
                                                                         G1)
between domestic and foreign buyers. Such rationing rules further constrain
the household maximization process. For examples: (i) ration according to
historical shares ——           =
                            (C/Ci)              (Cj/C)o;
                                              (ii) ration the larger purchaser
only —— C.,. =        mm   (X., (0.5) times (Y., —    Gi),     C1. =          — C1 —
                                                                                       C;
                                                               =
(iii) discriminate against foreign buyers ——
                                                          C1       mm   (X.1, Y. —     C.),
C. =    Y.1   —G1 —Cii

     5lnstantaneous clearing In the foreign exchange market remains character-
istic even under "fixed" exchange rates and managed floating, once account is
taken of both private (firm and household) and official (government) supplies
and demands. Excess private supply of or demand for foreign exchange still
exist in this case, however, and hence a "balance of payments" can be defined.
But the exchange rate is nevertheless flexible, and responsive to both govern-
ment intervention and private action.

     6This can be seen by summing the household and government budget con-
straints ((2) and (7)), adding and subtracting exports of goods (p1X12 if
unconstrained) and rearranging the result in order to apply the sub'stitution
of (M12 —      —       —
          M2) r(M21 M21) for —p1X2 + rp2X21 from (8):

from which, using (1):
                       =        —

     7mere are many reasons why export prices will differ in equilibrium
from domestic prices, including taxes, transport costs, and price dis-
crimination (Kravis and Lipsey (1971, 1977)). The text describes how price
controls and extraordinary sluggishness can cause the actual wedge between
export and domestic prices to diverge temporarily from the equilibrium
wedge, creating supplier arbitrage that restores the equilibrium wedge.
Note that this would imply that uncontrolled export prices would change
at the same rate as domestic prices subject to control. In the U.S.,
between 1971 and mid—1980, the ratio of U.S. export unit values to whole-
sale prices rose at an average annual rate of only 0.7 percent per year
(International Monetary Fund, International Financial Statistics).


     8The use of specific and empirically plausible functions in this way
has illustrative precedent as a means of easing computational burdens and
alleviating indeterminacy in both the disequilibrium—macroeconomics liter-
ature (Malinvaud (1977), Muellbauer and Portes (1978, Appendix), Ito (1978))
and in the exchange rate—dynamics literature (Dornbusch (1976), Flood (1979)).

     (i4) is obtained by substituting (11) and (13) into (8) and partially
solving for r —— "partially solving" in the sense that r remains on the
right—hand side of (14) as well, in both numerator and denominator.
     10This can be seen in (14) by observing that the             would vanish
without rationing, and the w1N's could be rewritten is nominal output
(p.Y.) less current profits, where current profits are exactly equal to
firms' stocks of financial assets. See equation (j) nd oQtnQte 6 abQve.

     11We do not highlight these for reasons cited in footnote 12. But
they are easily calculated — see note** to Table 2.

     12We have ignored certain other endogenous variables, such as domestic
asset stocks (M11, M22) and measures of the "inflationary gap" because of
the international focus of our paper. They are easily examined, however,
using the results from Table 2, because they are recursively determined
with respect to the impacts recorded there. They, too, are influenced
fundamentally by spillovers, even with respect to their functional deter-
minants, making conclusions that rely on "stable" behavior (e.g., the
demand for cash balances or the Phillips curve) doubtful at best. Each
country's aggregate "inflationary gap" or "shortage" (D1,D2) would be
best measured by the excess of notional demand facing its domestic
producers over available supply:

                    =            +              + r N1) +    + G1 —
                        ct1(w1N1         + M1

                    =                0     0        0
                                 + 112 + M12/r +        + X21 +
               D2       2(w2N2

It is worth noting the implicit international interdependence of inflationary
gaps in these equations. The unconstrained X12 and X21 should be obtained
                                   F3


from equations (11), and will reflect spillovers. Hence         will depend
through X12 on rationing in country 2 (C22, which will be reflected in

D2), and    will depend likewise on rationing in country 1 (Ca, which will
be reflected in D1). International transmission of rationing, gaps, and
shortages is discussed below and in Appendix A.

     13Comparisons of the left—hand side results to their counterparts on the
right—hand side provide an elementary sensitivity analysis for the calcula-
tions. All of the results are quantitatively robust to the one change in
parameters implicit in focussing on one region compared to the other. The
two stylized regions are asymmetric in that:  (i) the U.S. is wealthier
relative to its income than the rest of the world (about 20% better endowed
with liquid wealth relative to income); (ii) the U.S. is more "open" than the
rest of the world taken together (trade is about 10 percent of output, rather
than 5 percent; liquid liabilities to foreigners are around 9 percent of
liquid wealth, rather than 4 percent); and (iii) the U.S. is a net debtor
on liquidity account (net international indebtedness equal to roughly 2 per-
cent of liquid wealth) whereas the rest of the world is a net creditor (net
claims on the U.S. equal to roughly 1 percent of rest—of—world liquid wealth).




    14Note * to Table 2 describes the way to determine the impacts of an
incomes policy that favors profits.

    15The impacts of a guidelines program that allowed permissible wage
increases to exceed permissible price increases by the amount that produc-
tivity increases exceeded a critical value (maybe zero) can be calculated
by adding the entries in the "w" column to those in the "a1" column. It
will be observed that this kind of productivity—conditioned incomes policy
has qualitatively opposite effects to unconditional incomes policies that
favor wages.

     16See Appendix C below and note **   to   Table 2.

     17This conclusion has nothing to do with "small—country effects." The
two regions are in ratio roughly 1:2 in size. See footnote 13.

     18The effect of a region's output growth on its inflationary gap (D.
from footnote 12) is negative and substantial ——     revealed   in elasticities
of 15 or so in absolute value.

      '9Note that Table 2's entries also suggest that wage—price guide-
lines, "progressive" incomes policies, fiscal expansion, and technological
sluggishness will "weaken" a nation's current account. Under floating
exchange rates, there would be a concomitant "improvement" in the capital
account ((1412 —      —       —                                 —       —
                M2)                  for country 1; (M21 —
                       r(M21   M1)                        M1)    (1412   M2)/r
for country 2)) that is not directly revealed in Table 2 because of its focus
on asset stocks rather than asset flows. It is worth noting that
all shocks cause real commodity exports (X.. for country i) to move
parallel with commodity imports (X,. for country i), and also to move
parallel with stocks of liabilities to foreigners       which themselves
move parallel with the stock of claims on foreigners (M21). This seems
to suggest the possibility of simultaneous surpluses (or deficits) on both
"real" current account and capital account. Such "real" changes are of
course consistent with cleanly floating exchange rates, and are actually
accommodated by them to bring about market—clearing in the foreign exchange
market through re—valuation of commodity trade and through capital gains or
losses on existing portfolio positions (M2 and
                       FOOTNOTES TO APPENDIX A



     Alintervention in the foreign exchange market (purchases of or
sales from official currency hoards) would necessarily alter stocks of
liquidity available to the public, and would have to be added to or sub-
tracted from the right—hand side of equation (8) (the government's budget
constraint). Official—reserve transactions with the public would also
provide a sink for any excess stock supply/demand of liquidity, additional
to those discussed in footnote 6.


     A2Table Al records only elasticities of
                                            X12, X21, M12, M21, C11, and
C22 with respect to various shocks. These are all "real" magnitudes. The
corresponding elasticities for domestic—currency values of the same variables
are either identical or differ numerically by 1. The corresponding elasti-
cities for foreign—currency values are, under fixed exchange rates, equal to
those for domestic—currency values. Terms—of—trade and welfare effects are
not immediately relevant under fixed exchange rates, since current— and
capital—account changes are financed out of official reserves (although one
might attach welfare significance to such changes in reserves, and reserve
losses may just postpone the exchange—rate, terms—of—trade and welfare
effects described in Table 2 of the text).

       Measures of liquid wealth were chosen because of the belief that it,
rather than illiquid wealth, would be the sink for spillover effects due
to temporary non—market—clearing. For the same reason, only it appears
explicitly in household budget constraints (equations (2) of the text),
and as an influence on the exchange rate (equation (8) of the text).


       c3m15 proportion may seem unduly large, since given log—linear utility
functions (unit—price—elastic demand functions), and given repressed
inflation and the fixed output supply (Y1) that would accompany excess demand
in the labor market, 6 percent gaps would correspond to sluggish or con-
trolled prices that were roughly 6 percent below market—clearing levels.
Given classical unemployment, however, with excess supply in the labor market
and output supply elasticities of roughly 3 (S/(l_6), as shown below) with
respect to price, 6 percent gaps would correspond to holding prices only 1.5
percent below market—clearing levels. ?thd in any event: (1) outright
shortages represent only a fraction of inflationary gaps, the remainder
being accounted for by delivery delays; (ii) shortfalls of current pro-
duction over "normal" demand may be considerably smaller than 6 percent,
which is a proportion that is mushroomed by previous periods' accumulated
shortages, deferred purchases, and spillover effects.


     C4Employment is determined by setting labor's marginal product equal
to its real wage; which for (10) implies:
