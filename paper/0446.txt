      The Evolution of the American Labor Market, 1948-1980


                              ABSTRACT


     The United States' Labor Market has experienced significant changes

in the composition of the work force, the type of work performed, the

institutional rules of operation and the structure of wages, employment,

and unemployment since World War II.     Some of these changes continue historic

trends while others have diverged from developments in earlier decades.      This

paper identifies seven of the most important changes, documents their

magnitude, and seeks to estimate their impact on the economy.

     The seven changes are:    1. a decrease in the rate of growth of real

wages and labor productivity; 2. a change in the age, sex, and education

composition of the work force; 3. a significant change in the composition

of labor demand and employment; 4. a decline in the proportion of workers

in trade unions; 5. changes in operations rules and procedures of firms

and unions; 6. the altered structure of wages; and 7. changes in the rate

and composition of unemployment and its relation to wage inflation.

                        Since World War II, the labor market in the United States has experienced

              significant changes in the composition of the work force, type of work performed,

              institutional rules of operation and structure of wages, employment and unemploy-

              ment.    Some of the changes continue historic trends.           Others. however, have

              diverged from developments of earlier decades to create new labor market condi-

              tions and problems.          In this paper, I identify seven of the most important

              changes, document their magnitude, and seek to estimate their impact on the

              economy.    The   s~ven     changes are:

              (1)     A decreasing rate of growth of real wages and labor productivity.
                      For the first time in recent American economic history, the real

                      (constant dollar) pay and average output per worker have failed to

                      increase substantially over an extended period of time.           From 1900 to

                      1966, real earnings increased by 2.1% per annum.           From 1966 to 1978,

                      real compensation per manhour increased by jUdt 1.7% per annum.           Output

                      per worker grew by 2.4% from 1900 to 1966, compared to just 1.8% from

                      1966 to 1978.       Slackened growth of real earnings and productivity in

                      the 1970s represent one of the major changes in the United States' labor

                      market.
               (2)    A changed 1se; sex, and education composition of the work force.

                      Continuing historic trends, the percentage of the work force that is

                      female, and the percentage with high school and college training have io-

                      creased, while the labor participatioorate of older men has declined.              The

                      age structure of the work force was also altered as a result of the post

                      World War II "baby boom".          These de!:1ographic changes make the typical worker

                      io the latter part of the 20th century different from the typical worker in

                      earlier decades and have led to different market problems.

              (3)     A significant change in the composition of labor demand and employment.

                      Continuing long-term historic .trends, the fraction of workers employed in




                                      /
                                          -2-


      white collar occupations, in government, and in the service industries

      increased in the period under study, while the fraction working as factory

      operatives or laborers, and in agriculture declined.       In Dore detailed

      sectors, there were also marked changes in the composition of employment,

      with the number of workers in some industries (i.e., coal) decreasing in

      early postwar years and then increasing in the latter years, while the con-

      verse occurred in other industries (i.e., education).       In a strikingly new

      development, the growth of demand for educated wQrkers fell short of the

      growth of supply, with the result that the quality of jobs obtained by the

      educated declined.     The sizeable changes in employment by industry and

      occupation highlight the flexibility of the work force in response to .

      dynamic changes in demand for labor in a modern economy.

(4)   A declining proportion of workers in trade unions

      In 1954, 35% of nonagricultural workers in the U.S. were in trade      un~ons;


      in 1974, only 26% were so organized --    a decline   in the extent of union

      organizati~n    of comparable magnitude to the decline in percentage organized

      in the 1920s.     The decline in the proportion organized is the resultant of

      two divergent trends:    a steep fall in the proportion of private wage and

      salary workers who are organized, even in traditional union strongholds;

      contrasted with a sharp rise in the proportion of public sector workers

      who are organized.    Thus, unionism has become less prevalent and qualitatively

      different than in the immediate post-World War II period.

(5)   Changes in the rules and procedures of operation of firms and unions.

      Three important sets of forces have fundamentally altered the way in which

      companies hire, fire, promote, and otherwise treat workers:      equal oppor-

      tunity and affirmative action legislation by the federal government; other

      federal laws such as in occupational health and safety; and the advent of

      computerized personnel files.    These forces have transformed the personnel

      practices of    companies to an· extent unprecedented since the onset of the
                                         -3-


      scientific management movement of the l890-l920s.     They have had a particularl}

      significant effect on the way enterprises treat minority and women workers.

(6)   An altered structure of wages.

      Differentials in wages by race, age, educati?n, and occupation have under-

      gone fundamental changes in the period.    The wages of young workers have

      fallen relative to the wages of older workers.     Blacks have gained relative

      to whites.    The composition of the wage package has also altered, with

      fringe~   becoming an increasingly large share of labor cost.   Sizeable

      medium term changes in the differentials paid different groups of workers

      highlight the flexibility of wage structures.

(7)   Changes in the rate and composition of unemployment and its relation to
      wage inflation.

      The average rate of unemployment in the United States drifted upward in the

      period under study.    In the 1950s, unemployment averaged 4.5%; in the 19705,

      6.2%.   The fraction of the unemployed who are young workers, particularly

      young minority workers, has risen noticeably as has the fraction in

      high skill groups.    The rate of change in money wages coincident with

      given levels of unemployment rose over the period, destroying the once

      widely held belief in the existence of a stable Phillipps curve linking

      wage inflation to unemployoent.

Plan of Study

         What are the quantitative dimensions of the seven changes sketched out

above?

         To what extent do the changes represent continuance of past labor market

developments or fundamentally new patterns of change?

         What caused the seven major changes?

         The paper seeks to answer these questions.    First it analyzes the magnitude

of each of the seven changes and the extent to which they represent a continuation
                                        -4-


of historical trends or fundamentally new economic developments.           Then it

tries to determine the cause of the changes and their meaning          for the opera-

tion of the United States' economy.


Change (1):     Growth of Real Earnings and Labor   Productivi~


            Perhaps the most distrubing   post-\~or1d   War II trend in the American

labor market has been the notable retardation in the growth of real wages

and output per manhour that began in the late 1960s.        As Table 1 shows, long-

term increases in real compensation per manhour on the order of 2.1% per annum,

which had risen in the 1947 to 1966 period, declined to just 1.7% from

1966 to 1978.     The rate of growth of real average hourly earnings (which exclude

fringe benefits and are thus a less desireable measure of earnings, but which

is   widely used in analyses) fell from 2.4% (1947 to 1966) to just 0.8% (1966

to 1978).     Concomitant with the decline in real earnings was a sharp fall in

the growth of output per manhour.

            Is the retardation in the growth of real earnings and productivity

the result of sectoral shifts in the economy, such as the reduced flow of

workers out of agriculture or the shift into services?        Analysis by the U.S.

Bureau of Labor Statistics suggest that 22% of the reduction in growth from
                                                                  1/
1947-1966 to 1967-1978 can be attributed to sectoral shifts,           which falls far

short of accounting for the bulk of the retardation.        That sectoral changes

are not the prime force at work is documented by the fact that productivity

growth has decreased in most industries: in 47 of the 62 industries for which

the B.L.S. calculates productivity, rates of change in output per employee hour

~ere   lower from 1966 to 1976 than from 1947 to 1966.      Similarly, while rates of

change in earnings differ for various groups of workers [see the discussion of

Change (6)] only in coal was the rate of increase in real earnings         higher
                           1/
post-1969 than pre-l969.        The seventies's retardation is not the result of

the changing industrial mix of the economy.

           The retardation in growth rates is also not directly explicable by the

sluggish state or the economy in the 1970s.        Regression analyses of the log of real

earnings or productivity per     ~anhour   on a trend variable, a 1970 trend, and a rnea-

sure of business cycle, the level of unemployment, yield significant negative 1970

trend coefficients.  Comparable regressions using a first difference format and
                                                   3/
using different trend breaks yield similar results.-

          Accepting the retardation of growth as real, what factors can be

adduced to explain the pattern of change?

          A   ~~jor   effect to account for the 1950s slowdown has been made by

Denison, who has used standard growth accounting methods to attribute the

decline in productivity to selected factors.       Table 2 presents the results of his

analysis for the period 1948-1973 and 1973-1976.        While Denison's period.is shorter

than that in Table 1, suffers from reflecting cyclical (the 1974-1975 recession)

as well as secular patterns and other problems, his estimates offer the best

available evaluation of the magnitude of factors at work.

          With respect to labor inputs, Denison finds little impact of changes in

workers' hours and attributes to the decelerated growth rate: the sizeable increase

in the.educated work force in the period,      ~hich   tends to raise growth, is balanced

off by the decrease in labor input due to fewer hours worked and the changing

age-sex composition of employment.      Extending these calculations over a longer

period of time is unlikely to greatly alter the results [see Change (2)].

          With respect to the other major input, capital, Denison's calculations

suggest only a modest role to slower capital formation per person in the retarda-

tion.   From 1948 to 1973 Denison finds a growth of capital and per person

employed of .35 points, compared to .24 points from 1973 to 1976, a modest retar-

dation of .11 points compared to the decline in productivity of 2.97 points.         Using

different data, Mark obtains an even stronger result as he finds that "the capital-

labor ratio grew at about the same rate from 1966 to 1976 as it did from 1947 to

1966" (p. 198), eliminating it as an explanatory factor.
                                        -7-


             Three other possibilities for explaining the retardation deserve

attention.     First is the decline in expenditures on R&D relative to national

output.   Hhile the drop in R&D may have complex effects on the economy, estimates

of its contribution to the retardation of growth using standard growth accounting

suggest only a modest impact (Denison, Griliches).

             Second is what Denison calls "changes in the legal and human environ-

ment," due in large measure to governmental regulation [see Change (6)].       While

there is general agreement that regulations have reduced measured productivity,

estimates of their magnitude are difficult to obtain.      Those of Denison indicate

that costs incurred to protect the physical environment and health and safety of

workers may explain as much as 13% of the retardation (-.40/-2.97).

             The third, and most controversial factor, is the rise in energy prices.

Some analysts place great weight on the increase in energy prices and resultant

decline in energy used in their analyses of productivity (Jorgenson & Hudson).          The

fact that the timing of the drop in productivity and real wages was concentrated

after 1973, which is roughly coincident with the rise in oil prices due to.OPEC,

tends to support this interpretation.     On" the other' hand, other analysts (Perry,

Denison, Bruno & Sachs) attribute a smaller impact to the rise in energy prices,

largely because energy use has not declined dramatically and does not constitute

a large share of national product.

          As Table 2 shows, the bottom line in Denison's calculations for pro-

ductivity growth in the 1970s, like those for earlier times, leaves the final ex-

planation open to question, for the key factor is changes in the residual "advances

in knowledge and miscellaneous determinants", which dropped from positive 1.41 to

negative -.75 in the period covered.     In sum, while there is general agreement

that there was a marked break in trend in productivity and real wage growth in

the period covered, the cause and possible long-term persistence of the change

remain open to question.

post-1967 period, or is it a oore general process?

             Table 3 presents evidence on the growth of productivity and real wages

in several developed countries and in the United States which suggest that the

retardation has characterized most of the developed countries, and is thus more

likely due to worldwide economic trends than to developments specific to the

United States.

             What stands out in Table 3 is the fact that both before and after the

period of retardation, the growth rate of the United States was exceedingly dismal:

worse than that of every country save the United Kingdom.            }loreover, though in

earlier decades slower growth in the U.S. might be attributed largely to higher

initial levels of productivity and real earnings, such an explanation has de-

creasing validity.     Despite serious problems of comparison due to exchange rate

fluctuations, there     is no doubt that the U.S. no longer has a major advantage in

real income over other       ~ajor   developed countries: by the latest B.L.S.    co~parisons,


in fact, the U.S. had lower compensation per hour worked than did 'Belgium, Germany,
                                 41 '
the Netherlands, and Sweden:-           Finally, it also is important to realize that the

more sluggish increases in real wages in the United States compared to other

developed .countries are partially attributable to the rough constancy of labor's

share of compensation in national income in the U.S. in the period,           co~pared   to
                                                                             5/
an upward trend in labor's share in several of the other countries.

           Since growth of productivity and real wages is the essence of economic

progress, the declining rates of increase in the 1970s represent a potentially

~ajor econo~ic    problem.     Productivity advances are necessary for inproving

~verage   living standards and make       numero~s   national goals easier

to attain.     Reduction of poverty, increased real defense spending, allocation

of a greater share of desireable jobs to women and ~norities, and increased

support of older persons is easier, most would agree, in a rapidly growing

economy than in a sluggish one.          In the late 1950s, the Rockefeller Brothers

issued a report comparing the growth of the U.S. to that of the Soviet Union and

called for a major effort to raise the U.S. growth rate.            If the falloff in the

1970s represents a new secular pattern of productivity growth rather than a

temporary phenomenon, national attention should, perhaps, focus once more on

policies to strengthen productivity growth.
Change (2):      The Composition of the Work Force

             In 1978, there were over 103 million persons aged 16 and over in the U.S.

work force, of whom 94.4 million were in the civilian work force.         Forty-one

percent of the work force were women; nearly half were less than 35 years of age;

and about one-fourth were between 16 and 24; approximately one in three had

attended college for at least one year and one in six was a college graduate;

over 70% were high school graduates; and about lOr. may have been illegal
      !!-/
aliens.

             Thirty years earlier, the composition of the labor force was quite dif-

ferent, with relatively fewer women, young persons, and highly educated workers.

The labor force participation rate of married women with spouse present more than

doubled over the period, and the proportion of married.wbmen in the labor force

with children under six nearly tripled.         TDe participation of men, by contrast,

fell, especially those in the 55 to 64 age bracket and non-white.         In the span

of only three decades, the work force had chaneed to a remarkable extent (see

figure 1).

             The most important change was the influx of wor-en into the job market,

particularly of married women with children.         In the early part of the post-

World War II period, most of the increase occurred among older women, many of

whom were returning to work as their children reached school age.         Nearly

80% of the growth in the female workforce between 1947 and 1965 resulted

from increased numbers of women aged 35 and over, whose labor force participation

rate rose sharply.      By contrast, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the major

source of growth of the female work force was among younger women, with         77~


of the increase coming from persons less than 35 years old.         From 1965 to 1977,

the participation rate of women aged 20 to 24 rose from 50% to 677..while that of
                                                Jj
women aged 25 to 34 rose from 39% to 60%.

        The increased p.articipation of women in the work force was related,

prestll:lably partly as cause and partly as effect" to several important social

deve10p~ents.   The downward trend in fertility that followed the postwar

baby boom was undoubtedly linked to the change     ~n   participation, though

the influx of women with children into the work force       ~kes   it clear that the

link is not the predominant factor at work.      Similarly, the growth in the

number of female-headed homes, which was especially sizeable among blacks, is

also likely to have been closely tied to increased female participation.             By

1978 only 23% of homes fit into the traditional stereotype husband-wife homes with
                                                                    'if
men eoployed and no other   ~ousehold   member in the work force.

        On the job side, the female work force was associated with a marked

increase in part-time jobs, which are largely filled by women.            In 1950,

16% of persons with work experience over the year we~e part-time workers:
                                2.1
in 1975. l2%~ and in 1977."21%.

        Because of the changes in fertility noted above, there was a remarkable

shift in the age structure of the work force.      In the 1950s, the proportion

of the work force below 35 years of age was relatively small because of the

low birthrate during the Depression.      In the mid-1960s, however, the number of

younger workers began   increasing at unprecedented rates due to the postwar

baby boom.   The proportion of workers under 35 years of age jumped from

35% to 50% in the span of only one decade.     As the proportion of the young

going on to higher education increased in the period, much of the

growth in the labor force of younger workers occurred among the college-trained.

In 1966, there were 0.49 male college graduates aged 25 .to 34 per gradua te 35
                                                             10/
years of age and over; by 1976 the ratio had jumped to 0.78.--

        The large size of the youth population has had several socio-economic

consequences.   It has, as will be seen later, altered the earnings of younger

relative to older workers and made youth unemployment a oajor national concern.

Coupled with 19605 increases in the proportion of young choosing to go on to
                                          -14-


college, the increased number of youths sparked a large expansion of the educa-

tion sector and a IIgolden age ll for colleges and universities.    Because crime is

an activity disproportionately conducted by the young, it also raised rates of

criminal activity (see Freeoan and Hedoff, 1980).

          Despite the extraordinary increase in the number of young persons and

growth in their labor participation rate, youth unemployment did not rise drarna-

tically in the period studied.     Among white youth aged 16 to 19 the number em-

played rose from 4.1 million in 1964 to 7.0 million in 1977 as the proportion

employed actually increased.     Among minority youth, however, the proportion in

the labor force and the proportion employed fell while the proportion unemployed

rose.    The differential   employment prospects facing white and black youth" became
                                            11/
one of the major problemG of the decade.         .

          One of the most surprising labor force changes shown in figure 1 is the

marked drop in the participation of adult males, particularly older men and

non-white men.    In 1954, 86% of men 16 and over were in the work force; in 1977,

79%.    Aoong non-whites the decline was even more precipitous, from 85% in 1954 to

71%.    The downward trend in non-white male participation is the major discordent

pattern in a period of broad non-white economic advance.      Both among whites and

non-whites the drop in participation was concentrated among older men, with the

participation of all 55 to 64 year old men falling by 16 percentage points.

           The principal qualitative chanBe in the labor force in post-Uorld

War II years was the increased educational attainment of workers.      In contrast to

the situation before World War   II~   high school graduation became common among the

young, while a substantial fraction of young men and women chose to go on to college

during the 19605.   Between 1954 and 1969, the proportion of 18 to 19 year old men
                        \




going to college rose from .30 to .44 while the proportion of 18 to 19 year old

women going to college increased from .23 to .36.      As a result of increased

enrollments, in the late 19605 and the early 1970s, the number of graduates
                                                  -15-


grew rapidly.        Fro~    1966 to 1974, the     nu~~er   of bachelor's degrees granted

doubled, while the          nlli~ber   of master's degrees and doctorates increased

at nearly the    sa~e   pace.          The boom was accompanied by sizeable changes in the

fields of study and occupations of new graduates, with sot:le specialties like

law or   ~illA man~ge~ent      enjoying extraordinary growth and others experiencing dif-

ferent patterns of change (i.e., engineering).

           At the outset of the 1970s,           howev~r,   enrollt:lent in higher education

began leveling off.           The proportion of 18 to 19 year old men in college dropped

to just 34% by 1974; whereas in 1969 there were 0.5 graduate level enrollees

per college graduate aged 22 to 29, in 1975, there were 0.4 enrollees per bachelor's

graduate in the 22 to 29 year old age bracket.                In some Ph.D. specialties, enroll-

ments and degrees granted fell by as much as 40%.                Stabilization or decline in

enrollment rates anong the young did not, however, reduce or even greatly affect

the rate of increase in the overall educational attainment of the work force.

Even with the    rate~bf        the 1970s,the average education of the labor force rose

noticeably.     This was because of a continued sizeable difference in years of

schooling between retiring and entering workers.  The proportion of college workers
                                                                   12/
among the young, but not in the work force as a whole, stabilized.


Causes of Change

          The economic model of labor supply, in which supply decisions reflect

economic incentives, can be used to analyze changes in female participation, male

participation, and educational investments.

          In the siDple economic             model, changes in labor force participation are

due to changes in narket wages and in the value of tiDe spent working at" horne

(the 'shadow wage' for household activities).                Increases in market wages   ~ill   raise

labor participation (substitution effect), while increases in the value of working

at horne, due to higher income of other household members, will reduce participation

(incol!le effect).

           Improve=ents in household technology, which take the form either of
                                             -16-



new machines or      tec~.niques   or of lower prices for given techniques, can

increase or decrease work activity depending on the extent to which they sub-

stitute for household time, among other things.

            The basic effort to explain participation rate patterns follows

a two-stage procedure.       First, the effects of the    ~~ges   of women and of their

husbands on participation are estimated by cross-sectional (more recently, longi-

tudinal) data.       Then the changes in these explanatory factors over time are

multiplied by their estiMated effects to assess the impact of the changes on

participation.       Because the wages of men and of WOMen have risen at roughly

 the same rate over tiQe, the model requires greater female responsiveness to

 female wages than to the incomes of their husbands to account for the upward

 trends in participation.      \{hile most studies have found that women react more

 to their   ow~   wages than to their husbands' earnings, the differences have not
                                                                                          _13/
been sufficiently large to explain the bulk of increased female participation.

Addition of other factors, such as number of children, does not greatly enhance

the ability to track the trend.          Perhaps most discouragingly, the most recent

results for the 1970 Census of Population show that the economic factors "which

together once explained three-quarters of the variation in wives' participation

rates across SHSAs (Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas) now account for

only one-third of it.       }~ny    of the variables are no longer significant, and

 the strength and explanatory power of all except the unemployment variable have
               14/
. declined."         \ve are far from accounting for the rise in the participation

of women in terQS of simple economic factors.

               One possible missing element from standard Qodels is the nature of house-

hold technology.       The household sector is surprisingly capital intensive.        In 1975,

the average household had $6,900 in consumer durables. From 1952 to 1975, the
                                                     15/
accumulation of durables increased by 5.4% per annum.--  Refrigerators, washing

machincs, and related equipMcnt became increasinr.ly prevalent in the        hnm~.

                                                 I
Although   causc-a~d-effect   cannot be readily disentangled, the growth of fast

food   servic~s   and other restaurants have come to offer a more readily available

(and chosen) alternative for one of the main household products.               In the absence

of estimates of the quantitative effect of these factors (and of the substitution

between time and goods in household production), however, we can do no more than

speculate about the effect of technology in "freeing" ·women's time.
           Another possible missing element, which must be brought into the

 story with care, is attitudinal changes, potentially associated with the

 women's liberation movement    ~f    the late sixties and seventies.         That there ·toJere

 significant changes in attitudes over the period is apparent from diverse

 opinion surveys.     As late as 1967,    44:~       of first-year college women and

 67% of first-year college men thought "a woman's pl,ace is best at home."

 In 1974, only 19% of entering college women and 40% of entering college men agreed
               };if
 with that view. Clearly, it had become (for whatever reason) more socially

. acceptable for women to devote themselves to careers as opposed to marriage and

 family.   The extent to which these changes in attitudes were caused by or

 caused the labor force patterns is difficult to determine.

           The basic economic model can also be used to analyze the decline in

the labor participation of older men.        One important economic factor that can

be expected to reduce participation of men 65 and over has been the expansion

of social security coverage, which places a higher tax on earnings after that

age.

           Another fat tor likely to lower older male participation is private

pension plans, which have also become more widespread in recent years (Skolnik)

and which typically provide strong incentives to leave the job, often in the

form of mandatory retirement.        Indeed, mandatory retirement provisions are

sufficiently widespread as to constitute a major institutional provision in

labor contracts (Lazear).     Recent changes in the law regarding vesting of
                                         -18-


pensions and mandatory retire~ent [see Change (6)] may provide an ioportant

"test" of how private pensions and mandatory retirement rules in fact affect

retirement decisions.

              Host empirical studies find sizeable response parameters to economic

variables in retirement behavior, with older men estimated to be Dare sensitive

to wages or nor:..age income than men in general (Cain & \o:atts, 1973).     Although

detailed analysis of the effect of social security on retirement is just begin-

ning, the evidence seems to support the attribution of a considerable effect

to the social security mode of retirement pay (Baskin & Hurd, Boskin. Burkhauser

and Turner, Pellechio, Quinn). Recent analysis of the work incentive effects

of social security -- the strong dependence of benefits on final years' pay,

which can increase participation -- does, however, raise some doubts about its impact

(Blinder, Gordon & Wise).

        The puzzling drop :.0 the labor force participation of black men has

been explained in part by another component of Social.Security:       Disability

Insurance (SSDI).     About half of older black men out of the labor force are

recipients of SSDI.     Because of their concentration in blue-collar jobs with

substantial risk of job-related injuries and lower wage rates. black nen turn out

to have been more affected by    ~he   program than white men (Leonard).   Still, a

significant proportion of their decline in participation remains unexplained.

        Finally. the    h~~an-capital   analysis of investment in skills provides a

reasonably successful explanation of the changes in the qualifications of the

work force.     In the human-capital model, decisions to obtain a certain level

of schooling or skill are made by comparing tW6 income streams:       the stream

tllat results from the investment and the stream that would obtain in its absence.

If. at a given interest rate r, the present value of the former exceeds the

latter plus the direct cost of the investment, the individual is expected to

choose the investnent.     Because about two-thirds of the private cost of educa-
                                        -19~




cation turns out to consist of foregone income, as opposed to direct costs,

the analysis directs attention to differences in the wages of more and less

qualified persons as the major factor in investcents in schooling.

          Analyses of the link between enrollment patterns suggest that cuch of

the postwar expansion and the seventies' contraction         ~n   the higher educati9D sys-

teQ can be attributed to changes in economic incentives, measured by wages

or other indicators of rates of return.        The growth of enrollments in the

1960s was spurred by improved earnings opportunities for college graduates while

the decline of enrollments in the 1970s appears to be the result of the falling

 return to college workers [see Change (5)].        Cross-section    (Ro~en   and Willis)

and time series (Freeman,1975) analyses find sufficiently high elasticities of

response as to account for the bulk of the changes in male enrollments in terms

of the economic model.    The slow-down in doctorate production also appears

explicable in terms of the economic factors at work in that market, although,

in this case, nonprice factors, notably the difficulty of obtaining academic

employment, may be as important as wages in causing changes (Freeman, 1980a).

Finally, the selection of particular fields of study has also been found to

respond to market factors with, for example, relatively many students choosing

education in the 1960s when the school system was expanding and few choosing

this concentration in the 1970s when the teacher's job carket deteriorated

(Hebl).   Though by no means without problems, the economic analysis does appear

to provide a good handle on the changing educational attainment of the work

force.

           Overall,if one single conclusion about the labor force is to be

drawn from the post-World   t~ar   II experience, it is that the labor supply

undergoes substantial dynamic shifts and evinces high supply responsiveness

in several dimensions and thus cannot be       vie~ed   as a stable, inflexible

component of the labor market.      Much of the variation of course, rises from
                                       -20-


marginally attached groups       young persons, women, older workers -- rather

than from the prine-age male workers.


Change (3):    Demand and Employoent

       Figure 2 highlights some of the most signjficant changes in the compo-

sition of employment in the post-Horld Uar II period.     With respect to occupa-

tions it shows a nassive shift in employment from blue-collar work, including

agricultural, to white-collar work, particularly into professional, technical

and clerical jobs.    Note, however, that the rate of expansion of the white-

collar sector levels off noticeably in the 19705.     Between 1950 and 1960 the

proportion in white-collar jobs increased by 4 percentage points; between 1960

and 1970, the increase is by 7 points, whereas from 1970 to 1978 it is just

3 points.    Among professionals the slackened rate of increase in the 1970s

is even more striking:    after increasing by 3 points between 1950 and 1960 and

by 4 points between 1960 and 1970, the professional share of employment was vir-

tually unchanged between 1970 and 1978.

       The slowdown in the growth of professional and white-collar employment at

a time when the number of college graduates is increasing rapidly caused a

&Jajor "underemployment" problem in the college job market.    As Table 4 shows,

there was a substantial downgrading in the types of jobs held by graduates,

with fewer holding professional and technical positions and more in b1ue-

collar and lower level white-collar jobs.     The modest increase in the propor-

tion of male graduates in managerial positions and the sizeable increase in

the proportion of women in those jobs is, it should be stressed, dwarfed by

the decline in the proportion in technical and professional jobs.     The Bureau

of Labor Statistics predicts that in the next decade or so the demand for

professionals will continue to exPand more slowly than supply, creating an

even greater underemployment problem.
            The reduction in the quality of jobs and in the relative earnings of

the more highly educated might expect a drop in the job satisfaction of more

highly educated workers, and, according to the University of Michigan Quality

of Work Survey, such appears to have been the case.             ~lereas   in 1969 college

workers scored higher than high school workers on an overall job satisfaction

index by a considerable amount, in 1977 they scored much lower than in 1969
                                .       17/
and no higher than high school workers.     A major burden has been placed on

employers to adjust to     tb_~   __Il..!:!W availability of college graduates for jobs
that have traditionally been held by the less educated and to the distorted

age structure of the college work force.

           Figure 2 also displays one of the most important changes in the

industrial distribution of the work force: the doubling in the state and

local   govern~ents'   share of employment in the postwar period.          By 1977,orie

in seven workers was employed by state and local governmental bodies compared

to orie in fourteen three decades earlier.          One-third of the growth of emplor-

ment over the entire f948.to 1976 period is attributable to expansion of the

public sector (including federal employees).            At the other end of the

spectrum there was a continued shift of the work force out of agriculture,

leaving just 3.8% of    e~ployed
                              workers in that sector in 1976, and a drop
                                      .            18/
in the self-employed, nonagricultural labor force.


          The increased importance of the governmental labor force            i~   the economy

has raised a whole host of industrial relations problems.             Consider, for example,

the following type of issue:          a locality forbids public workers from striking.

This same locality reaches an agreement with the public workers on a certain

wage settlement after collective negotiations, but the citizens of the locality

refuse to raise taxes to pay for this wage settlement.             The public sector

workers cannot strike.     Should wages be raised to the negotiated levels?               If

not, should the public sector workers be permitted to strike to pressure voters

to meet the agreement?     Wha.t should be done?       A wide variety of answers to

these questions have been ~mployedby various states.              As yet, there is no

general agreement as to the best mode of dealing with public sector industira1

relations problens.

       Another widely heralded shift in employment, shown in figure 2, is the

relative decline of employment in the Eastern and Midwestern industrial belt.

The fastest gro\.ing regions of the country were "the South, Southwest, and, to a

lesser extent, the West Coast.    r~ny   industries moved into the South and South-

west in this period, locating new plants in such states as Texas, Louisianna,

Florida, Arizona, and Colorado.    Industrialization of those areas and loss of

employment in New England and the Midwest became a subject of considerable

controversy, due to, in part, the federal government's alle&ed spending

decisions which favored the Sun Belt over the Snow Belt.

        The shifts in jobs among occupations, .industries, and areas are the

tip of an iceberg of changes in employment in the job market.     Among dis-

aggregated categories there were large changes in employment, with some groups

growing rapidly and others declining and with the grow.th sectors of one decade

often being the declining sectors of the next and vice versus.      School teaching,

for example, was a booming occupation in the 19605, but not in the 1970s.

Employment in aircraft and parts rose by 184% from 1950 to 1969 and then fell

by 42% from 1969 to 1977.  Employment in all mining dropped from 901,000 in
                                                            19/
1950 to 619,000 in 1969 and then shot up to 837,000 in 1978.--

        It is important to recognize that the changes in the composition of

eoployment are more extensive than the changes in the structure of wages.

The standard deviation of log changes in employment in three-digit Census of

Population occupations from 1960 to 1970 was .39 compared to a standard devia-

tion in the log changes of earnings in those occupations of .13.        Similarly,

the standard deviations in log changes in employment among two-digit manufac-

turing industries far exceed those in wages.     From 1961 to 1977 (which hav.e

roughly similar cyclical conditions) the standard deviation on log changes in

production worker employment in 20 two-digit durable and non-durable industries

earnings, exclusive of overtime, was .09.              .

              One of the fundamental features of the United ·States' economy appears

to be much greater variability in employment by sector than in earn{ngs by

sector.       Though the    ~age   structure changes over time, it has greater stability

than employment.




              The principal cause of the structural change in employment among occupa-

tions 'and industries appears to be dynamic shifts in demanc:LJor labor,            which

alters enployrnent along relatively elastic supply schedules.            While there are

other possible explanations for the concordance of large changes in employment

with more modest changes in wages, the demand/elastic supply interpretation

of the patterns appears to offer the best explanation of the observed phenomenon

(Free:;Jan, 1980b).         Some or the shifts in deraand are attributable to broad
 economic swings, such as growth of demand for some goods rather than others,

 while others are attributable to technological changes.



Employment and Productivitx

              Considerable concern has often been expressed about the effect of

technological change on the level of employment in industry.             Does el:lp10ynent

increase or decrease in industries undergoing significant technological

progress?        The impact of differential increases in productivity and industry

of enployrnent is twofold.           All else being the same, industries with large in-

creases in productivity will experience relative declines in emp10ynent since

fewer workers are needed for production.             But all else will not remain the same.

An industry with substantial gains in labor productivity will find that labor

costs per unit of output and total costs decline rapidly.             The decline in cost

causes prices to fall and induces consumers to purchase more of the industry's
                                          -26-

   output.     Hence, the decline in labor demand associated with the need for fewer

  workers per unit of output     ~ay   be offset by the increased demand for output.

              Empirical evidence for the United States in the postwar period indicates

   that the   employ~ent   creating effect of the growth of output are roughly offset

  by the disemployment effect of rapid productivity gains.          Specifically, the

  correlation between changes in output per employee hour and employee hours in

  the industries for which the B.L.S. calculates productivity indexes is a bare
       21/
  -.03:--Thus, rapid productivity is essentially unrelated to growth of employment

  by sector.     Technological change alters the distribution of      emp1o~ent   among

  industries and occupations, but does not have the feared          effect of creating

  significant loss of jobs in sectors with rapid productivity growth.
  Change (4):     Unionism

              Collective organization of the U.S. labor force has changed substantially

  in the postwar period.      Since the mid-1950s, the fraction of private sector workers

  who are unionized has fallen gradually while, by contrast, organization of public

  sector workers has jumped en~rmously.          These two changes have altered the labor

  movement in the country and the operation.of the labor market.

              The two divergent patterns and their net impact on unionization in the

  country are depicted in figure 3, which records the fraction organized in the

  private and public sectors and in the country overall.          In 1956 the Bureau of

  Labor Statistics data showed 34% of private nonagricultural workers to be organ-

  ized; by 1974, the fraction had dropped to 26%.          In the public sector organization

  grew from 12% in 1956 to 19% in 1974, reaching 34% if members of associations,

  like the National Education Association,are included as union members.          Because

  the majority of workers are private employees, the overall percentage has also fallen.

         Data on the success of unions in National Labor Relations Board represen-

tative elections tell a similar story about the diminution of private sector

unionism in the United States.     In 1950 unions won 74% of NLRB elections; in 1976

their victory rate was below 50%.      The fraction of eligible-to-vote workers in

election:; won by unions fell even more sharply as unions had increasing difficulty

in elections in large establishments.     Barely a third of workers in elections

were in districts won by unions.     As a result, the ratio of workers organized

due to the NLRB elections to the total nonagricultural private work force fell
                                              E:./
from 1.7% in 1950 to a bare 0.3% in 1977.

           While trade unions have contracted in earlier time periods -- notably

the 19205 when the percentage of nonagricultural workers organized fell

from 20% to 12% -- the drop in the 19505 to 19705 represents a sharp break with

the long-term trend and a pattern in carked contrast to the growth or stability

of unionism in other developed countries, including Canada, where many of the same

unions and firms operate.

          \Vhat explains the erosion of private sector organization of the United

States' labor force?   One important factor has been the demographic and employment

changes in the composition of the work force.        The proportion of workers who have

historically tended to be less organized -- women, the young, Southwestern workers,

white-collar workers, and so on -- have grown while the proportion in the tradition-

ally organized categories have fallen.       Esti.cates by Freeman and Hedoff suggest

that about 60% of the decline in unionism can be explained by such structural
                        23/
changes (Table 4, p. 24).--   Still, even among blue-collar workers in traditional

strongholds of unionism, there was a sizeable drop in union coverage:

             A second major factor underlying the erosion of unionism among private

 wage and salary workers has been increased managerial opposition, abetted in part

 by changes in the law.      In the early years of the Wagner Act, employers were

 severely limited in what they could say or do to oppose unionism. Since the

late 1940s, however, legal enactment (Section 8C) of Taft-Hartley and diverse
NLRB and Supreme Court decisions regarding managemeni: right to "free speech"

 in opposition to unionism has significantly altered the nature of the election

 process.     Nowadays, managements contest elections, ffiakin8 extensive eiforts to con-

 vince workers to vote against union, and often enp10ying specialized labor        ~anagement


consultants to advise or run their campaigns.         In Canada, where the same unions

and management often deal with one another but where the method of recognizing

unions does not allow for management campaigns against organization, trade union

organization of the work force has grown.

            Quantitative data from the AFL-CIO and National Industrial Conference

Board suggest that active management opposition has significant effects on the

success of unions.     According to the AFL-CIO study, unions won 97% of elections

with no opposition compared to 30% to 40% °in which management opposition was

extensive.     According to the NIGB study, unions won 85% of elections in which
companies made either no effort or a limited effort in the form of a written

.letter opposing organization; won 51% in which the company held anti-union

meetings, but won only 34% of elections in which written communication, group

and individual meetings were used to communicate.        w~i1e   these studies suffer

from potential simu1taneous·problems due to the: possibility that management

does not fight when the outcome isa foregone conclusion in the union's favor,

both union and management officials place great stress on the impact of

opposition, particularly use of expert labor/management consulting firms.

             In addition to legal opposition, however, there has been a marked in-

crease in illegal opposition to unions.         The number of 8(a) (1) cases -- those

This drop in public approval for unions has occurred within broad occupational

categories (professional and business, white-collar, blue-collar, and faroers).

According to Gallup, it has dropped oost rapidly in the past decade among

adults under 30.

            Even with changing attitudes, however, a relatively large fraction of

nonunion workers would like to be unionized.          Kochan found that in the 1977

Quality of Enployment Survey         39% of blue-collar workers would vote for

union representation in their workplace, if an election were held,

while 28% of white-collar workers, excluding the self-employed and managers,

would also vote for unions.          "Perhaps the most striking finding was that 67%

of all black and other minority workers would vote to unionize"          (Kochan .. p. 25).

While all of these workers could be in pliints where even in the absence of

management campaigns·to discourage organization the 1!Iajority 'of workers would

vote down unions, it is more likely that at least some are in plants that would

be-organized if instillNtional procedures were       <.1iffer~nt.


            Will private sector unionism continue to diminish in the future?         The

 answer to this question is unclear.          On the one hand, even modest efforts to

 reform the labor laws in the United States in such a way as to reduce the ability

 of management to discourage u~ionism, (e.g. the Labor Law Reform of 1978) have

 been defeated.       On   the other hand, unionism has traditionally grown in sudden

 spurts which were never predicted by experts.
            What are the economic effects of a proportionately smaller trade union

movement?     From the perspective of the monopoly "face" of unionism the decline.

can be expected to reduce the monopoly misallocation of resources due to
                                         -32-


unionism and, to the extent that union monopoly wage gains      depen~   on the fraction

of the labor force organized (Freeman & Medoff, 1979), also         reduce the union

wage advantage.      On the other hand, however, reduced unionism can be expected to

adversely affect many of the positive effects of strong unionism -- lower dis-

persion of earnings among workers; lower quit rates; and higher productivity due

to pressures on management to reduce costs in organized firms.       As the United
~line t~orkers   organization and industrial relations in coal have deteriorated,

productivity in union mines haS fallen sharply.       The broader social effects of a

diminished       trade union covement remain to be seen.


Public Sector Unionism

        While private sector unionism has declined, public sector unionism has

grown rapidly.      The largest union in the AFL-CIO is the State, County and

Municipal tvorkers.     Teachers have become one of the most highly organized

occupations in the country.      In most cities, policemen and firemen negotiate for

wages and work conditions.      About half of the federal work force is organized.
This organizatiOn of public sector workers brings the U.S. closer to other

developed countries, where unionism of government employees has long been impor-

tant, and alters the face of the American labor movement.      Public sector unions

rely on political rather than economic muscle to obtain desired benefits.         Public

sector unions are usually not allowed to strike.      Negotiated settlement must

be approved, in many cases, by bodies that decide taxes.      As noted earlier,

these distinct characteristics create new industrial relations issues.
         What explains the success of unionism in the public sector compared to

the diminution of organization in the private sector?

         A good case can be made that the direct cause of union success in the

public sector has been explicit changes in the law regarding public sector

labor relations.       First, states with laws that are more favorable to public

sector collective bargaining have the highest proportion unionized.        Second,
                                       -33-


 and more importantly, over time public sector organization has grown rapidly in

 states following passage of the more    fav6r~b1e   laws and has not grown rapidly in

 states which maintain laws that discourage public sector unionism.         lnone
 study, it was found that organization of police increased sizeably following pas-

 sage of    a: law that required localities to meet and confer with unions (Lauer).
 Third, at the federal level, President Kennedy's Executive Order 10988 and

 ensuing policies toward unionism clearly precipitated the successful organiza-

  tion of federal employees.    While the political and attitudinal changes that

 underlie the new laws may be properly viewed as the fundamental causes of the in-

 creased public sector unionism, new laws appear to be a necessary condition for

 organizational success.

            Concomitant with an increase in unionization in the public sector has

 been a growth of strikes among public employees, including white-collar workers

 like teachers.     In 1956 BLS data show that outside of education there were just

 27 work stoppages in the public sector.      In 1976 the   n~ber   of stoppages was

 378.   For the education sector, National Center for Education Statistics data

 reveal only two teacher work stoppages (involving just 210 people) in 1959 com-

 pared to 218 stoppages (involving 182,300 teachers) in 1975 (UCES 1978, Table 4.9,

 p. 182).     Despite the illegality of public sector strikes in most states, teachers

 and other public sector workers (except for polic,e and firemen) have come to

 view the strikes' asa legitimate mode of seeking contract changes.

            Most studies of the effects of public sector unionism on the pay of

,public employees have found moderate differences between the wages of public

sector workers in cities that are organized and cities that are not (see Lewin

for a smnnary),       a surprising result in view of widespread concern with

public sector unions and belief that absence of competition for government

functions would create inelastic demands for their services and thus, great

pow'er in bargaining (Wellington & Winter).    One reason for the modest estimated

effect of public sector unions appears to be the extensive "spillover" of ""ages
                                         -34-


across cities asci result of the extensive r.eliance of local governmerits on

cooparabflitycolTIparisons in wage set ting (Ehr~nb~rg    &   Gol,<is t~in) •   A nonunion

city near a unidncityin the same state is likely to pay wages similar to those

in the union city.    One study has fOUtld that while police in union and nonunion

cities in the same state teceiveroughly similar pay, police in highly unionized

states obtain a considerable advantage over those in less organized states,

suggesting that public sector unionism hasilldeed had sizeable e.conomic con~

sequences that escape detection from city comparisons (Lauer).            Other studie.s

have found that public sector unions have larger effects on fringe benefits .than

on direct pay {Gustman & Segal,Ichniowski, Edwards & Edwards}.




 Change (5):   Governmental Regulations

         One of the major changes in the labor market·in·post-l\Torld War II years

 has been an increased role of governmental regulations in determining market

 behavior and outcomes.     In the area of collective    bargaining~     legislative

 enactment and NLRB and court decisions have brought internal union affairs

 and the bargaining process under greater regulation than ever conceived by the

 proponents of the l.;Tagner Act.    In the area of personnel policy, the antibias

 and affirmative action ruies of the f~deral government have revolutionized

 employee selection, promotion, and remuneration        policies.     In the area of

 work place conditions, occupational health and safety acts and enVironmental,

 policies have brought governmentalr~l~s and regulations into thewor~ places

 of thousands of enterprises.       Compensation has also been affected, both·by

 equal pay legislatiori and regulation of pension plans.        Finally, through its

 taxation and social welfare programs, the government has altered the rewards

 from working and th~;'fl~or b~neithVhfch thds'e who d3.nnot workmayfalJ.

 Regulation of Collective Bargainins

         In the period under study, two major pieces of labor legislation

were enacted by the U.S. Congress.      The Taft-Hartley Act attempted to redress

what was viewed by many as an imbalance in the labor law favoring unions.

The main purpose of the Landrum-Griffin Act was to regulate the internal

affairs of trade unions to guarantee democratic procedures and reduce the

possibilities of corruption.     The laws, interpreted by the National Labor

Relations Board, the Representative of Labor (expressly responsible for the

Landrum-Griffin Act), and the courts have established the method of determining

union representation, modes of bargaining and conflicts, and internal union

practices.

Representation

        As noted in Change (4), court rulings and the Taft-Hartley "free speech

provision" have greatly expanded the extent to which employers can campaign

against unions in NLRB elections, making the electoral process more an adversary

procedure than had previously been the case.     In addition, the Taft-Hartley

Act outlawed closed shop clauses, which "made union membership a prerequisite

for a job, and permited states to outlaw the union shop, which required member-

ship after employment.     Evidence suggests that these changes have

contributed to the gradual diminution of private sector unionism.(Frccnan      ~nd

Medoff, 1976; Ellwood and Fine) •.


Bargaining Topics and    P~ocedures


        The government has also come to play a role in determining the subjects

of collective. bargaining, prescribing mandatory topics about which parties must

bargain (as opposed to permissive topics, about which they can choose not to

discuss), and outlawing other topics.     When the Supreme Court ruled in 1949 that

pensions were a mandatory topic, there was a sharp increase in the proportion of

the wage bill going to pensions in unionized industries.     In the 1964 Fibreboard
Gase (which made contracting out a mandatory bargaining topic under certain con-
                                         -36-


 .Htions) the Supreme Court noted the extent to which the original intent of the

 Wagner Act (to get parties into a room to negotiate, but not to affect the sub-

 stance of the negotiations) had been changed.

             "There was a time when one mieht have taken the view that ••• the courts

 have no power to determine the subJ"ectsabout whl."ch partl."es mus t barga i n •••
                                                          ,       l!!../
 too much law has been built upon a contrary assumption."

             A second, more   comple~   legal obligation on the two parties is   '~argaining


 in good faith".     In several important decisions, the NLRB and the courts have

 outlawed certain forms of bargaining -- such as Boulwarism, (the General Electric
strategy of making its first offer the full and final offer' and engaging in

a tough propaganda program to sell the offer to workers) -- and have sought to

interpret the state of mind called "good faith".         As there are no obligations to

reach an agreement, however, it is unclear what effect the duty to bargain has on
                yJ
negotiations.

Weapons of Conflict

            The Taft-Hartley Act   outla~ed   certain forms of conflict, making it an

unfair labor practice for unions, as well as managments, to coerce employees,

for instance by masspicketing,to engage in secondary boycotts, and to strike

for jurisdictional purposes.       The Landrum-Griffin Act added "hot cargo" clauses

(in which management agrees to refuse to deal with other enterprises having

labor disputes) to the list of illegal weapons of conflict.

Internal Union Practices

            Far-reaching federal controls on the governance of unions were established

by the Landrum-Griffin Act, passed following the sensational HcClellan Committee

hearings on criminal elements in trade unions:        the electoral procedures in unions

"Here   brought under the law; a "bill of rights" was enacted to guarantee normal

1emocratic freedoms to members;      trusteeships over locals were restricted; and union

leaders ordered to report     cert~in Hnanc:l.aitrailsac:tiohs.
            To some extent the extensive anddet:ailedregulatioh of collective
                                      -37-

bargaining and internal union.democracy may be a necessary concomitant of the use of

government-regulated elections to establish unions.        Once the governnent has set

up a procedure for organizing, next it can reasonably be expected to concern

itself with the process and outcome.

Antibias Regulation of Personnel Policies

         No institutional change has transfor~ed the labor market more than

the outlawing of discriminatory employment practices by Title VII of the Civil

Rights Act of 1964 and the requirement that federal contractors engage in

Affirmative Action under Executive Order 11246.       "The world of the personnel manager

was changed drastically as the EEO and the courts have enforced and implemented

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act" (Miner and Miner, p.4).         Hany traditional modes of

recruiting, testing, and selecting workers.were ended by the EEO laws, replaced

by Affirmative Action searches and "fast tracks" to promote women and minorities.

As Table 4 indicates, a whole set of new personnel practices were initiated as a

result of the Equal Employment Opportunity pressures      ·o~   the government.   As the

Bureau of National Affairs puts it:

         Equal Employment Opportunity (£EO) Programs complete with
         Affirmative Action Plans (AAP) are viewed as 'a fact of
         life' by nearly all employers, and the personnel function
         has changed in a variety of ways as a' result of the
         government's efforts to enforce the employment provisions
         of the act (p. 1).
          The nuscle behind the EEO effort has been the court decisions, whic;l first

 tended to weigh heavily the interests of protected groups as opposed to other workers.

Through the early 1970s most court decisions tended to favor active Equal Employ-

ment and Affirmative Action programs.        In the mid and late 1970s, however, the

tone of court decisions changed.   Instead of Griggs Power, which came down heavily

against employment tests with disparate effects, there was Washington vs. Davis,

which supported tests for the District of Columbia police force.          Instead of finding

discriIaination on the basis of statistical disparities., additional inforL1ation on

specific cases of discrimination was also required in several cases. ·In the Weber

Case the entire notion of voluntary affirmative action that involved inverse dis-

crimination came under attack.     The decision of the court in favor of Kaiser Steel

and the Steelworkers may have drawn the bounds, however, on the changed direction

of court decisions.

            There is a wide variety. of evidence indicating that governmental

equal employment efforts have substantially improved the economic position

of black workers.     As Table 5 indicates, there was a marked acceleration in

biack economic progress post-1964, when the federal antibias effort began

(Title VII of the Civil Rights Act outlawing discrimination took      eff~ct   on

July 1, 1965).     As might be expected given pressures of affirmative action pro- ..

grams to place and pronate minorities into higher level jobs that were previously

closed to thee, many of the gains were concentrated among the better educated and

skilled.   For the first time in American history, blacks began to obtain manager-

ial and professional jobs in major corporations •. The most rapid gains were made,

it is important to recognize, by young blacks and by black women, both of whom

attained rough economic parity with whites in many markets.     Finally, most studies

of the employment of blacks have found greater increases in employment in companies

influenced by federal antibias and affirmative action pressures than in companies

that are less influenced by such pressure (Burman, Ashenfelter & Heckman, Heckman

and Wolpin; see Goldman and Smith for an exception).

           w~ile    most would agree that at least some of the post-l964 black
economic progress is due to the effect of antibias laws on company employment

practices, some have cited other factors as being important    a~   well.   Welch

stresses improvements in the quality of education obtained by blacks, while

Butler and Heckman suggest that reduced work force participation of black
                                                                            28{
relative to white workers may also ,have contributed to the observed changes.--

           Though apparently less affected, the position. of women appears to

have also improved, in some respects, by the federal laws.    Some women were moved

into traditionally male occupations and others benefited from special promotion

 policies designed to alleviate: under-representation in high level jobs.

S;omputerization

           In addition to EEO pressures, the personnel practices of major corpora-

tions were also greatly affected by new computer techniques in the period.           For

the first tiQe companies have computerized personnel files available (some put

together as a result of court cases regarding discrimination) which permit more

detailed and rigorous tracking and analysis of internal labor markets.           The new

technology has begun and will continue to transform personnel policy into

a more integral part of corporate policy making.

Other Market Regulations

           The federal government enacted several other      ~ajor   pieces of legislation

regulating the labor market in the period under study.         Among the most important

were:

           (a)     The Coal Hine Health and Safety Act (1969), which established

dust and ventilation standards in mines and compensation for victims of black lung

disease.     In the   year~   following the Act, fatality rates fell in bituminous coal,

apparently, at least partially, as a result of the regulations (Connerton).

           (b)     The Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970 (OSHA), which requires

that places of employment be free from "recognized hazards that are causing or are

likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees" and mandates the

Department of Labor to promulgate and enforce occupational health and safety

standards.       Despite the significant powers given to OSHA and efforts of the agency

to monitor work places, it is generally agreed that OSHA failed to live up to

its potential for reducing job injury and disease.         There is increasing realiza-

tion of the cOQplexities involved with health and safety prob1eQs, which will

not yield to simplistic strategies based on simple approaches (see Ashford,

SQith, Viscusi).
             (c)   The Employee Retirement. Income Security Act, which ffiandated that

all retirement plans be vested after ten years, established financial stan-
                                        -42-

dards for pensions, and ~hich provided federal insurance for pension plans.          As

is often the case with governmental regulations, in addition to its planned

effects on pension plans, ERISA appears to have unanticipated effects causing a
                                                     26/
number of plans by small companies to be closed down.--

          (d) Extension of Minimum Wage coverage.      While the level of the

minimum wage has not changed relative to average wages, the fraction. of the

work force covered has increased greatly, which can be expected to        increase

its effect.    In 1947 56% of workers were covered by the minimum wage; by 1963

the fraction covered had risen to     79%.

              (e)   Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which outlaws discrimination

against workers between the ages of 40 and 70, and the Rehabilitation Act of

1973, which outlaws discrimination against handicapped workers.


Sepnding and Taxation

              In addition to direct regulations, the government has influenced the

operation of the labor market through its social insurance and welfare manpower

training and taxation policies.      In the post-World War II period, many new pro-

grams were initiated and expenditures on existing programs increased while. tax

rates rose significantly.

          In 1960 the United States federal expenditure on manpower programs was

approximately $250 million; in 1975 expenditures were over $5 billion a year, more

 than a 20-fo1d increase.     The legislative cornerstone of this expansion is the

Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 (CETA), and its subsequent

amendments, which is designed to provide       training,emplo)~ent,   and related ser-

vices for economically disadvantaged, unemployed, and under-employed persons.            The
                    .           .
major titles of CETA authorize: a nationwide program of eI:lployment and training

services, including training, employment, counseling, testing, and placement ad-

ministered for the most part by state and local govern::lents; transitional public

service employment and other manpower services in areas with high rates of un-
                                          -43-

employment; nationally sponsor,ed training and job placement progr~II:s for such

special groups as youth, criminal        offenders~   persons of limited English-speaking

abili'ty, seasonal farmworkers, and others with particular market disadvantages;

the Job Corps program of intensive education, training, and counseling for dis-

advantaged youth; and temporary emergency public service jobs to reduce the

impact"of hiBh uQemp10yment.         For persons on we1fare,the Work Incentive (WIN)

Program is designed to provide comparable aid in obtaining skills and finding

jobs.         In 1976 there were about 2.5 million persons in CETA programs and over

two million registered for WIN.        While the results of studies of manpower training

(Ashenfelter) •

              Other programs gave direct financial aid to persons unable to work or

temporarily out of work.        Public, social welfare expenditures broadly defined,

the most important of which is Aid to Dependent Children, which provides money

largely for families lacking a male head of household, increased drastically in

the 1960s and 1970s, from 10% of GNP in 1960 to 19% in 1975.               Other major
        '.,
programs include Social Security disability insurance, and workmen's compensa-

tion, which assist persons injured at work.           Another set of programs seeks

to provide funds for particular types of purchases.           In 1976, $5.6 billion
were given in Food Stamps to help low income families with food coupons.                 These

stamps can be used only for purchases of food.           Hedicare similarly provides

funds for the medical expenses of older persons.  Yet another, Unemployment
                                                              29/
Insurance, provides money for persons who have lost their job.--

               The effects of these various programs are two-fold.     On the one hand,

they clearly raise the economic well-being of persOns suffering economic distress.

One estimate of the net effect of the welfare programs suggests that upwards of
                                                                      30/
16 million persons have been raised above the official poverty level.     On the

other hand, the programs 'also reduce the incentive to work and thus reduce labor

force participation.
                                    -44'-

        On the taxation side, the gap between before and after tax earnings has

grown steadily in the post-World War II period, as a result of increases in

income, social security and other taxes.    In 1949 taxes took up 23% of net

national product;   in 1975 taxes amounted to 33% of net national product (IDIP).      In

1949 the individual federal income taxes were 7.6% of NNP, while social insurance

taxes accounted for 2.3%.   By 1979 the income tax share was 11. 5% and the social

security share 7.2%.   While there does not exist a set of widely accepted estimates

of the effect of taxes on the quantity, quality and effort devoted to work, many

believe that the increased gap between what employers pay and what workers re-
                                                        31/
ceive in earnings has significantly affected the market.--

Change (6):   Structure and Composition of Wages

        Once thought of as relatively inflexible, the structure of wages in the
Uni ted States, by which I mean the differentials pi:lid workers categorized in

various ways, underwent significant change in the    post-~~orld   War II period.   Edu-

cated workers, young workers, and many highly skilled workers had slower increases

in wages than less educated, older or less skilled   w~rkers   in the 1970s after

more rapid increases in the 1950s and 19605.    Black workers, as noted, had greater

increases in earnings than white workers.    While differentials may not have

changed as rapidly as might be desired for optimal allocation of workers or elimi-

nation of discriminatory differences, there is no gainsaying the flexibility of

relative wages in responding to the changes in the supply-demand balance.

         Table 6 summarizes evidence on some of the principal changes in the wage

structure in post-World War II years.

Education

         One of the most widely heralded changes in the structure of wages has

been the decline in the advantage received by college graduate cen.       As the

 table shows, from the 1950s through the 1960s, college men earned a sizeable

 differential over men with just high school training.    In the 1970s, however, the

 differential eroded rapidly -- part and parcel of the declining occupational

 position of graduates depicted in Table 3 earlier.     The drop in the advantage

 to college workers was most pronounced among the young, with starting bachelor's

graduates in several cases earning much less in real terms in the mid-1970s than

comparable workers earned at the end of the 1960s.     For instance, the real pay

for beginning B.S. science majors dropped by 21% from 1969 to 1975 and that of
                                            32/
social science or humanities majors by 23%.     Since the direct costs of college

rose in the period, the rate of return to college fell carkedly which in turn

lowered enrollment rates among young persons.

         The principal cause of the decline in the relative earnings of

young college graduates appears to be the enormous increase in the number of

graduates in the 1970s -- the result of the high fraction of (baby boom) young

persons enrolling for higher   ~ducation      rather than decreased demand for

college relative to high school graduates.     Viewed.strictly from a human capital

investment interpretation, however, an alternative explanation of the change

can be developed: namely that the wages of young graduates have fallen because

graduates are caking greater investcents in on-the-job training as a means of

coping with the increased supply.    This view suggests that the

earnings of the workers who graduated in the 1970s will rise rapidly in the

1980s (Welch & Smith).  While the long-term significance of the depressed college
                               .                          33/
market of the 1970s thus will rtot be clear for some time,-- thecha.nges of the

period show dramatically the impact of supply and demand on relative earnings

and investments in skills.
          Another important change in the structure of wages has been a marked

twist in age-earnings profiles.     As Table 6 shows, in 1968 25-34 year old men

earned 15% less than 45-54 year old men.     By 1975 the differential had risen to

21%.   Among college men, the ratio of 25-34 year. aIds earnin5s to those of

45-54 year olds fell from .72 in 1968 to .61 in 1975.     The remarkable increase in

the income advantage of older over young male workers in the period appears to

be primarily due to the changed age composition of the work force noted earlier,

apparently because younger and older male workers are imperfect substitutes in
                                       -47-

 production.     It previously eased the inflow of the large numbers 'of young

workers of the period into employQent and enabled the market to adjust to the

baby boom cohort without oassive increases in youth unemployment.      It may also

have created, however, a lifetillle· "cCiI.ort earnings gap" for the entrants of the

1970s.     Whether the sizeable drop in the earnings ·of the young in the 1970s will

persist, however, remains to be seen     (Welch and Smith).

Specific Skills Groups

           Workers in certain occupational and industrial groups also experienced

marked changes in earnings relative to other workers in the postwar period.       In

the 1960s,construction average hourly earnings zoomed, rising from 1.26 times

those in manufacturing in 1947 to 1.56 times those in manufacturing in 1969,

only to fall to 1.37 times those in manufacturing by 1979.      Scientists, engineers,

college faculty and doctorate personnel enjoyed substantial increases in income

in the sixties and sluggish increases in the seventies.. Workers in the oil

industry had sizeable gains in the 1970s, as did those in coal.

           Overall, the pattern of the 1970s was toward lower differentials between

more and less skilled workers, in contrast to stable or rising differentials in

the 1950s and 1960s.     As in other changes in the wage structure, the prime reason

appears to be shifts in the demand for those workers compared to the supply.

           Finally, as noted earlier, one of the oajor changes in the wage structure

occurred along the racial dimension.     Black-white differences diminished signifi-

cantly, apparently as a result of increased demand for labor spurred by govern-

mental EEO efforts.

Significance

           The finding that relative wages have changed in the postwar

period in response to labor market conditions sugbests that the price system has

at the least operated in the right direction in rewarding and allocating workers among

sectors.    According to the post-war experience, largeillcrcdses in numbers of

workers in particular groups, relative to demand, produced sizeable drops in
                                            -48-
wages relative to those of other workers, while large decLeases had the

opposite effect.



Composition of the Wage Bill

         Table 7    docu~ents    another important chan&e in the pattern of wage payments

in the U.S.:     the increased importance of fringe or supplementary benefits.                    By

1977 over one-third of compensation in major companies consisted of fringes, with

pension plans, vacation and holiday pay, and health insurance constituting

the bulk of privately agreed-upon fringes and social security, the most important

component of legally-required payments.

         There are several reasons for the growth of fringe benefits:                      the tax

advantages which accrue to most fringes, increased worker desires for certain bene-

fits.as incomes rise, union pressures for fringes following rulings that fringes

are valid bargaining topics (fringe benefits are n larger share of wage bills in

union than in nonunion companies) and changes in social security and other l;:at.fQ.

         While there are serious problems in international comparisons of wage

bills, particularly with regard to the institutional structure of work forces.

 (distinction between regular and temporary workers, for example) available

data suggest that the tendency for          a   larger share of compensation to take the

 form of fringes is not unique to the United States, and that the ratio of

supplementary payments to earnings in the U.S. is by no means high on an inter-

national scale.

          The increased role of supplementary or fringe benefits has substantially

changed the nature of renumeration for work and complicated the meaning to be

attached to "wages".    Hhether workers behave differently when a sizeable proportion

of their pay does no.t appear in the weekly pay check than when it does has not

been seriously investigated, however.



Change (7):   Unemployl:lent and tolage Inflation

          From the point of view of national policy two basic labor market problems

plague national economics:     unemployment and hourly wage inflation.     In the post-

World tolar II period under study, the level of unemployment' drifted up·...ards. the

composition pf unemployment changed, and there was a significant change in the

level of wage inflation and its link to unemployment and aggregate economic activity.

Level of Composition and   Unemploymen~


          The level of unemployment in the United States appears to have increased

in the 1970s relative to the 1950s and 1960s.        From 1950 to 1959 unemployment

averaged 4.5% per year, with a range from 2.9% to 6.8%.        From 1960 to 1969, the

average was slightly higher at 4.8%, with a range from 3.5% to 6.7%.   From 1970 to
                                                                           34/
1977 , however, unemployment averaged 6.3%, with a range from 4.8% to 8.5%.-

Analysis of the unemployment rates of separate groups of workers shows that

while changes in the demographic composition of the work force have contributed

to the higher rate, the up\-lard drift in the'1970s is not primarily the result of

changing mix of workers but is, instead, a phenomenon found among virtually all

groups of workers, though it is    ~ore    pronounced among some than among others.

~~ile   part of the upward drift in   unemploy~ent   rates may be attributable to

changes in unemployment insurance, which leads some workers to remain on unemploy-

ment compensation for large periods of time due to the receipt of funds \V'hile

out of work, nost analysts would attribute the hiGher rates of unenployment to

the state of the aggregate economy -- in particular, the level of demand       for

labor (itself af[ected by changes     i~   oil and other natural resource prices) and to
                                     -51-
governmental macroeconomic policy.   Most other   ~~jor   countries have also   experien~ed


an increase in unemployment rates in the 1970s, pointing to world market conditions

as an underlyinK cause of the problem.

         The incidence of unemployment in the U.S. has also changed significantly,

with young workers in general and black teenagers in particular having higher

rates of unemployment relative to other workers than in the past, exacerbating

the concentration of and inequality in unemplcynent.      On the other end of the

spectrum, white-collar workers and more highly educated workers have also had higher

rates of unemployment relative to others than in the past.

         The changing patterns of unemployment rates over time is examined in

figure 4 in terms of the rates of unemployment for selected groups of workers and

the rates predicted by regression of those rates on those of other workers.         When

the deviation between actual and predicted rates rises over time, the rate of the

specified group worsens relative to the other group, and conversely, if the

deviations decline over time.

        The figure shows:

           a moderate increase in the unemployment rate of 16 to 19 year old

           white young persons at given levels of total unemployment in the
..
 ,
           1960s but not in the 1970s.
           a more surprising and less noticed increase in the unemployment of

           25 to 34 year old white men relative to older workers, possibly

           attributable to demographic forces;

           a marked increase in the unemployment rate of black teenagers relative

           to the total unemployment rate.   The causes of the extraordinary

           deterioration in the employment position of these youth has yet

           to be satisfactorily explained.   \{hatever the causes, however, few

           would disagree with the propositio~ that the deteriorated employment

           of non-white youth constitutes one of the major ,socia-economic

           problems of the period.

              an increase in the unemployment rate of'white-colla:r workers,

              relative to blue-collar workers.

              an increase in the unemployment rate of professional and college

              trained    workers relative to the less·skilled and ~ducated workers,

              yet another indicator of the turnaround in the college job market

              discussed earlier.

           As a result of the changed pattern of unemployment rates and changes in

the composition of the work force, the unemployed worker of the late 1970s had

very different characteristics than the unemployed worker in earlier years.             The

unemployed worker of the late 1970s was more likely to be             young, black,and also

highly educated and skilled than in the past.

           The changing composition of unemployment suggests the need for different

policies to aid the jobless than in       th~   past.   Young unemployed workers, particu-

larly minority youth in inner cities, have a greater          ne~d   for job training and

related skill acquisition than the unemployed experienced heads of households

of previous periods.      Unemployed   profess~onal,    managerial, and other white-collar

or college educated workers also represent a new problem, for which existing

policies may be inadequate.

Wage Inflation

           Concordant with the upward drift in unemployment over the period has been

an increase in the average rate of wage inflation, creating a substantial policy

problem.    From 1950 to 1959, hourly compensation of all persons in private busi-

nesses increased by 5.1% per annum; from 1960 to 1969, hourly compensation of

all persons in private business increased by 4.9% per annum; from 1970 to 1977,

the rate of increase was 7.1%.      As figure 5 shows, the increase in wage inflation

in the 1970s despite increased unemployment appears to have significantly

rained the Phillipo curve relation \lhich once ::;uided thinking on the unet:.:l?loYtlcnt-

of 6.0Z to 7.0% was associated with 'vage inflation of 4.0% to 5.Qh, in the 19705

it was associated with wage increases nearly twice as high.         h~ile   it is not

universally agreed that the experience of the 1970s      prov~s   that there is no 10ng-

term stable tradeoff between unemployment and hourly wage inflation, there is no

doubt that whatever relation exists is quite unstable and an inadequate guide to

policy.

            More detailed analyses of the cyclic4l behavior of wages have shown a

further change in the responsiveness of wage to unemployment and aggregate

cyclical conditions in the period under study:     a sizeable decline in the reduction

in the rate of wage inflation associated with a given shortfall in aggregate

activity.     According to one set of estimates, the effect of unemployment on the

rate of change in wages has become significantly lower in the postwar period than
in the earlier part of the 20th century (Sachs).       One important reason for the

declining cyclical sensitivity of wages is the spread of long-term collective bar-

gaining contracts.    At the outset of the postwar period most contracts covered a one

year period.     By the 19705, most major industrial   L~reements   were written for a

three year period. Wages set over a three year period are likely· to be unrespon-

sive to unemployment or other measures of market conditions except in the year

the contract is signed.    Other factors, such as effective macroeconomic policy,

have also been cited as potential causes of the decreased cyclical responsive-

ness of wages (Sachs).

            The upward shift and reduced slope of the unemployment-wage change

schedule make aggregate economic policy oore difficult, which directs attention
                                                                               ;'~"




to a more disaggregated and sectoral approach to both unemployment and wage

inflation problems.

 Conclusion

          "Each generation believes itself on the verge of a new economic era, an

 era of fundamental change" (NBER, Receht Economic Changes in the United States,

 1929, p. ix).

          In three decades examined in this study, seven major changes have

 taken place in the American labor market, signif~cantly altering the wages,

 employment, and institutions at the work          plac~.     First, the rate of growth of

 real wages and productivity declined sharply.              While sOme of the decline is

attributable to sectoral shifts in employment, the changing age-sex composition

 of the work force, changes in capital-labor ratio's,           in~reased   regulation, changes

 in energy prices, and reduced R&D effect, for'th~ most part                 the retardation

 in growth is a story of changes in the famous "residual", about which, by defini-

tion, we know little.
          Second, there have been sizeable demographic changes in the composition

of employment:   more women workers, more younKworkers, m01?e educated workers,

and fewer older male workers.      In part these changes can be explained by changes

in labor market incentives, but at. least" some remain a puzzle.

          Third, the composition of employment has changed sUb~tantially, with

 the, number of 'workers .in white-collar and skilled jobs, in the South and

,', Southwest, and in local and state government employment rising while the number

in   blue-collar and lower skilled jobs has declined.             One noticeable pattern

',. h~s been that employment in skilled areas has fallen short of the growth of

 the supply of educated labor, with a resultant drop in the quality of jobs

held by' the educated.   Another   ;15   for employment changes to vary more across

 sector,s than wage changes.

          Fou~th,   the trade union share of the work force has diminishe.d 5Mb-

 stantially, with a sharp drop in the proportion unionized in the private sector

 overpowering a rise in the proportion organized in the public secfor.              Changes

 in the age-sex-:"skill mix of the work force explain perhaps 60% of the decline
                                         -59-

in private sectororgan!zation, but increased managerial opposition and
                      .                         "

effectiveness in contesting NLRB elections is also important in accounting for

the diminished number of private sector unionism.           Growth of public sector

organization appears to be closely linked to changes in public sector labor

relations laws.

            Fifth, governmental regulation of the labor market and of the internal

operation of management and labor has been greatly expanded.           Equal employment

legislation and affirmative action requirements have "changed the personnel

function.     A wide variety of acts, like Occupation Health and Safety or the

Employee Retirement Insurance Security Act, have changed the "rules" of labor

market behavior, in some cases with sizeable effects on basic economic factors.

            Sixth, the structure of earnings has      be~n si~nificantly altered   by

shifts in the demand/supply balance.        In the period studied, college graduates,

particularly the young and those in the educational sector, young male workers,

and those in several highly skilled occupations have suffered declines in

relative earnings.        Black workers have significantly gained compared to white

workers.     Fringe benefits increased in importance in the wage package.

            Seventh, the composition of unemployment and its relation to wage

inflation has also undergone tl)ajor change.        Young   black workers and highly

educated men have come to bear a greater share of unemployment.          The rate of

inflation consistent with particular levels of unemployment has increased

rapidly.
COtl)parisons With 1929 NBER Conference

            The changes delineated in this paper can be fruitfully compared to

those   exatl)in~d   half a century earlier at the 1929 NBER Conference on Recent

Economic Changes, in which Leo Wolman wrote a section on labor.

            Which of the seven changes are similar to those cited in the earlier

volume?     To what extent do our changes represent continuation of long-term

developments and to what extent do they significantly diverge from historical
                                        -60-
 changes?

             An~wers to these questions should provide perspective on the nature of

 changes in the post-World War II period.

          Four of our changes, while different in some cases in direction, have

definite parallels with those in the earlier period.

            In 1929, as in 1979, the changing demographic structure of the work force ,

due to declining birth rates and immigration wa~ of SOI:le concern.    In 1929, however,

the increased participation of women was not given serious attention.

          Similarly, in 1929, as in 1979, patterns of change in the composition of

employment -- increases in white-collar and skilled jobs, declines in farming -_

received attention.    While the 1970s may be relatively unique in that growth of

employment in skilled areas has fallen short of the growth of educated labor

there is nothing surprising    ~n   the existence of significant shifts in employment

among sectors.

            Sizeable changes in the wage structure were also observed in the 1929

volume.   Though the direction and nature of changes differed fundamentally

between the periods, changes in relative wages appear to be a .hallmark of the

United States' labor market.

          Decline in unionization in the 1920s     parallels to some extent the

decline in the post-World 1.Jar II period, though here more fundamental differences

also arise.    In the 1920s, the total number of union members, as well as the union

share of the work force fell, whereas in the post-World \-lar II period, union

membership rose, while the proportion of workers covered fell.     }loreover, there

was nothing in the 1920s comparable to the spurt in public sector organization

in the later period.    Still, in the period covered by this essay and in the

earlier period, declines in unionization were a major development.

          Three of oui seven changes, by contrast, seem to differ greatly from those

stressed in the 1929 volume.

          First is the increased governmental regulation of the labor market and
                                       -61-


 of the internnl opcrntiono of      r~nn~encnt ~nd   1nbor.   Governncntnl ir.tcrvcntion

 in the market following World War I seems to have been sufficiently modest as to

 draw virtually no attention from analysts.       Peace time growth of governmental

regulation in the recent decades appears to be a relatively unique development.

         Second is the 1970s concern over the growth of real wages and productivity,

which has no parallel in the earlier period of time.          In the 1929 conference,

continued rapid advance of the economy was assured by all:          liThe spread of

higher living standards [is] not new, but in its degree and scope it has taken

on new importance" (NBER, P. xi).      The loss of confidence in growth, due to the slug&isl

performance in the 1970s, is a strikingly new development.

         Third is the drift upwards in both unempioyment and rates of wage

inflation, which   ~')nstitutes   the aggregate economic problem of the 1970s.        By

contrast, in 1929, there was little concern with overall levels of unemployment

(which were viewed as satisfactory) or with inflation, due to an "increasing

tendency" toward price staibility.

         Finally, it is important to remember that all of the labor market

changes stressed in the 1929 conference were, of course, completely over-·

shadowed by the change about to occur -- the Great Depression, the development

of which no analyst managed to foresee.       Hopefully, the changes examined in

this paper will not be overshadowed by forces escaping current attention that

will yield a new economic disaster.

        An alternative way of showing the' changed trend in productivity growth

        and real wages is to assume that the y follow a random                        with a

        drift and regressed changes         (~)   in the variables.        (Suggested by Orley
