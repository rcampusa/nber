                                             ABSTRACT

We develop a quantitative model of higher education to test explanations for the steep rise in college
tuition between 1987 and 2010. The framework extends the quality-maximizing college paradigm
of Epple, Romano, Sarpca, and Sieg (2013) and embeds it in an incomplete markets, life-cycle environment.
We measure how much changes in underlying costs, reforms to the Federal Student Loan Program
(FSLP), and changes in the college earnings premium have caused tuition to increase. All these changes
combined generate a 106% rise in net tuition between 1987 and 2010, which more than accounts for
the 78% increase seen in the data. Changes in the FSLP alone generate a 102% tuition increase, and
changes in the college premium generate a 24% increase. Our findings cast doubt on Baumol’s cost
disease as a driver of higher tuition.

1         Introduction
Over the past thirty years, the perceived necessity of having a college degree and a growing
college earnings premium have led to record enrollments and greater degree attainment in
higher education. However, a dramatic escalation in tuition looms over the heads of many
parents of prospective students and serves as a stark reminder to graduates saddled with

large student loans. From 1987 to 2010, sticker price tuition and fees ballooned from $6,600
to $14,500 in 2010 dollars. After subtracting institutional aid, net tuition and fees still grew
by 78%, from $5,790 to $10,290. To provide perspective, had net tuition risen at the rate of
much maligned healthcare costs, tuition would have only reached about $8,700 in 2010.1
     In this paper, we seek to account for the college tuition increase by quantitatively eval-
uating existing explanations using a structural model of higher education and the macroe-
conomy. We divide our hypotheses about driving forces into supply-side changes (Baumol’s
cost disease and exogenous changes to non-tuition revenue), demand-side changes (notably,
expansions in grant aid and loans), and macroeconomic forces (namely, skill-biased technical
change resulting in a higher college earnings premium). Our quantitative model shows that
the combined eﬀect of these changes more than accounts for the tuition increase and provides
key insights about the role of individual factors as well as their complementary eﬀects.
     Existing hypotheses about increasing college tuition largely fall into two camps: those
that emphasize the unique virtues and pathologies of higher education and those that place
rising higher education costs into a broader narrative of increasing prices in many service
industries. Advocates of the latter approach look to cost disease and skill-biased technical
progress as drivers of higher costs in service industries that employ highly skilled labor.
Cost disease, which dates back to seminal papers by Baumol and Bowen (1966) and Baumol
(1967), posits that economy-wide productivity growth pushes up wages and creates cost
pressures on service industries that do not share in the productivity growth. To cope, these
industries increase their relative price and pass the higher costs onto consumers.
     By contrast, theories emphasizing the uniqueness of higher education take several forms.
Falling within our notion of supply-side shocks, state and local funding for higher education
fell from $8,200 per full-time-equivalent (FTE) student in 1987 to $7,300 in 2010, all while
underlying costs and expenditures were rising. Several studies, including a notable study
commissioned by Congress in the 1998 re-authorization of the Higher Education Act, at-
tribute a sizable fraction of the increase in public university tuition to these state funding
cuts. We take a somewhat broader view in this paper by looking at how exogenous changes
to all sources of non-tuition revenue impact the path of tuition.
     On the demand side, several expansions in financial aid have occurred over the past sev-
eral decades. During our period of analysis, annual and aggregate subsidized Staﬀord loan
limits were increased in 1987 and five years later in 1992. The Higher Education Amend-
ments of 1992 also established a program of supplementary unsubsidized Staﬀord loans and
increased the annual PLUS loan limit to the cost of attendance minus aid, thereby eliminat-
ing aggregate PLUS loan limits. Interest rates on student loans also fell considerably during

the 2000s. In a famous 1987 New York Times Op-Ed titled “Our Greedy Colleges”, then
secretary of education William Bennett asserted that “increases in financial aid in recent
years have enabled colleges and universities blithely to raise their tuitions” (Bennett, 1987).
We evaluate this claim through the lens of our model, and we also cast light on the tuition
impact of the 53% rise in non-tuition costs (such as those arising from the greater provision
of student amenities), which has the eﬀect of increasing subsidized loan eligibility.
    Lastly, we quantify the impact of macroeconomic forces—specifically, rising labor market
returns to college—on tuition changes. Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2008) find that, from the
mid-1980s to 2005, the overall earnings premium to having a college degree increased from
58% to over 93%. Ceteris paribus, such an increase in the return to college has assuredly
driven up demand for a college degree. We use our model to quantify how much this increase
in demand translates to higher tuition and how much it contributes to higher enrollments.
    Our quantitative findings can be summarized as follows:

  1. The combined eﬀect of the aforementioned shocks generates a 106% increase in equi-
     librium tuition. This result compares to a 78% increase in the data.

  2. The rise in the college earnings premium alone causes tuition to increase by 24%. With
     all other shocks present except the college premium hike, tuition increases by 87%.

  3. The demand-side shocks by themselves cause tuition to jump by 102%. With all other
     changes except the demand-side shocks, tuition only increases by 16%.

  4. The supply-side shocks by themselves cause tuition to decline by 6%. With all other
     changes except the supply-side shocks, tuition increases by 122%.

    The model we construct to arrive at these conclusions integrates the framework of im-
perfectly competitive, price discriminating, quality maximizing colleges by Epple, Romano,
and Sieg (2006) and Epple et al. (2013) into a life-cycle, heterogeneous agent, incomplete
markets environment with student loan default. In this paper, we focus on the case of a
representative, non-profit college that faces a balanced budget constraint. We defer issues
surrounding college endowment accumulation and the strategic interaction between hetero-
geneous colleges to future work. In the model, revenues include endogenous tuition and
exogenous non-tuition revenue (e.g. endowment income and state funding). Expenditures
consist of endogenous investment and non-quality-enhancing custodial costs. To prevent the
college from extracting the entire consumer surplus from students, we follow Epple et al.
(2013) by adding unobservable preference shocks to the utility of attending college, as seen
commonly in many discrete choice models. On the household side, we include several poten-


                                              3
tially important features: heterogeneity in ability and parental income dimensions, college
financing decisions, college drop-out risk, and student loan repayment decisions.
    Our assumption that colleges maximize quality—in line with what Clotfelter (1996) calls
the “pursuit of excellence”—implicitly incorporates another prominent hypothesis for rising
tuition, namely, Bowen (1980)’s “Revenue Theory of Costs.” Ehrenberg (2002) states it best:

       The objective of selective academic institutions is to be the best they can in every
       aspect of their activities. They aggressively seek out all possible resources and
       put them to use funding things they think will make them better. To look better
       than their competitors, the institutions wind up in an arms race of spending...

To make matters concrete, quality in our setting depends on investment per student and
the average ability of the student body. As a result, students act both as customers and as
inputs to the production of quality via peer eﬀects, as described by Winston (1999). This
unique feature of higher education gives colleges an additional motive to engage in price
discrimination beyond the usual monetary rent extraction—namely, to attract high ability
students by oﬀering generous institutional aid.
    To discipline the model, we use a combination of calibration and estimation. Rather than
ex-ante assume cost disease or a particular production structure (e.g. number of faculty,
administrators, etc. needed to run a college), we directly estimate the reduced-form custodial
cost function and track its changes over the period 1987 – 2010. Similarly, we compute average
non-tuition revenue per full-time equivalent (FTE) student using Delta Cost Project data
and feed it into the model. On the household side, we use earnings premium estimates by
Autor et al. (2008) and construct time-series for Federal Student Loan Program variables.
    As mentioned previously, we find that the combined eﬀects of the supply-side changes,
demand-side changes, and increases in the college earnings premium can fully account for the
mean net tuition increase. Looking at individual factors, we find that expansions in borrowing
limits drive 40% of the tuition jump and represent the single most important factor.2 To grasp
the magnitude of the change in borrowing capacity, first note that real aggregate borrowing
limits increased by 56% between 1987 and 2010, from $26,200 to $40,800 in 2010 dollars.3
Second, the re-authorization of the Higher Education Act in 1992 introduced a major change
along the extensive margin by establishing an unsubsidized loan program. We also find that
increased grant aid contributes 17% to the rise in tuition, which mirrors the 18% impact of
the higher college earnings premium. Our model also suggests that financial aid increases
   2
     For this calculation, we take one minus the tuition increase without the borrowing limit expansion relative
to the increase with the expansion, i.e. 1 − ($9, 949 − $6, 100)/($12, 559 − $6, 100). Adding the percentage
contribution from each exogenous driving force need not yield 100% because of interaction eﬀects.
   3
     We use the limits in place from 1981 to 1986 as our figure for 1987.


                                                       4
tuition at the bottom of the tuition distribution more so than it does at the top. These
results give credence to the Bennett (1987) hypothesis.
    Lastly, our results cast doubt on the role of cost disease as a driver of higher tuition.
Although our estimated cost function shifts upward from 1987 to 2010, this isolated eﬀect
reduces average tuition (a contribution of −17%). Intuitively, colleges face a trade-oﬀ between
raising tuition and retaining high ability students when they experience a balance sheet
deterioration. If they increase tuition, fewer high ability students may enroll, which drives
down quality. Alternatively, a decision to not raise tuition forces colleges to cut back on
quality-enhancing investment expenditures. We find that colleges take this latter route to the
tune of almost $1,900 in cuts per student as a response to higher custodial costs. This result
comports with the behavior we observe among many public universities across the country
of replacing tenured faculty with less expensive non-tenure-track positions. Additionally,
changes in non-tuition revenue have almost no impact on tuition (a contribution of −4%).
    We do not claim that Baumol’s cost disease or changes in government aid have no impor-
tance for tuition increases. Rather, we suspect that these factors aﬀect some colleges more
than others. For instance, if private research universities experience cost disease, they may
increase their tuition. However, higher tuition may induce substitution of students into lower
cost universities. Given the absence of competition and college heterogeneity in our model,
our estimation implicitly incorporates substitution of households across college types and
any corresponding composition eﬀects.


1.1     Relationship to the Literature
This paper fits into two broad strands of the literature. First, a large empirical literature
estimates the eﬀects of macroeconomic factors and policy interventions on tuition and enroll-
ment. Second, this paper relates to a growing body of literature employing structural models
of higher education. With a few notable exceptions, these models focus on student demand
and abstract from many distinguishing features of the supply side of the college market.

1.1.1   Empirical Literature

In discussing related work, we map our categorization of supply-side shocks, demand-side
shocks, and macroeconomic forces into the existing empirical literature. For supply-side
shocks, we analyze the impact of upward shifts in custodial (non-quality-enhancing) costs
as well as changes in non-tuition revenues. The literature on Baumol’s cost disease most
closely relates to the former, while the literature analyzing the eﬀect of the decline in state
appropriations for higher education addresses the latter.


                                              5
Supply Shocks: Cost Disease The origins of cost disease emerge from seminal works by
Baumol and Bowen (1966) and Baumol (1967). They lay out a clear mechanism: productivity
increases in the economy at large drive up wages everywhere, which service sectors that lack
productivity growth pass along by increasing their relative prices. Recently, Archibald and
Feldman (2008) use cross-sectional industry data to forcefully advance the idea that cost
and price increases in higher education closely mirror trends for other service industries that
utilize highly educated labor. In short, they “reject the hypothesis that higher education
costs follow an idiosyncratic path.”
    We find that the form of the cost increase matters. In particular, our estimates uncover
a large increase in the fixed cost of operating a college from $12 billion to $30 billion in
2010 dollars. To pay for the higher fixed cost, the college lowers per-student investment and
increases enrollment, which lowers average tuition by a composition eﬀect.

Supply Shocks: Cuts in State Appropriations Heller (1999) suggests a negative rela-
tionship between state appropriations for higher education and tuition, asserting that “the
higher the support provided by the state, the lower generally is the tuition paid by all
students.” Recent empirical work by Chakrabarty, Mabutas, and Zafar (2012), Koshal and
Koshal (2000), and Titus, Simone, and Gupta (2010) support this hypothesis, but notably,
Titus et al. (2010) show that this relationship only holds up in the short run. Lastly, in a
large study commissioned by Congress in the 1998 re-authorization of the Higher Education
Act of 1965, Cunningham, Wellman, Clinedinst, Merisotis, and Carroll (2001a) conclude
that “Decreasing revenue from government appropriations was the most important factor
associated with tuition increases at public 4-year institutions.”
    While our model finds little support for this idea in the aggregate—that is, lumping
public and private colleges together—cuts in appropriations could potentially play a role in
driving up public school tuition. Extending our model to incorporate heterogeneous colleges
with detailed, disaggregated funding data will shed further light on this issue.

Demand Shocks: The Bennett Hypothesis For demand-side shocks, we focus on the
eﬀects of increased financial aid. We address the extent to which changes in loan limits and
interest rates under the FSLP as well as expansions in state and federal grants to students
drive up tuition—famously known as the Bennett hypothesis. A long line of empirical research
has studied this hypothesis with mixed results.
    Broadly speaking, we can divide the literature into those papers that find at least some
support for this hypothesis and those that are highly skeptical. In the first group, McPherson
and Shapiro (1991) use institutional data from 1978 – 1985 and find a positive relationship


                                              6
between aid and tuition at public universities but not at private universities. Singell and
Stone (2007), using panel data from 1983 – 1996, find evidence for the Bennett hypothesis
among top-ranked private institutions but not among public and lower-ranked private uni-
versities. They also found evidence in favor of the Bennett hypothesis for public out-of-state
tuition. Rizzo and Ehrenberg (2004) come to the mirror opposite conclusion: “We find sub-
stantial evidence that increases in the generosity of the federal Pell Grant program, access to
subsidized loans, and state need-based grant aid awards lead to increases in in-state tuition
levels. However, we find no evidence that nonresident tuition is increased as a result of these
programs.” Turner (2012) shows that tax-based aid crowds out institutional aid almost one-
for-one. Turner (2014) also finds that institutions capture some of the benefits of financial
aid, but at a more modest 12% pass-through rate. Long (2004a) and Long (2004b) uncover
evidence that institutions respond to greater aid by increasing charges, in some cases by up
to 30% of the aid. Cellini and Goldin (2014) compare for-profit institutions that participate
in federal student aid programs to those that do not participate. Institutions in the former
group charge tuition that is about 78% higher than those in the latter group. Most recently,
Lucca, Nadauld, and Shen (2015) find a 65% pass-through eﬀect for changes in federal sub-
sidized loans and positive but smaller pass-through eﬀects for changes in Pell Grants and
unsubsidized loans.
    In contrast to the previous literature, several papers reject or find little evidence for the
Bennett hypothesis. For example, in their commissioned report for the 1998 re-authorization
of the Higher Education Act, Cunningham et al. (2001a); Cunningham, Wellman, Clinedinst,
Merisotis, and Carroll (2001b) conclude that “the models found no associations between
most of the aid variables and changes in tuition in either the public or private not-for-profit
sectors.” These sentiments are echoed by Long (2006). Lastly, Frederick, Schmidt, and Davis
(2012) study the response of community colleges to changes in federal aid and find little
evidence of capture.
    Our model likely exaggerates the impact of the Bennett hypothesis. As we discuss in
section 4, the monopolistic college engages in an implausibly high degree of rent extraction
despite the presence of preference shocks. We suspect that more competition in our model of
the higher education market would temper the magnitude of the tuition increase attributable
to the Bennett hypothesis.

Macroeconomic Forces: Rising College Earnings Premia According to data from
Autor et al. (2008), the college earnings premium increased from 58% in the mid-1980s to
93% in 2005. While we remain agnostic about the cause of the increasing premium, several
papers, including Autor et al. (2008), Katz and Murphy (1992), Goldin and Katz (2007),


                                               7
and Card and Lemieux (2001), ascribe it to skill-biased technological change combined with
a fall in the relative supply of college graduates.
    In recent work, Andrews, Li, and Lovenheim (2012) study the distribution of college
earnings premia and find substantial heterogeneity attributable to variation in college qual-
ity. Hoekstra (2009) looks at earnings of white males ten to fifteen years after high school
graduation and finds a premium of 20% for students who attended the most selective state
university relative to those who barely missed the admissions cutoﬀ and went elsewhere.
Incorporating this heterogeneity in college earnings premia may help explain why tuition in-
creases at selective schools (such as public and private research universities) have outpaced
those at less selective schools.

1.1.2   Quantitative Models of Higher Education

Our paper also fits into a growing body of papers that employ structural models of higher
education, such as Abbott, Gallipoli, Meghir, and Violante (2013), Athreya and Eberly
(2013), Ionescu and Simpson (2015), Ionescu (2011), Garriga and Keightley (2010), Lochner
and Monge-Naranjo (2011), Belley and Lochner (2007), and Keane and Wolpin (2001). In
the interest of space, we discuss only the most closely related papers.
    Recent work by Jones and Yang (2015) closely mirrors the objectives of this paper.
They explore the role of skill-biased technical change in explaining the rise in college costs
from 1961 to 2009. Their paper diﬀers from ours along several dimensions. First, whereas
they explore the eﬀect of only one possible driver of higher college costs—namely, cost
disease—we quantify the role of supply-side as well as demand-side shocks. Second, Jones
and Yang (2015) analyze college costs—which increased by 35% in real terms between 1987
and 2010—whereas we address the increase in net tuition, which went up by 78%. In terms
of the model, we emphasize important details of the higher education market: peer eﬀects,
imperfect competition and price discrimination, subsidized and unsubsidized student loan
borrowing, and the option for borrowers to default.
    Our extension of the Epple et al. (2006) and Epple et al. (2013) framework to incor-
porate a life-cycle model with heterogeneous agents and incomplete markets features price
discrimination, explicit peer eﬀects, and rich post-graduation outcomes. Moreover, all of
these features aﬀect college enrollment, pricing, and financing decisions. Fillmore (2014) also
analyzes a model of price discriminating colleges, but he treats peer eﬀects in a reduced
form way. Fu (2014) considers a rich game-theoretic framework of college admissions and
enrollment but does not allow for price discrimination.




                                              8
2         The Model
The model embeds a college sector into a discrete time, open economy. A fixed measure
of heterogeneous households enter the economy upon graduating high school, make college
enrollment decisions, and then progress through their working life and into retirement. A
monopolistic college with the ability to price discriminate transforms students into college
graduates (albeit with dropout risk), and the government levies taxes to finance a student
loan program.


2.1         Households
We sequentially describe the environment faced by youths, students, and, finally, workers
and retirees. We immediately follow this discussion by a description of colleges in the model.
Section 2.4 gives the decision problems for all agents in the economy.

2.1.1        Youths

Youths enter the economy at j = 1 (corresponding to high school graduation at age 18), at
which point they draw a two-dimensional vector of characteristics sY = (x, yp ) consisting of
academic ability x and parental income yp from a distribution G. Youths make a once-and-
for-all choice to either enroll in college or enter the workforce. In addition to the explicit
pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits of college that we will describe momentarily, youths
receive a preference shock α1 ϵ of attending college, where α > 0 and ϵ comes from a type 1
extreme distribution. Colleges cannot condition tuition on the preference shock.

2.1.2        College Students

Newly enrolled students enter college with their vector of characteristics sY and a zero initial
student loan balance, l = 0. Colleges charge type-specific net tuition T (sY )—equal to sticker
price T minus institutional aid—which they hold fixed for the duration of enrollment.
    Students also face non-tuition expenses ϕ that act as perfect substitutes for consumption
c. Direct government grants ζ(T + ϕ, EF C(sY )) oﬀset some of the cost of attendance, where
EF C(sY ) represents the expected family contribution—a formula used by the government to
determine eligibility for need-based grants and loans. After taking into account both forms
of aid, the net cost comes out to N COA(sY ) = T (sY ) + ϕ − ζ(T (sY ) + ϕ, EF C(sY )).
    While enrolled, college students receive additive flow utility v(q) which increases in college
quality q.4 In order to graduate, students must complete JY years of college. Students in class
    4
        To improve tractability while computing the transition path, we assume students receive v(q) each year


                                                        9
j return to college each year with probability πj+1 ≡ π1[j+1≤JY ] ; otherwise, they either drop
out or graduate.5
    Students can borrow through the Federal Student Loan Program (FLSP). Of primary
interest, the FSLP features subsidized loans that do not accrue interest while the student
is in college, where eligibility depends on financial need (N COA less EF C). Since 1993,
students can borrow additional funds up to the net cost of attendance using unsubsidized
loans. Students face annual and aggregate limits for subsidized and combined borrowing.
    Denote the annual and aggregate combined limits by b̄j and ¯l, respectively.6 Because
students can borrow only up to the net cost of attendance, their annual combined subsidized
borrowing bs and unsubsidized borrowing bu must satisfy

                                     bs + bu ≤ min{b̄j , N COA(sY )}.                                     (1)

                     s                                                      s
Similarly, define bj as the statutory annual subsidized limit and lj as the statutory aggregate
subsidized limit. The actual amount b̃sj (sY ) that students can borrow in subsidized loans
depends on their net cost of attendance and the expected family contribution, both of which
vary with student type. Lastly, define ˜ljs (sY ) as the maximum amount of subsidized loans
that students can accumulate by year j in college. Mathematically,

                         b̃sj (sY ) = min{b̄sj , max{0, N COA(sY ) − EF C(sY )}}
                                                 ∑
                                                 j
                                                                                                          (2)
                         ˜ls (sY ) = min{¯ls ,         b̃si (sY )}.

Given the superior financial terms of subsidized loans, we assume that students always ex-
haust their subsidized borrowing capacity before taking out any unsubsidized loans. Further-
more, to increase tractability, we assume that borrowers can carry over unused subsidized
borrowing capacity into subsequent years. These two assumptions reduce the state space and
simplify solving the student’s debt portfolio choice problem.
   Apart from loans, students have two other means of paying for college. First, they have
earnings eY , which we treat as an endowment.7 Second, they receive a parental transfer
ξEF C(sY ), where 0 ≤ ξ ≤ 1 is a parameter.
based on the college’s quality q at the time of initial enrollment. In the computation, we make the isomorphic
assumption that students receive the net present value of v(q) at the time of enrollment.
   5
     We do not allow endogenous dropout for reasons of tractability.
   6
     The aggregate limit caps maximum loan balances the period after borrowing, inclusive of interest.
   7
     We abstract from labor supply choice and the trade-oﬀ between increased earnings and studying.

2.1.3    Workers/Retirees

Working and retired households receive earnings e that depend on a vector of characteristics
s that includes their level of education, age/retirement status, and a stochastic component.
Each period, households face a proportional earnings tax τ .
    These households value consumption according to a period utility function u(c) and
discount the future at rate β. Workers with student loans face a loan interest rate of i and
                                             t−1
amortization payments of p(l, t) = l i(1+i)
                                       (1+i)t −1
                                                 , where l represents the loan balance and t the
remaining duration. All households can use a discount bond to save at the risk-free rate r∗
and borrow up to the natural borrowing limit a at rate r∗ +ι, where ι is the interest premium
on borrowing. The price of the bond is denoted (1 + r(a′ ))−1 .


2.2     Colleges
There is one representative college. Following Epple et al. (2006), the college seeks to max-
imize its quality (or prestige), q, which depends on the average academic ability θ of the
student body and on investment expenditures per student, I. The college’s other expenses
include non-quality-enhancing custodial costs F + C({Nj }Jj=1   Y
                                                                  ), where F represents a fixed
cost and C is an increasing, twice-diﬀerentiable, convex function of enrollment {Nj }Jj=1
                                                                                        Y
                                                                                           .
    The college finances its expenditures with two sources of revenue. First, the college has
exogenous non-tuition revenue per student E, which includes endowment income, government
appropriations, and revenues from auxiliary enterprises. Second, the college has endogenous
tuition revenue, a function of enrollment decisions and type-specific net tuition T (sY ). The
college is a non-profit and, given our assumption of an exogenous endowment stream, runs
a balanced budget period-by-period.8
    In order to avoid dealing with issues such as the college’s discount factor—not to mention
other diﬃculties associated with the transition path computation—we make the college prob-
lem static through four assumptions. First, we assume that college quality q(θ, I) depends
on the academic ability of freshmen and investment expenditures per freshman student.9
Second, we assume that colleges face a quadratic cost function for each class given by

                                                                 ∑
                                                                 JY
                                    F+   C({Nj }Jj=1
                                                  Y
                                                     )   =F+           c (nj )                               (3)
                                                                 j=1


where Nj is the population measure in class j (j = 1 for freshmen, j = 2 for sophomores, etc.)
   8
     Technically, the non-profit status of the college only implies that it cannot distribute dividends. However,
we abstract from strategic decisions regarding endowment accumulation.
   9
     We assume the college commits to a level of I for the duration of each incoming cohort’s enrollment.


                                                       11
              N
and nj ≡ 1/Jj is the measure relative to the age-18 population (for scaling purposes in the
estimation). Third, we assume the college has no access to credit markets. Last, we isolate the
eﬀect of current tuition and spending decisions on future budget conditions. Specifically, we
assume that each year the college exchanges the rights to all future budget flows generated by
contemporaneous tuition and expenditure decisions in exchange for an immediate net present
value payment from the government. This last assumption implicitly rules out any “quality
smoothing” on the part of the college and captures the fact that administrators typically
have short tenures that may make borrowing against expected future flows challenging.10


2.3       Legal Environment and Government Policy
Consistent with U.S. law, workers in the model cannot liquidate their student loan debt
through bankruptcy. However, they can skip payments and become delinquent. Upon initial
default, workers enter delinquency status and face a proportional loan penalty of η that ac-
crues to their existing balance. In subsequent periods, delinquent workers face a proportional
wage garnishment of γ until they rehabilitate their loan by making a payment. Upon reha-
bilitation, the loan duration resets to the statutory value tmax and the amortization schedule
adjusts accordingly.
    The government operates the student loan program and finances itself with a combination
of taxation on labor earnings, funds from loan repayments and wage garnishments, and the
revenue flows generated by colleges discussed above. We assume that the government sets
the tax rate τ to balance its budget period by period.


2.4       Decision Problems
Now we work backwards through the life cycle to describe the household decision problem.
Afterward, we describe the college’s optimization problem.

2.4.1      Workers/Retirees

Households start each period with asset position a, student loan balance l and duration t,
characteristics s, and delinquency status f ∈ {0, 1}, where f = 0 indicates good stand-
ing. Households in good standing on their student loans choose consumption, savings, and
whether to make their scheduled loan payment. These households have the value function

                     V (a, l, t, s, f = 0) = max{V R (a, l, t, s), V D (a, l(1 + η), s)}        (4)
 10
      The average tenure of a dean is five years (Wolverton, Gmeich, Montez, and Nies, 2001).



                                                     12
where V R is the utility of repayment and V D is the utility of delinquency. Note that η
increases the stock of outstanding debt in the case of a default.
    Households in bad standing face the decision of whether to rehabilitate their loan or
remain delinquent. Their value function is

                         V (a, l, s, f = 1) = max{V R (a, l, tmax , s), V D (a, l, s)}.            (5)

Household utility conditional on repayment or rehabilitation is given by

                        V R (a, l, t, s) = max
                                             ′
                                               u(c) + βEs′ |s V (a′ , l′ , t′ , s′ , f ′ = 0)
                                             c≥0,a ≥a

                                                           subject to
                                                                                                   (6)
                                     ′             ′
                               c + a /(1 + r(a )) + p(l, t) ≤ e(s)(1 − τ ) + a
                               l′ = (l − p(l, t))(1 + i), t′ = max{t − 1, 0}.

The value of defaulting (if f = 0) or not rehabilitating a loan (if f = 1) is11

                          V D (a, l, s) = max
                                            ′
                                              u(c) + βEs′ |s V (a′ , l′ , s′ , f ′ = 1)
                                             c≥0,a ≥a

                                                           subject to
                                                                                                   (7)
                                         ′             ′
                               c + a /(1 + r(a )) ≤ e(s)(1 − τ )(1 − γ) + a
                                  l′ = max{0, (l − e(s)(1 − τ )γ)(1 + i)}.

    In the last period of life, households have no continuation utility and no ability to borrow
or save. We allow households to die with student loan debt.

2.4.2      College Students

College students with characteristics sY = (x, yp ) and debt l choose consumption and ad-
ditional student loans, l′ ≥ l. In particular, we assume that students do not pay back their
loans while still in college, which speeds up computation. We also introduce an annual limit
b̄uj for unsubsidized borrowing that equals either the combined limit or zero (the latter case
captures the pre-1993 environment where there were no unsubsidized loans).
 11
      In the case of a default, note that η has already been applied to the loan balance in (4).

   Taking college quality q and the net tuition function T (·) as given, students solve

                                    bs + bu ≤ min{b̄j , N COA(sY )}

Note from these equations that our setup allows us to easily decompose student debt into its
subsidized and unsubsidized components. We deflate lu′ by 1 + i in the aggregate borrowing
constraint because the loan limit is inclusive of interest accrued by unsubsidized loans.

where µ0 (sY ) ≡ G(sY )/J is the distribution of characteristics across the age-18 population.
   The first constraint reflects the college balanced budget requirement, while the remaining
constraints establish the definitions of enrollment, average freshman ability, tuition revenues,
non-tuition revenues, custodial costs, and investment expenditures, respectively.


2.5     Steady State Equilibrium
A steady state equilibrium consists of household value and policy functions, a tax rate,
college policies and quality, and a distribution of households such that:

  1. The household value and policy functions satisfy (4 – 9).

  2. The college policies and quality satisfy (10).

  3. The government budget balances.

  4. The distribution is invariant.

3       Data and Estimation
We calibrate the model to replicate key features of the U.S. economy and higher education
sector in 1987. These initial conditions set the stage for the results section, which feeds in
the observed changes between 1987 and 2010 described in the introduction to assess their
impact on equilibrium tuition. We proceed through our description of the calibration and
estimation in the same order as we described the model.


3.1     Households
3.1.1    Youth

We determine the distribution G of youth characteristics sY = (x, yp ) using data from the
NLSY97. The ability measure comes from percentiles on the ASVAB aptitude test. For
parental income, we use the household income measure from 1997 in those cases where the
data correspond to the parents rather than the youth (98.0% of cases).

                                                          Parental income in 1997


                            Figure 1: Distribution of Parental Income by Ability Decile

    Figure 1 displays histograms of the parental income distribution by ability level. In
each case, parental income resembles a truncated normal distribution. To handle trunca-
tion from above due to top-coding and truncation from below, we estimate a Tobit model

                                                                       16
where parental income depends on ability. Specifically, we estimate

                                         yi∗ = β0 + β1 xi + εi
                                                                                                    (11)
                                      yi = min{max{0, yi∗ }, y}

where yi is the observed parental income, yi∗ is the “true” parental income, and εi ∼
N (0, σ 2 ).12 The parameter y corresponds to the 2% top-coded level implemented in the
NLSY97 (we find y = $226,546 in 2010 dollars). In 2010 dollars, we find β0 = $40,006,
β1 = $614.6, and σ = $48,012, with standard errors of $1,529, $25.95, and $543.4, respec-
tively. By the construction of x in NLSY97, x ∼ U [0, 100]. Hence, our estimation implies
that, all else equal, parents of children at the top of the ability distribution earn $152,900
more on average than parents of children at the bottom of the ability distribution. We assume
the joint distribution is time invariant.

                                   Ability Parental Income                  Enrollment
                       Ability     1.0000
                   Parental Income 0.3164      1.0000
                     Enrollment    0.5216      0.2952                          1.0000

          Table 1: Correlations Between Ability, Parental Income, and Enrollment

   Table 1 reports the correlation between ability, observed parental income, and enroll-
ment. All the correlations are significant at more than a 99.9% confidence level. We use
the correlation between ability and enrollment as a calibration target and the correlation
between enrollment and parental income as an untargeted prediction of the model.

3.1.2    College Students

For our specification of the expected family contribution function EF C(sY ), we use an
approximation from Epple et al. (2013) to the true statutory formula. Specifically, we assume
a mapping between raw and adjusted gross parental income of ỹ(yp ) = y(1 + .07 · 1[y ≥
$50000]) and an EFC formula given by EF C(yp ) = max{ỹ(yp )/5.5 − $5,000, ỹ(yp )/3.2 −
$16,000, 0} in 2009 dollars.
   We assume that the government grants ζ(T + ϕ, EF C(sY )) are given by
                                           {
                                               ζF ζ        if ζ F ζ ≤ T (sY ) + ϕ − EF C(sY )
            ζ(T (sY ) + ϕ, EF C(sY )) =                                                       ,     (12)
                                               0           otherwise
  12
    The NLSY79 top-codes at the 2% level by replacing the true value with the conditional mean of the top
2%. In this estimation, we bound the observed value at the 2% threshold value.


                                                      17
which reflects the progressive nature of federal grants. First, we estimate the average value
of government grants ζ from the college-level Integrated Postsecondary Education Data
(IPEDS) published by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Then, we cal-
ibrate ζ F ≥ 1 to match average grants per student, ζ, in the initial steady state. Over the
transition path we keep ζ F constant but vary ζ.
                                    1−σ
    The utility function u(c) = c1−σ for students as well as workers and retirees features
constant relative risk aversion. We use the standard parametrization of σ = 2 and β = 0.96.
We assume utility from college quality is linear, v(q) = q (and so all curvature comes from
the production function q(θ, I)).
    To determine student earnings eY while in college, we again turn to the NLSY97. For
our sample, students enrolled in a 4-year college earn on average $7,128 (in 2010 dollars).13
We convert this to model units and set eY equal to it. The mapping from dollars into model
units is discussed in section B.1.
    Recall that the annual retention rate satisfies πj+1 = π1[j + 1 ≤ JY ], which implies
constant progression probabilities for students in years 1, · · · , JY − 1. Students in their last
year, which we set to JY = 5, successfully graduate and earn a diploma with this same
probability. We set π = 0.5561/JY to match the aggregate completion rate of 55.6% reported
by Ionescu and Simpson (2015).
    Lastly, we allow the non-tuition cost of attending college ϕ, which plays a significant part
in determining eligibility for subsidized loans, to vary over the transition path. We measure
ϕ using room-and-board estimates from the NCES (nce, 2015c).

3.1.3    Workers/Retirees

The earnings process for working households follows

                                   log eijt = λt hi /JY + µj + zij + ν
                                          zi,j+1 = ρzij + ηi,j+1                                      (13)
                                            ηi,j+1 ∼ N (0, σz2 )

where hi is the number of completed years of college, i is an individual identifier, j is age, and t
is time. Households who begin working at age j draw zij from an unconditional distribution
with mean zero and and variance σz2 (1 + . . . + ρ2(j−1) ). For the persistent shock, we use
  13
    Students work an average of 824 hours a year in the NLSY97. Using diﬀerent data, Ionescu (2011) reports
similar results of 46% of full-time college students working with mean earnings (for workers) of $20,431 in
2007 dollars.




                                                    18
Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron (2004)’s estimates in setting (ρ, σz ) = (0.952, 0.168).14 The
deterministic earnings profile µj is a cubic function of age with coeﬃcients also taken from
Storesletten et al. (2004).15
    In the model, λt represents the earnings premium for college graduates relative to high
school graduates. We compute λt using the estimates from Autor et al. (2008), which range
from roughly 0.43 in the 1960s and 1970s to 0.65 in the early 2000s. To deal with the fact that
Autor et al. (2008) estimate values only up until 2005, we fit a quadratic polynomial over
1988–2005 and extrapolate for 2006–2010.16 We use the fitted values (both in-sample and
out-of-sample) for λt , and they are presented in table 4 (see appendix B.2 for a comparison
of the raw and fitted values).
    Retired households (j > JR = 48) have constant earnings given by log eijt = log(0.5) +
λt hi /JY + µJR + ν, which yields an average replacement rate of roughly 50%.


3.2     Legal Environment and Government Policy
We set the duration of loan repayment to its value in the Federal Student Loan Program,
tmax = 10. Two parameters—the loan balance penalty η and garnishment rate γ—control
the cost of student loan delinquency. Various changes in student loan default laws between
1987 and 2010 render obtaining values for these parameters less than straightforward.17 Our
approach sets η = 0.05, (which is half the value in Ionescu, 2011, and only a fifth of the
current statutory maximum) and then pins down γ in the joint calibration to match the
17.6% student loan default rate in 1987.


3.3     Colleges
We need to parametrize and provide estimates for the per-student endowment E, the quality
production function q(θ, I), and custodial costs F + C({Nj }Jj=1  Y
                                                                    ). We set the per-student
endowment E equal to non-tuition revenues per FTE student in the 1987 IPEDS data, and
then we vary E along the transition path. Figure 2 plots the time series for E and other
key aggregates. For college quality, we follow Epple et al. (2013) and choose a Cobb Douglas
functional form, q(θ, I) = χq θχθ I χI , where χI = 1 − χθ .18
  14
     Storesletten et al. (2004) let σ vary with the business cycle and estimate σ = .211 for recessions and
σ = .125 for expansions. We average these.
  15
     In principle, one could include a cohort-specific term that allows for average log earnings in the economy
to grow over time. However, we found that such a term is negligible in the data as we show in section B.1.
  16
     The “1987” college premium corresponds to the average from 1981 to 1987.
  17
     See Ionescu (2011) for changes in student loan default laws.
  18
     In principle, q(θ, I) need not satisfy constant returns to scale. With one college, it is diﬃcult to pin
down—using only steady state information—what the returns should be. With multiple colleges, dispersion

    The local first-order conditions of the college problem provide some insight into calibrat-
ing χθ and χq . The key tuition-pricing condition comes out to

                               P(enroll|sY ; T (·), q)                   qθ
                 T (sY ) +                               = C ′ (N ) + I + (θ − x(sY ))               (14)
                             ∂P(enroll|sY ; T (·), q)/∂T                 qI

where P(enroll|sY ; T (·), q) comes from the decision rule of youths for whether to attend
college, taking into account the idiosyncratic preference shock ϵ. Epple et al. (2013) label
the collected right-hand side terms the “eﬀective marginal cost” EM C of a type-sY student,
which captures the fact that students act both as customers and as inputs to the production
of quality (an argument put forth by Winston, 1999, and others). The above equation states
that colleges admit any student to whom they can charge at least EM C(sY ).
    With our Cobb-Douglas specification, qqIθ = χχIθ Iθ = 1−χ
                                                           χθ I

                                                                  . The degree to which EM C(sY ),
and therefore tuition T (sY ), varies by student type depends on χθ . This price discrimination
generates cross-sectional enrollment patterns that we use to target χθ and χq . Specifically,
we target overall enrollment and the correlation between parental income and enrollment.

3.3.1    Cost Function Estimation

Like in Epple et al. (2006), we estimate the college’s custodial cost function directly. In
particular, we assume that the custodial costs by class, c(n), have the functional form C 1 n +

                 is class j enrollment in year t relative to the age-18 population.
   To identify Ft , Ct1 , and Ct2 , we estimate cost functions for individual colleges using IPEDS
data and then aggregate them. Let college i’s cost function at time t be given by

                                                     JY                 ∑
                                                                        JY
                              cit = αi + c0t + c1t         nijt + c2t         n2ijt + εit .          (16)

Here, αi is a fixed eﬀect and both αi and εit are i.i.d. normally distributed with mean zero.
    The IPEDS data contains enrollment information but not its composition by class. To
deal with this problem and to create consistency with the model, we assume a constant
retention rate π and a five-year college term, JY = 5. Given π, JY , and total FTE enrollment
in θ and I translates into dispersion in q that is controlled by returns to scale.

                      ∑ Y ι−1
nijt = π j−1 F T Eit / Jι=1 π . Thus, the two summation terms in the cost function come out

   As in Epple et al. (2006), we measure custodial costs as a residual in the college budget
constraint, which gives us
                                    cit ≡ eit + tit − iit .                             (18)

The first term, eit , represents total non-tuition revenue in IPEDS (which consists mostly of
endowment revenue and government appropriations), while tit and iit equal net tuition rev-
enues and total education and general (E&G) expenditures, respectively. Intuitively, our cost
measure reflects the fact that, holding investment iit constant, higher costs must accompany
any observed increase in revenues in order to maintain a balanced budget. Consequently, any
factors related to Baumol’s cost disease, such as escalating faculty wages, appear in cit . Using
these definitions, we run the fixed eﬀects panel regression above to obtain {(c0t , c1t , c2t )}2010
                                                                                                t=1987 .
    To translate the individual cost function estimates into the aggregate cost function, we
sum costs over colleges. In particular, to calculate the total cost of educating {Njt }Jj=1    Y
                                                                                                   stu-
dents, we assume students sort across colleges i = 1, . . . , K in proportion to the observed
share in the data.19 Define sijt ≡ Nijt /Njt = nijt /njt as the share of students in class j at
time t who attend college i. From our assumption of geometric retention probabilities, this
share does not vary with j, i.e., sijt = sit . Thus, Nijt = sit Njt and nijt = sit njt for all j,
which gives us20

                                                                    ∑

                                                                                                          JY

                                                                    j=1                  i=1              j=1


This mapping between individual colleges and the representative college yields Ft = Kc0t ,
                         ∑
Ct1 = c1t , and Ct2 = c2t i s2it .
    Table 2 presents the estimates. We found it necessary to impose c1t = 0 to ensure an
increasing aggregate cost function over the relevant range of N . Figure 3 plots the aggregate
cost function over time and circles the realized values from each year.
  19
     We allow K to vary over time in the estimation (it is the number of colleges in the sample) but treat it
as fixed here to simplify

     We assume that i αi = 0 and i εit = 0, where the first assumption is required for identification in
the fixed eﬀects regression.

3.4       Joint Calibration
We determine the remaining parameters (ν, ξ, γ, χθ , χq , ζ F , α) jointly such that the initial
steady state matches the following moments in 1987: average earnings, average net tuition,
the two-year cohort default rate, the correlation between parental income and enrollment,
the enrollment rate, the average grant size, and the percent of students with loans.21
    Table 3 summarizes the calibration. Note that, while the table associates each parameter
in the joint calibration with an individual moment, the calibration identifies the parameters
simultaneously, rather than separately. We discuss model fit in the next section.

3.5     Model Fit
Table 5 presents key higher education statistics from the model and the data. The calibration
of the initial steady state directly targets the first set of statistics from 1987, while the
remaining statistics act as an informal test of the model. Note that, while the calibration
matches mean earnings, net tuition, and the two-year default rate from 1987 quite well, the
model generates too little enrollment and too many students with loans.
    We pinpoint two sources for these shortcomings. First, the presence of only one college in
the model generates too much market power, which results in a small calibrated value for the
parental transfers parameter ξ in order to still match average net tuition. Thus, students rely
more on borrowing. Second, by omitting ability terms in the post-college earnings process,
we implicitly attribute the entire college premium to the sheepskin eﬀect of a diploma (as
opposed to selection eﬀects). This exaggerated sheepskin eﬀect generates a larger surplus
from attending college, which the college partially captures through higher tuition.
    Despite the presence of too many student borrowers, the model actually generates smaller
average loans than in the data—$4,700 vs. $7,100. Lastly, the model nearly matches invest-
ment per student of $20,300 in 1987 and the ratio of assets to income of about 3. The
matching of the asset-to-income ratio reflects the fact that our model of households is, at its
core, a standard incomplete markets life-cycle model.


4       Results
Now we present the main results. First, we compare the model’s initial and terminal steady
states to the data from 1987 and 2010. Next, we evaluate the transition path of the model in
light of the time series data. Lastly, we undertake a number of counterfactual experiments
to quantify the explanatory power of each theory about the rise in college tuition.


4.1     Steady State Comparisons
4.1.1    Tuition

Of central importance, the model generates a 106% increase in average net tuition—from
approximately $6,100 to $12,600—between the initial and terminal steady states. This jump
compares to a 78% increase in the data. To illustrate how tuition changes, figure 4 plots
slices of the tuition function and figure 12 in appendix C plots the entire function.
    In both steady states, tuition does not move monotonically with income. Instead, tuition
in the initial steady state first increases with parental income before it starts to decline at

income levels between $50,000 and $100,000 as financial aid eligibility tightens and grants
decline. After $100,000, tuition resumes its ascent as student ability to pay increases. The
tuition curves shift up noticeably between the two steady states, though not in a parallel
fashion. In particular, the region of declining tuition compresses to the range between $75,000
and $100,000, which is largely due to the expansion in aid between 1987 and 2010.
    Comparatively, the college engages in more modest price discrimination by academic
ability than by parental income.22 Inspection of the 100th percentile and 75th curves in
1987 reveals that tuition never diﬀers by more than $700 between moderate and high ability
students. By 2000, the largest tuition diﬀerence between the 75th and 100th percentiles of
the ability distribution rises to $2,000.
    When weighing whether to oﬀer tuition discounts to high ability students, colleges face
the trade-oﬀ between a higher ability student body and the need for resources to fund quality-
enhancing investment expenditures. In our calibration, the latter eﬀect dominates. The data
provides supporting evidence. For instance, table 5, which presents selected statistics from the
data and the initial and terminal steady states, shows that investment in the model increases
by 25% between the two steady states. This increase approximates well the untargeted 17%
rise in the data. While we lack data on student ability in 1987, the model’s mean college
graduate ability of 0.735 in 2010 closely matches the untargeted 0.716 from the data.

4.1.2    Enrollment

Figure 5 reveals how the enrollment patterns change between the steady states. Recall that
the calibration targets the correlation between parental income and enrollment, and observe
that average student ability aligns closely with the data in table 5. However, figure 5 unveils a
striking polarization of enrollment by income in the initial steady state. Specifically, middle-
income students find themselves priced out of college, enrolling at a rate of less than 50%.
    As shown in equation 14, colleges set tuition by charging each student their type-specific
eﬀective marginal cost EM C(sY ) plus a markup that reflects the student’s willingness to
pay. Given that eﬀective marginal cost only depends on the ability component x(sY ) of
each student’s type, all tuition variation within ability types derives from the impact of
parental income and access to financial aid on student willingness to pay.23 Furthermore,
in the absence of preference shocks (the limiting case as α → ∞), colleges first only admit
  22
      In fact, theoretically, tuition should be monotonically decreasing in ability. However, due to computa-
tional cost, we have parametrized the tuition function more flexibly in the income dimension to account for
more variation there. See appendix C for computation details.

students that have a willingness to pay that exceeds their eﬀective marginal cost, and then
they proceed to charge tuition that extracts the entire surplus.
    High-income students have a high willingness to pay because of parental transfers, while
low-income students, despite lacking parental resources, have a high willingness to pay be-
cause of access to financial aid. Middle-income students find both of these avenues closed, in
large part because each $1 increase in parental income reduces access to subsidized borrowing
by $1 but only delivers ξ < 1 dollars of additional resources to the student. Consequently,
these students cannot aﬀord to pay the full net tuition directly and also lack eligibility for
subsidized loan borrowing, which represents the only form of student loans accessible in 1987.
The college responds to the higher demand elasticity of these students by reducing their tu-
ition, but the decrease does not prove suﬃcient to prevent low enrollment of middle-income
students in the initial steady state.
    By 2010, the introduction of unsubsidized loans and repeated expansions in grants and
subsidized borrowing induces middle-income students to flood into higher education. These
innovations partly explain the increase in enrollment from 33% to 48% across steady states,
as reported in table 5. The data show a more subdued rise from 38% to 41%.

4.1.3   Borrowing and Default

As we just explained, the enrollment surge between the initial and terminal steady states
comes primarily from high-ability, middle-income youths who benefit from the introduction of
unsubsidized loans and expansion of subsidized aid. In fact, in the terminal steady state, every
single college student participates at least minimally in student borrowing (recall that β =
0.96 and the loan interest rate in 2010 is 3%, which makes student loans an attractive form
of borrowing). Empirically, the percentage of students with loans increases more moderately
from 35.7% to 52.9%. That said, although the model greatly overestimates participation in
the student loan program, it generates an average loan size of only $6,900 compared to $8,400
in the 2010 data.
    The model also yields a modest decline in the student loan default rate from 17.1% to
16.7%. The data, by contrast, show a much larger fall from 17.6% to 9.1%. This discrepancy
largely comes from the fact that legal changes between 1987 and 2010 increased the cost of
student loan default, whereas we abstract from such changes in the model.

4.1.4   Life-Cycle Behavior

Figure 6 displays how loans, consumption, and default rates vary over the life-cycle for
diﬀering levels of college attainment (measured as the number of completed years of college).


                                              32
For each group, average outstanding loans shrink over time and virtually disappear by age
45. Considering the 10 year loan duration, this later than expected age owes much to a
wave of student loan defaults that occurs prior to age 30. Given that we abstract from legal
changes between 1987 and 2010 that increased the penalties of default, the model generates
too much default and too much willingness of students to borrow in the first place. In turn,
the upwardly-biased willingness to borrow likely distorts equilibrium tuition.
    Consumption exhibits the familiar hump-shaped profile seen frequently in life-cycle mod-
els. In particular, the earnings process follows a hump-shaped profile, and although house-
holds prefer to smooth consumption, borrowing constraints prevent them from doing so
completely. Interestingly, the eﬀects of debt overhang are clearly visible: Despite a large in-
crease in the return to a year of schooling, consumption barely changes from 1987 to 2010
for young workers who completed two years of college.

4.2    Transition Path Dynamics
Given that we have constructed a rich time series of borrowing limits, the college premium,
college endowments, and measured custodial costs, we can gain further insights by analyzing
the entire transition path of the model. Figure 7 plots the path of net tuition, enrollment,
and investment expenditures in both the model and the data.
    While investment per student in the model lines up well with the data, equilibrium
tuition follows a diﬀerent trajectory than net tuition in the data. In particular, although the
model generates an overall increase in tuition similar to that in the data, equilibrium tuition
rises rapidly between 1993 and 1997 before stagnating, while empirical net tuition increases
gradually during the entire time period. As the next section will make clear, the expansion
in financial aid following the re-authorization of the Higher Education Act in 1992 drives
a significant fraction of the rise in tuition. Although the college premium increased from
0.46 to 0.58 log points between 1987 and 1993, many middle-income households lacked the
resources or borrowing capacity to take advantage by enrolling in college. The 1992 reform
significantly loosened credit constraints by introducing unsubsidized loans.
    We can only speculate as to why net tuition in the data does not accelerate in 1993.
To the extent that political concerns partially govern the setting of tuition, colleges may
prefer to spread out tuition increases over longer time horizons rather than announce rapid
escalations. Alternatively, students may not have accurately forecast the persistent rise in
the college premium, whereas our solution method assumes perfect foresight. Lastly, colleges
may engage in some form of tacit collusion that takes time to implement, a feature our model
cannot capture by virtue of our representative college assumption.
    The overly rapid increase in tuition may also explain the divergent pattern in enrollments
between 1993 and 1998. In particular, the data enrollments increase steadily whereas model
enrollments fall substantially. Had the college in the model “smoothed” tuition over this
period, enrollments might not have fallen so sharply.


4.3    Assessing the Theories of Tuition Inflation
Now we turn to our main question of assessing why net tuition has almost doubled since
1987. Notably, our model successfully replicates this rise without using it as a calibration
target. We proceed to quantify the role of the following factors in this tuition rise: i) changes
in custodial costs and non-tuition sources of revenue, such as endowments and state support
(supply shocks), ii) changes in student loan borrowing limits, interest rates, grant aid, and
non-tuition costs, such as room and board (demand shocks), and iii) macroeconomic forces,
namely, the rise in the college wage premium.

    We undertake the tuition decomposition from two diﬀerent angles. First, we progressively
solve the model by implementing only one of the broad categories of shocks at a time, which
answers the question “How much would tuition have gone up if only X had occurred?” Then
we sequentially shut down the supply shocks, demand shocks, and the college wage premium
one at a time. This approach allows us to answer the question “How much would tuition
have gone up if X had not occurred?” Lastly, we break down the eﬀect of the individual
factors that constitute our categorizations. In all the experiments, we solve for the tax rate
that ensures a balanced budget for the government.

4.3.1   Demand Shocks: The Bennett Hypothesis

Table 6 summarizes the decomposition through some key statistics. With all factors present,
net tuition increases from $6,100 to $12,559. As column 4 demonstrates, the demand shocks—
which consist mostly of changes in financial aid—account for the lion’s share of the higher
tuition. Specifically, with demand shocks alone, equilibrium tuition rises by 102%, almost
fully matching the 106% from the benchmark. By contrast, with all factors present except
the demand shocks (column 7), net tuition only rises by 16%.
    These results accord strongly with the Bennett hypothesis, which asserts that colleges
respond to expansions of financial aid by increasing tuition. In fact, the tuition response
completely crowds out any additional enrollment that the financial aid expansion would
otherwise induce, resulting instead in an enrollment decline from 33% to 27% in the new
equilibrium with only demand shocks. Furthermore, the students who do enroll take out
$6,876 in loans compared to $4,663 in the initial steady state. The college, in turn, uses
these funds to finance an increase of investment expenditures from $21,550 to $27,338 and
to enhance the quality of the student body. In particular, the average ability of graduates
increases by 4 percentage points (pp). Lastly, the model predicts that demand shocks in
isolation generate a surge in the default rate from 17% to 32%. Essentially, demand shocks
lead to higher college costs and more debt, and in the absence of higher labor market returns,
more loan default inevitably occurs.
    As a caveat, we view this measured eﬀect as an upper bound for the Bennett hypothesis.
Given our assumption of a non-competitive representative college, only the presence of the
unobservable preference shocks impedes the college from extracting the entire consumer
surplus from its student body. Table 6 illustrates this market power in the remarkably small
variation in ex-ante utility across the decompositions (the variation is less than 1.6% in
consumption equivalent terms). With more colleges, competition would act as a buﬀer against
unbridled rent extraction and diﬀerent pricing patterns would emerge. Given the diﬃculty
of solving for equilibrium with multiple colleges, we leave it for future research.

4.3.2   Macroeconomic Forces: The Rising College Wage Premium

The rise in the college wage premium also contributes to higher tuition, albeit more modestly.
If only the college wage premium changed between 1987 and 2010, the model predicts that
net tuition would have gone up by 24%. In its absence, but with all other shocks present,
tuition would have gone up by 87%. Interestingly, the rise in the college wage premium does
not appear to generate any increase in enrollment. Instead, the average ability of the student
body shifts upward by 2 pp, and the overall enrollment actually falls from 33% to 29%. In
part, limitations in borrowing capacity acted as a binding constraint for (mostly middle-
income) students in 1987, and absent any increase in financial aid, labor market changes
alone could not drive up enrollment.

4.3.3   Supply Shocks: Cost Disease and Fluctuations in Non-Tuition Revenue

Lastly, our results cast considerable doubt on the role of Baumol’s cost disease and fluc-
tuations in non-tuition revenue (such as state funding support for higher education) as
explanations for higher tuition. In fact, not only do we find that these factors do not lead to
large increases in tuition, but our results show that tuition falls in response to supply shocks
alone. Specifically, when we feed in the empirical estimates for the changes in custodial costs
and college endowments (which consist of all non-tuition revenue sources) but leave all other

parameters at their initial 1987 levels, equilibrium tuition decreases modestly from $6,100
to $5,762. Enrollment, by contrast, surges from 33% to 48%. We discuss the reason shortly.

4.3.4   Further Decomposing the Rise in Tuition

At this point, we need to unpack the impact of changing custodial costs and changes in
the college’s endowment to understand why supply shocks act to lower tuition in the model.
Table 7 shows what happens when we solve the model by taking turns shutting down exactly
one of the factors that change between 1987 and 2010.
    Comparing column 2 to the 2010 column, one sees that omitting the change in custodial
costs causes tuition to rise by approximately $1,100 more than it does in the baseline 2010
equilibrium. By contrast, shutting down the changes in the college’s endowment (seen in
column 3) increases tuition by $200. In other words, despite the fact that we estimate an
increase in custodial costs between 1987 and 2010, these higher costs reduce tuition.
    Careful consideration of the college’s objective function, budget constraint, and first order
condition sheds some insight. In particular, recall that the first order condition of the college
problem sets tuition equal to eﬀective marginal cost, EM C(sY ) = C ′ (N ) + I + qqIθ (θ − x),
plus a markup based on the demand elasticity. Our regression estimates find that both the
fixed cost and quadratic cost terms of C increase between 1987 and 2010, so C ′ increases,


                                                  38
which would increase tuition, all else equal. However, in equilibrium, the higher fixed cost
causes the college to cut back significantly on investment I. Overall, we find that the latter
eﬀect dominates, causing EM C and tuition to fall in response to the custodial cost increase.
    A diﬀerent way to understand this result recognizes that fixed costs largely drive the
increase in college costs. The college cannot eﬀectively oﬀset this cost by raising revenue from
the existing student body because it already engages in substantial rent extraction. Thus, the
college must raise revenue from other sources and/or reduce costs. Because average ability
and investment are complements in the quality production function, colleges cut investment
and average ability in response to this budgetary pressure (see column 5 of table 6).

                                                                           Tuition cdf

                                          Figure 8: Tuition Cumulative Distribution Function

    Also surprisingly, changes in college endowments show little eﬀect on equilibrium tuition.
However, inspection of figure 2 reveals that endowments per FTE only change by approx-
imately $600 between 1987 and 2010. Given that our model eﬀectively lumps private and
public colleges together, it appears that changes in state funding support and changes in
other sources of non-tuition revenue largely oﬀset each other. In future work, we plan to
disaggregate the model along the public/private dimension.
    While we have focused our attention on average net tuition, the model also has predictions

                                                                             39
for the entire distribution of net tuition. Figure 8 displays the distribution of net tuition for
1987, 2010, and the experiments listed in table 7. Some of the experiments have virtually
no eﬀect on tuition at any point of the distribution, namely, interest rates, non-tuition cost,
and changes in the college endowment. Other changes, such as grants, have a large first-
order eﬀect but have even larger eﬀects at the bottom of the distribution. Table 7 provides
corroborating evidence for these distributional consequences by listing the standard deviation
of net tuition in each experiment. Notably, the increase in grants over the transition lowers
the standard deviation of net tuition from $1,981 to $1,245.


5     Conclusion
Existing theories can fully explain the increase in net tuition between 1987 and 2010. Our
model suggests demand-side theories have the most predictive power. In fact, our results
show the Bennett hypothesis can fully account for the tuition increase on its own. We suspect
that our model exaggerates the explanatory power of the demand-side theories as a result
of the lack of competition faced by the college. We find that several compelling supply-
side theories, such as Baumol’s cost disease and changes in other college funding sources,
have little quantitative impact and can even move in the wrong direction. To assess the
robustness of our findings and to allow for more plausible welfare and policy analysis, we
plan to incorporate heterogeneous colleges in future work.

A     Additional Data and Estimation Information
This appendix describes the data sources we use and some details omitted in the main text.


A.1     NLSY97
For the National Longitudinal Sample of Youth 1997 (NLSY97), we restrict attention to
the representative sample. We drop waves after 2012. We also drop any observations that
report annual work hours in excess of 6000. Apart from that, every observation is included
when possible (when possible meaning, e.g., that if zero earnings were reported, they are not
included when measuring log earnings).


A.2     IPEDS and Delta Cost Project
For our sample selection in the Delta Cost Project (DCP), we require that the institution
be present from 1987 to 2010, that they be a four-year, non-specialty institution according


                                             45
to the Carnegie Classification, that they be either public or private, non-profit, and that
they have non-missing data on FTEs and net tuition. Additionally, we drop observations
that had fewer than 100 FTE students or had net tuition per FTE outside of the 1-99th
percentile range. To be included in the fixed eﬀects regression, we additionally require that
observations have cost per FTE inside of the 1-99th percentile range. Without trimming,
the R2 measures in the fixed eﬀects regression are about 50% smaller (i.e., the within R2
measure falls to around 0.1 and the overall measure falls to around .06).
   The college budget constraint has custodial costs, an endowment, investment, and tuition.
The corresponding data measures are as follows:

   • Endowment: all non-tuition revenue, which is the sum of appropriated federal (non-
     Pell) grants, appropriated state and local grants, and a auxiliary revenue (all per
     student).

   • Investment: total education and general expenditures including sponsored research but
     excluding auxiliary enterprises.

   • Tuition: net tuition and fees revenue.

   • Custodial costs: a residual computed as the endowment plus tuition less investment.

As with Epple et al. (2006), we compute custodial costs as a residual. Our investment mea-
sure is perhaps too broad as it includes all education costs, rather than just minimal ones.
However, it is unclear exactly what minimal expenditures on education should be.
    A significant shortcoming in the DCP database is that financial variables that are reported
as zero are converted to missing values (p. 14 del, 2011). Moreover, there are a large number
of missing values for certain measures, including the appropriated state and local grants
measure. For this measure in particular, one could imagine that many schools actually had
zero appropriations.
    For the estimation of the cost function, we of course require that a cost observation
be non-missing. Since costs are computed as a residual, this also requires the endowment,
investment, and tuition measures to also be non-missing. This results (after trimming) in
23,718 observations for costs (as well as endowment). Investment and net tuition have a
total of 30,517 observations. The other variable we take from IPEDS, federal plus state
government grants to students, has 23,047 observations (which may be a result of incorrectly
missing values).




                                              46
A.3     PSID
For the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we restrict the sample to heads of house-
holds (not necessarily male), aged 18 to 65, in the representative SRC (Survey Research
Center) sample. For waves prior to 1991, we compute an estimate of the heads years of
education using the education bucket variable (e.g., we treat “some college” as 14 years of
education and “college” as 16 years) since actual years of education are not available.


B     Additional Transition Information
This appendix provides estimates of how earnings have changed over the past few decades
and provides historical information on the student loan programs.


B.1     Model Units and Growth in Earnings
Since we focus on steady states with only real variables, we need a way to convert dollar
measures into our model. We do this by expressing all variables relative to average earnings
in 2010. A natural concern is that average earnings have grown substantially over the sample
period.
    Indeed, earnings have grown substantially over the sample period. For instance, using
the PSID, we compute four measures of real average family income: (1) head and wife labor
income; (2) head and wife labor income plus transfers; (3) family income (which includes
asset income); and (4) OECD-equivalized labor plus transfer income. Our preferred measure
is (4), and the averages over time for all measures are displayed in figure 9. In figure 10, we
also report the time series for average log values for our preferred measure.
    While in every measure there has been this substantial earnings growth over time, other
factors have been changing as well. Most importantly, college attainment has changed sub-
stantially over the last few decades. These changes could explain most or all of the changes
in average earnings. To investigate this, we regressed our preferred income measure on age,
age squared, and age cubed (results for age dummies are similar) and an education measure
equal to (min(max(educ, 12), 16) − 12)/4 where educ is the heads years of education (the
measure corresponds closely to our model). We restrict the sample to heads aged 18 to 65.
The regression results are reported in table 8.
    The results reveal that, after controlling for education attainment and age, almost all
the growth in earnings is orthogonal to time. Because of this result, we restrict attention
to steady states in the true sense of the word with average earnings growing over time only
because of changes in educational attainment. It is worth noting that our implied college

earnings premia is 0.70, which is a bit higher than what Autor et al. (2008) would suggest.
However, one should note that their earnings premia is restricted to full-time workers, while
our measure has hours worked varying with characteristics.
   Our model units are expressed as a fraction of average log equivalized income in 2010.
Rounding slightly, this amount was $36,200. In 1987, this value was $31,400, which is our
target for averages earnings in 1987.


B.2    Earnings Premium
The estimates in Autor et al. (2008) only go until 2005. As stated in the main text, we fit
a quadratic polynomial from 1987-2005 and use that to recover λt values both in and out
of sample. Figure 11 plots the actual and fitted college premium. Since the steep rise in the
earnings premium began in 1981, we try to obtain something more akin to an initial steady
state value by taking the seven-year average from 1981 to 1987. We treat this average, 0.46,
as the “1987” value.


B.3    Student Loan Programs
Government guaranteed loans have been available to students through two programs, the
William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (DL) and Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL)

(Smole, 2012). The DL program has loan capital provided by the government while the
FFEL has loan capital provided privately (Smole, 2012). In either case, losses due to default,
death, or permanent disability have been paid for by the government (Smole, 2012).
    Unsubsidized loans were introduced by the Higher Education Ammendments of 1992
Title IV, Part B, §428H.24 The loan limit was a combined subsidized and unsubsidized limit
(i.e., students who were not eligible or only partly eligible for subsidized loans would be
allowed to borrow the remainder via unsubsidized loans) (§428H(d)).
    Beginning in 1994, independent undergraduate students were able to borrow more than
the combined subsidized/unsubsidized limit for dependent undergraduates (Smole, 2012).
Then in 2008, the ability to borrow in unsubsidized loans was increased for dependent and
independent undegraduates (Smole, 2012). Table 9 summarizes the historical loan limits,
both the aggregate loan limits and the year-by-year limits.
    To map these limits into our model, where we do not distinguish between dependent and
independent students, we need to make an assumption. Choy (2002) shows that in 1999-2000,
37.6% (36.7%) of students at public (private) 4-year schools were financially independent.
So, we create a combine dependent/independent limit by placing 37% of weight on the
independent limit and 63% of weight on the dependent limit. The values are given in table
4.
    For our terminal steady state, we take the limits associated with 2010. For our initial
steady state, we take the limits not associated with 1987, which were new that year, but
rather with the limits in 1986 (which had been in place since 1981). The complete list of
limits we use, in nominal terms, is given in table 10
    Interest rates have also varied historically. From 1992 to 2006, the interest rates were
given as a 91-day T-bill plus a spread while capped at a specified rate. In other years,
interest rates have had a fixed rate between 3.4% and 10%. Since 2008, there have also been
separate interest rates for subsidized and unsubsidized loans. For completeness, these are
reproduced from Smole (2012) in table 11.
    In mapping these interest rates into the model, we first compute what the real student
loan interest rate in period τ would be for a loan originated at time t, and call it it,τ .25 We
take it to be the numerical average of {it+j,t }0j=−13 . This average interest rate reflects that,
in a standard 10-year repayment plan, cohorts from 13 years ago will be aﬀected by the

     We measure this as the statutory rate minus the CPI inflation rate. For the statutory rate, we take the
rate corresponding to November 1st in year τ . For 1988 to 1992, we use a rate of 9.6% = 0.8 ∗ 10% + 0.2 ∗ 8%.
Prior to 1988, we use 8.5%. For 2008 and beyond, we take the numerical average of the subsidized and
unsubsidized rates.

    While these give interest rates for some of the years along the transition path, the actual
transition from steady state to steady state may take several decades. In this case, it is
unclear what iτ should be. To illuminate this, figure 13 plots iτ for τ = 1987, . . . , 2010.
While the average interest rate early on is around 5%, it increases to a peak of around 7%
before falling for a decade and finally hovering around 3%. To obtain our initial steady state
interest rate, we use the average of the rates from 1987 to 1991. Likewise, to obtain our final

steady state rate, we use the average from 2006 to 2010.26 These average values are 4.7%
and 3.0%, and they are plotted alongside the historical interest rates for comparison.

C      Computation
This appendix describes some of the less trivial details of the computation. The worker and
youth problems are mostly standard except that we use “binary monotonicity,” a technique
described in Gordon and Qiu (2015), to solve the worker problem very quickly.27 We focus
the remaining discussion on the solution of the college problem and the transition.


C.1      Solving the College Problem
Computing the solution of the college problem is challenging. Since our value function for
attending college takes into account many diﬀerent features of the model, including borrowing
  26
     Hence, in the computation, we replace the 1987 and 2010 values with those 5-year averages (so that our
initial steady state corresponds to “1987” and terminal corresponds to “2010.”
  27
     In particular, the asset policy function is monotone in assets, so we can solve for the working problem
in O(nA log nA ) time (where nA is the number of asset grid points) else equal.



                                                     56
limits, default, kinks, and a lack of feasibility of certain regions of the state space, it is not
always smooth and is not well-defined in certain regions of the state space. Because of this, we
found working with first order conditions (FOCs) untenable (which is the approach in Epple
et al., 2006), at least for calibration/estimation where the model must be solved thousands
of times for a wide range of parameter values.
    Instead of working with FOCs, we directly maximize the college’s quality function by
choosing tuition. Specifically, we parameterize tuition as a bilinear function of the students
ability and parental income. We construct a tensor product grid of ability and parental
income. We then specify the value of tuition at those tensor-grid points, which implicitly de-
fines a tuition function (via the bilinear interpolant) for the entire space. Given a particular
guess on the tuition function, we must solve for enrollments, college investment, and college
quality jointly. Specifically, we “guess” (i.e., solve a root-finding problem) on what the equi-
librium college quality is, compute youth utility from attending (taking into the account the
tuition they will pay and the utility they receive from college quality), compute enrollment
probabilities, compute investment as a residual in the college budget constraint, and produce
an implied college quality. We then check if the guess on quality and the implied quality are
close enough. If not, we update the guess (in particular, we use bisection).28
    The equilibrium tuition functions for 1987 and 2010 are displayed in figure 12. There is
a great deal of variation in the tuition function. Some of the variation is immaterial: For the
lowest ability youths, enrollment probabilities are virtually zero. Hence, any higher tuition
level for them should generate essentially the same enrollment for this group (zero) and hence
the same college quality. However, the tuition function also has substantial variation where
youths do attend. In our discussion of figure 5, we described the main mechanism for why
enrollment in 1987 is low for high ability, medium parental income youths. This discussion
carries over almost directly to why tuition plummets for these students. In particular, colleges
want the high ability students, but they have very little ability to pay. So tuition falls to
accomodate some of them.
    Given the variation in the tuition function, we decompose the process of finding the
equilibrium tuition into a number of steps in an attempt to ensure we get close to the global
maximum. To do this, we use three techniques: a multigrid, global search, and local search.
We begin by specifying tuition on a very coarse grid for ability and parental income, two
points in each dimension. We choose one thousand random points in the support of our
tuition space.29 From each of these points, we perform a simplex search. We then take the
  28
     Note that, unfortunately, we have no guarantee that the equilibrium is unique: If college quality is very
high, willingness to pay is very high, which may justify the high college quality through higher enrollment
of high-paying students.
  29
     We make tuition a state variable and solve for the student value function on a grid (97 points linearly

best of these. This the truly global part of our search.
    We then do a slightly less global approach. With the best guess on the tuition function
from the global step, we take 31 random draws within plus or minus $1000 and perform a
simplex search from each (we also do a simplex search from the guess). Taking the best of
these, we update our guess. We repeat this process three more times.
    Our next step is the multigrid step. In particular, we refine the grid on ability and parental
income. Our initial guess on the tuition function is the solution to the previous multigrid step.
We then apply the global/local approach just described (32 draws four times). We repeat this
multigrid process several times, eventually arriving at our desired grid that has six points in
the ability dimension and nine points in the parental income dimension (equilibrium tuition
has more curvature in the parental income dimension).
    This approach typically yields large increases in quality for the first two multigrids and
small increases (on the order of 2% or less) for the remaining five multigrids. Having small
grids initially allows for a much more thorough exploration of the search space rather than
simply starting with a six-by-nine grid. We tried a number of diﬀerent approaches and
found this one was both reliable and allowed substantial flexibility in the tuition function
parameterization.


C.2     Transition
In the transition, the only unknown endogenous object that is needed to solve the household
and college problem is the tax rate τ . This is in part because we have taken care to formulate
the college problem as static (and made certain other assumptions such as college being a
once and for all choice made at time zero): The equilibrium θ, I, N can be determined at each
point in time as long as the value function Y1 (0, sY ; T ), is known, and this value function
does not depend on θ, I, N, or q.30
    Our algorithm for computing the transition is as follows:

   1. Fix t = 1987 − J + 1 and some terminal period t ≫ 2010. Guess on {τt }tt .

   2. For each cohort t in t, . . . , t, do the following:

       (a) Use backward induction to compute the worker problem for all ages j = 1, . . . , J
           (with τ and policies at age j given by t + j − 1). For cohorts that are surprised
           mid-life, the problem must be solved twice, once for before they were surprised
spaced between $0 and $15000 and three points at $20000, $30000, and $50000, converted to model units).
The support of the tuition space is $0 to $50000.

     Recall that college quality does aﬀect utility, but it shows up at time zero as Y1 + q.



                                                  59
              (for all ages) and once for after they were surprised (for the age that they are
              surprised and on).
         (b) Use backward induction to compute the student problem for all student ages
             j = 1, . . . , JY taking tuition as given and with quality separate (don’t compute Y
             yet, just Y1 , . . . , YJY ). As in 2(a), the problem may need to be solved more than
             once.
         (c) Compute the college problem solution, guessing θ, I, N , computing q, the value Y ,
             the tuition T , attendance based on EMC, and then updating the θ, I, N guesses
             until convergence is obtained.

  3. For each cohort, simulate a panel. Use it to compute statistics, including the implied
     τ̂t needed to balance the government budget constraint.

  4. Determine the supnorm maxt∈{t,...,t} |τ̂t − τt |. If it is less than .0005, continue to the
     next stop. Otherwise, update the guess on τt according to τt := (1 − ρ)τt + ρτ̂t where
     ρ ∈ (0, 1], and go to step (2).

  5. Check whether the specified transition length was long enough: If |τt − τ ∗ | < .0005,
     where τ ∗ is the terminal steady state value of τ , then stop. Otherwise, go to (1) and
     increase t.

We set t = 2086. In order to avoid storing policy functions for each cohort, we use Monte
Carlo to compute statistics over the transition (this also requires solving for cohorts as far
back as 1987 − J + 1).31 More precisely, we solve for a cohort’s value and policy functions,
simulate a panel for just that cohort, and compute statistics (such as means and standard
deviations) on a rolling basis.
    Students can be surprised by policy changes that can make their current stock of student
loan debt infeasible. In particular, a tightening in the real borrowing limits with our l′ ≥ l
assumption can result in infeasibility. To handle this, student borrowing terms and other
financial aid variables are fixed for the duration of college.

      This technique allowed us to use MPI to much more easily parallelize the transition computation.
