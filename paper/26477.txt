Electricity is a general purpose technology and the catalyst for the second industrial revolution.
Developing countries are currently making huge investments in electrification, with a view to
achieving structural change. What does history say about its impact on the structure of
employment? We use U.S. Census data from 1910 to 1940 and measure electrification with the
length of higher-voltage electricity lines. Instrumenting for electrification using hydroelectric
potential, we find that the average expansion of high-voltage transmission lines between 1910
and 1940 increased the share of operatives in a county by 3.3 percentage points and decreased the
share of farmers by 2.1 percentage points. Electrification can explain 50.5% of the total increase
in operatives, and 18.1% of the total decrease in farmers between 1910 and 1940. At the industry
level, electrification drove 15.7% of the decline in the share of agricultural employment and
28.4% of the increase in the share of manufacturing employment between 1910 and 1940.
Electrification was thus a key driver of structural transformation in the U.S. economy.

1. Introduction
    For the first time in U.S. history, the federal Census in 1920 reported more than 50% of residents living

in urban areas, marking a turning point in a long movement off farms and towards cities, with the accompa-

nying transition to urban occupations and industries. In fact, Figure 1 illustrates a massive labor reallocation

over the period 1910-1940, from agricultural occupations toward ones more concentrated in sectors such

as manufacturing, retail, and wholesale trade. This structural transformation was achieved relatively late in

the U.S., due to its status as a young nation and a destination for individuals seeking to make their fortunes

on the land. The backdrop of this transformation was an equally dramatic transformation of infrastructure,

involving the move from steam to electric power in cities and from horse to electric power in rural areas.

While this kind of structural transformation is one of the most salient features of economic development

(Herrendorf, Rogerson and Valentinyi, 2014)--identified as one of Kuznets' stylized facts of development

(Kuznets, 1966)--there is still considerable debate about its underlying causes.

    Historical studies have focused on explaining the transition from an agriculture-based economy to one

where manufacturing is the dominant sector, while more recent studies also seek to explain later stages of

development when manufacturing is now on the wane and services becomes dominant for richer countries.

Gollin, Jedwab, Vollrath et al. (2013) provide a nice summary of the theoretical literature on structural

change, from theories that focus on the increased productivity of manufacturing and services, which creates

a "pull" force for labor to move out of agriculture, and the "push" theories which investigate the price and

income effects influencing the move away from the primary sector.2

    This paper focuses on the specific role played by electrification, a general purpose technology that drove

the second industrial revolution in the developed world (Gordon, 2017) and still plays a crucial role for eco-

nomic development today.3 Many developing countries are currently witnessing unprecedented investment

in electrification as a vehicle for development, in the hope that it will stimulate structural transformation,

pushing more workers into modern, higher valued-added sectors. In fact, the World Bank argues that "in-

frastructure has a central role in the development agenda and is a major contributor to growth" (World Bank,

    2
      On the latter types of models, see, for example, Herrendorf, Rogerson and Valentinyi (2013). Other creative explanations for
the new dominance of the service sector include, for instance, Cravino, Levchenko and Rojas (2019) which suggests that this is a
natural result of the aging of populations in the developed world.
    3
      Gordon (2017) showed that the second industrial revolution was sparked by the perfection of the steam engine but realized
such high productivity gains due to electricity. So far, the gains from the second industrial revolution dwarf those of the third.

Notes: The figure depicts overall changes in the occupational structure as displayed in Figure 3 and contrasts them with the structural
changes due to electrification as implied by our IV estimates (Tables 5 and 7) scaled by the average increase in transmission lines
within a county (Table 2). Panel A focuses on occupations while panel B reports our results for industries. We only report implied IV
estimates for statistically significant coefficients. The underlying data on the occupational and industrial structure are the full count
U.S. Cenuses for the years 1910, 1920, 1930, and 1940. The impact of electrification is estimated using historical maps of the U.S.
electricity grid and hydroelectric potential as an instrument. Details are provided in Sections 3 and 4.


2005) and states that it has helped 45 million people to gain access to electricity from 2014 to 2018 and

spent over $5 billion on energy programs.4 Ethiopia is a leading example of a developing nation recently

investing heavily in electricity. Fried and Lagakos (2017) analyze the extent to which this investment trans-

lated into structural change and find an increase in non-agricultural businesses in rural areas, mostly in retail

and wholesale trade rather than manufacturing.

        In this paper, we present the first quantification (to our knowledge) of the contribution of electrification

to U.S. structural change, focusing on the years 1910 to 1940 and utilizing a dataset that allows us to look

across the universe of geographies, occupations and industries. Looking at this historical episode allows

us to analyze the long run impacts of electrification over three decades (1910-1940), which is generally

not possible in the modern development literature but is important given the lengthy time general purpose

technologies usually need to unfold their full potential through complementary innovations.5 Examining the

impact of this earlier major general purpose technology on the labor market over the long run can also allow

     See, for example, Rud (2012); Burlig and Preonas (2016), which look at most over two decades interval to analyze the effects
of electrification in India, and Fried and Lagakos (2017), who look at the period since 2012 because Ethiopia's electrification is so
recent.

us to gain insights on the potential impacts of the most recent general purpose technology, information and

communication technologies (ICT).

    One serious challenge in estimating the impact of electrification is that the proliferation of electricity is

likely endogenous to existing levels of development, available local skills and industrial composition. To

address this concern, we use hydro-electric potential within 50 miles of a county to instrument for electri-

fication, as proxied by the length of high-voltage power lines in a county. Hydro-electric potential is high

for areas that have sufficient flows of water that can fall from sufficient heights--in other words, exoge-

nous geographic endowments. We investigate the impact of 1910-1940 electrification on the occupational

and industrial structure of male county employment in 1940, controlling for initial 1910 conditions in each

county. Using this IV, we find that 100 extra kilometers of high-voltage power lines significantly decreased

the share of farmers among American men, and significantly increased the share of operatives. In parallel,

electrification significantly decreased the share of farming in male employment and increased the share of

manufacturing. The size of the effects implies that electrification can explain 50.5% of the increase in the

share of operatives, and 24.8% of the decline in the share of farmers between 1910 and 1940. As for the

industrial structure, electrification can account for 15.7% of the decline in agriculture and 28.4% of the in-

crease in manufacturing. Figure 1 graphically illustrates these results and highlights that electrification is

thus a key driver of structural transformation.

    Additional results show that more than half of the impact of electrification on the share of operatives

was already visible in 1930 while the negative impact of electrification on farmers only becomes significant

in 1940. Furthermore, the increase in the share of operatives entirely occurred in counties that were rural in

1910 rather than in urban counties. This highlights how important a role electrification plays in transforming

economic activity in rural areas.

    Our analysis makes three key contributions to the literature. First, we provide a credible instrument for

the expansion of the high-voltage power grid in order to investigate the causal impact of electrification on

structural transformation at the early stages of economic development in the U.S.. Specifically, we use a

measure of "hydro-electric potential", which is governed by fixed, exogenous topographic characteristics of

a place, which is related to the cost of building and operating a hydro-electric power station in any given

location. In doing so, we are building on U.S. literature that used the distance to power plants (Lewis

and Severnini, 2017) as an instrument, and a literature that directly looked at how hydro-electric potential

                                                       4
affected agglomeration economies in different areas (Severnini, 2014).

    Second, we study the impact of electrification on the entire U.S. territory, examining effects on the oc-

cupational and industrial structure of employment. We digitized historical maps to document the expansion

of the high-voltage electricity grid within the contiguous U.S. states. We argue that the expansion of the

high-voltage electricity grid serves as a proxy for the proliferation of hydro-electric power, and we are able

to use this measure thanks to our digitization of new data from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This pro-

vides us with a nationwide source of variation for electricity adoption due to the invention of high-voltage

power transmission--a general purpose technology shock. Previous studies of the impact of electrification

in the U.S. analyze either the manufacturing sector, using the Census of Manufacturers (Gray, 2013), or

the agricultural sector (Census of Agriculture) in isolation (Kitchens and Fishback, 2015), and some focus

on programs that were only applicable in a few states. Ours is the first attempt to use detailed exogenous

variation in electricity adoption to study potential labor re-allocation between, rather than within sectors.

Furthermore, because we use full Census data, we go beyond just agriculture and manufacturing and ana-

lyze the impact of electrification on the full occupational and industrial structure. We thus complement the

work by Katz and Margo (2014), which focused on skill bias rather than structural transformation and did

not use an instrument for electrification.

    Third, the extant literature on structural transformation offers a variety of theoretical explanations for

its ultimate causes. One class of models draws on dominant income effects (through non-homothetic pref-

erences) while another class of models draws on a production structure in which general purpose technol-

ogy shocks--through a reduction in the relative price--have differential effects in different sectors (Her-

rendorf et al., 2014). Our analysis provides evidence that the invention of high-voltage electrical power

transmission--a general purpose technology--directly caused structural transformation of rural America

during the period 1910-1940, consistent with the theory of technology-driven structural transformation.

    Probably most closely related to this paper is Bustos, Caprettini and Ponticelli (2016) which explores

the impact of two agricultural innovations on structural transformation in Brazil. They find that one of their

technologies is labor-saving and it has the clear effect of reallocating labor from agriculture to manufactur-

ing, which impacted more intensely areas suited more to crops using this technology. Our case is slightly

different because we deal with a general purpose technology which had a variety of effects across all sectors

and places, and we discuss those effects in the next section. They also add a services sector to their model

                                                      5
and suggest that, as incomes rise, more is devoted to non-tradable services. While services is not the focus

of this paper, we note that the employment shares of service-related occupations, such as professions, sales

and distribution did grow during our period.

       In section 2, we discuss the role electricity could play in the occupational and industrial composition of

employment. In section 3, we describe the data and our econometric specification. In section 4, we present

the results. Finally, section 5 concludes.



2. What did electricity do?
       This section does not present a formal model but is intended to provide a conceptual framework to

inform our empirical analysis below.

       Electricity, as with many general purpose technologies, took a very long time to bring large productivity

gains to all sectors of the U.S. economy, from the realization of commercial viability of the technology in the

1880s through to 1960, by which time rural electrification was complete. We know from existing research

that it had large productivity effects--David and Wright (1999) showed that electricity contributed about

half of the five-fold increase in TFP growth during the 1920s. The earliest gains were, of course, in the

manufacturing sector, concentrated in large and medium-sized cities. A range of studies have analyzed the

impact of electrification within manufacturing, and a more detailed summary of which can be found in Gray

and Kitchens (2018). The most recent contributions are firstly Gray (2013) which showed that electrification

in U.S. manufacturing led to a hollowing out of the skill distribution, whereby workers occupying jobs

in the middle of the skill distribution (with craft skills) lost out to those at the poles who were mainly

clerical/managerial and manual workers. A more general study was conducted by Katz and Margo (2014)

which confirmed the hollowing out result for manufacturing but found that, in the economy as a whole,

electricity led to skill bias, i.e. more demand for high-skilled workers.6 This is the only other paper that

looks across all sectors of the national economy as it presents a description of the occupational composition

of the entire labor force up to 2010.

       How did electricity bring about these changes within manufacturing and usher in the era of capital-skill

   6
    Goldin and Katz (1998) had also argued that manufacturing technology was skill-biased, because the education level of workers
was correlated with electricity adoption.



                                                               6
complementarity, as claimed by Goldin and Katz (1998)? Electricity was complementary to technologies

such as the assembly line, and the bundle of new technologies led to an increased scale of production as

factories were no longer limited by the capacity of inefficient steam engines. This brought increased pro-

ductivity and an increased demand for clerical and managerial tasks within factories, and on the factory floor

a huge increase in demand for operatives who could operate side by side in the new continuous processing

mode. Where previously there had been a huge demand for high-skilled craft workers with knowledge of

producing each item from start to finish, now operatives, assisted by new capital goods, dominated factory

floors that were redesigned to minimize the floor space of each station and maximize efficiency, rather than

accommodating the quirks of the previous steam-based system.

    Rural electrification took place later and did increase agricultural productivity, looking at the Kitchens

and Fishback (2015) estimates of increased crop output and yields as a result of the Rural Electrification

Administration (REA) program during the 1930s. Early on, farms utilized generators for lighting and were

often able to run power tools or small appliances from their cars and trucks. Purchased grid electricity

replaced these smaller-scale, less convenient alternatives. Electricity on farms removed the drudgery of

drawing water from the list of daily chores and facilitated the introduction of complementary technologies

such as milking machines, chicken brooders, irrigation systems as well as household appliances such as

washing machines and telephones. Farms in this era adopted more capital and, as in manufacturing, this

may have changed the optimal scale of farming and the mix of labor, energy and capital.

    Electricity thus increased employment in manufacturing, as shown by Alexopoulos and Cohen (2016),

who also showed that labor turnover increased as a result. It changed the composition of tasks demanded

within manufacturing and we would expect demand for semi-skilled operatives to have increased most.

Within agriculture, we would expect electricity to increase the amenities available on farms as well as

agricultural productivity. Such amenities include running water, refrigerators and radios, and their usage did

increase in rural areas even before 1940. Those initially living in rural areas thus may have faced competing

forces of the pull towards urban manufacturing amid higher farm productivity. Lewis and Severnini (2017)

weighed these issues in their study of the effects of rural electrification from 1930 to 1960 and found that over

that span electricity was a countervailing force in the broader decline of farm population, but that increased

productivity translated into greater amenities for farm households rather than increased incomes/wages.

Kline and Moretti (2013) also found gains in agricultural employment due to the TVA program, but counties

                                                       7
benefiting from the program also saw increased manufacturing employment. The theoretical literature on

structural change has pointed out that the effects of increasing agricultural productivity should be different

in open versus closed economies. The U.S. during our sample period was mostly closed, and so the likely

impact of higher agricultural productivity is to shift labor into manufacturing (Laitner, 2000) because of the

higher demand for manufactured goods due to Engel's Law.

       For our period, we do not have comprehensive data on wages in manufacturing/urban jobs and how those

changed over time, but the existing evidence suggests that manufacturing wages rose faster than rural wages

and farm incomes. Farm incomes famously suffered even before the Great Depression and continued to

face downward pressure during the 1930s--data from the U.S. Department of Commerce showed average

net farm income as fairly stagnant between 1915 and 1930, but with huge fluctuations on a year-to-year

basis, particularly during the 1930s (Kline, 2000, 285). Alston and Hatton (1991) presented data from 1925

to 1941 which showed that the collapse of agricultural laborer wages relative to those of manufacturing

laborers started in the early 1930s. Workers who had been agricultural laborers and became manufacturing

laborers or operatives were moving up the socioeconomic ladder in terms of well-being and this is likely

true for many of the farmers too, since they were the ones with marginal farms that they decided to leave in

favor of the manufacturing sector. It is difficult to conclude whether they moved up in terms of occupational

status, as they left somewhat stable jobs with some autonomy to work in the high-turnover manufacturing

sector where they would enter on a low rung of the job ladder, as manual workers or operatives.

       Since our analysis ends at 1940, we conjecture that the pull into manufacturing jobs was greater than the

push away from agriculture as a result of electrification. Other factors had started the long run decline of

employment in agriculture from the 1910s onwards7 , but the sector was only 33% electrified by 1940 (Kline,

2000, 287), so it is likely that electricity had not yet enacted substantial changes on American farms--indeed

the farm population fell at a faster rate from 1940 to 1960 than it had from 1915 to 1940.



   7
   Appendix Table A.1 in Kline (2000) shows that the U.S. farm population declined from 1915, with only a brief blip back
upward in the 1930s as people reverted to subsistence on farms during the Great Depression. The number of farms followed this
same pattern.

3. Data and econometric specification
    We draw from three main data sources, which we describe in detail below: first, we construct a new

measure of electrification based on historical maps of the U.S. electricity grid; second, we use a measure of

"hydroelectric potential" as a source of exogenous variation in the expansion of the high voltage power grid;

third, we draw on the full count census of population for the years 1910-1940.



3.1. Expansion of the U.S. Electric Grid (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers)
    AC power became the dominant power system in the U.S. from the 1890s, paving the way, with some

further innovations, to longer distance power transmission from the 1920s on. City residential and com-

mercial customers gained access to electricity from the 1880s onwards and were highly electrified by 1920.

The Censuses of Manufactures show that, at the national level, electric power was more than half of total

power used by 1920, overtaking steam power, and by 1930 it was over 80% of total power (Gray, 2013,

Figure 1). Early urban electrification was achieved mainly by private utilities and private action by large

manufacturers, with a more limited role for municipal-owned plants. Most of this power was derived from

coal-burning plants, unless there was easy access to hydro-electric capability, such as at Niagara, the site of

the first hydro-plant in 1881. Coal plants had the advantage of being built close to the point of use and there

was some improvement in the efficiency of these large plants over our period.

    For rural counties, they remained mostly without electricity by 1930, and in many places the first moves

towards electrification were initiated by the government. The earliest adopters were farms in California and

the southwest, where the need for irrigation motivated the choice to electrify, perhaps facilitated at least

for California by the availability of hydro-electric power. Kitchens and Fishback (2015), Kline and Moretti

(2013) and Kitchens (2014) document several New Deal programs such as the REA, which provided loans

for farms to connect to the grid, provided that they were within a certain distance of the existing grid

and the Tennessee Valley Authority, which created a series of government-built water and hydro-electric

infrastructure projects from 1933. These are all towards the end of our sample period, so most of our grid

expansion does not reflect these efforts. For example, the REA reported 267,846 miles of lines energized by

1940, servicing 674,495 customers (Kline, 2000, 290). This is not a small number for rural America but is

still not the main story in our sample period.

                                                      9
    Using standard GIS software, we digitized maps compiled in 1962 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,

which document the expansion of the U.S. electric grid over time, and are the most detailed information used

to date on access to electricity across the U.S.. We map both plant location and the expanding network of

transmission lines over time (we do not have the smaller substations and distribution lines in our grid) at a

finer level of geography than has previously been possible, because our maps are more detailed than those

of the Edison Electric Institute, for example. As an example, panel A of Figure 2 graphically illustrates the

resulting county-level exposure to the high voltage power grid in 1940, as measured by the total kilometers

of high-voltage power lines within the county.



3.2. Hydro-electric Potential (Idaho National Laboratory)
    As it is our goal estimate the causal impact of the high-voltage electricity grid expansion on the structure

of the labor market, we exploit arguably exogenous variation based on "hydroelectric potential"--the po-

tential amount of hydroelectric energy that could be generated in a given location, if a hydroelectric power

station were installed. This measure is available nation wide, based on a 10-year data collection effort by

the Idaho National Laboratory (Conner and Francfort, 1998), and captures information on land gradient and

stream flow across 5677 sites. We do this to exploit purely cost-driven variation in electricity across space.

Panel B of Figure 2 graphically illustrates the regional distribution of hydroelectric potential. We note that

the data collection effort was undertaken in the 1990s, and many locations with high hydropotential had a

power station in place at that time. For such locations, the actual power generation at the plant is assumed to

capture the potential before the power station was installed. Thus, from the perspective of 1910, when only

a handful of locations already had a hydroelectric power station in place (that may itself have been expanded

in later years), the map compiled in 1998 captures the potential power generation, if the 5677 surveyed sites

were to be developed in the future.

    The marginal cost of electricity was lower for hydro-electric power, but it had the twin disadvantages of

high fixed costs and having to be located wherever geography provided steep enough gradients and sufficient

water flow. In other words, the location of hydro-electric power will be closely linked to hydro-electric

potential and to lower electricity costs. Severnini (2014) showed that this local cost advantage disappeared

after 1950, when higher voltage transmission lines made power distribution away from each plant much mo-

3.3. Labor force characteristics (Full count U.S. Census of Population)
    We draw on the full count U.S. Census of Population for the years 1910-1940 as provided under a special

license by IPUMS (Ruggles, Flood, Goeken, Grover, Meyer, Pacas and Sobek, 2019). The analysis below

uses data for the male, non-institutionalized, working age population (16-65), sometimes restricted to those

who reported a codeable occupation and industry. The Census of course gives us a range of demographic and

location information, along with labor market outcomes for our subsample. Unfortunately, wage and salary

income was only reported in 1940 so we cannot make specific statements about the income implications of

our results because we cannot control for 1910 income.

    Our main outcomes for quantifying structural changes in the labor market are the occupations and in-

dustries recorded in the Census. In particular, we draw on IPUMS's harmonized occupation and industry

codes occ1950 and ind1950, which are standard across our sample period.

    IPUMS assigned these harmonized codes based on the original text recorded by the Census enumera-

tor, which is available to us (with restricted access) in digitized form as occstr and indstr. Unfortu-

nately, as of October 2018, a non-negligible subset of individuals in the 1910, 1920, and 1930 files receive

occ1950 and ind1950 code 979, which indicates that IPUMS has "not yet coded" an individual's in-

dustry and/or occupation. We develop a simple procedure in order to drastically reduce the number of 979

codes in the original IPUMS files (see Appendix A for details). In the raw IPUMS files, roughly 7% of

individuals are coded as 979 in the 1910-1930 files. Our procedure reduces this number to roughly 6% for

occ1950-ind1950 tuples and to less than 3% for occupations (occ11950), since occstr tended to

contain much more information than indstr.

    For our main analyses we aggregate the harmonized IPUMS occupation and industry codes to the one

digit level, effectively resulting in 10 occupation groups and 9 broad sectors.



3.4. Defining Geography
    All of our analyses are at the county level. Since county boundary definitions change over the period

1910-1940 we use Hornbeck's (2010) method to hold 1910 county definitions fixed and proportionately re-


                                                      12
allocate all county-level aggregates as if the data were uniformly distributed across locations within a county.

For example, New York county was split into Manhattan and the Bronx in 1914, which falls between the

1910 and 1920 censuses. To keep geographic areas comparable over time, we therefore define a synthetic

New York county for 1920-1940 which adds the outcomes for 1920-1940 in the Bronx and Manhattan. In

other cases, when a newer county definition contains all or portions of multiple 1910 counties, the outcomes

are weighted by their respective share in area of the newer county definition. The changes in county areas are

calculated based on historical county definitions using standard GIS software. We note that this adjustment

is applied at the county level to all three data sources described above.



3.5. Econometric specification
    In our main analysis, we estimate the following cross sectional regression for a given Census year:


                                 yi = 0 + 1 Ei + 2 Xi + 3 yi,0 + i +         i                              (1)


Counties are indexed by i, and Ei is the number of kilometers of high-voltage power lines in county i: this is

by definition a cumulative measure of electrification, capturing the stock of power lines to date. We control

for state fixed effects, i , and various county level characteristics, Xi , calculated on the same subsample of

the population we use for our outcomes in 1910 when there were essentially no high-voltage power lines

(Table 2). Xi includes logged population density (to account for initial differences in levels of development),

the fraction of white individuals, the average age (see Table 1 for summary statistics). Finally, we include

as a control the outcome at period 0, yi,0 . Observations are weighted by county population in 1910 and

standard errors are robust.

    Running this specification with different end years t allows us to trace the short to long-term impact of

electrification. We focus on the long-run effects in our main estimates, choosing t = 1940.

    The most likely confound for OLS regressions is that electrification was demand driven: electrification

may occur sooner in counties where electricity-intensive occupations and industries were already strong .

To get around this potential confound, we use an instrument for electrification that is a plausibly exogenous

supply-side shifter: hydro-electric potential in an area decreases the cost of electrification. In our instru-

mental variable specifications, Ei is instrumented by hydro-electric potential within 50 kilometers of the

county.

    Other studies have used similar approaches to our identification strategy. Dinkelman (2011) used gradi-

ent as an instrument for the electric grid in South Africa, to analyze the effect of the rollout of the grid to

more remote areas after the end of apartheid. Lipscomb, Mobarak and Barham (2013) built an engineering

model of the ideal rollout of the electric grid in Brazil, assuming a counterfactual world where political

factors are shut down. They use this as an instrument for the actual grid and analyze the impact on growth

through various channels including agricultural productivity. This is similar to our use of hydro-electric

potential as an instrument, which captures just the exogenous geographic variation in the cost of electricity.

Lewis and Severnini (2017) use the distance to power plants for counties in the U.S., from 1930 to 1960, to

identify exogenous variation in electricity cost. They point out that rural customers made up a small fraction

of the overall customer base, reducing the threats to identification of their approach. In our study too, we fo-

cus mainly on rural areas, and farm service made up only 2.6% of nationwide electricity customers in 1932,

implying that their actions would not have driven transmission line or power plant placement (Kitchens

and Fishback, 2015, 1163). Severnini (2014) also looked at areas that had similar hydro-electric potential,

comparing those that eventually built dams to those that did not, to measure the agglomeration effects of

expanding infrastructure.



3.6. Descriptive statistics
    In 1910, only 6% of the counties are urban (Table 1), so our sample is overwhelmingly rural. In addi-

tional results below, we will consider the effects of electricity separately for rural and urban counties.

    How did the U.S. economy change between 1910 and 1940 in terms of its occupation and industry

structure? In Figure 3, panel A, we order occupations from the most common to the least common in 1910

among working age men who have an occupation. In 1910, farmer is the most common occupation with

23.5% of men working as farmers. Generally speaking, by 1940, the most common occupations declined

while the least common expanded: the most dramatic changes occurred for farmers, whose share declined

by 11.3 percentage points and for operatives, whose share increased by 6.5 percentage points (Figure 3),

panel B)8 . By 1940, operatives constitute the most common occupation with 18.2% of male employment.

       Employment by industry also changed between 1910 and 1940 (Figure 3), panels C and D). While

agriculture employed 36.7% of the working male population in 1910, this share declined to 21.4% by 1940.

During this same time period, manufacturing jumped up from 15.8% of the working make population to

22.9%. Thus, by 1940, manufacturing replaced agriculture as the most common industry of employment

among men. These trends in industrial employment are closely related to the trends in occupations where

operative replaced farmer as the most common occupation for an American man between 1910 and 1940.

This is broadly in line with figures quoted in (Laitner, 2000, 547) from the Historical Statistics of the United

States that showed that U.S. agricultural employment shrank by about half between 1900 and 1960, while

manufacturing rose by a factor of almost 3.

       Electrification as measured by power transmission lines (Table 2) started after 1910. However, relative

   These changes in the shares of farmers and operatives are qualitatively similar when we include men without an occupation
(Appendix Figure B.4).

Notes: The figure shows national trends in the occupational structure during 1910-1940 in the United States. Panel A plots fractions
of the male, working age population, without inmates and military who reported an occupation. Panel B displays the change from
1910-1940 as displayed in panel A. Panels B and C report analogous charts for 9 broad sectors. "No Industry" refers to individuals
with an occupation but no specific/reported industry. For full regression tables of national trends in occupation and industry shares,
see Appendix Tables C.9 and C.10.


to levels achieved in 1940, there is little growth in electrification between 1910 and 1920. Most of the action

happens between 1920 and 1940, with the length of high-voltage power lines multiplied by two between

1920 and 1930 and again between 1930 and 1940.

      Interestingly, the timing of electrification seems to coincide with the timing of changes in the share of

farmers and operatives. The decline in farming between 1910 and 1920 was very limited (Figure 3), panel

A). The share of farmers declines most strongly between 1920 and 1940, which is also when electrification

spread the most rapidly. For operatives, the strongest growth occurs between 1930 and 1940. We will

now investigate whether this coincidence of timing between electrification and structural change can be

interpreted as a causal effect of electrification.



4. Results
    In Table 3, we show a first stage regression of length of high-voltage power lines on hydro-electric

potential within 50 miles of each county. This regression is not exactly the first stage for our IV because we

will be including the 1910 value of the left-hand side variable as a control in each specification.

    Hydro-electric potential has a positive and significant impact on electrification, and the magnitude of

the effect is largest in 1940. The F-test in 1930 and 1940 is above 10, suggesting the instrument is strong

enough. In our IV regressions, we will report the Kleinbergen-Paap underidentification test.



4.1. Impact of electrification on the occupational structure of employment
    In our main results, we focus on the 1910-1940 period to capture the long-run effect of electrification on

the occupational structure.

    In OLS regressions (Table 4), electrification seems to thoroughly affect the structure of occupations

between 1910 and 1940: it significantly decreases the share of farmers and farm laborers and non-farm

laborers, and increases the share of clerical, sales, craft, operatives, professional, service and management

workers.

                                                               18
    We then move on to instrumental variables estimation; the p-values of the Kleibergen-Paap underiden-

tification test imply that we can reject underidentification at the 1% level for all occupations. Once we

instrument for the length of high-voltage power lines with hydro-electric potential (Table 5), there are fewer

significant effects of electrification on the occupational structure. Electrification decreases the share of men

employed in farming, and increases the shares employed in craft, operatives and professional occupations.

In terms of magnitudes, the largest effects are on farmers and operatives: a 100 kilometers of high-voltage

power lines decreases the share of farmers by 0.5 percentage points and increases the share of operatives by

0.4 percentage points. The effect of electrification on farmers is not different when using IV relative to OLS,

while IV doubles the magnitude of the effect of electrification on operatives. This suggests that increases in

electrification occurred in counties where the growth of operatives tended to be otherwise slower, leading to

a downward bias in the OLS estimates.



4.2. Impact of electrification on the industrial structure of employment
    We now investigate the impact of electrification on the industrial structure between 1910 and 1940. We

note that industry is missing for up to 28% of workers depending on occupation (see Appendix Table C.24),

so we also incorporate the effect of electrification on the "missing industry" category.

    Using OLS (Table 6), we find that electrification affected industry employment across the board, sig-

nificantly reducing the share of males employed in agriculture and increasing the share employed in trade,

finance, services, and the public sector, as well as increasing the share of men without a reported indus-

try. Quantitatively, the largest effects of electrification are the decline in agriculture and the increase in

manufacturing, which corresponds to the structural transformation.

    We then move on to IV. The p-values of the Kleibergen-Paap underidentification tests imply that we can

reject underidentification at the 1% level for all industries (Table 7).

    When instrumenting electrification with hydro-electric potential (Table 7), electrification significantly

decreases the share of men employed in agriculture and increases the share of men employed in manufactur-

ing. Electrification also increases employment in construction and decreases employment in transportation.

A 100km increase in high-voltage power lines lowers the share of men employed in agriculture by 0.6 per-

centage points and increases the share of men employed in manufacturing by 0.5 percentage points. The

      Notes: The table reports back of the envelope calculations on the approximate contribution of electrification to the
      decline in farmers and the rise of operatives. National trends in panel A are taken from Tables C.9 and C.10. National
      trends in electrical grid expansion in panel B are taken from Table 2. Estimates of the impact of grid expansion on
      occupational and industrial composition of employment are taken from Tables 4 and 5 for occupations as well as 6 and
      7 for sectors.



electrification played a role in structural transformation, which we will now quantify more precisely.



4.3. Implied effects of electrification on structural transformation
    Table 8 summarizes a back of the envelope calculation to gauge the contribution of electrification to

structural transformation between 1910 and 1940. Scaling our IV estimates from Table 5 and with the

average county-level increase in high-voltage transmission lines, we find that electrification explains roughly

18% of the national decline in the employment share of farmers between 1910 and 1940 and about 50% of

the increase in the employment share of operatives.

    An analogous calculation for industries based on Table 7 suggests that electrification accounts for 15%

of the decline in the employment share of agriculture and about 28% of the increase in the employment

share of manufacturing. Electrification may have a lower impact on industries than on occupations because

agriculture and manufacturing are comprised of other occupations besides farmers and operatives respec-

tively (Appendix Tables C.23 and C.25): in agriculture, the share of farmers is about two thirds in 1910,

and in manufacturing, operatives constitute only 28% of employment in 1910 (Appendix Table C.23). Fur-

                                                                21
thermore, while farmers are essentially only found in agriculture, one can find operatives in other industries

besides manufacturing (Appendix Tables C.24 and C.26): for example, in 1910, 37% of operatives were in

manufacturing and 29% were in mining (Appendix Table C.24).

       Overall, the picture that emerges from our results is that electrification played a causal role in moving

American employment away from farming occupations and toward operatives occupations, explaining a sig-

nificant share of the structural transformation in early twentieth century U.S.. Figure 1 graphically illustrates

these back of the envelope calculations for the entire occupational and indstrial structure.



4.4. Additional results and robustness tests
       The effects of electrification could be different between rural and urban counties. In Appendix Tables

C.15 (OLS) and C.16 (IV), we add an interaction between a dummy for a county being urban and elec-

trification. We find that the impact of electrification between 1910 and 1940 on farmers and operatives is

driven by rural counties. Similarly, the effect of electrification on agriculture and manufacturing are driven

by rural counties, though results are imprecise for agriculture (Appendix Table C.21 for OLS, and C.22 for

IV). Therefore, it appears that electrification accelerated structural transformation within rural counties in

the U.S. rather than changing the occupational structure in urban counties.

       What are the effects of electrification during different decades? We start with changes between 1910 and

1920. During this decade, there was little increase in electrification (Table 2) and the instrument is relatively

weak (Table 3) so we should not over-interpret the results. In terms of occupations, IV regressions9 show

a significant increase in the share of sales and professional occupations (Appendix Table C.12). In terms

of industries, IV results10 show a significant decline in mining, transportation and public services and a

significant increase in construction, trade, and services (Appendix Table C.18).

       Between 1910 and 1930, electrification increases considerably (Table 2). IV regressions11 show that

electrification significantly increased the share of operatives in male employment (Appendix Table C.14),

though the effect is smaller than for 1940, consistent with this being an earlier period. The impact on farmers

in 1930 is less than half as large as the impact on farmers in 1940 and is not statistically significant. This

suggests that electrification had an earlier effect on operatives than on farmers.

       As for the impact of electrification on the industry structure in 1930, the IV results12 show a significant

positive effect on manufacturing but not yet a significant negative effect on farming (Appendix Table C.20).

This is consistent with the historical evidence cited above that wages in agriculture only started to collapse

in the 1930s.

       Overall, electrification spread most vigorously in the 1920s and 1930s, and we correspondingly observe

a causal significant and positive effect on the share of operatives in male employment in both 1930 and 1940,

and a causal significant and negative impact on the share of farmers in 1940. In parallel, we see already a

significant positive effect of electrification on manufacturing in 1930 and 1940, and a significant negative

effect on farming by 1940. This suggests that electrification played a causal role in structural transformation

by stimulating job creation for operatives and the growth of the manufacturing sector, and in a second time

facilitated the decline in farmers and the shrinking of the agriculture industry.



5. Conclusion
       In this paper, we leverage a new combination of U.S. Census data and electricity data on hydro-electric

potential and high-voltage power lines to examine the impact of electrification on the employment structure

in the early twentieth century U.S.. We instrument the length of high-voltage power lines in a county with

hydro-electric potential with 50 miles of that county. We find that the average increase in the length of

high-voltage power lines between 1910 and 1940 increased the share of operatives in male employment in a

county by 3.3 percentage points and decreased the share of farmers by 2.1 percentage points. Electrification

can explain 50.5% of the total increase in the share of operatives in male employment, and 18.1% of the total

decrease in the share of farmers. At the industry level, electrification can explain 15.7% of the decline in the

share of male agricultural employment and 28.4% of the increase in the share of manufacturing employment.

       We find that much of the increase in operatives over this period is in rural areas rather than urban areas,

suggesting that structural transformation is not just a movement between rural and urban areas but affects

the structure of employment within rural areas.

       The effects of electrification take a very long time to unfold, illustrating the long time scales involved

when trying to understand the impact of a general purpose technology on the labor market. First, even though

electricity was developed commercially in the late 19th century, most residents and commercial activities

in the U.S. did not have electricity by 1910, and only large urban areas were electrified. The development

of higher-voltage power lines was very slow until 1920, and only accelerated significantly between 1920

and 1940. We show that this acceleration of electrification affected the structure of employment, especially

favoring the growth of operative jobs and negatively affecting farmer jobs. The long timescale for the impact

of electrification on the labor market suggests that we may see a similarly protracted development of the full

impacts of ICT--the latest general purpose technology--on the labor market.

Appendix A. Adjustment of 979 Occupation/Industry Codes
   We develop a simple procedure in order to drastically reduce the number of 979 codes in the original

IPUMS files. To do so, we exploit the fact that IPUMS has coded different Census files sequentially, starting

with 1940 and working backwards until 1910. It turns out that there are many instances in which identical

entries for occstr and/or indstr appear in several Census waves, yet are assigned 979 in one Census

and an actual occupation and/or industries in others. We therefore apply the following two step procedure.

First, from all four Census waves during 1910-1940, we gather all unique occstr-indstr tuples that

map into non-979, non-missing occ1950-ind1950 tuples. If a unique occstr-indstr tuple maps

into several different occ1950-ind1950 tuples, we keep the most frequent mapping. In each Census file,

we then replace any occstr-indstr tuples that are assigned 979 with the non-979, non-missing value

found in the comprehensive list of the most frequent mapping from all four Census waves.

   While there is some benefit to looking at occstr-indstr tuples, we repeat this procedure analo-

gously for any remaining 979 values but using occstr by itself. We do not repeat this procedure for

indstr by itself, as "industries" are in many cases coded simply as the name of an employer, or a particu-

lar location, so it is often not possible to assign an industry based on indstr in isolation.

Notes: The figure shows national trends in the occupational structure during 1910-1940 in the United States. Panel A plots fractions
of the male working age population, without inmates and military. Panel B decomposes the fractions of those without a reported
occupation (first group of bars labeled "No Occupation") into it's sub-components based on IPUMS OCC1950 codes.
