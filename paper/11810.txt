Who Benefits from New Medical Technologies? Estimates of Consumer and Producer Surpluses
for HIV/AIDS Drugs

                                           ABSTRACT

The social value of an innovation is comprised of the value to consumers and the value to innovators.
We estimate that for the HIV/AIDS therapies that entered the market from the late 1980's onwards,
innovators appropriated only 5% of the social surplus arising from these new technologies. Despite
the high annual costs of these drugs to patients, the low share of social surplus going to innovators
raises concerns about advocating cost-effectiveness criteria that would further reduce this share, and
hence further reduce incentives for innovation.

Section 1: Introduction

The value of a new technology may be divided between consumers, whose
willingness to pay may exceed the price paid, and producers or innovators, whose
costs may be lower than the price charged. Consumer surplus is central to static
efficiency after an innovation has been discovered, while producer surplus, which
forms the incentive for firms to engage in costly R&D to bring an innovation to
market, is central to dynamic efficiency. Therefore, understanding the degree to
which innovation benefits consumers versus producers is important for policies
aimed at trading off the two forms of efficiency, such as intellectual property and
R&D policies.
        However, empirical evidence on the division of social surplus arising from
new health care technologies is very scarce or non-existent. To begin to remedy
this lack of knowledge, this paper investigates this issue for a major breakthrough
in medicine—the new drugs to treat HIV/AIDS that came on the market after the
late 1980’s. HIV/AIDS is an important case to consider in and of itself, partly
because it is perhaps the major disease targeted by public sector R&D in the US.2
For the new HIV drugs that came about during this period, our major finding is
that innovators captured only 5% of the social surplus arising from these new
technologies. More precisely, consumer and producer surplus from these drugs
amounted to roughly $1.33 trillion and $63 billion, respectively. We argue that if
the new HIV/AIDS therapies are representative of other technologies, the lack of
appropriation of social surplus by innovators has strong policy implications for
how to adopt and evaluate new health care technologies. Despite the high prices
of many therapies such as the new HIV drugs, patients and health plans are
getting too good a deal in the short run which, of course, hurts them in the long
run by insufficient R&D.3
        The low share of appropriation by innovators can be understood by some
simple back-of-the-envelope calculations. For the size of the consumer surplus,
consider the 1.5 million US citizens who have been infected by HIV since the
start of the epidemic, some of whom died before drug therapy became available
and some of whom lived until or contracted HIV after the breakthrough drugs
entered the market in the mid 1990’s. Averaging across all such cohorts, the gain

2
  Public R&D on HIV/AIDS was roughly $2 billion in 2000. Health, in general, is among the three
leading industries into which the government allocates its R&D, the other two being defense and
aero-space. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is responsible for allocating the vast majority
of the public R&D dollar—in 1999, NIH funding accounted for nearly 81% of public spending on
health R&D. Of the $13.9 billion that the NIH spent on research in 1999, nearly $1.8 billion
(13%) was spent on HIV/AIDS (Health, United States, 2002).
3
  The inefficiency typically associated with non-appropriation is the classic one discussed in the
literature. See, for example, Arrow (1961), Tirole (1988), and more recently, Philipson and Jena
(2005).
in life-expectancy has been at least 5 years. With a low value of a life-year of
$100,000, the added survival has been worth more than $500 thousand per
individual and $750 billion in aggregate. This figure, of course, does not include
the benefit to those individuals who become infected with HIV in later years but
can benefit from drugs introduced to date—doing so, while assuming current
incidence rates persist in the future, raises the total consumer value of these drugs
above $1 trillion.4
        For the size of the producer surplus, consider that sales of HIV/AIDS
drugs have grown from $1 billion to $4 billion annually since the breakthrough
drugs came on the market in 1996. From these revenues, one can compute a
present value of sales of $74 billion assuming that drugs sell at current levels in
the future. We can then subtract the variable costs of production, which are
approximated to be 15% of revenues based on estimates of markups stemming
from differences in drug prices pre- and post patent expiration.
        This paper is related to several strands of other work. Our finding of a low
degree of surplus appropriation by innovators of HIV/AIDS drugs relates to an
existing literature outside of health economics on the general inability of
innovators to capture the social value of their inventions.5 It also relates to a vast
and growing literature on cost-effectiveness analysis that attempts to assess the
value of new innovations mainly from the perspective of consumer surplus,
wrongly ignoring the incentives for innovation such criteria induce.6
        The paper may be briefly outlined as follows. Section 2 estimates the
share of social surplus appropriated by producers for the case of HIV/AIDS drugs.
Section 3 discusses how much value is left in future HIV/AIDS research as
estimated using our methods. Lastly, section 4 concludes.




4
  Our analysis includes future cohorts for several reasons. First, since the relevant R&D has
already been undertaken and the subsequent drugs already introduced, it is natural to focus on the
lifetime returns to innovators (i.e. profits) and the comparable benefits to future infected cohorts.
In fact, since the vast majority of sales of HIV/AIDS drugs from 1987 to 2000 occurred after
1995, limiting our analysis to cohorts and firm profits affected to date would lower our estimated
appropriation. For example, sales of HIV/AIDS drugs from 1987 to 2000 amounted to $11
billion, while gross benefits to consumers were roughly $398 billion, implying a surplus
appropriation of well below 5%.

Section 2: Surplus Appropriation for the New HIV/AIDS Drugs

2.1 Background on HIV/AIDS Drugs

HIV is the causative agent of AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome), a
chronic disease characterized by suppression of an individual’s immune system.
The main mechanism of immune suppression is the destruction of the hosts’ CD4
(Helper) T-cells—these cells stimulate the body’s normal immune response to
bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens. AIDS can be diagnosed clinically or
serologically (a low CD4 count). The clinical manifestation of AIDS includes the
presence of opportunistic infections (infections that are otherwise harmless to an
immune-competent individual), AIDS-related cancers, wasting, and dementia.
        The time between initial HIV infection and the onset of AIDS varies, but
is on average, several years even without treatment. Much can be done to slow
this progression and the progression from AIDS to death. The four classes of
drugs used to treat HIV/AIDS and the year of first marketing are shown in Table
1.
                  Table 1: HIV/AIDS Anti-retroviral drug classes

HIV utilizes RNA as its genetic code—upon entry into a cell, the HIV’s own
machinery (reverse transcriptase) transcribes this RNA into its DNA analog. This
transcription process involves building the DNA from a series of small precursors
called nucleotides. The NRTIs are essentially ‘fake nucleotides’—they compete
with the normal nucleotides and when incorporated into the budding DNA chain,
prematurely terminate transcription. The NNRTIs do not mimic nucleotides—
instead, they directly bind to reverse transcriptase, rendering it inactive and
thereby preventing the formation of DNA.
        In the absence of any treatment, the DNA produced by the viruses’ reverse
transcriptase is able to integrate into the host DNA. That DNA is ultimately used
by the host’s machinery to produce a long, inactive poly-protein, a protein
comprised of several smaller, active proteins. It is these smaller proteins that
enable the newly replicated virus to infect and kill other Helper T-cells. The PIs
act by preventing the conversion of the poly-protein into the smaller constituent
proteins (this conversion is normally done by the HIV enzyme, protease, hence
the name protease inhibitor). The final and most recently developed class of
drugs, fusion inhibitors, act by a distinct mechanism—they prevent the initial
attachment and entry of HIV into the Helper T-cell. Highly Active Anti-
Retroviral Therapy (HAART) combines drugs from several of the above
classes—this combination is more effective in reducing HIV levels in the blood
and slowing the development of viral resistance. These drugs are effective in
lowering viral load and consequently increasing CD4 counts in both AIDS and
HIV-only patients.

2.2 Valuation Formulas

In this section, we provide the theoretical underpinning for the economic value of
newly introduced HIV/AIDS drugs. In short, for a given set of people that are
diagnosed in a given year, we compare survival rates from HIV/AIDS before and
after the introduction of Anti-Retroviral (ARV) drugs and attach a monetary value
to that survival compared to a baseline survival when no drugs were available. We
repeat this for the new set of cases, cohort by cohort, since the start of the
epidemic and then aggregate up.
         Since antiretrovirals are effective in slowing the transition from AIDS to
death and from HIV to AIDS, any estimates of the value of added survival
induced by these drugs should not only be restricted to AIDS patients. Instead,
these estimates should also account for decreased rates of transition between HIV
and AIDS. This suggests that any empirical specification should use survival
curves conditional on a diagnosis of HIV as opposed to AIDS. The progression
from initial HIV infection to death can be modeled in two steps (with two
corresponding survival functions): the transition from HIV to AIDS and from
AIDS to death. These two survival functions can be used to generate a new
survival function, St(d), summarizing the transition from HIV to death for
individuals diagnosed with HIV in year t. This survival curve is assumed to be
raised by the consumption of new drugs compared to the counterfactual survival
curve So(d) experienced by those infected in year zero, here taken to be 1979.
         Each year, there is a new cohort of HIV infected people (incidence). The
initial cohort of HIV infected people face the survival curve So(d). The gross
consumer surplus, g, induced by the new drug consumption is calculated by
multiplying the size of cohort t, nt, by the monetary value of increased survival
and summing over all calendar years. Formally,

                               2000
                         g=           β t −1980 n t ⋅ g t   (1)
                              t =1980
where gt = g(So(d), St(d)), or the monetary value of increasing survival from the
baseline survival So(d) to the higher future survival faced by cohort t, St(d).
        The gain in survival, gt, can be calculated using the infra-marginal
valuation formula of Becker et al. (2005). They provide the value of survival
gains for an infra-marginal change in survival from So(d) to St(d) under a yearly
income y. Following Becker et al. (2005), this valuation is based on the
willingness of an individual in cohort t (with income yt) to accept a decrease in
survival from St(d) to So(d). Formally,

                           V[yt + et, So(d)] = V[yt, St(d)]                 (2)

where V is the indirect lifetime utility function and et is the yearly compensation
required to make the hypothetical individual indifferent between the two survival
frontiers.7 The lifetime value for the gain in survival is calculated by summing
the yearly compensation (et) over time, discounting by the rate of interest and the
new survival probability. That is,
                                        ∞
                                gt =          β d ⋅ S o (d ) ⋅ et     (3)
                                       d =0
Becker et al. parameterize the instantaneous utility function to be:
                                       c 1−1 / γ
                             u (c ) =            +α (4)
                                      1 − 1/ γ
This leads to the following expressions for the yearly “willingness to accept”
infra-marginal changes in survival,
                                                                              γ
                       A( S t )                      A( S t ) − A( S o )     γ −1
            et = y t1−1 / γ ⋅   + α ⋅ (1 − 1 / γ ) ⋅                     − y t (5)
                       A( S o )                            A( S o )
where A(S) is the present value of an annuity discounted by the rate of interest
and the survival probability S. That is,
                                               ∞
                                A( S t ) =           β d ⋅ S t (d )   (6)
                                              d =0
The parameter α arises from a utility normalization and is estimated to be -14.97.
The intertemporal elasticity of substitution ( γ ) is set to 1.25, and the interest rate
to 3%. With the above parameter values and estimates of cohort-specific survival
curves, we can use the above formulas to estimate the value of gains in survival
under the willingness-to-accept criterion.


7
 Note that the use of yearly, as opposed to lifetime, income (y) and compensation (e) in
expression 2 follows from the assumption that the discount rate on instantaneous utility equals the
market rate of discount, i.e. the interest rate. For more details see Becker, et al. (2005).
        A major issue in using the above valuation formulas is how the income of
the target population is determined. This is particularly relevant to consumers of
HIV drugs, since they have lower than average incomes. This is, in part, due to
an increasing proportion of newly infected individuals who are low-income and
eligible for Medicaid. In addition, the disabling nature of the disease often causes
individuals to leave work, losing both income and employer-sponsored insurance
(Kates and Wilson, 2004). Simply using existing estimates of the value of life
may greatly overstate the value of survival gains from AIDS research if those
estimated values are based on the average income of the US population. In
particular, if such estimates stem from wage-mortality tradeoffs among the
employed population, they may overstate value of life estimates among the
unemployed. Before developing the empirical counterparts of the above valuation
expressions, we briefly discuss the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS.

2.3 Time Series of HIV/AIDS

Estimating the aggregate value of additional survival for all those diagnosed with
HIV requires data on the incidence of HIV and cohort-specific survival
conditional on the year of diagnosis of HIV (i.e. survival probabilities for cohorts
diagnosed with HIV in 1984, 1985, etc). Only within the past ten years have a
substantial number of states begun mandatory HIV reporting—prior to that, only
AIDS cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC). This complicates the analysis for two reasons. First, estimates of HIV
incidence are not as readily available as those of AIDS incidence. Second, there
are no published cohort-specific survival curves with time zero being
seroconversion (contraction of HIV). We address these issues, in turn, below.
        Figure 1 graphs AIDS incidence, prevalence, and deaths from the CDC’s
HIV/AIDS Annual Sureveillance Reports. Since early estimates of HIV
incidence are not available from reporting data (as is the case with AIDS),
estimates of HIV incidence prior to 1990 were obtained from published figures
using the method of “back-calculation” (Brookmeyer, 1991). Since 1990, the
CDC has estimated incidence to be roughly 40,000 annually—this estimate is
consistent with data on rates of transmission among hetero- and homo-sexuals and
prevalence of both groups in the US.8 There have been over 900,000 diagnosed
AIDS cases to date, with over 500,000 AIDS related deaths. There are slightly
over 400,000 individuals currently living with AIDS and roughly 650,000
individuals living with HIV only.

There are at least three points worth noting in Figure 1. First, large declines in
AIDS deaths followed the introduction of Protease Inhibitors and Non-Nucleoside
Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors in 1995 and 1996. Second, there seem to be
declines in AIDS diagnoses since 1995, which is consistent with an effect of
ARVs on the transition from HIV to AIDS. Finally, the apparent increase in
AIDS diagnoses around 1993 is, in part, due to a change in the definition of
AIDS. Prior to 1993, a diagnosis of AIDS was based on the clinical finding of an
opportunistic infection. After 1993, the diagnosis was expanded to include
individuals with CD4 counts below 200 per cubic millimeter. This re-definition
creates a problem in our construction of AIDS to death survival curves, which we
address shortly.

2.4 Estimating the Time from AIDS to Death

As noted above, to our knowledge, there are no data available for cohort specific
survival curves for the transition from HIV to death. To overcome this data
limitation, we use data from several sources to construct estimates of these curves.
Using 1) published cohort specific survival curves for AIDS patients (time zero
being diagnosis of AIDS, as opposed to HIV) for each year from 1984-2000 and
2) survival curves for transition of HIV to AIDS for 1980-83 and 1996-1997, we
construct survival curves for the transition of HIV to AIDS for 1984-2000. 9
Under some assumptions, we use our estimated HIV to AIDS and AIDS to death
survival curves to generate HIV to Death survival curves for each year of HIV
diagnosis from 1979-2000.10 It is important to stress that our basic conclusions
about the returns to HIV/AIDS R&D will not depend on the methods used to
generate these curves.
        The earlier theoretical analysis requires the use of survival curves that
span the entire range of lifetimes. The survival curves published by the CDC,
however, are censored five years after diagnosis. There are two possible ways to
overcome this limitation. One way is to fit the survival curves to known
parametric forms (such as exponential, Weibull, or Gompertz). This is
problematic for several reasons and is considered more carefully in the Appendix.
The second way to project our survival curves forward, and the means we
employ, is to assume that individuals who have survived five years since a
diagnosis of AIDS experience future survival that is typical of, say, a normal 70
year-old male. Intuitively, individuals who have survived this long still face
certain medical problems that lead to lower survival than other normal individuals
their age. However, they may face survival probabilities that are similar to
individuals substantially older than them. While the leading causes of death
differ between the two groups, they do share some similarities—for example, the
elderly can often die from pneumonia, which is also a common cause of death in
AIDS patients. We describe the above estimation procedure more thoroughly and
examine the robustness of our estimates in the Appendix.
        Figure 2 presents estimated survival curves conditional on a diagnosis of
AIDS for select years of diagnosis. AIDS is defined according to the post-93
definition to ensure comparability across years.

  Survival curves for AIDS patients: “Survival after AIDS Diagnosis in Adolescents and Adults
during the Treatment Era,” United States, 1984-1997, Lisa M. Lee, John M. Karon, Richard Selik,
Joyce Neal, Patricia Fleming, JAMA, March 14, 2001--Vol. 285, No. 10. The AIDS survival
curves are generated by following individuals in the official CDC HIV/AIDS Registry over time.
This differs from the “period life-table” approach to generating survival curves.
10
   Prior to 1993, AIDS was defined by the presence of an opportunistic infection. After 1993, the
definition was expanded to include individuals with low CD4 counts (serological diagnosis) as
well. Since AIDS patients with opportunistic infections have poorer survival than those diagnosed
serologically, a comparison of published survival curves for “AIDS” patients in 1984 and 2000
would overestimate the true increase in survival. We use data from 1993-1997, for which survival
information exists under both pre- and post-1993 definitions, to compute an adjustment factor
which is applied to AIDS survival data from 1984-1992. This results in estimates of survival from
AIDS which are comparable over time. The details are presented in the Appendix.

The above figure demonstrates the huge increases in survival experienced by later
cohorts diagnosed with AIDS compared to their earlier counterparts. In fact,
consistent with findings by Goldman et al. (2000) and Bhattacharya and Goldman
(2003), the gains in survival arising from the early HIV/AIDS drugs (namely
AZT) were marginal compared to the gains experienced due to the breakthrough
drugs in the mid 1990’s. The difference is particularly stark when comparing
survival among individuals diagnosed with AIDS in 1996 to survival of those
diagnosed in 1988. The five year mortality rate is nearly fifty percentage points
lower in 1996. Table 2 in the Appendix presents the life-expectancy from AIDS,
by year of diagnosis. Our estimates suggest that life expectancy for AIDS
patients has increased from 3 years in 1984 to 16.5 years in 2000.

2.5 Estimating the Time from HIV Infection to Death

As stated earlier, the final goal is to arrive at estimates of survival conditional on a
diagnosis of HIV (not AIDS). The CDC implemented a program of confidential
name-based reporting of HIV cases in 1994—this program was adopted by 25
states. The CDC has not published official estimates of survival from HIV to
AIDS using this data.        There are numerous studies in the medical literature,
however, that follow individuals longitudinally to determine the time from HIV
seroconversion to onset of AIDS. We use data from one such study (CASCADE
Collaboration), which aggregates data from 38 smaller studies for which the date
of seroconversion can be reliably estimated. Specifically, we use data on AIDS-
free survival of HIV infected individuals in two periods, 1980-83 and 1996-97.11
For each of the two time periods, we have a single survival curve. The
individuals in this study are drawn from Europe, Australia, and North America
and consequently may not be fully representative of the HIV infected population
in the US. However, comparisons with other estimates within the US show little
difference.
        With estimated AIDS-free survival curves for individuals infected with
HIV in 1980-83 and 1996-1997 in hand, we estimate survival for each year
between these two time periods using the following strategy. We assume that
survival in each year from 1979 to 1983 is equivalent to the survival estimated for
the four year period as a whole. Similarly, we assume that the AIDS-free survival
for each year from 1997 to 2000 is equivalent to the estimated survival for 1996-
1997. Using these two sets of survival curves as bounds for survival in the
intermediate years, we assume that survival in the intermediate years evolves in a
manner similar to the survival from AIDS to death during those same years, on
which we have estimates. Specifically, we assume that the share of the total
increase in HIV to AIDS survival from 1980-2000 that occurs between 1984 and
1985 is equal to the share of total improvement in AIDS survival that takes place
between those same years. This implicitly assumes that between years, treatment
affects the transition from HIV to AIDS and AIDS to death relatively the same,
the frame of reference being the total improvement in survival for each group
from 1980-2000.
        Using the previously estimated survival curves for AIDS and the AIDS-
free survival for HIV infected individuals, we generate survival curves
conditional on an infection with HIV for each year from 1979 to 2000. The
details behind this estimation are presented in the Appendix. Figure 3 presents
the survival after an infection with HIV, by year of infection. Table 3 in the
Appendix presents the average time to onset of AIDS and the life-expectancy
after HIV infection for various years of HIV infection.




11
    The AIDS-free survival in the CASCADE study is censored at 13 years. We fit the remainder
of each survival curve using the Weibull specification. The fact the published survival curves
extend 13 years allows us to reliably do so.

                                                    Years Since Infection

From the above graph and Table 3 in the Appendix, it is clear that advances in
treatment have led to increases in both the time to onset of AIDS and the period of
time alive after a diagnosis of AIDS. The life-expectancy of the average
individual infected with HIV has increased roughly 15 years since the start of the
epidemic, from 19 to 34 years. These figures are slightly larger than those in the
literature—for example, the mean incubation time of HIV (time from HIV to
AIDS) in the early 1980’s is generally thought to be between 10 and 11 years,
while the life-expectancy after AIDS is 3 - 4 years. These estimates suggest an
initial life-expectancy from HIV of almost 15 years, so our above estimates are
not far off.
         To further verify the reasonableness of our estimates, we can use our
estimated annual HIV survival curves and reported data on annual HIV incidence
to estimate the current number of individuals infected with HIV/AIDS. We can
then compare this imputed figure to published figures from the CDC.
Specifically, we multiply the incidence of HIV in a given year by the proportion
of individuals infected with HIV in that year who survive until 2003, as
determined from the estimated survivals. Doing so from the very beginning of the
epidemic, we estimate 1,055,097 to be living with HIV/AIDS in 2003. This can
be compared to the CDC estimate of 1,067,522, a difference of only 12,424
people! It is important to note that these differences will not impact the sheer
magnitude of the value of gains in survival.12 With estimated survival for various
cohorts infected with HIV in hand, we now turn to valuing the gains in survival.

2.6 Valuing the Gains in Survival due to HIV/AIDS Drugs

Using survival of an individual infected with HIV in 1979 as a benchmark, we use
the valuation formulas described earlier to compute the lifetime value to an
individual of increasing survival to that of someone infected with HIV in a given
later year. Aggregate values for each year are computed by multiplying that
year’s incidence of HIV by the value of increased survival experienced by a
single individual in that cohort. Note that these figures ignore the behavioral
change that raises incidence in response to better treatments, which we discuss
more fully in the Conclusion. The income used in the calculations is GDP per
capita (in year 2000 dollars). All figures are discounted back to 1980.




12
    The calculated survival functions suggest an upper bound of the increase in life-expectancy
attributable to HIV/AIDS drugs. This is due to concomitant advances in the treatment of
HIV/AIDS in areas other than anti-retrovirals. From 1984 to 2000, life expectancy increased by
nearly fifteen years for individuals infected with HIV and thirteen years for individuals diagnosed
with AIDS. This can be compared to the estimates of Lichtenberg (2005), who estimates increases
in AIDS life-expectancy of nearly 22 years from 1993 to 2001, 13 years of which is attributable to
HIV/AIDS drugs.

                   Total Discounted Value                      398
          All figures are discounted to 1980 and are in year 2000 dollars.

The above results suggest that the aggregate value of improved survival
experienced by all individuals infected with HIV to date has been nearly $400
billion. This, of course, ignores the value of increasing survival for all individuals
who have not contracted HIV yet, but will do so in the future. We add this
component to our calculations later in the section.
         We can compare our value of life estimates with other estimates in the
literature. One way of doing this is by calculating the gain in life-expectancy
induced by our estimated survival functions and then using existing estimates of
the value of a life-year to value the changes in life-expectancy induced by HIV
drug consumption. Since life-expectancy associated with a survival curve is its
sum over ages, if we have an estimate of the value of a life-year, v, the value of
increasing survival from a benchmark of So (d ) to that of cohort t, St (d ) satisfies

                                ∞                   ∞
                          v⋅          St ( d ) −          So (d )   (7)
                               d >0                d >0



This implicitly assumes an age-invariant value of a life-year, but adjusting this
value for age may, of course, also be done. Using common estimates of the value
of a life-year in the range of $100 thousand (Cutler and Richardson, 1998), we
can calculate the value of increasing life expectancy from the benchmark to that
of a cohort diagnosed in a given year. Table 3 presents the value of the gain in
life expectancy based on the value of a life-year equal to $100,000. Note that
when calculating the value of increased life expectancy using the value of a life-
year, each additional year of life expectancy is discounted back to 1980.

         All figures are discounted to 1980 and are in year 2000 dollars.

For recent years, the value of increased life expectancy derived from the value of
a life-year is similar to our value of life estimates, amounting to nearly $750
thousand for year 2000 survival.
        As alluded to earlier, the consumer benefit from HIV/AIDS drugs does not
simply include the aggregate value calculated to date, but also includes the value
to future cohorts of increased survival. We can forecast the value to future
cohorts of HIV infected individuals by assuming that all cohorts experience the
same aggregate gain in survival gt as the last cohort, 2000. Hence, we assume
                          g 2000+t = g 2000 ∀t > 0       (8)
Assuming that the future incidence of HIV is equivalent to the last period, we can
calculate the discounted sum of future gains for individuals infected with HIV in
the future. We then add this amount to the value to date calculated earlier,
namely $398 billion. This leads to an aggregate value of increased survival for
all past and future cohorts of nearly $1.4 trillion. In the next section, we calculate
the lifetime profits and variable costs associated with production. This allows us
to decompose the total value of HIV/AIDS drugs into consumer surplus, producer
surplus (profits), and costs.

2.7 Dividing the Social Surplus into Producer and Consumer Surplus

The overall producer surplus obtained from R&D is determined by the present
value of producer surplus to firms producing HIV/AIDS drugs. Specifically, it is:
                                       ∞
                                π=         β t −1980 ⋅ π t   (9)
                                     t =1980
An upper bound of producer surplus is the aggregate sales for HIV/AIDS drugs.
An alternative lower estimate takes out variable costs. We do this by applying
existing estimates of markups for brand-name drugs estimated from patent
expirations, and applying those markups to the observed aggregate sales.
         Figure 4 presents estimates of national spending on HIV/AIDS drugs
broken down by public and private payers. The estimates for total spending are
from IMS Health and are reported in Lichtenberg (2005). Public spending is
approximated by the sum of Medicaid and ADAP expenditures. The Medicaid
estimates include both federal and state contributions and were calculated from
the Medicaid State Drug Utilization Data using National Drug Codes (NDC) for
all antiretrovirals introduced since 1987.13 Medicaid expenditure on HIV/AIDS
drugs is unavailable prior to the last quarter of 1991—this is likely because
Medicaid began its Prescription Drug Rebate Program (for all drugs, not just
ARVs) only in 1990. 14 Data on ADAP expenditures are unavailable prior to
1996, though it was informally covering some individuals through the Ryan
White CARE Program prior to that.15

Figure 4 demonstrates the large increase in spending on HIV/AIDS drugs in the
past ten years. Since 1995, spending has increased from $250 million to almost
$4 billion, largely due to increased spending on protease inhibitors and nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Figure 5 also depicts the large share of total
spending on HIV/AIDS drugs that comes from public sources, nearly 50% from
1997 onwards.
        In order to estimate the aggregate lifetime profits from HIV/AIDS drugs,
we must make assumptions about future sales. One possibility is to assume that
future sales are equal to last-period sales, in this case national sales of HIV/AIDS
drugs in 2000. We use estimates from the literature on the prices of generic drugs
relative to their branded counterparts to assume variable costs to be no more than
15% of sales (Caves, et al., 1991).16 With sales in the future being equivalent to
year 2000’s patent-protected sales, we estimate lifetime sales to be roughly $74
billion. This suggests a lifetime variable cost of production of $11.1 billion (74 x
0.15) and lifetime profits of $62.9 billion.
        Using the above figures, we can decompose the total lifetime value of
HIV/AIDS drugs into consumer surplus, producer surplus (profits), and

16
  In “Patent Expiration, Entry, and Competition in the U.S. Pharmaceutical Industry,” R. Caves,
M. Whinston, and M. Hurwitz estimate that with 20 generic competitors, the ratio of prices
between generic and brand drugs is roughly 17%. We use the price of generic drugs as an upper
bound of the marginal costs of production.
production costs. Recall that we estimated the total value to be nearly $1.4
trillion, discounted to 1980 in year 2000 dollars. This amounts to a lifetime
consumer surplus of roughly $1.33 trillion ($1.4 trillion – $74 billion). With a
social surplus (total value net of production costs) of $1.38 trillion, almost 95% is
captured in the form of consumer surplus.

Section 3: Potential Gains from Future R&D

The previous analysis of the value of life gains induced by HIV/AIDS drugs
introduced to date suggested a gross benefit to consumers of nearly $1.4 trillion.
This begs the question: In the current environment in which several HIV/AIDS
drugs already exist, what is the added value of a complete cure for AIDS? Figure
5 below illustrates this question.

As demonstrated earlier, the survival for an individual infected with HIV has
improved dramatically since 1980. Also plotted in Figure 5 is the survival of a
normal, healthy 30 year-old individual in 2000—the area between the survival of
an individual infected with HIV in 2000 and that of a healthy individual in the
same year represents the gain in life-expectancy for the HIV-infected individual
from a cure for AIDS. The added value from a cure for AIDS is divided among
two groups, those individuals who have contracted HIV in the past and can now
resume normal, healthy lives and those individuals who contract HIV in the future
and would otherwise experience survival typical of someone infected with HIV in
2000.
         We can use the previously described methodology to estimate the added
value from a cure for AIDS. Supposing a complete cure becomes available in
2010, we can modify our survival curves to account for a complete cure that
restores survival to that of normal individuals.17 For example, these modifications
take into account that an individual who survives to 2010 after contracting HIV at
the age of 30 in 1990 follows survival of a healthy 50 year-old after being cured
of HIV/AIDS. Essentially replicating our earlier analysis, we estimate the value
to increased survival induced by both drugs introduced to date and a cure
introduced in 2010 to be nearly $3.2 trillion. Recall that the value of life induced
by drugs introduced to date (with no cure) was estimated to be roughly $1.4
trillion. This suggests that there is almost $1.8 trillion of gross benefit to be had
from a complete cure for AIDS. This raises the question of whether producers
should be appropriated more surplus to close the remaining gap in HIV/AIDS
survival.

Section 4: Conclusion

The value of an innovation may be divided into the gains to consumers and
innovators. We estimated that for the HIV/AIDS therapies that entered the market
from the late 1980’s onwards, innovators appropriated only 5% of the social
surplus arising from these new technologies.
        Despite the high prices of these drugs to patients and health plans, the low
share of social surplus going to innovators raises concerns about advocating cost-
effectiveness criteria that would further reduce this share, and hence further
reduce incentives for innovation. In particular, popular technology assessment
criteria in healthcare going under the rubric of “cost-effectiveness” often
implicitly maximize consumer surplus, which is consistent with maximizing static
efficiency after an innovation has been developed. Dynamic efficiency, however,
aligns the social costs and benefits of R&D and is therefore determined by how
much of the social surplus from a new technology is appropriated by producers.
        Our findings suggest several questions to be addressed by future research.
First, why is the share of surplus appropriated by producers so small and the cost-
effectiveness so seemingly high? One may be tempted to argue that there is a
lack of market power of those holding patents on these new technologies due to
therapeutic competition within drug classes. However, this certainly does not
17
  Recall that these survival curves already account for improved survival due to drugs introduced
to date.
seem to be the case for the breakthrough drugs in HIV/AIDS. Furthermore, in a
related theoretical analysis, Philipson and Jena (2005) show that even if
substitutes do not exist and patents are very broad, as when demand is highly
inelastic, the share of the social surplus allocated to the producer may be very
small.
        Second, the small estimated share of social surplus appropriated by
investors sheds important light on the recent growth of alternative funding
mechanisms to stimulate HIV/AIDS research, e.g. through advance purchasing
contracts of governments or private foundations.18 Given that there is a social
surplus above a trillion that is not appropriated by R&D investors, a few billion
dollars added to stimulate innovation, as these public or private contracts seem to
provide, seems to pale in comparison to the missed consumer surplus not
appropriated.
        Third, the economic epidemiology of chronic infectious diseases may alter
the social value of HIV/AIDS drugs (Philipson, 2000). For example, one
behavioral response to treatment may be an increase in incidence due to a lower
cost of risky behavior. This might be mitigated by the longer life-expectancies
(and prolonged ability to infect others) of HIV infected individuals receiving
treatment. Offsetting this second effect, however, is the fact that current
treatments lower the viral load and reduce the probability of infection at any point
in time. While these external effects may alter the social value of HIV/AIDS
drugs, their effect on the private value, which we consider here and is the target of
producer appropriation efforts, is likely limited.
        Finally, the peculiar aspects of healthcare markets may raise some non-
standard issues regarding the efficient form of surplus appropriation. One issue
concerns the effect of altruism, which seemingly motivates much of public
financing, on optimal technology adoption.19 A second concerns the effect of ex-
post inefficiencies such as moral hazard. A third concerns the impact of the joint
demand of physicians and patients as would be the case of the pharmaceutical
industry considered here.
        Our analysis and evidence, if they generalize to other technologies,
suggest that interventions should be sought to attempt to raise producer surplus
levels for new technologies. Even though this would lead to lower observed levels
of cost-effectiveness for these technologies, dynamic efficiency would be raised.

altruism that motivates public healthcare delivery, in general, and R&D into third-world diseases,
in particular.

Adjustment of AIDS Survival Data from 1984-1992 for Changes in AIDS
Definition

        t
Let N OI   and N St be the shares of newly diagnosed AIDS cases in year t based on
opportunistic infection (OI) and CD4 count (S), respectively. They sum to one.
      t
Let S OI  (d ) and S St (d ) be the corresponding survival curves. Under the pre-1993
definition, a diagnosis of AIDS includes only those individuals with an OI. Under
this definition, the proportion alive after d periods is:
                                          t
                                       APRE   (d ) = S OIt

 Under the post-1993 definition, a diagnosis of AIDS includes those with an OI
and those with a low CD4 count. The proportion alive after d periods under the
post-1993 definition is,
                           t
                         APOST (d ) = N OI

                                                                    t
a weighted average of the two survival functions. Note that APOST     (d ) is the
survival curve conditional on a diagnosis of AIDS used by the CDC after 1993.
For 1993-1997, we have survival curves conditional on a diagnosis of AIDS for
                                                                      t
both pre and post-1993 AIDS case definitions—that is, we have APRE        (d ) and
  t
 APOST (d ) for t=1993-1997. Subtracting the two curves, we obtain,

                                       = S OI

We can rewrite this as
                   t
                 APOST (d ) = N St (d ) ⋅ ( S St (d ) − S OI
                                                          t
                                                             (d )) + APRE
                                                                      t
                                                                          (d ) .
                                                 t
This expression suggests two ways of estimating APOST (d ) for years prior to 1993
                                                                t
using survival curves available for those years, namely APRE        (d ) .
Case 1:
First, we might simply average N St (d ) ⋅ ( S St (d ) − S OI
                                                           t
                                                              (d )) for t=1993-1997, and
                               t
add this correction factor to APRE  (d ) for years before 1993. Instead of averaging,
we might alternatively apply N S (d ) ⋅ ( S S1993 (d ) − S OI
                                1993                       1993
                                                                (d )) to all previous years.
Case 2:
               t                         t
Second, since APOST         t
                    (d ) , APRE (d ) = S OI (d ) , and N St (d ) are known for 1993-1997,
we can use these to back-calculate S St (d ) for those same years. Since N St (d ) and
S St (d ) are not known for years prior to 1993, we might use 1993 values for all
calculations. That is,
                  t
            Est[ APOST (d )] = N S1993 (d ) ⋅ ( S S1993 (d ) − S OI
                                                                 t
                                                                    (d )) + APRE
                                                                             t
                                                                                 (d ) for t<1993.
Given that the true correction factor for APRE        t
                                                         (d ) is N St (d ) ⋅ ( S St (d ) − S OI
                                                                                             t
                                                                                                (d )) , we
can compare this to the two cases above. For notational convenience, let t=1993
and for Case 1, consider N S1993 (d ) ⋅ ( S S1993 (d ) − S OI
                                                           1993
                                                                (d )) as opposed to the average.
Consider         Case      2     first.               The        true          correction           factor
N S (d ) ⋅ ( S S (d ) − S OI (d )) will be less than the correction factor in Case 2,
  1984         1984       1984


N S1993 (d ) ⋅ ( S S1993 (d ) − S OI
                                  1984
                                       (d ))   ,        since         S S1993 (d ) > S S1984 (d )      and
 N (d ) > N (d ) . The latter is true since a greater share of newly diagnosed

                   S
AIDS cases are likely to be only serologically diagnosed in the later years due to
better drug therapy. Thus, the correction factor for Case 2 would be an upper
bound of the true correction factor—estimated survival curves would overstate the
true survival curves. Reversely, N S1984 (d ) ⋅ ( S S1984 (d ) − S OI
                                                                   1984
                                                                        (d )) is likely to be
closer to N S1993 (d ) ⋅ ( S S1993 (d ) − S OI
                                            1993
                                                 (d )) , the correction factor for Case 1. This is
because the effects of N S1993 (d ) and S S1993 (d ) are in part mitigated by the fact
       1993
that S OI   (d ) > S OI
                     1984
                          (d ) , which brings correction factor 1 closer towards the true
correction factor. Consequently, the first correction factor is used to adjust the
pre-1993 data.20




                                                                                        t

     One might alternatively consider a multiplicative adjustment factor in which      APOST (d ) is

estimated for years prior to 1993 by simply multiplying      APRE (d ) by     1993
                                                                                        . We do not do

this for two reasons. First, the theoretical relationship between    APOST (d ) and APRE (d ) is
                                                                                         t
additive. Second, a multiplicative adjustment factor would result in values of [ APRE (d ) -
 t
APRE (d ) ] that are low for early years (since the base by which the adjustment factor is multiplied
is smaller). This is inconsistent with the data, which demonstrates that, for the years available,
this difference is roughly independent of the level of survival.
Estimating Survival from AIDS

Parametric estimation of AIDS survival curves published by the CDC is
problematic for several reasons. First, the exponential distribution has a constant
hazard, which is rejected in our data—in our case, the non-parametric plots
exhibit a declining hazard. Second, the Gompertz specification, which is
commonly used to characterize normal life tables, is inconsistent with the survival
patterns seen in AIDS patients. Third, since survival curves after the mid-90’s
exhibit almost 50% survival in the first five years, out-of-sample predictions of
future survival are unreliable. For example, fitting the 1995 survival curve to the
Gompertz specification results in nearly 50% of individuals still alive 10,000
months after diagnosis of AIDS—similar results hold for the Weibull. Note that
is not a problem with earlier years. For example, fitting the 1984 survival curve
to the Weibull distribution results in nearly all individuals dead within 20 years of
diagnosis. This is due to the fact that, unlike survival in later years, only 20% of
individuals survive past five years of diagnosis.
        Another way to project our survival curves forward is to assume that
conditional on surviving five years after a diagnosis of AIDS, future survival
follows the survival of a normal individual conditional on reaching age Y, where
Y is determined by the following expression,

SAIDS(d|Surviving 5 years since diagnosis in year t) = S(d|Y years old in year t+5)

The value of Y should differ across diagnosis cohorts. That is, an individual who
is alive in 1990 after being diagnosed with AIDS five years earlier will certainly
face different survival prospects than an analogous individual ten years later. Our
intuition for generating values of Y is the following. Individuals diagnosed with
AIDS in 1984 experienced a death rate of nearly 75% within the first five years.
We can use survival curves for normal individuals in 1984 to determine which
age group X experienced a similar death rate over the course of five years. We
can then use the survival curve of Y year-olds in 1989 (where Y = X + 5) to
project the 1984 AIDS survival curve past five years of diagnosis. Again, the idea
behind this method is that normal elderly individuals who face similar prospects
for five-year survival as do younger AIDS patients may also face similar survival
rates later on.
         In the actual estimation, we restrict our attention to changes in survival
within the last year of the five-year period. Specifically, instead of considering
the rate of death over the five-year period after diagnosis, we consider the rate of
death between years four and five. We then determine the ages of normal
individuals with similar one-year death rates. 21 The estimated ‘AIDS survival
equivalent ages’ are presented in Appendix Table 1. Figure 1 in this Appendix
compares projected survival curves generated by the parameterization and
imputation methods. For the years in which both methods were used, 1984-1993,
the estimated survival curves are quite similar.

  Since individuals comprising the latter part of the AIDS survival curve might differ
systematically from those on the early part, we focus on the latter part when generating our
projections.

Table 2 presents estimates of life expectancy conditional on a diagnosis of AIDS
in a given year. Our estimates suggest that life expectancy has increased from 2.9
years in 1984 to 16.5 years in 2000.

      These estimates differ somewhat from others in the literature. For
example, Lichtenberg estimates life expectancy of an individual diagnosed with
AIDS in 1993 (2000) to be 3.7 (26.3) years. This might, in part, be due to his
period life-table rather than cohort specific approach. In addition, he assumes a
constant hazard (mortality rate)—the calculated life expectancy is equal to the
inverse of the hazard. A comparison of our year 2000 survival curve with that of
Lichtenberg (exponential distribution with hazard =.038) demonstrates that the
two track each other fairly closely for the first 20 years. After that, however, our
survival falls off much more rapidly—for example, 30 years after diagnosis, 32%
(as opposed to 11%) are still alive in the exponential specification.22
        To further check the robustness of our results, we use a slightly different
specification to project the AIDS survival curves. Specifically, an individual
diagnosed with AIDS in 1995 who is still alive 5 years later may expect a survival
similar to individuals diagnosed with AIDS in 2000. Similarly, an individual
diagnosed with AIDS in 1984 who is alive in 1989 may expect survival similar to
an individual of the same age diagnosed in 1989. Fixing the 2000 survival curve
to the one calculated before, we can “back-calculate” survival curves for
individuals diagnosed in earlier years according to the above algorithm. The life
expectancies generated by the ‘back-calculation’ method are on average 2.2 years
longer, with the majority of the differences lying in the later years. Since the
magnitude of our results does not depend crucially on this difference, we use the
survival curves generated by the imputation method in all subsequent analysis.

Generating Survival Conditional on an Infection with HIV

We use discrete-time AIDS-free survival SHIV(d) for an HIV infected individual to
obtain the probability distribution function, fHIV(d). This distribution states the
proportion of individuals who contract AIDS exactly d years after HIV infection.
This distribution is allowed to vary by year of HIV infection to capture the
delayed progression to AIDS due to antiretroviral treatment.          Consider an
individual infected with HIV in 1979. With probability fHIV,79(1), this individual
contracts AIDS within the next year and faces the survival curve for an individual
diagnosed with AIDS in 1980. Similarly, with probability fHIV,79(2), this
individual contracts AIDS exactly two years after infection with HIV and faces


22
  To compare the reasonableness of our end-of-life assumptions, we make the following
calculation. Suppose that the life expectancy of an individual diagnosed with AIDS in 2000 is, in
fact, 26.3 years. Using CDC data on the first 5 years of survival, we can project survival past 5
years using the survival curve of a normal individual of age Y. The question we ask is—what age
Y is consistent with an overall AIDS life expectancy of 26.3 years? The answer is Y = 51 years.
Thus, conditional on being alive five years after a diagnosis of AIDS, instead of assuming the
survival of a normal 45 year-old, an AIDS patient assumes the survival of a normal 51 year-old.
This implies that for these individuals, AIDS lowers life expectancy by only 4.5 years, which
seems too low.
the survival curve for an individual diagnosed with AIDS in 1981. Using this
logic, the survival curve for an individual infected with HIV in 1979 is
               1979
             S HIV  (d ) = f HIV
                             1979
                                  (1) ⋅ S 1980
                                          AIDS ( d − 1) + f HIV (1) ⋅ S AIDS ( d − 2) +

which is a weighted average of the survival from AIDS for different years of
AIDS diagnosis. Note that the lags in the survival functions account for the fact
that the individual has lived several years before contracting AIDS. For years
after 2000, we assume that the survival curve for AIDS takes its 2000 value. We
use the above metric to generate estimates of survival conditional on an infection
with HIV for each year from 1979 to 2000. These are presented in Table 3 below.
