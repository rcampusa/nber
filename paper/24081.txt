We provide evidence that the deregulation of U.S. state banking markets leads to a significant
increase in the relative employment and capital growth of local firms with higher productivity
and that this effect is concentrated among young firms. Using financial data for a broad range of
firms, our analysis suggests that this effect is driven by a shift in the composition of local bank
credit supply towards more productive firms. We estimate that this effect translates into
economically important gains in aggregate industry productivity and that changes in the
allocation of labor play a central role in driving these gains.

A growing body of evidence suggests that improvements in financial markets can significantly

contribute to economic growth and argues that increases in aggregate productivity plays a central

role in this process. 1 Despite the importance of this idea, we still have limited direct evidence on

the specific economic mechanisms through which finance affects growth and productivity. In this

paper, we study the role of local U.S. banking markets in shifting the allocation of labor and capital

within local industries towards firms with higher productivity. Intuitively, this reallocation effect

changes the composition of the industry and plays an important role in increasing the industry’s

aggregate productivity as it allows the same aggregate resources to generate more output. 2 Banks

can potentially be important in shaping this composition effect because of their role in determining

which firms are financed. Therefore, improvements in banking markets can lead to a more positive

link between firm productivity and bank credit. We examine this idea and the importance of labor

in this process. While labor is a central factor used in production, limited attention has been paid

to the role of labor reallocation in explaining the effects of finance on aggregate productivity.

      We study the importance of bank lending to both labor and capital reallocation in the context

of major U.S. state banking deregulations, which reduced constraints on banks’ ability to expand

across geographic markets and represent historically important changes in U.S. banking markets.

An advantage of analyzing these reforms is that they capture focused changes in the degree of bank

    Previous research has emphasized the role of this within-industry composition effect as a fundamental determinant

of aggregate productivity (e.g., Olley and Pakes (1996), and Hsieh and Klenow (2009)). Differences in firm

productivity are typically the fundamental source of firm heterogeneity emphasized in empirical studies and models

of such composition effects (Bartelsman, Haltiwanger, and Scarpeta (2013)).


                                                           1
competition in a local market. Broad patterns around these reforms have indicated that the previous

reallocation effects appear to be important in driving higher economic growth during these

episodes (Jayaratne and Strahan (1996, 1998)). As banking markets become more competitive,

banks – either new or existing banks facing competition – might improve the monitoring and

screening of borrowers. For example, this can happen because of an improved selection

mechanism for surviving banks or because of stronger incentives for performance faced by a given

bank. As banks improve their screening of borrowers, they may be able to better detect higher

productivity firms. Improvements in the monitoring of firms should make it easier for borrowers

to pledge their future income. Firms with higher productivity can arguably benefit more from these

improvements because they have more income to pledge.

   However, in theory, the sign and magnitude of this effect are unclear. Increased bank entry

might simply lead to reduction in market power and interest rates, increasing the availability of

credit for all firms. Reductions in bank market power can also harm relationship formation

(Petersen and Rajan (1995)) and simply lead banks to lend less to all small business. In addition,

new (larger) banks entering a market might not have comparative advantage in small-business

lending and might be worse in monitoring and screening these firms.

   Empirically analyzing the importance of the previous reallocation effects has been difficult

because of both data and identification challenges. This analysis requires micro-level data on small

firms connecting both their real decisions and sources of external finance to their productivity and

age. We analyze small firms by using firm- and plant-level data from the U.S. Census

Bureau. Two recent studies by Kerr and Nanda (2009) and Krishnan, Nandy, and Puri (2014)

also have used this data to analyze the effects of deregulation. However, these studies do not

examine the reallocation of production from less productive to more productive firms, nor the

impact on labor
                                                 2
versus capital and lastly, do not study the bank financing patterns of these small firms. 3 We also

quantify the magnitudes of the industry productivity gains implied by our results. 4

       Our analysis is implemented with micro-level data from the U.S. Census Bureau on a broad

sample of small U.S. manufacturing firms. This data allows us to relate both firms’ real decisions

and financial policies to measures of their multi-factor productivity estimated using plant-level

data. We note that the previous reallocation effects should be mostly important for the youngest

firms. Because of the past lending relationships of older firms, new firms should be more likely to

borrow from new banks entering a market. If new banks change the composition of local credit

supply, this effect should then mostly affect the youngest firms. Differences in the screening and

monitoring of banks should also arguably matter more for young firms which have a limited track

record. 5 Additionally, these firms should depend more on external funds to finance their higher

growth.

       We start by analyzing how the relative growth of higher-productivity firms within a local

industry changes after deregulation in their state. We separately estimate this effect across firm

age groups and examine its differential importance for young existing firms. Our main results


3
    In their discussion of the mechanism through which deregulation matters, Jayaratne and Strahan (1996) explain that

“To answer this question satisfactorily, we would like data on bank borrowers such as the productivity and longevity…

especially among bank-dependent firms such as small business”.
4
    When examining implications for industry productivity, an important consideration is that firms affected by

deregulation might represent a small portion of aggregate industry output. We explicitly incorporate this issue when

quantifying the magnitudes of our results.
5
    As discussed in Section 1.2, previous evidence based on aggregate data from banks’ balance sheets shows that these

reforms were associated with a significant increase in the market share of better performing banks in deregulated

states.


                                                           3
employ a triple-difference framework, where we compare changes in the previous relative growth

across states experiencing deregulation at different periods of time, and then contrast this effect

for different age groups. We find that the deregulation is associated with an economically large

increase in the relative growth of more productive, young firms. We find that this relative growth

increase is important for both labor and capital, and that is not present for older firms. This increase

in growth takes place right after deregulation and is not matched with pre-existing growth trends.

       We then investigate the role of changes in the composition of credit supply in driving the

previous growth effect. We first directly examine the importance of such changes in the

composition of credit supply. As before, we separately examine different age groups and focus on

differential patterns for young firms. In order to analyze the role of bank credit supply, as opposed

to credit demand, we analyze how firms borrow across different sources of debt financing. Our

data allows us to distinguish between debt from commercial banks (bank debt) and debt from other

sources (non-bank debt), and deregulation only covered commercial banks. Consistent with

previous research (Petersen and Rajan (1994)), we find that young and old small firms significantly

rely on both bank and non-bank debt. We argue that changes in credit demand should affect firms’

demand for both sources of debt financing. In contrast, increases in bank credit supply should lead

to an increase in the share of total debt coming from banks for a given firm-year. We therefore

estimate our results using this share of bank debt as an outcome. 6 We find that deregulation is

associated with a significant increase in the relative bank debt share of high-productivity firms.

This effect is economically large for the young firms driving the previous growth results and is


6
    The basic idea of relying on the share of bank debt to isolate changes in bank credit supply is also used in Kashyap,

Stein, and Wilcox (1993), and Becker and Ivashina (2014).




                                                             4
limited for old firms where the growth effects are not present. Moreover, these effects are

associated with limited changes in the average bank debt share of young or old firms.

   We also examine the composition of borrowing across bank debt and non-bank debt and find

economically large increases in the relative importance of bank debt for high-productivity firms.

In contrast, these results are not associated with increases in the relative importance of non-bank

debt for these same firms. This suggests that the previous increase in the relative use of bank debt

by high-productivity firms is not explained by credit demand. Additionally, we also show that

improvements in local economic conditions that are unrelated to local banking deregulation do not

predict the previous patterns in the composition of firms’ debt financing. These financial results

provide direct evidence that our growth effects are matched with a significant shift in the

composition of bank credit supply towards more productive firms. Both of these effects are only

important among young firms and their estimated magnitudes are consistent with the view that the

shift in credit supply drives the growth effects.

   We conduct additional tests to further mitigate the possibility that deregulation might explain

the growth effects through alternative mechanisms that differentially affect the growth of young,

high-productivity firms. We note that deregulation is positively associated with local economic

growth (Jayaratne and Strahan (1996)) and examine the effect of exogenous shocks positively

affecting local economic conditions. We test if such shocks also lead to an increase in the relative

growth of high-productivity firms which is differentially important for young firms. We examine

shocks to overall state economic conditions but also consider shocks to subsets of local industries.

Specifically, we consider the potential role of local demand effects by examining shocks to other

local industries that are significant customers. Our results show that these local demand effects do




                                                    5
not explain our growth results. 7 We also analyze potential effects through local input markets and

local labor markets. Across a range of such falsification tests, we provide direct evidence that

leading alternative mechanisms cannot explain our growth results.

       As a last step in our analysis, we examine the implications of our results for aggregate industry

productivity. In order to guide this analysis, we use a simple monopolistic competition framework

which has been studied in recent research connecting resource misallocation to industry

productivity (e.g. Hsieh and Klenow (2009, 2014)). We focus on the implications of the previous

change in the composition of credit supply in such a setting. We illustrate how these implications

depend on how greater access to credit reduces firms’ cost of using capital or labor. While models

of finance and misallocation typically assume financial frictions only increase firms’ cost of using

capital, we discuss how recent empirical research on finance and labor implies that these frictions

should also increase firms’ cost of using labor. 8 These labor effects can be more important than

capital effects in increasing industry productivity because of the larger share of labor in production.



7
    Mian, Sufi, and Verner (2017) provide evidence that deregulation leads to local demand effects on employment

which are only important in non-tradable sectors (outside of manufacturing). In contrast, with such effects, our analysis

focuses on a mechanism through which deregulation can induce longer-term productivity gains.
8
    For example, recent evidence suggests that labor can increase the cost of financial distress by inducing operating

leverage due to labor-market frictions such as firing costs (Serfling (2016)) and labor protection (Simintzi, Vig, and

Volpin (2015)). Similarly, labor-market frictions and firm-specific training might make it costly for firms to fire

workers in response to financial conditions. Other research suggests that financial distress might expose workers to

significant costs and firms might need to compensate workers upfront for taking such risks, increasing firms’ cost of

using labor (Agrawal and Matsa (2013), and Graham et al. (2016)). All these ideas imply that finance affects the cost

of using labor. See Moll (2014) and the references therein for models of finance and misallocation and Section 5 for

more details on this issue.


                                                           6
Specifically, we examine if deregulation leads to a significant convergence in the marginal revenue

products of young firms with high versus low productivity. Our framework highlights how this

convergence should only be present for labor if labor misallocation effects are important. We find

that deregulation is associated with a significant convergence in the labor marginal revenue

product gap of young firms with different productivity and that this pattern is similar for capital.

   We then use our framework to quantify the magnitude of the implied gains in industry

productivity and consider the role of labor in determining them. We take into account the fact that

our results are concentrated on a subset of young firms and consider the implications of

deregulations across all states for the aggregate productivity of a given industry. We find that our

results imply gains between 1.1% and 2.1% of industry value added over a few years. This effect

is equivalent to an increase between 3.3% and 6.2% in the output of the small young firms driving

our results. We also find that labor misallocation plays a central role in determining these gains

because of the larger share of labor in production.

   Overall, our paper makes three main contributions. First, we provide direct evidence that the

deregulation of U.S. state baking markets leads to a significant reallocation of resources towards

young, more productive firms with economically important gains in aggregate industry

productivity. Second, we provide evidence that these effects are driven by a shift in the allocation

of bank credit towards high-productivity firms. This documents a specific mechanism through

which the competition of local banking markets can matter for aggregate productivity. Finally, we




                                                  7
also provide evidence that the allocation of labor, not only of capital, can play a central role in

determining the quantitative implications of finance for aggregate productivity. 9

      In addition to previous research on U.S. banking deregulation, our analysis complements

studies on the cross-country connection between financial development and the allocation of

capital across industries (Wurgler (2000)) and on changes in this allocation within U.S. industries

over time (Lee, Shin, and Stulz (2016)). It also complements studies which examine how country-

level reforms in banking or financial markets matter for the allocation of resources (Bertrand,

Schoar, and Thesmar (2006), and Larrain and Stumpner (2016)). Our study is the first to examine

how micro-level changes in the composition of bank lending affect capital and labor reallocation

and industry productivity.

I. State Banking Deregulation

A. Background and Banking Deregulation Index

      Prior to the 1970s most U.S. states had restrictions on banks’ ability to operate within and

across state borders that had remained historically stable. Given that small U.S. firms mostly relied

on geographically close banks as a source of external financing until the early 1990s (Petersen and

Rajan (2002)), these restrictions created local banking monopolies. Between the early 1970s and

early 1990s, states relaxed these restrictions in a staggered way. Following previous research on

U.S. state banking deregulation, we focus on two main types of restrictions imposed by states.

First, states imposed restrictions on intrastate branching. For example, these included restrictions


9
    Previous research has examined the impact of finance on firm and aggregate employment (Benmelech et al. (2011),

Pagano and Pica (2012), and Chodorow-Reich (2014)), but has not examined the impact of finance on aggregate

productivity through the allocation of labor.


                                                          8
on the ability of multibank holding companies to convert branches of acquired subsidiary banks

into branches of a single bank, as well as restrictions on banks’ ability to open new branches. As

in Jaraytane and Strahan (1996), we choose the date of intrastate deregulation as the date in which

a state permits branching through mergers and acquisitions.

   Second, the Douglas amendment to the Bank Holding Act of 1956 prevented a bank holding

company from acquiring banks in another state unless that state explicitly permitted such

acquisitions by statute. No state allowed such acquisitions until the late 1970s. States then entered

reciprocal regional or national arrangements which allowed their banks to be acquired by banks in

any other state in the arrangement. Except for Hawaii, all states had entered such agreements in

1993. These episodes of interstate deregulation culminated with the passage of the 1994 Riegle-

Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act, which codified these state-level changes at

the national level. Our data is available from 1977 and, motivated by the above timeline, we end

our sample in 1993. We follow Amel (1993) and Kroszner and Strahan (1999, hereafter KS) in

determining the dates of interstate and intrastate deregulation.

                                         (Insert Figure 1 here)

   We construct a state-level banking deregulation index (Dereg) by combining these two events

which affected states during a similar period of time. Dereg is the sum of Intrastate_Dereg and

Interstate_Dereg. Intrastate_Dereg and Interstate_Dereg are indicators that equal one if the state

has passed intrastate and interstate banking deregulation, respectively. We show the dates for each

of these events across individual states in Table IA.1. Figure 1 shows the average value across

states of Interstate_Dereg, Intrastate_Dereg, and Dereg during each year of our sample period.

The figure shows the significant deregulation wave that took place around the middle of the 1980s.



                                                 9
KS argue that technological changes such as the development of more sophisticated credit-scoring

models made it more difficult for local interest groups to protect local banking monopolies.

B. How Does Banking Deregulation Matter?

   Previous research has documented that state banking deregulation is associated with local

economic growth and has argued that changes in the composition of bank credit supply appears to

be the channel driving such effect (Jayaratne and Strahan (1996, hereafter JS)). JS argue that

deregulation might trigger a shift in the composition of bank lending towards higher-quality

borrowers, which then increases the share of total investment coming from firms with better

growth opportunities (composition effect). They conjecture that such changes in the allocation of

bank credit might come from improvements in the screening and monitoring of the average local

bank. Their evidence suggests that deregulation in a given state is not associated with significant

increases in the aggregate loan growth in that state. At the same time, deregulation is associated

with reductions in the aggregate importance of non-performing loans or charge-offs for banks in

deregulated states. Jayaratne and Strahan (1998) find that most of this state-level drop in loan

losses can be explained by the fact that better-performing banks increase their market share in a

state after deregulation. This evidence is consistent with the idea that deregulation improves the

composition of local bank lending by creating a stronger selection mechanism for local banks.

   However, these studies do not provide direct micro-level evidence on the importance of the

bank credit composition effect. Providing such evidence is important for at least two broad reasons.

First, banking deregulation could explain the previous broad patterns through multiple economic

channels, which could have different implications for when and how local banking competition

matters. Improvements in the efficiency of local banks could lower their costs and translate into

lower interest rates for all firms, reducing implicit barriers to entry, and facilitating the entry of

                                                 10
new nonfinancial firms displacing less efficient incumbents. 10 Second, evidence on the channel

through which deregulation matters can also help to better establish its importance. 11

       We examine how deregulation affects the relative growth of high productivity firms. Our focus

on differences in firm productivity within an industry is motivated by previous empirical and

theoretical work on industry productivity and resource misallocation. 12 Analyzing the previous

composition effect requires firm-level data linking differences in firm productivity to their real and

financial decisions. Moreover, since local banks should mostly matter for small firms, it is

important to have micro-level data covering such firms.

II. Data and Summary Statistics

       Our main data sources are the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), the Census of

Manufacturers (CM), and the Quarterly Financial Reports (QFR) from the U.S. Census Bureau.

The CM provides information on the sales and inputs used by all manufacturing firms every five

years (i.e., Census years). Our analysis tracks changes in the relative growth of more productive

firms around deregulation events and higher frequency data on small firms is useful to estimate

these effects. Note that many deregulation episodes happen between Census years and higher


10
     Consistent with this view, Jayaratne and Strahan (1998) find that deregulation is associated with a drop in average

interest rate in loans for local borrowers. The reduced demand for credit by large incumbent firms could offset some

of the increase in borrowing by new firms.
11
     Huang (2008) argues that U.S. state deregulation leads to an acceleration of local growth only in a limited number

of cases. Zarutskie (2006) provides evidence suggesting that local young firms use less bank debt after deregulation,

while the opposite takes place for older firms. Since young firms are likely to be more constrained than older firms,

this composition effect could lead deregulation to reduce aggregate productivity.
12
     For example, see Olley and Pakes (1996), Hsieh and Klenow (2009), Bartelsman, Haltiwanger, and Scarpeta

(2013)), and the references therein. See Section 5 for more details.


                                                           11
frequency data allows us to precisely analyze how a given firm changes around such events. We

address this challenge by combining the CM with the LBD. The LBD provides annual employment

information for every private establishment from 1976 onward. The underlying data are sourced

from U.S. tax records and Census Bureau surveys. We use the LBD to annually track within-

industry differences in firm employment growth and link to the CM to relate these differences to

firm productivity. We construct the main sample of data used in our growth results by matching

firms in the LBD and the last available CM.

   We focus on firms with their operations concentrated in a single state. State banking

deregulation should matter mostly for firms with a strong geographic exposure to banks in the

deregulated state. We also focus our analysis on firms that operate in a single industry. We need

to compare the overall productivity of different firms operating in a given industry and this is

challenging when firms also operate in other industries. Once we impose these two restrictions,

almost all firms in our data are single-plant firms, which is the focus of our analysis. Overall,

across all manufacturing firms in the LBD or the CM over our sample period, we find that 76%-

77% of establishments belong to single-plant firms. When we consider the total number of firms

operating in a given industry and year (i.e., firm-industry-year observations), we find that 91% of

firms are single-plant firms.

   Our analysis examines differential patterns among young firms, which are plausibly more

exposed to the effects that we want to isolate. We measure firms’ age by considering the first year

in which the firm appears with positive employment in the data. We construct age groups based

on the difference between the current year and this first year of operations. Our main age groups

are Young1 and Young2, which include firms present for the first time in the previous CM and

present for the first time in the CM before the previous one, respectively. Old includes the


                                                12
remaining firms. 13 These groups capture firms with age 1-5 and 6-10 in the previous CM,

respectively. In our analysis, we focus on composition effects among these young firms with a

single plant. While these firms represent a subset of the overall sample of firms in an industry, we

explicitly take this into account when examining the implications of our results for aggregate

industry productivity in Section V. 14

                                                   (Insert Table I here)

       Panel A of Table I shows summary statistics for this overall sample and subsamples of young

firms. As described in Section I.A, our sample covers the period between 1977 and 1993. All

variables are described in Appendix A. The average firm in our overall sample is small and has

22.3 workers and 1.4 Million in sales ($1987). In some of our additional results of the real effects

of deregulation, we restrict our analysis to Census years. This comes from the need to examine

outcomes not covered in the LBD (e.g., capital stock growth) or a focus on longer-term effects of

deregulation (e.g., analysis in Section V). In these results, we use only the CM to construct similar

samples of single-plant firms in different age groups.

       Our analysis of changes in firms’ financial policies is based on the QFR. The QFR collects

quarterly balance sheet and income statement data on large-, medium-, and small-size


13
     This basic approach to classify firms into an age group is used by Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda (2013) and the

Census Bureau (e.g., https://www.census.gov/ces/dataproducts/bds/definitions.html). We use the CM to define our

main age groups because the LBD only starts in 1976, and this limits our ability to construct different age groups at

the start of our sample period (1977 to 1993). We use the CM data from 1967 onward and this allows us to have at

most three age groups at the start of our sample (age 1-5, age 6-10, and age 11+). We also construct age groups using

the LBD as a robustness check, but have to limit the sample period of our analysis in these results.
14
     Using the CM in our sample period, we have found that 56% of firms that operate in a given industry are single-

plant firms with an age between 1 and 10 years.

manufacturing corporations. This data is available for us at the firm-level during Census years,

and we construct annual firm-level values for the variables in these years using averages for each

firm. We construct our sample for this analysis by matching the QFR (with annual values) and the

CM in Census years. As before, we only include single-plant firms. We also note that the QFR

uses a random sample of firms, different from the population of firms in the CM and LBD. We

construct sample weights based on firm size and age that replicate the importance of size and age

groups in our previous sample described in Panel A. We estimate results with these weights, which

allows us to estimate effects that are representative of the same sample considered in our analysis

of real effects. This sample includes firms in 1977, 1982, 1987, and 1992.

   Panel B of Table I describes the main variables used in this analysis. We report summary

statistics with the sample weights used in the results. We focus on variables which capture the

importance of bank debt and non-bank debt financing. Companies separately report their debt from

commercial banks (bank debt) and other sources in the QFR. We measure the importance of bank

debt using the ratio of bank debt to total debt (Bank Debt Share). We also separately measure the

ratios of bank debt and non-bank debt to total assets, which we label Bank Debt Ratio and Non-

Bank Debt Ratio, respectively. This distinction is important in our analysis because only

commercial banks are directly affected by banking deregulation. Between 40%-50% of firms’ debt

comes from non-bank sources for both young and old firms. This shows that firms significantly

rely on both bank and non-bank debt. Additionally, the combination of firms’ bank and non-bank

debt represents approximately 30% of firms’ assets, and this ratio is significantly larger for young

firms where this combination represents approximately 40% of firms’ total assets. This suggests

that the young single-plant firms in our analysis significantly rely on debt financing. These values




                                                14
do not include trade credit and are similar to the ones described in Petersen and Rajan (1994) based

on the National Survey of Small Business Finances (NSSBF) for the late 1980s. 15

       As discussed in Section I.B, an important variable in our analysis is firm total factor

productivity (TFP). We include measures of firm TFP using data from the CM. Following

previous research in finance examining productivity, we follow a simple strategy to estimate plant-

level TFP. We estimate a Cobb-Douglas production function with separate parameters for each

industry-year (3-digit SIC code). We estimate these parameters using ordinary least squares (OLS)

with year fixed effects and data from the previous five years. 16 As a robustness check, we report

our main credit composition and labor reallocation results using alternative approaches for

estimating TFP in Table IA.2 and Table IA.3, respectively. Since we focus on single-plant firms,

our measures of firm productivity are the same as plant productivity.




15
     The NSSBF provides information on the main sources of non-bank debt for small businesses, which are non-bank

financial institutions, the company owner, and the family of the owner. When compared to the NSSBF, there are

fundamental advantages of using the QFR for our purposes. The NSSBF only starts in 1987, what limits one’s ability

to analyze the effect of banking deregulation in our sample period (1977-1993). Additionally, the QFR provides a

significantly larger and more comprehensive sample of manufacturing firms which can be matched at the firm-level

to measures of productivity based on plant-level data from the CM.
16
     Annual plant-level data from the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) for a subsample of plants is used to

estimate production function parameters, which are then combined with the CM to measure plant-level TFP for all

firms in our samples in Census years. Appendix A describes this approach and robustness in greater detail. Recent

research in finance using similar measures of firm productivity include Maksimovic, Phillips, and Yang (2013),

Krishnan, Nandy and Puri (2014), and Giroud and Mueller (2015).

III. Banking Deregulation and Labor and Capital Reallocation

    We start our analysis by examining how the relative growth of high-productivity firms changes

after deregulation. We separately analyze this effect within different age groups and focus on the

differential effect for young firms. By examining immediate changes to young firms around

deregulation and comparing them to other young firms in states that did not deregulate in that year,

we can better isolate the effect of these events from other changes affecting industries in a given

state. This higher-frequency analysis is important for comparing a firm before and after

deregulation.

    We analyze these growth effects by estimating the equation:

                  𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑠𝑠 × 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 × 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖         (1)

                                               +𝛽𝛽 × 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 × 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿′𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

where 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the employment growth of firm i in industry j, state s and year t, 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is a

state-industry-year fixed effect, 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 denotes firm fixed effects, TFP is the firm’s total factor

productivity (in logs), 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 denotes year fixed effects, 𝛾𝛾𝑠𝑠 denotes state fixed effects, 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 is the

banking deregulation index, and X denotes controls. TFP is measured in the previous CM. Control

variables include Large, Age1, Age2, and the interactions of each of these variables with the

previous two deregulation indicators.

    We separately estimate Equation (1) for different age groups (Young1, Young2, and Old) and

examine the differential value of 𝛽𝛽 for young firms. In each age group, the estimation of

𝛽𝛽examines how the sensitivity of firms’ growth to their productivity (TFP) in a local industry

relates to state banking deregulation. The increase in firm growth predicted by TFP captures the




                                                                    16
sensitivity of this growth to a given gap in firm productivity, which is measured within an industry-

state-year because of the fixed effects.

       Intuitively, one can think about this estimation as involving two steps. First, we estimate the

previous sensitivity within each industry-state-year. We then estimate how deregulation affects

this relationship using a difference-indifferences specification. We are implementing these two

steps together in a single regression. 17 Finally, when we contrast this estimated effect for different

age groups, we are analyzing a triple difference, which tells us the differential change in the

previous sensitivity for young firms. This last interaction allows us to contrast the effect of

deregulation on different groups of firms in the affected states and control for broad changes

around deregulation in the previous sensitivity of industries in affected states.

       We initially focus on employment growth because this is an important outcome that can be

measured at an annual frequency for a broad range of firms. Previous research has provided direct

evidence that bank credit availability affects the employment of small and medium firms (e.g.,

Chodorow-Reich (2014)), so changes in the composition of credit should translate into shifts in

relative employment growth. 18 Table II reports these employment growth results. All reported

coefficients are scaled to capture changes in the relative growth of firms in the top versus bottom



17
     Recall that TFP is measured in the previous CM. In our main age group of interest (Young1), this variable measures

the first value of TFP in the data for the firm. This within-industry-state-age sensitivity is analogous to the within-

country sensitivities of industry investment to industry fundamentals such as Q or value-added growth in Wurgler

(2000) and Lee, Shin, and Stulz (2016). As discussed in Section 1.2, we focus on these differences in firm productivity

because they have been emphasized as a fundamental determinant of aggregate industry productivity.
18
     As we discuss in greater detail in Section 5, this labor effect can be an indirect effect from a lower cost of using

capital or a direct effect from greater credit availability on firms’ cost of using labor.


                                                              17
quartiles of an industry-state. More precisely, we multiply the estimated coefficients by the average

TFP gap between these two groups. We start by analyzing the average effect of deregulation across

different age groups.

                                           (Insert Table II here)

   Column (1) of Panel A reports this result, which is based on the estimation of Equation (1)

with additional controls: Young1, Young2, and their interactions with the two deregulation

variables. This result shows that deregulation is associated with a significant average increase in

the relative growth of high-productivity firms. This result implies that deregulation (i.e., change in

Dereg between zero and two) is associated with an increase of 1.8% in the relative employment

growth of firms in the top TFP quartile.

   Column (2) of Panel A examines the differential effect for Young1. In this specification, all

independent variables (including controls) and fixed effects in Equation (1) are included with and

without their interaction with Young1. The only variables not interacted with Young1 are Age1 and

Age2. Column (3) separately examines these differential effects for Young1 and Young2. This last

result is based on an analogous specification where the independent variables and fixed effects are

now separately interacted with Young1 and Young2. These results show that the previous effects

are differentially stronger for the youngest firms and driven by these firms. There is an

economically and statistically significant increase in the relative growth of more productive firms

only among the youngest firms. The effect for older firms is economically small and statistically

not significant in Column (1). This effect is negative in Column (2). The results imply that, in the

subsample of young firms (Young1), deregulation is associated with a differential increase between

3.0% and 4.2% in the relative employment growth of the top TFP quartile. Recall from Table I

that the average employment growth of these same young firms in the sample is 5.7%.


                                                  18
       We next consider the possible role of firm age and size in explaining these results. One

possibility is that differences in firm TFP are capturing these characteristics and the previous

results reflect changes in the link between firm growth and age or size. In the context of age, we

note that we are comparing only firms within a same age group and year. In our main group of

interest (Young1), within-group-year differences in age are limited to five years. We also include

continuous measures of firm age based on the LBD (Age1 and Age2) as controls. 19 As an additional

robustness check on the role of age differences, we estimate our previous results without these last

controls. Columns (1) and (2) of Panel B of Table II report the estimated effects. The effects for

the interaction with Young1 remain similar in the results with and without these controls. We also

consider an alternative definition of Young1 using the LBD. Young1 is now an indicator that equals

one if the firm has age between one and five years using the LBD, and can only be defined from

1982 on (see Section II). Column (3) of Panel B reports the results with this variable, which capture

younger firms than Young1 in the previous specifications. The results become economically

stronger with this alternative specification.

       We next consider the role of size. We note that, in contrast with age, firms’ size should be

endogenously affected by their productivity as more productive firms should find it more attractive

to expand their business. Indeed, previous models and evidence on resource allocation within

industries have emphasized this idea and the existence of a strong positive link between size and

productivity within an industry. In these frameworks, productivity is the exogenously given firm



19
     As discussed in Section 2, our main age groups are based on the CM. The LBD provides a more continuous measure

of age, but the data starts in 1976, what limits our ability to construct broad groups of age with this data. We therefore

construct these additional continuous controls. Also notice that, as previously discussed, all controls are interacted

with the deregulation indicators.


                                                           19
characteristic and conditioning on firms’ choice of size while examining a link with productivity

can bias our estimates. For this reason, in our main results we only use broad controls for firms’

size group (Large). Large is an indicator that equals one if the firm is above the median size

(employment) within the industry-age group-year. We examine how the results change as we

exclude or add size controls. Columns (1) and (2) of Panel C (Table II) show the results without

the previous size control. We then estimate the effects with narrower group sizes as controls. We

include indicators for all size quintiles within an industry-age group-year, constructed in an

analogous way to Large. Columns (3) and (4) of Panel C report these results. Across these sets of

results, the effects remain similar and become economically stronger as we add more size controls.

Together with the previous age analysis, these results show that the results in Table II are not

capturing a change in the link between employment growth and size or age within local industries.

   We check if our previous employment growth effects are matched with changes in the relative

growth of firms’ capital stock. If the previous results are driven by changes in the composition of

bank credit, it is natural to expect them to be associated with capital effects. One challenge in

implementing this analysis is that it is only in Census years that we can observe firms’ capital stock

growth for a broad range of small firms. This is especially relevant because we focus on young

firms. In a sample only with Census years, firms in Young1 are present in the data for the first time

and one cannot contrast their growth after deregulation with a previous growth outcome prior to

this event. In Table III, we therefore estimate the same specification used in Table II (Columns (2)

and (3) of Panel A) but exclude firm fixed effects.

                                         (Insert Table III here)




                                                 20
   Table III shows that our previous effects are matched with an important increase in the relative

capital growth of high-productivity firms in the sample of young firms. Deregulation is associated

with an increase of 0.8% in the relative capital growth of the top TFP quartile for young firms.

   Lastly, we examine the dynamics of the previous growth effects. We focus on employment

growth because we can measure this outcome each year. We first consider if the previous changes

in relative growth after deregulation are associated with pre-existing trends. These results are based

on specifications that add more variables to the ones in Table II (Column (3) of Panel A). More

specifically, we add Dereg(-1 to -3) or Dereg(-1 to -6) in an analogous way to Dereg and include

the same set of interactions used for Dereg. These variables are constructed in the same way as

Dereg using a sum of two indicators (for intrastate and interstate deregulation) that now equal one

in the three or six years prior to deregulation events. Table IV reports these results.

                                         (Insert Table IV here)

   The results show that our previous effects are not associated with pre-existing positive trends

in the relative growth of young firms with high productivity. This growth only changes after

deregulation. We also analyze these changes in growth using narrower windows of time. We

implement this by splitting our sample in three periods of time (1977 to 1982, 1983 to 1988, and

1989 to 1992) and separately estimating our previous effects in each of them. We then estimate an

average effect across these periods. Notice that this effect can only be estimated by contrasting the

period right after deregulation with the period right before this event. In addition, Table IA.4

provides evidence that our previous findings are robust to narrowing the window of time and

focusing on immediate growth after the deregulation events.

IV. How Does Banking Deregulation Affect the Bank Credit Supply?



                                                 21
       We now examine the role of changes in the composition of bank lending in driving our

differential growth effects for young, productive firms. In particular, we study whether there is a

shift in the composition of bank credit supply towards more productive firms. We also analyze if

the magnitude of these financial results is consistent with the view that they drive the previous real

effects. We then conduct a series of robustness tests that consider the potential role of alternative

mechanisms in driving the previous relative growth effects.

A. Banking Deregulation and the Composition of Bank Lending

       We examine if the previous results showing differential higher growth for young, productive

firms are associated with changes in the composition of bank credit supply. We separately examine

different age groups to test if changes in the composition of bank credit are mostly important for

young firms. We link firms’ bank debt to their productivity for a broad range of firms, and weight

these firms using sample weights to match our previous sample of single-plant firms.

       A challenge for isolating credit supply effects is the fact that deregulation might also affect

firms’ demand for bank debt. We address this issue by examining how firms borrow across

different sources of debt financing. Our data allows us to measure both bank debt (from

commercial banks) and non-bank debt (from other sources). Only commercial banks are directly

affected by state banking deregulation. 20 We argue that changes in credit demand should affect

firms’ demand for both bank and non-bank debt. In contrast, increases in bank credit supply should

lead to an increase in the share of total debt coming from banks (bank debt share) for a given firm-

year. As a first approach to isolate bank credit supply effects, we thus examine if deregulation is



20
     We show in Section 2 that bank debt represents between 50%-60% of firms’ total debt for both young and old firms

in our sample. Therefore, both sources of debt financing are important. As discussed in Section 2, these numbers are

similar to the ones found in previous research using small business surveys (Petersen and Rajan (1994))).


                                                          22
associated with a more positive link between firms’ productivity and their bank debt share. This

basic approach to isolate shifts in bank credit supply using the share of bank debt is also used in

Kashyap, Stein, and Wilcox (1993) and Becker and Ivashina (2014).

    The financial data we use is only available in Census years (CM conducted every five years).

We therefore focus on longer-term effects of deregulation and explore the fact that there is a big

national-level deregulation wave between the middle and end of the 1980s (see Figure 1 and

Section I.B for a discussion). At the start of our sample (1977), approximately one third of states

had (partially) deregulated their local banking markets and this initially determined set of states

(initially deregulated) should be less affected by the subsequent deregulation wave. The wave

should lead to a convergence of the deregulation status of initially different states. We compare

the link between firms’ bank debt share and their productivity across initially deregulated states

and other states in a same year. We examine if this difference across states is more positive prior

to the wave. We implement this idea by estimating the following specification:

        𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛾𝛾0 × 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑠𝑠 × 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾1 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 × 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   (2)

                                     + 𝛽𝛽 × 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑠𝑠 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 × 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿′𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

where 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 is the ratio of firms’ bank debt to total debt (bank and non-bank debt),

𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 is the value of 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 in a state at the start of the sample period (1977), 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 is an indicator

that equals one in the years prior to the deregulation wave (1977 and 1982), 𝑋𝑋 denotes controls,

and all other variables are defined in the same way as in Equation (1). Control variables include

Large, indicators for age groups, and the interactions of each of these variables with Pre, IDereg,

and Pre× IDereg. Age groups are constructed based on the number of years since the firm first

appeared in the CM (Age 1-5, Age 6-10, and Age 11+). We separately estimate this specification

for different age groups and, in each age group, focus on the estimation of 𝛽𝛽.

                                                                     23
    In an analogous way to our previous analysis, the estimation of 𝛽𝛽 within each age group can

be interpreted as difference-in-differences approach where the outcome variable is the link

between firms’ bank debt share and their productivity. We analyze if the difference in this link

between initially deregulated states and other states is more positive prior to the deregulation wave.

Our data covers years 1977, 1982, 1987, and 1992, and that this wave takes place in the middle of

this period (see Figure 1). Also notice that, when compared to our previous results, this estimation

includes one additional level of contrast (bank debt versus non-bank debt).

                                           (Insert Table V here)

    Panel A of Table V reports the results for different age groups. To make the results comparable

to previous tables, we multiply the estimated effects by the gap in TFP between the top and bottom

quartiles of an industry-state. The results show that deregulation is associated with an

economically and statistically more positive link between firms’ bank debt share and their

productivity for young firms. This effect is also positive for old firms (age 11+) but only

statistically significant for young firms. The economic magnitude of this effect for old firms is

approximately eight times smaller than the one for the youngest firms (age 1-5). Moreover, this

magnitude for young firms is important in absolute terms. The interaction 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑠𝑠 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡

captures a gap in 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 of approximately 1.0.

    The effect for young firms (age 1 -10) implies that deregulation (i.e., a change in 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 from

zero to two) leads to an increase of 0.41 in the relative bank debt share of top TFP firms. Note that

this is a relative effect. In the absence of significant changes in the average value of firms’ bank

debt share (see below), this estimate implies effects with the opposite sign and half of this

magnitude for top and bottom TFP firms. Note that the mean value of this bank debt share is around

0.55 for these same young firms (Table I).


                                                     24
       We further analyze these differences across age groups by estimating the differential value of

the previous effects for young firms. Panel B of Table V reports these differential values, which

are statistically significant and economically similar to the previous estimates for young firms.

This similarity is expected given the small (relative) magnitude of the effect for the old group.

                                                             (Insert Figure 2 here)

       Figure 2 examines the dynamics of these effects. We report results analogous to the previous

ones (Panels A and B of Table V) with effects that are separately estimated across different years

(1977, 1982, and 1987). Figure 1 suggests that the deregulation wave becomes strong between

1982 and 1987. Figure 2 shows that the previous convergence effects mostly take during this same

period and among young firms. This provides additional evidence that the previous financial

patterns capture banking deregulation.

       As an alternative approach, we also estimate these effects with following specification:

                        𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 × 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                                          (3)

                                                      + 𝛽𝛽 × 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 × 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿′𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

where all variables are defined in the same way as in Equations (1) and (2). The control variables

(X) include Large, indicators for age groups, and the interactions of each of these variables with

Dereg. This specification compares the link between firms’ bank debt share and productivity

across states with different deregulation status at a same point in time. We also separately estimate

this specification for different age groups. 21 The main advantage of including this alternative


21
     Notice that the addition of 𝛾𝛾𝑠𝑠 × 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 as a control would lead 𝛽𝛽 to be estimated for each age group with difference-

in-differences approach analogous to the one in Equation (2). However, our sample size for young firms in these

financial results is more limited and the inclusion of all these fixed effects is demanding. When we included all these

fixed effects, we have found similar point estimates but large standard errors that do not allow us to statistically detect


                                                                         25
specification is that it uses broader variation on deregulation to estimate the previous effects. The

main disadvantage is that it relies only on cross-sectional differences in deregulation.

    Panel C of Table V reports the results with this alternative specification. Since the previous

interaction 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑠𝑠 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 captures a gap in 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 of approximately 1.0, the magnitude of these

results is directly comparable to the ones in Panel A. The effects remain qualitatively and

quantitatively similar to those previously estimated. Panel D of Table V then considers if these

relative changes in the importance of bank debt for more productive firms are associated with

significant changes in the average importance of bank debt. We rely on the same interaction

𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑠𝑠 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 used in Panel A but now analyze average changes on 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑒𝑒, as opposed

to the relative effects for high-productivity firms. The results show that these average changes in

the share of bank debt are economically limited and statistically insignificant. These results suggest

that deregulation mostly affects the composition of credit in each of these age groups, consistent

with the previous evidence on banking deregulation discussed in Section I.B.

    One concern with these results is that deregulation could potentially affect the relative demand

by firms for bank debt versus non-bank debt. We examine this possibility by separately analyzing

changes in these two sources of debt financing. We argue that it is challenging to imagine that

high-productivity firms would only increase their demand for bank debt in response to

deregulation. Therefore, if the results are driven by increases in the credit demand, rather than

credit supply, for these firms, they should plausibly be associated with increases in both bank and

non-bank debt. Table VI reports results with the same specifications used in Table V with both




effects with the magnitudes here considered. In Section 5, we analyze this same specification with a broader sample

(different outcome) and show that the inclusion of this additional control does not significantly affect the results.


                                                           26
Bank Debt Ratio and Non-Bank Debt Ratio as the outcome variables. These results show that the

previous effects among young firms are matched with an economically and statistically significant

increase in the relative importance of bank debt (level) for high-productivity firms but a

statistically insignificant and economically much smaller drop in the importance of non-bank debt

– consistent with credit supply changes and not credit demand driving the results. These patterns

are once again robust across specifications and are not present for old firms. 22

                                                   (Insert Table VI here)

       We also address the concern that it might be credit demand rather than credit supply that is

responsible for the results with an additional falsification test. We consider if economic shocks

affecting a state also lead to the previous patterns on the link between firms’ bank debt share and

their productivity. More specifically, we estimate specifications analogous to the ones in Table V

which replace IDereg with Shock, which capture state-level economic shocks during our sample,

and replace Pre with Post = 1-Pre. Table VII reports the results. We first define Shock as a

predicted shock to state economic conditions between 1977 and 1993, constructed by combining

the initial (employment) composition of industries in each state with the realized national-level

(employment) growth of different industries over the same period. 23 This captures exogenous


22
     If deregulation changes local economic conditions in such a way that it strongly increases firms’ preference for bank

debt over non-bank debt, in principle, a strong substitution away from non-bank debt could lead to such patterns. We

further address this possibility below and also notice that typical models of financial intermediation predict that

improvements in economic conditions are associated with a reduced preference for bank loans relative to other sources

of debt (e.g., Holmstrom and Tirole (1997)).
23
     The predicted shock is the weighted average of national-level shocks to industries based on initial weights (see

Appendix A for more details). Intuitively, states are differentially affected because they rely on industries experiencing

heterogeneous national-level shocks. This approach to predict local economic shocks was proposed by Bartik (1991)


                                                            27
shocks to state-level conditions. We also define Shock as the state's employment growth between

1977 and 1992, and control for the effect of deregulation in this analysis. This captures broad

changes in state economic conditions not associated with banking deregulation. In both cases we

find evidence that improvements in state economic conditions are not associated with the previous

patterns on firms’ bank debt share.

                                             (Insert Table VII here)

    Finally, we consider whether the magnitude of these financial results for young firms is

consistent with the view that they drive the previous growth effects. The result for young firms in

Panel A of Table VI implies an increase of 14% in the relative bank debt ratio of the top TFP

quartile. This relative bank debt increase is equivalent to 14% of firms’ total assets after a change

of 1.0 in Dereg and over a period of approximately five years. The previous employment growth

effects for young firms (Table II) imply increases in relative employment between 7.0% and 10.0%

over five years. These magnitudes suggest that the financial results can plausibly explain our

previous growth results.

B. Alternative Mechanisms

Our previous analysis provides direct evidence that the reallocation results are matched with a

significant shift in the composition of bank credit supply towards young, more productive firms.

We now analyze in greater detail whether other economic mechanisms could also explain our

previous reallocation results. At a broad level, firms could be indirectly affected by deregulation

through changes in local economic conditions, in addition to being directly affected by the




and Blanchard and Katz (1992) and is commonly used in economics (e.g., Autor and Duggan (2003)), as well as has

been recently used in finance (Adelino, Ma, and Robinson (2016)).


                                                       28
previously documented changes in bank lending. Deregulation might affect the entry of new local

firms, as well as the decisions of local consumers or other local firms. This can then change the

economic conditions faced by a given existing firm after deregulation.

   For example, one possibility is that deregulation might increase the contestability of local

product markets for nonfinancial firms. This could increase the incentives for incumbents to

maximize their value, increasing the alignment of firms’ decisions with their productivity.

Alternatively, new firm entry or the expansion by other existing firms could drive up prices for

local inputs or labor. Less productive firms might be more exposed to such local price increases,

which could trigger a reallocation of resources towards more productive firms.

   We note that, in order to explain our reallocation results, these alternative mechanisms need to

generate an increase in the relative growth of more productive firms which is only present among

young firms. Some of these effects, such as increases in product market contestability, should

naturally affect older incumbent firms. Moreover, in some examples such as local demand effects,

it is also unclear if changes in these conditions would differentially affect more productive firms.

However, one might be concerned that older firms are larger and have a limited sensitivity to local

economic conditions. If some changes in local economic conditions increase the relative growth

of high-productivity firms, the limited sensitivity of older firms could lead these effects to be only

relevant for young firms. In contrast to this view, previous research in our setting has provided

direct evidence that the growth of both existing young and old firms are significantly responsive

to local economic conditions (Adelino, Ma, and Robinson (2016)). This research has found

comparable sensitivities to local economic conditions across these two groups. We also note that




                                                 29
our analysis focuses on single-plant firms and that the older firms in our analysis are mostly small

firms, with an average employment equal to 29 workers (see Table I). 24

       We further address this concern in two main ways. First, we build on our previous financial

policy results. These alternative channels predict that the increase in the relative growth of high-

productivity firms should be associated with a relative increase in the credit demand of these same

firms. In these alternative mechanisms, the increase in the relative growth of high-productivity

firms is not driven by the direct effect of greater access to bank credit at the firm level. In contrast

with the view that these channels drive our results, our analysis in Section IV.A suggests that

deregulation is not associated with an increase in the relative credit demand of firms with high

productivity among young firms.

       We then also address this concern with a new intuitive falsification test. This analysis directly

checks if leading alternative mechanisms can generate the patterns in our previous growth results.

More specifically, we examine if positive shocks to local economic conditions generate an increase

in the relative growth of high-productivity firms that is differentially more important for young

firms. Recall that deregulation is positively associated with local economic growth (Jayaratne and

Strahan (1996)). We consider both broad shocks to state economic conditions as well narrower

shocks that focus on specific alternative mechanisms such as increases in the local demand for an

industry’s products.

                                                 (Insert Table VIII here)

       Table VIII reports these results. These results are based on the estimation of a specification

analogous to the one analyzed in Table II (Columns (2) and (3) of Panel A), which replaces Dereg


24
     In non-reported results, we have also found that this contrast between the effects for young and old firms remains

similar if we only contrast firms within a same size group.


                                                            30
with Shock. The results include the same set of controls as in Table II, which are now defined in

analogous ways using Shock. The different panels are based on different definitions for Shock. We

here describe the basic idea for these definitions and provide more details in Appendix A. We first

define Shock with the two basic approaches used in Table VII to capture shifts in state-wide

economic conditions. In Panel A, Shock is a predicted shock to state economic growth between

1977 and the current year. This shock is constructed by combining the initial (employment)

composition of industries in each state with the realized national-level (employment) growth of

different industries over the period (1977-current year). The predicted shock is the weighted

average of national-level shocks to industries based on initial weights. This captures exogenous

shifts to state economic conditions triggered by national-level changes to its industries.

      In Panel B, Shock is the state's employment growth between 1977 and the current year. These

results include Dereg and all its interactions used in Table II as additional control variables, and

capture shifts in state economic conditions that are not associated with state banking deregulation.

As in our previous results, we scale the estimated effects by multiplying them by the TFP gap

between the top and bottom quartiles of an industry-state. In order to better capture the magnitude

of effects, we also multiply these estimates by the standard deviation of Shock in the sample being

analyzed. 25 The results presented in Table VIII show that positive changes to state-wide economic

conditions do not lead to our previously shown growth results. The magnitude of the estimated

effects across all specifications is limited when compared to the ones in Table II. Moreover, in the




25
     Notice from Table 1 that multiplying the effects in Table II by the standard deviation of Dereg would not

significantly affect our reported estimates.


                                                       31
cases where the effects are economically stronger or statistically significant, they all have the

opposite sign of our growth results.

       After considering the role of broad changes to state economic conditions, we focus on specific

alternative channels. In these results, Shock is a predicted shock to the growth of a subset of other

connected industries in the same state between 1977 and the current year. The shock to this subset

of connected industries is predicted in an analogous way to the approach used in Panel A (using

national-level shocks). Intuitively, positive shocks to local connected industries take place when

these same industries are growing faster at the national level. We follow Ellison, Glaeser, and Kerr

(2010) in the definition of connections, which are all defined at the national level and described in

greater detail in Appendix A. 26

       Panel C considers if positive shocks to local demand conditions predict the patterns in our

growth results. This analysis is motivated by the possibility that deregulation leads to increases in

the local demand faced by industries, which then generate the previous growth patterns. For each

industry i, we use input-output tables to classify industry j as a buyer if it purchases a sufficiently

large share of the sales from industry i. This share is calculated using all customers, including final

customers. We then capture demand shocks to an industry-state by predicting shocks to its local

buyers (in the same state). The results in Panel C show that these positive shocks to local demand

are statistically insignificant and do not explain our results.




26
     The evidence in Ellison, Glaeser, and Kerr (2010) suggests that these measures of connections across industries

empirically capture interactions in product, input, and labor markets. In non-reported results, we have found similar

results when we followed the approach in Panel B and used measures of realized growth for connected industries that

are not associated with deregulation.


                                                          32
   Panels D and E consider changes in local input markets and labor markets, respectively. These

analyses address the previously discussed possibilities that positive shocks to the local demand for

industries’ inputs or labor could lead to the patterns in the growth results. In Panel D, we use input-

output tables to classify industry j as a supplier for industry i if an important share of the inputs

used by industry i comes from industry j. This share is calculated using all suppliers. Positive

shocks to the local input markets of an industry-state are then defined as shocks to its suppliers in

the same state. In Panel E, for each industry i, we classify industry j as a common labor industry

if both industry i and j use workers in similar types of occupation. In an analogous way to the

previous approaches, positive shocks to the local labor markets of an industry-state are predicted

shocks to common labor industries in the same state.

   The results in Panels D and E show that positive shocks to input and labor markets are also

insignificant and do not generate the patterns in the previous growth results. The economic

magnitude of all these effects is limited when compared to the ones reported in Table II. While it

is challenging to completely rule out the role of alternative mechanisms in driving our results, our

evidence is mostly consistent with the view that our growth effects are explained by the effect of

deregulation on the composition of credit supply among young firms.

V. Implications for Industry Productivity

   We now examine the implications of the previous reallocation effects for industry productivity.

In order to guide our analysis, we use a simple model of monopolistic competition with

heterogeneous firms, which has been studied in recent research connecting resource misallocation

to industry productivity (Hsieh and Klenow (2009, 2014)). We consider the role of the composition

of bank credit supply into this model.



                                                  33
    We first use this framework to motivate simple tests for the hypothesis that our previous results

lead to industry productivity gains. We solve for an expression that captures local misallocation

losses by different groups of firms by industry and state, following our empirical analysis. We then

use it to quantify the implied magnitude of these gains from changes to bank credit supply through

bank deregulation.

A. Theoretical Framework

    We present the model’s set up and discuss the intuition for its main results. Appendix B shows

the formal steps for these results. The model considers an industry j where 𝑁𝑁𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 firms produce

differentiated products at time 𝑡𝑡 and are monopolistic competitors with Cobb-Douglas production

functions. More specifically, the (real) output for firm i is given by:

                                                 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗        𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗          𝛾𝛾𝑗𝑗
                      𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 � �𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 � �𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 � ,                (4)

where 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a firm-specific productivity component, 𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the firm’s capital stock, 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 denotes

the labor used by the firm, and 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the firm’s choice of materials. Firms face constant returns

to scale on their technology (𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 + 𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗 + 𝛾𝛾𝑗𝑗 = 1) but their revenue function has decreasing returns

to scale because of the downward-slopping demand for their products. We assign each firm 𝑖𝑖 to a

primary state 𝑠𝑠 and to a unique group 𝑔𝑔 by industry-state. We interpret these groups as capturing

the samples of local young and old single-plant firms, as well as remaining firms, in an industry-

state from our empirical analysis. We assume that firms in the industry face exogenously given

factor prices that might depend on their state.

    Firms in the industry supply their output to a representative firm producing industry output:
                                                                    𝜎𝜎
                                            𝑁𝑁𝑗𝑗         𝜎𝜎−1 𝜎𝜎−1
                               𝑄𝑄𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 =   �∑𝑖𝑖=1 𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜎𝜎 � .                                            (5)




                                                                    34
This representative firm sells its output (industry output) in a perfectly competitive market at a

price 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 . These assumptions allow us to determine the demand for the differentiated products in

the industry and lead to a constant elasticity of demand for these products.

                                                                                                                              𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗             𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗              𝛾𝛾𝑗𝑗
          This setting allows us to express industry output as 𝑄𝑄𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 �𝐾𝐾𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 � �𝐿𝐿𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 � �𝑀𝑀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 � , where

                                                  𝑗𝑗                             𝑁𝑁
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is industry productivity, 𝐾𝐾𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ≡ ∑𝑖𝑖=1  𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the industry’s capital, and 𝐿𝐿𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 and 𝑀𝑀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 are the

industry’s labor and materials, respectively. Industry productivity changes when the industry

produces more output with the same aggregate inputs. This will happen if individual firms become

more productive or if the same aggregate industry inputs are used by more efficient firms. The

allocation of resources is defined in broad terms and captures the distribution of factor shares

across firms. 27 Conditional on a set of firms and their productivity distribution, industry

productivity will be maximized when resources are reallocated across firms to equalize marginal

revenue products. 28

          We allow for firms to be potentially exposed to firm-specific frictions affecting their cost of

using capital and labor, which can lead to gaps in their marginal revenue products of firms and

induce losses in industry productivity. Firms choose their inputs to maximize current profits,

subject to these distortions. These profits are given by:



27
     This broad definition of resource allocation is commonly used in studies of industry productivity (e.g., Olley and

Pakes (1996)).

     The prices of differentiated products can be used to evaluate their marginal contributions to industry output. Industry

where 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 are the marginal revenue products of capital and labor, respectively.

Some of these distortions, 𝜏𝜏, are nonfinancial and capture frictions such as firing costs and

discounts in the sale of capital. We assume that financial frictions also potentially affect these

distortions and model increases in the credit supply faced by a firm as a reduction in these

distortions. 29 The idea that greater availability of bank credit translates into reduced financial

distortions is likely to be true for young firms.

       We simplify our analysis by assuming that (𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 , 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 ) are jointly log-normally

distributed in an industry-year. Our analysis focuses on the intensive-margin allocation of

resources and examines how changes in the composition of bank credit shape industry productivity

conditional on a distribution of existing firms. Given this intensive-margin focus, the number of

firms 𝑁𝑁𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 and the joint distribution of their characteristics (𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 1 + 𝜏𝜏𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 , 1 + 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 , 𝑠𝑠(𝑖𝑖, 𝑡𝑡), 𝑔𝑔(𝑖𝑖, 𝑡𝑡))

in the industry are exogenous to the firms.




29
     In principle, the availability of credit at the firm level could also affect the nonfinancial distortions faced by firms.

This drop in overall distortions will capture the net effect of reduced financial distortions on capital overall distortions.


                                                                               36
      In this setting, the contribution of the allocation of resources to industry productivity can be

summarized by measures of the dispersion of 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) and 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) within the

industry. Motivated by our empirical analysis, we examine the implications of the potential

misallocation of resources across firms with different productivity within the previous groups.

Intuitively, the drop in aggregate industry productivity induced by this within-group misallocation

will be captured by the dispersion of 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) and 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) within a group. Gaps in

marginal revenue products within a group capture differences in distortions since all firms in a

group face the same factor prices. Using a simple linear projection, we decompose firms’
                                                                               𝑔𝑔      𝑔𝑔                     𝑔𝑔

      In the absence of this link between distortions and firm productivity, there are no (industry

productivity) gains from reallocating resources across firms of different productivity within a

group. The existence of this link is important in misallocation models and consistent with previous
                                                                                                                         𝑔𝑔

      We define local misallocation losses (𝐿𝐿𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 ) as the increase in industry productivity that

would take place if distortions 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(1 + 𝜏𝜏𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 ) and 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(1 + 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 ) became uncorrelated with firm

changes in the misallocation of resources across groups and hold the mean value of these

distortions in each group constant in this exercise. Appendix B shows that we can write these local

misallocation losses (𝐿𝐿𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ) as:

       We examine how a more positive link between credit supply and firm productivity (credit

composition effect) affects the previous misallocation losses. We hold the distribution of firm

productivity constant in this exercise. As in models of finance and misallocation, we assume that

financial frictions affect the cost using capital, which needs to be financed upfront. This effect of
                                                                                                 𝑔𝑔
the composition of credit on capital is captured by a drop in 𝑎𝑎𝐾𝐾 .

       In contrast with previous models of finance and misallocation, but consistent with recent

empirical research on finance and labor, we argue that financing frictions can also affect firms’

marginal cost of using labor. This labor financing effect could be significant for multiple reasons.

One reason is that financial distress might affect the cost of using labor. As firms have greater

access to credit, these financial distress costs associated with labor can be reduced. For example,

the existence of firing and training costs might limit firms’ ability to adjust their labor downwards

after a negative shock, and labor can create operating leverage (wages are rigid). As firms expand

their labor, operating leverage becomes more significant and the costs of financial distress


30
     Note that the 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 measure used in the previous empirical analysis captures revenue productivity and is different

from firm real productivity (𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ). In order to relate to the empirical analysis, we can also define firm productivity here

as the equivalent of 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 in the context of the model. In our framework, these two measures are related within a group.

All results and conclusions here discussed remain unchanged if we use 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 as our measure of productivity.


                                                                           38
increase. 31 Alternatively, financial distress might expose workers to significant costs and firms

might need to compensate workers upfront for taking such risks, increasing firms’ cost of using

labor (Titman (1984), Berk, Stanton, and Zechner (2010)). 32

       Similarly, if firing or losing workers during financial distress is costly for firms, the risk of

such distress can increase firms’ upfront cost of using labor. Another reason for a labor financing

effect is the potential need to finance labor expansions. Firms will need financing to employ more

labor if there is a timing delay between payments to workers and the cash flows generated by the

use of labor – a net working capital channel that has been recently emphasized theoretically by

Jermann and Quadrini (2012) and empirically by Paravisini et al. (2014). Firms also often face

training and hiring costs, and firm-specific investments by workers can be important, so expanding

labor often requires upfront costs that need to be financed. These different economic mechanisms

share a common prediction that financial distortions can affect firms’ marginal cost of using labor.

We model labor distortions in an analogous way to capital distortions and allow the composition
                                 𝑔𝑔
of credit to also reduce 𝑎𝑎𝐿𝐿 .




31
     Consistent with this idea, Serfling (2016) provides evidence suggesting that firing costs in the U.S. can significantly

increase the costs of financial distress through increases in operating leverage. Using cross-country data, Simintzi,

Vig, and Volpin (2015) provide evidence supporting the view that employment protection legislations lead to an

increase in the cost of financial distress through this same operating leverage channel.
32
     Graham et al. (2016) directly estimate that the labor-market cost of bankruptcy for employees is important and

provide evidence that these costs significantly increase the upfront wages paid by firms. Agrawal and Matsa (2013)

provide evidence also consistent with the idea that the ex-post costs of financial distress for employees increase the

upfront costs for firms of using labor.


                                                             39
   We assume that this credit composition effect happens simultaneously for all groups (young

and old) in a region with potentially different magnitudes across the groups. We allow the price of

industry output and factor prices to change together with these credit effects. This incorporates

potential shifts in demand and input markets faced by firms after the credit effects. In this

framework, the previous shift in the allocation of credit always reduces local misallocation losses.

This shift leads firm productivity to become less positively correlated with distortions and reduces

the dispersion of marginal products drops within the group. Moreover, the number of regions

affected by the credit composition effects and changes in industry output or input prices do not

affect this analysis. Conditional on basic parameters, changes in the correlation between distortions

and firm productivity are sufficient to determine the previous drop in the dispersion of marginal

products. Additionally, one can evaluate the importance of this effect by examining changes in the

marginal revenue product gap predicted by differences in firm productivity within a group.

   This framework also allows one to formally analyze whether labor might be a “sideshow”.

Labor is defined to be a sideshow if increases in credit supply reduce firms’ capital distortions but

do not change their labor distortions. In this case, the local composition of credit will only affect

industry productivity by changing the distribution of 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 (capital misallocation effect) and

changes in the distribution of 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 will play no role in explaining changes in local misallocation

(labor misallocation effect). Note that, even if credit does not affect firms’ cost of using labor, the

previous credit composition effects will still be matched with labor reallocation towards more

productive firms. This comes from the fact that capital and labor are complements and a relative

capital expansion by more productive firms also leads to a relative labor expansion by these same

firms. The gaps in 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 within a region will not change in this case because labor will be

reallocated across firms to keep these gaps constant. In contrast, labor misallocation effects can be


                                                  40
important if the composition of credit affects labor distortions. The key pattern that allows one to

disentangle these two cases is the 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 gap between more and less productive firms. This gap

will only be reduced in the case where labor is not a sideshow.

B. Do We Observe a Convergence in Marginal Product Gaps?

We examine if our previous results on the effects of state banking deregulation are matched with

a convergence of the marginal revenue products of local firms with different productivity. This is

the central qualitative prediction of the previous framework. One challenge in the implementation

of this analysis is that banking deregulation might affect the dispersion of marginal products

through additional mechanisms other than changes in the composition of credit supply. As in the

previous empirical analysis, we address this issue by contrasting the relative effects for more

productive firms among young and old firms. We estimate specifications from our financial policy

results (Table VI) using simple measures of gaps in firms’ marginal revenue products as the

outcome variables. As in our financial results, this analysis focuses on longer-term changes in

outcomes across census years given that gaps in marginal revenue products can only be measured

for broad samples of small firms during these years. We focus on the specifications including an

interaction with Young. We therefore rely on this age interaction to control for demand effects. 33

       We measure gaps in firms’ marginal revenue products of labor using 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) =

         𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 �          �, where 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 is firms’ revenue. Note that variation in this variable within an industry-
           𝐿𝐿


state-age group-year will capture gaps in firms’ marginal revenue product of labor (in logs) if

firms’ labor elasticity is constant within these groups. This will be the case if firms have Cobb-

Douglas revenue functions with parameters that depend only on these groups, a specification that



33
     Recall that the previous results suggest that this interaction is not capturing changes in credit demand.


                                                             41
is more flexible than the one in the previous model. 34 We measure gaps in firms’ marginal revenue

products of capital in an analogous way. As in our previous results, we report scaled coefficients

to capture differences between firms in the top and bottom quartiles of firm productivity.

       Table IX reports the results. Column (1) reports results using the specification in Panel B of

Table VI. Banking deregulation is associated with a significant reduction in the relative labor

marginal product of high productivity firms in the group of young firms. This effect is

economically significant and implies that deregulation (change in Dereg between 0 and 2) is

associated with a 5% drop in the relative marginal product of these firms. This drop represents a

convergence of marginal products because, prior to deregulation, there is a significant positive link

within an industry-state-year between the marginal product of labor and the productivity of young

firms in our sample. This estimated convergence effect represents a drop of 12% in the magnitude

of this initial link. The results show that this convergence in the marginal product of labor is robust

across different specifications. Column (2) considers the interaction of the specification in Panel

C of Table VI with age. All independent variables in this last specification are interacted with

Young. The coefficient of interest Dereg × TFP × Young estimates the differential value of the

coefficient Dereg × TFP among young firms. We use a sample that is significantly larger than the

one used in Table VI and are able to include interactions of both state fixed effects and year fixed

effects with TFP as controls. Therefore, the identification of the effect of interest is similar to the



                                                                                                                                𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
34
     In general, we can write the marginal revenue product of labor for firm 𝑖𝑖 in year 𝑡𝑡as 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 �                �+
                                                                                                                                  𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖


𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ), where 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the labor elasticity. If 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) is constant within an industry-state -age group-year, it will be

absorbed by the fixed effects in the specification analyzed here.




                                                                   42
one in Column (1) and is based only on the differential changes for young firms in the link between

MRPL and TFP around deregulation events. When compared to the previous result, the estimated

effect following this approach becomes economically stronger.

                                                 (Insert Table IX here)

    Columns (3) to (5) show that these results remain important when we focus on a broader group

of young firms with age between 1 and 10 years. In the analysis that follows, we focus on these

estimates based on a broader group of affected firms while quantifying the implications of the

results for aggregate industry productivity. Finally, Column (6) shows that these estimates are

matched with an economically similar effect for capital. As in the context of labor, we confirm

that this effect captures a convergence in the relative marginal products of firms with different

productivity. Overall, this analysis suggests that the previous results lead to industry productivity

gains and that labor misallocation effects plays a significant role in driving such gains.

C. Quantification of Implied Industry Productivity Gains

    We analyze the magnitude of the industry productivity gains implied by our last results. The

quantification of these implications requires additional assumptions about specific parameters and

functional forms in the model. We interpret this analysis as simply describing what a standard

model of misallocation used in the literature, and reasonable parameter values, would imply for

the magnitudes of our results. We describe here our main findings and provide greater detail in

Appendix C. We assume that the credit composition effect analyzed in Section IV.B takes place

for all states simultaneously and consider the gains for industry aggregate output. This gain is the

sum of the drops in local misallocation losses across regions. We evaluate this gain using Equation
                                                  2          2
(8) together with the previous expressions for 𝜎𝜎𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 , 𝜎𝜎𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 , and 𝜎𝜎𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 . We use the values for 𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗 , 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 ,

       2
and 𝜎𝜎𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 implied by our estimates for firm productivity and follow the literature in setting values


                                                           43
                                                                                                 𝑔𝑔         𝑔𝑔
for 𝜎𝜎 between three and four. We use the estimates for changes in 𝑎𝑎𝐿𝐿 and 𝑎𝑎𝐾𝐾 from Table IX

(Column (3) and (6)), which capture our broadest group of affected firms. We estimate the initial

link between firms’ marginal revenue products and TFP prior to deregulation and use these
                                                 𝑔𝑔       𝑔𝑔
estimates as initial values for 𝑎𝑎𝐿𝐿 and 𝑎𝑎𝐾𝐾 . This allows one to consider values for these parameters

before and after deregulation. This is the only source of change in our analysis and is intended to

capture the previous shift in the composition of credit. Additionally, we also need to measure the

share of firms in the groups. Since we are adding effects across all regions we here use the average

share of young single-plant firms across industries. In the context of this analysis, we define young

firms as firms with 10 years or less and 56% of firms in our data are young single-plant firms.

          Table X reports the magnitudes from this analysis. We report output gains in terms of value

added because it avoids double counting output across industries. 35 The results imply gains in

aggregate industry value added between 1.1% and 2.1%. These magnitudes are not sensitive to the

choice of 𝜎𝜎 and are between 2.0% and 2.1% once one focuses on industries in the top tercile of

productivity dispersion. These effects capture gains over a period of approximately five years. We

also report implied drops in previous local misallocation losses of 24%. Additionally, we also

consider the percentage increase in the gross output of young single-plant firms necessary to

generate the same increases in industry value added. One can interpret these increases as the



35
      We model gross output production functions because this approach requires weaker assumptions (Petrin

and Levinsohn (2012)) but we analyze how gross output gains translate into value added gains. In our

framework, we can write industry value added as 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝑄𝑄𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 − 𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 𝑀𝑀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 . Conditional on 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , 𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 , and 𝑀𝑀𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡 ,

incremental gains in industry gross output (∆𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙�𝑄𝑄𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 �) lead to value added gains given by ∆𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙�𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 � ≈

    𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝑄𝑄𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗
�                   � ∆𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙�𝑄𝑄𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 �. Therefore, we can use the ratio of industry sales to value added to convert these gains.
     𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗



                                                                    44
equivalent gains in the (revenue) firm-level productivity of these firms necessary to replicate the

previous effects. We estimate that these equivalent increases are economically large and represent

implied increases in firm productivity between 3.3% and 6.2%.

                                          (Insert Table X here)

      Finally, we consider the role of labor in quantitatively driving these implied gains. We follow

a simple approach to decompose the previous estimates into capital and labor misallocation effects.
                                                   𝑔𝑔
We first compute the gains assuming that only 𝑎𝑎𝐾𝐾 drops and there is no labor misallocation effect.
                                                                        𝑔𝑔
We then estimate the incremental gains associated with the drop in 𝑎𝑎𝐿𝐿 at the new lower value for
 𝑔𝑔
𝑎𝑎𝐾𝐾 . This gives us a contribution of reductions in labor misallocation. We compute the percentage

of the total gains associated with each of these components. We find that 85%-86% of the gains
                                                                             𝑔𝑔      𝑔𝑔
come from the drop in labor misallocation. Since the estimated drops in 𝑎𝑎𝐾𝐾 and 𝑎𝑎𝐿𝐿 is similar, this

gap comes from the difference in factor shares. Our analysis suggests that the previous credit

effects lead to comparable changes in the costs of using capital and labor but that the labor effect

is quantitatively more important because the labor share in production is significantly larger.

VI. Conclusions

      We study how state banking deregulation in the U.S. shapes the allocation of resources across

firms with different productivity within local nonfinancial industries. We find that the deregulation

of local U.S. banking markets leads to significant increases in the relative employment and capital

growth of young, high productivity firms. We use financial data for a broad range of firms to

provide evidence that a shift in the composition of bank credit supply towards these same young,

high-productivity firms accompanies these real resource reallocations. We provide evidence that

alternative mechanisms, such as changes to local demand and other local economic conditions, do

not explain our growth results.


                                                  45
    Intuitively, this reallocation effect due to bank lending should translate into gains in aggregate

industry productivity. We build on a standard monopolistic competition framework used in the

misallocation literature to explicitly consider the implications of this effect for aggregate industry

productivity. We then use this framework to quantify the implications of our results for aggregate

industry productivity. We find that our results imply significant gains in aggregate industry

productivity. In contrast with typical models connecting finance to aggregate productivity, we find

that the reallocation of labor plays an important role in explaining these gains. We highlight how

this role of labor should be important if the availability of credit affects firms’ cost of using labor.

    Overall, our analysis suggests that increased competition in local banking markets increases

credit to young, highly productive firms and can impact aggregate industry productivity. More

broadly, our emphasis on the composition of bank lending and the allocation of labor complements

previous evidence on the real effects of other reforms to financial or banking markets. Our results

suggest the importance of incorporating bank competition and the allocation of labor when

modeling the potential implications of finance for industry productivity.

Appendix A – Variable Definitions
As described in Section II, our main data sources are the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), the
Census of Manufacturers (CM), and the Quarterly Financial Reports (QFR) from the U.S. Census
Bureau. Across all variables, industries are defined as 3-digit SIC codes.

Employment – total firm employment from the LBD. Given our sample of single-plant firms, this
is the same as total establishment employment.

Employment Growth - change in the log of firm employment between years 𝑡𝑡 and 𝑡𝑡 − 1.

Dereg – banking deregulation index that equals the sum of Intrastate_Dereg and Interstate_Dereg,
which are indicators that equal one if the state has passed intrastate and interstate banking
deregulation, respectively.

Sales – total value of shipments from the CM adjusted with industry deflator. This value is based on
the last CM.

Young1, Young2, Old – Young1 is the group of firms present for the first time in the last CM. Young2
is the group of firms present for the first time in the CM prior to the last one. Old includes all firms
present in a prior CM which are not included in the two previous groups.

Age1 and Age2 – Age1 is the firm’s age measured using the LBD, i.e. number of years since first
appearance in the LBD. Age2 is the squared value of Age1.

Large – indicator variable that equals one if the firm is above the median employment in a given year
and age group (Young1, Young2, and other firms).

TFP – log of firm total factor productivity. We specify Cobb-Douglas production functions at the
plant-level with parameters that depend on an industry-year. Firm productivity is the same as plant
productivity in our sample of single-plant firms. The output in the production function is industry-
deflated sales. The inputs are the capital stock, labor (total hours), and total material costs. Production
function parameters for an industry-year are estimated using plant-level data from the Annual Survey
of Manufacturers (ASM) for the last five years. The ASM provides annual plant-level data for a
random subsample of plants. TFP is measured in the latest CM using values for the output and inputs
in that CM combined with the estimated production function parameters for that industry-year. In the
Internet Appendix we consider alternative measures of firm TFP using different approaches to
estimate the production function parameters.

Capital Stock Growth - change in the firms’ capital stock between the end of years 𝑡𝑡 and 𝑡𝑡 − 1, from
the CM.

Young (Age 1-10), Young (Age 1-5), Young (Age 6-10), and Old (11+) – age groups constructed during
Census years based on the number of years since the first appearance of the firm in the CM.
Bank Debt Share – ratio of bank debt (from commercial banks) to the sum of bank debt and non-bank
debt from the QFR (balance sheet information).

Bank Debt Ratio – ratio of bank debt (from commercial banks) to the book value of total assets from
the QFR (balance sheet information).

Non-Bank Debt Ratio – ratio of non-bank debt (from other sources, excluding commercial banks) to
the book value of total assets from the QFR (balance sheet information).

IDereg – value of Dereg at the start of the sample (1977).

Pre – indicator that equals one prior to the deregulation wave (in years 1977 and 1982). This variable
is used in specifications estimated only with Census years.

Shock (Table VII) – In Panel A, Shock is a predicted shock to state economic conditions between 1977
and 1993 (sample period). For each state, we first determine the initial share (in 1977) of the total
employment in each industry (initial share). We then estimate the national-level employment growth
of each industry in this list using only data for other states (national industry growth). The predicted
growth is the weighted average of these national growth rates across industries, where the previous
initial shares are used as weights. In Panel B, Shock is the state’s aggregate employment growth
between 1977 and 1993 (sample period). All these employment variables are based on LBD
employment data.

Shock (Table VIII) – In Panel A, Shock is a predicted shock to state economic conditions between
1977 (first sample year) and the current year, constructed in an analogous way to Panel A of Table
VII. Initial shares are based on 1977 and the national-level growth rate of each industry is defined
between 1977 and the current year. In Panel B, Shock is the state’s aggregate employment growth
between 1977 and the current year. . In Panels C to E, Shock is predicted in analogous way to Panel
A, but only includes a subset of local industries for each industry-state. More specifically, for each
given industry, we first define connected industries at the national level (see below). When predicting
a shock for a given industry-state we only include connected industries in the same state. The
predicted growth for connected industries is the weighted average of the national growth rates across
industries, defined in the same way as in Panel A, but now restricted to this subset of connected
industries. This predicted growth is multiplied by the initial share of connected industries in the state
to better capture the magnitude of the shock. We follow Ellison, Glaeser, and Kerr (2010) in the
definition of connections. In Panels C and D, connected industries are defined using the Benchmark
Input-Output Accounts published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Panel C classifies
industry j as connected (buyer) to industry i if it purchases at least 5% of the total sales from industry
i. Panel D classifies industry j as connected (seller) to industry i if at least 5% of the total inputs used
by industry i comes from industry j. In Panel E, connected industries are defined using the National
Industrial-Occupation Employment Matrix (NIOEM) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS). The NIOEM provides industry-level employment in 277 occupations, and we first estimate
the share of each industry across occupations. We then measure the similarity of the labor used by
two industries by measuring the correlation of their shares across different occupations. Industries are
classified as connected if their correlation is in the top 25% of the distribution across all industry pairs.
MRPL and MRPK (Table IX) – MPRPL is the log of the ratio of sales to labor (total hours). MPRPK
is the log of the ratio of sales to capital (capital stock). These variables are based on the CM and only
defined in Census years.


Appendix B – Analysis of Model of Misallocation and Industry Productivity
We show how the model in Section VI.A leads to the expression for local misallocation losses
(𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ) in the text (Equation (8)). We also provide more economic intuition on the logic behind this

result.
We start by describing in detail the intuition for a key point in this framework: gaps in firms’ marginal
revenue products translate into lower aggregate industry productivity (misallocation losses).


Intuitively, industry productivity can be increased by reallocating factor 𝐹𝐹 from firm 𝑖𝑖 to firm 𝑘𝑘
                             𝜕𝜕𝑄𝑄𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘                 𝜕𝜕𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
only if 𝑝𝑝𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘                            > 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖               . In other words, we can evaluate the contribution of products to industry
                                 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕                  𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕

productivity using their prices. This follows from the fact that the marginal rate of transformation
(MRT) for two products in the industry production function (representative firm) is given by their
                                                                 ′   𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
relative price, i.e., 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖,𝑖𝑖 =                                           .
                                                                     𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖′ 𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗



This intuitive result comes directly from the first-order condition for the problem of the representative
                                                                                                     𝜎𝜎−1         𝜎𝜎
firm: 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 {𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝑄𝑄𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 − ∑𝑖𝑖 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 }, where 𝑄𝑄𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = (∑𝑖𝑖 𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝜎𝜎 )𝜎𝜎−1 and the representative firm is buying
                 𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

output from firms in the industry. This problem leads to a demand for differentiated products with a
                                                                                                            −𝜎𝜎
                                                                                      𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
constant price elasticity 𝜎𝜎 and given by: � � = � �                                                              . The revenue function of the firm is given
                                            𝑄𝑄    𝑃𝑃                                     𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗       𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗

by 𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and from this the marginal revenue products of any given factor can be written as
𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                   𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖       𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                                                                                             𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
             = 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                   +                𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 . Given a constant elasticity of demand, this leads to MRPFijt ≡                              =
𝜕𝜕𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                   𝜕𝜕𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖       𝜕𝜕𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                                                                                             𝜕𝜕𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

           𝜕𝜕𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜎𝜎−1
𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                (         ).
           𝜕𝜕𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖       𝜎𝜎




Therefore, in this framework, resource reallocation across different firms can translate into industry
productivity gains if the marginal revenue products of these firms are not equalized. Conditional on
a distribution of firm TFP, industry productivity will be maximized at the point where marginal
revenue products are equalized across firms.
As a first step in the analysis of local misallocation losses, we derive a general expression for industry
TFP.             Recall that we simplify our analysis by assuming that characteristics (𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )
are jointly log-normally distributed in an industry-year. Before imposing this last condition, we can
obtain a general expression for industry TFP as:
                                                                                                                     𝜎𝜎

labor (L), capital (K) and materials (M) as follows:

In order to derive Equation (B.1) from the previous expression for industry TFP, we need to combine
it with the demand for differentiated products and a pricing equation. The demand equation implies

equation after the last step leads to Equation (B.1). Firms face a constant elasticity of demand, which
                                                      𝜎𝜎       ′

equation comes from combining this mark-up condition with a Cobb-Douglas cost function and the
first order conditions for 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 in the text (Equation (7)).


Equation (B.1) allows us to write industry TFP as a general function of the distribution of firm
productivity and marginal revenue products in the industry and is analogous to Equation (15) in Hsieh
and Klenow (2009, hereafter HK). This expression can be significantly simplified if we assume that
the characteristics (𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) are jointly log-normally distributed in an industry-year
– additional assumption in Section VI.A. In this case, we can write:
                                                                          2                                     2

Equation (B.2) is analogous to a general version of Equation (16) in HK and can be derived from
Equation (B.1) after applying statistical properties of a log-normal distribution. Specifically, Equation

(B.1) has three main terms with sums across firms, which can be each written as 𝑁𝑁𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝐸𝐸�𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �, where

𝐸𝐸�𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 � is the expected value in the industry of some log-normally distributed variable. Moreover,

𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is always a product of three log-normally distributed variables. If (𝑋𝑋1 , 𝑋𝑋2 , 𝑋𝑋3 ) are joint log-
                                                                                                                 𝜎𝜎2 2       𝜎𝜎3 2
normally distributed, we have 𝐸𝐸(𝑋𝑋1 𝑋𝑋2 𝑋𝑋3 ) = 𝐸𝐸(𝑋𝑋1 )exp(𝜇𝜇2 + 𝜇𝜇3 +                                                 +           + 𝜎𝜎23 + 𝜎𝜎12 + 𝜎𝜎13 ) ,
                                                                                                                   2           2

where 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 and 𝜎𝜎𝑖𝑖 is the mean and standard deviation of log(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 ) , respectively, and 𝜎𝜎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the
covariance between 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 ) and log(𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 ) . If we apply this property to the three previous

expressions in Equation (B.1), we can obtain Equation (B.2) after some algebra.


We can use Equation (B.2) to derive the expression for local misallocation losses (𝐿𝐿𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ) in the text

in a simple way. Recall that these losses are defined as the increase in industry productivity that would

take place if 𝑎𝑎𝐾𝐾 and 𝑎𝑎𝐿𝐿 became equal to zero. Also recall that 𝑎𝑎𝐾𝐾 and 𝑎𝑎𝐿𝐿 are defined as the
incremental distortions (in logs) predicted within a group by a given increase in 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ). For each
                                                                𝑔𝑔         𝑔𝑔                           𝑔𝑔                      g
group g, we can write 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(1 + 𝜏𝜏𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 ) = 𝑏𝑏𝐹𝐹 +𝑎𝑎𝐹𝐹 × 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) + 𝜖𝜖𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 , where ϵFit is a residual from a

linear projection of log(1 + τFit ) on (𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ),1) within the group. As explained in the text, we

are assuming that the average value of 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(1 + 𝜏𝜏𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 ) in each group do not change in this exercise –
                                                                                                                                                                g
we abstract away from misallocation across groups. We are also holding the distribution of ϵFit

constant – assumption that other distortions unrelated to productivity are not changing.


We can thus obtain equation 8 in the text as:

and β = �                     � β�. When choosing values for σ, we use three following Klenow and Hsieh (2009)
                      σ−1

and four as in Bloom (2009). We estimate Shareg directly from data as the average share of young

single-plant firms across industries, which is 56% in our sample. Notice that we are adding gains
across all local industries, so we use the total share of this group in an industry. We measure
              g
empirically 𝑎𝑎L by first estimating a linear regression of MRPL on TFP (in logs) using single-

establishment young firms (age 1-10) in 1977 and include only states that have not been deregulated
in that year. We include industry-state-age group fixed effects in this regression. This regression
allows to predict log(1 + 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿 ) with TFP (in logs) within a group prior to deregulation. This provides
                       g
an initial value for 𝑎𝑎L , which we then combine with the estimated effect from Table IX to also obtain

                   g                                                       g
a final value for 𝑎𝑎L . We follow an analogous procedure for analyzing 𝑎𝑎K . We obtain an empirical

proxy for σ2Ag in the following way. For each industry (3-digit SIC code), state, and year, we first

compute the standard deviation of TFP (in logs) within young (age 1-10) single-plant firms. We then
take an average across different states and years to obtain a measure for each industry. We then sort
all industries based on this measure. In our empirical analyses, we use the average value for all
industries, as well as the average values for the top 50% and top 33% industries.
                                           g   g
  Using the initial and final values for (𝑎𝑎L , 𝑎𝑎K ) and the other values previously explained, we can

compute ∆LML. In order to convert these gross output gains into value-added gains, we scale ∆LML
(in gross output) by the average ratio of industry sales to industry value added (see Section VI). We
convert this gain into an equivalent change in the output of young single-plant firms by dividing
∆LML by the average share of output in young single-plant firms across industries.
                                Figure 1: State Banking Deregulation Over Time
This figure presents the annual average value of the deregulation index across states during our sample period (1977-
1993). Dereg is a banking deregulation index that equals the sum of Intrastate_Dereg and Interstate_Dereg.
Intrastate_Dereg and Interstate_Dereg are indicators that equal one if the state has passed intrastate and interstate banking
deregulation, respectively. Panel A repots the average value of Dereg for each year (across states). Panel B separately
reports the average values of Inter_Dereg and Intra_Dereg for each year. See Section I.A for more details.

This figure analyzes the dynamics of the effects in Table V. The panels report results analogous to the ones in Table V
with effects that are separately estimated across different years (1977, 1982, and 1987). For each specification in Table
V, the variable Pre is replaced with three separate indictors for each of those three years (Year_1977, Year_1982, and
Year_1987). These variables are included in an analogous way to Pre, including all previous controls based on them. The
results in Panel A are based on the specification used in Panel B of Table V (Column (1)). The values reported for year i
represent the coefficient of Year_i × IDereg × TFP × Young. The results in Panel B are based on the specification used
in Panel A of Table V (Columns (1) and (2)). The values reported for year i represent the coefficient of Year_i × IDereg
× TFP for the respective age group (Young or Old). All reported effects are scaled in the same way as in Table V to
capture a gap between the top and bottom quartiles of an industry-state.

This table presents summary statistics for different variables used in the paper. Panel A shows summary statistics for the main sample used in the paper, which
covers single-plant firms in the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) that are also present in the previous Census of Manufacturers (CM). See the text for details.
Young1 and Young2 are firms present for the first time in the previous CM and present for the first time in the CM before the previous one, respectively. Old
includes all other firms in the main sample. Panel B reports summary statistics for the financial variables used in the paper. We use these variables in a sample of
firms both present in the Quarterly Financial Reports (QFR) database and the CM. The means and standard deviations for this sample are computed using weights
to match the distribution of size and age in our main sample. Young (Age 1-5) and Young (Age 6-10) are firms present for the first time in the current and previous
CM, respectively. Old (Age 11+) are all other firms in the sample. Variable definitions are in Appendix A. The number of observations has been rounded to the
nearest hundred following the Census Bureau's disclosure policy.

                                Table II: Banking Deregulation and Labor Reallocation
This table presents results linking state banking deregulation to changes in the relative employment growth of local firms
with higher productivity. The analysis primarily focuses on the differential value of this effect for younger firms. The
results are based on the estimation of interactions of Equation (1) with different age groups (Young1, Young2, and Old).
The overall sample used in all results and the previous age groups are described in Panel A of Table I. The dependent
variable is Employment Growth. Dereg is a banking deregulation index that equals the sum of Intrastate_Dereg and
Interstate_Dereg. Intrastate_Dereg and Interstate_Dereg are indicators that equal one if the state has passed intrastate
and interstate banking deregulation, respectively. TFP is a measure of firm productivity (in logs) based on plant-level
data. Control variables include Large, Age1, Age2, and the interactions of each of these variables with the previous two
deregulation indicators. Large is an indicator that equals one if the firm is above the median employment in a given year
and age group (Young1, Young2, and other firms). Age1 measures the number of years since the firm first appeared in the
LBD database and Age2 is the squared value of Age1. The results in Column (1) of Panel A consider the average effect
of deregulation across all age groups. These results are based on the estimation of Equation (1) with additional controls,
which include Young1, Young2, and their interactions with the two deregulation variables. Young1 and Young2 are
indicators that equal one in these age groups. All other results consider the differential effect of deregulation for the age
groups. In the specifications analyzing the differential effect for Young1, all independent variables (including controls)
and fixed effects are included with and without their interaction with Young1. The only variables not interacted with
Young1 are Age1 and Age2. The results analyzing the differential effects for both Young1 and Young2 are based on an
analogous specification where the independent variables and fixed effects are now separately interacted with Young1 and
Young2. The results in Columns (1) and (2) of Panel B exclude Age1, Age2 and their interactions from the set of controls.
In the result in Column (3) of Panel B, Young1 is defined using the LBD as an indicator that equals one if Age1≤5. In this
result, only years from 1982 on are included. The results in Columns (1) and (2) of Panel C exclude Large and its
interactions from the set of controls. The results in Columns (3) and (4) of Panel C replace Large with separate indicators
for the four top quintiles of employment in a given year and age group. All interactions with Large in the set of controls
are constructed in an analogous way for each of the four indicators. All coefficients are multiplied by the average TFP
gap between the top and bottom quartiles of an industry-state (see text for details). The number of observations has been
rounded to the nearest thousand following the Census Bureau's disclosure policy. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity
robust and double clustered at the state and industry level. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%,
and 1%, respectively.

This table presents results linking state banking deregulation to changes in the relative capital stock growth of local firms
with higher productivity. The analysis focuses on the differential value of this effect for younger firms. The results are
based on the same specification used in Table II (Columns (2) and (3) of Panel A) with a different outcome variable and
the exclusion of firm fixed effects. The dependent variable is Capital Stock Growth. This outcome is only available during
Census years and this prevents us from estimating the effect for Young1 with firm fixed effects (see text for details). All
coefficients are multiplied by the average TFP gap between the top and bottom quartiles of an industry-state. The number
of observations is rounded following Census Bureau's disclosure policy. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity robust and
double clustered at the state and industry level. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%,
respectively.

This table presents results on the dynamics of the effects of banking deregulation on the relative employment growth of
local firms with higher productivity. As in Table II, the analysis focuses on the differential value of this effect for younger
firms. The results are based on specifications similar to the ones in Table II (Column (3) of Panel A) that allow for pre-
trends on the effect of banking deregulation. These specifications add more variables to the one used in Table II. The
specifications in Column (1) adds Dereg(-1 to -3) in analogous way to Dereg and includes the same set of interactions used
for Dereg. The specification in Column (2) follows the same approach with Dereg(-1 to -6). All coefficients are multiplied
by the average TFP gap between the top and bottom quartiles of an industry-state (see text for details). The number of
observations has been rounded to the nearest thousand following the Census Bureau's disclosure policy. Standard errors
are heteroskedasticity robust and double clustered at the state and industry level. *, **, and *** indicate statistical
significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

 Table V: Banking Deregulation and the Composition of Bank Lending: Evidence from the Share of Bank Debt

This table presents results linking banking deregulation to the relative importance of bank debt for local firms with higher
productivity. The analysis contrasts the importance of this effect for different age groups. The dependent variable is Bank
Debt Share, the ratio of bank debt to total debt (bank and nonbank debt). The results are based on the sample of firms
described in Panel B of Table I, which includes firms that are both on the QFR database and the Census of Manufacturers
(CM). Panel A reports results based on the estimation of Equation (2). Pre is an indicator variable that equals one prior
to the deregulation wave (i.e., 1977 and 1982). IDereg is the initial (beginning of sample) value of banking deregulation
index (Dereg). TFP is a measure of firm productivity (in logs) based on plant-level data. Control variables include Large,
indicators for age groups, and the interactions of each of these variables with Pre, IDereg, and Pre× IDereg. Large is an
indicator that equals one for firms above the median value of employment in a given year and age group. Age groups are
constructed based on the number of years since the firm first appeared in the CM (Age 1-5, Age 6-10, and Age 11+). The
results are estimated in subsamples defined based on these age groups. Panel B estimates the differential value of the
previous effects for groups of younger firms. In the specifications analyzing the differential effect for Young, all
independent variables (including controls) and fixed effects are included with and without their interaction with Young.
The only variables not interacted with Young are the age indicators. In the results where Young includes only firms with
age between 1 and 5, all firms with age between 6 and 10 are excluded from the sample. Panel C reports results based on
the estimation of Equation (3). Control variables include Large, indicators for age groups, and the interactions of each of
these variables with Dereg. Panel D reports results based on the estimation of linear regression of Bank Debt Share on
IDereg, Industry-Year fixed effects, Pre × IDereg, and controls. The controls include Large, indicators for age groups,
and the interactions of these variables with Pre and IDereg. All coefficients in Panels A to C are multiplied by the average
TFP gap between the top and bottom quartiles of an industry-state (see text for details). The number of observations has
been rounded to the nearest thousand following the Census Bureau's disclosure policy. Standard errors are
heteroskedasticity robust and double clustered at the state and industry level. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance
at the 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

This table estimates the results in Table V (Panels A to C) using the ratio of firms’ bank debt and non-bank debt as
outcome variables. Bank Debt Ratio is the ratio of bank debt to total assets. Non-Bank Debt Ratio is the ratio of non-bank
debt to total assets. All coefficients in Panels A to C are multiplied by the average TFP gap between the top and bottom
quartiles of an industry-state (see text for details). The number of observations has been rounded to the nearest thousand
following the Census Bureau's disclosure policy. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity robust and double clustered at the
state and industry level. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

                        Table VII: Addressing Concerns About Bank Credit Demand Effects

This table presents results addressing concerns that changes in credit demand could explain the previous patterns for the
share of bank debt. The results implement falsifications tests examining if higher local (state) economic growth is
associated with a more positive link between firms' productivity and their bank debt share. The dependent variable in all
results is Bank Debt Share, the ratio of bank debt to total firm debt. These results are based on the estimation of a
specification analogous to one analyzed in Table V (Panel A), which replaces IDereg with Shock and replaces Pre with
Post = 1-Pre. The results include the same set of controls as in Table V, which are now defined in analogous way using
Shock and Post. As in Table V, these effects are separately estimated for different age groups. The results in Panel A and
B are based on different definitions for Shock. In Panel A, Shock is a predicted shock to state economic conditions between
1977 and 1993 (sample period). This shock is constructed by combining the initial (employment) composition of
industries in each state with the realized national-level (employment) growth of different industries over the period (1977-
1992). The predicted shock is the weighted average of national-level shocks to industries based on initial weights (see
text and Appendix A for more details). In Panel B, Shock is the state's employment growth between 1977 and 1992. Panel
B also includes the variable IDereg and all its interactions used in Table V as additional control variables. All coefficients
are multiplied by the average TFP gap between the top and bottom quartiles of an industry-state and the standard deviation
of Shock in the data. The number of observations has been rounded to the nearest thousand following the Census Bureau's
disclosure policy. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity robust and double clustered at the state and industry level. *, **,
and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

           Table VIII: Labor Reallocation Effects: Falsification Tests Examining Alternative Mechanisms

This table presents results addressing concerns that the previous labor reallocation effects are driven by alternative
mechanisms, different from changes in the composition of bank credit supply. The results implement falsifications tests
examining the effects of shocks to state economic conditions or shocks to specific local industries that shape firms' local
demand, their input markets, or their labor markets. The dependent variable in all results is Employment Growth. These
results are based on the estimation of a specification analogous to the one analyzed in Table II (Columns (2) and (3) of Panel
A), which replaces Dereg with Shock. The results include the same set of controls as in Table II, which are now defined in
analogous ways using Shock. The different panels are based on different definitions for Shock. In Panel A, Shock is a
predicted shock to state economic growth between 1977 and the current year. This shock is constructed by combining the
initial (employment) composition of industries in each state with the realized national-level (employment) growth of
different industries over the period (1977-current year). The predicted shock is the weighted average of national-level shocks
to industries based on initial weights (see text for more details). In Panel B, Shock is the state's employment growth between
1977 and the current year. Panel B also includes the variable Dereg and all its interactions used in Table II as additional
control variables. In Panels C to E, Shock is a predicted shock to the growth of a subset of other local industries (in the same
state) between 1977 and the current year. The shock to this subset of industries is predicted in an analogous way to the
approach used in Panel A (using national-level shocks). For each industry-state, this subset of local industries includes only
industries classified as connected at the national level. Connected industries are important consumers and suppliers in Panels
C and D, respectively, based on Input-Output tables. Connected industries are industries with a similar workforce in Panel
E. All coefficients are multiplied by the average TFP gap between the top and bottom quartiles of an industry-state and the
standard deviation of Shock in the data. The number of observations has been rounded to the nearest thousand following the
Census Bureau's disclosure policy. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity robust and double clustered at the state and
industry level. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

This table reports results linking state banking deregulation to gaps between the marginal revenue product of local firms with high and low productivity. The
analysis focuses on the differential effects for young local firms. The results are based on the same specifications used in Table VI with different outcome variables
(MRPL and MRPK). MRPL is the log of the ratio of revenues to total labor. MRPK is the log of the ratio of revenues to the capital stock. Columns (1), (3), and (6)
are based on the specification in Panel B of Table VI. Columns (2), (4), and (5) report differential effects for younger firms based on the estimation of the
specification in Panel C of Table VI for different age groups. All independent variables (including controls) and fixed effects in the previous specification are now
included with and without their interaction with Young. The only variables not interacted with Young are the age indicators. All coefficients are multiplied by the
average TFP gap between the top and bottom quartiles of an industry-state (see text for details). The number of observations has been rounded to the nearest
thousand following the Census Bureau's disclosure policy. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity robust and double clustered at the state and industry level. *, **,
and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

                            Table X: Quantification of Implied Industry Productivity Gains

This table reports the magnitudes for the industry productivity gains implied by the previous results in a standard model
of misallocation and industry productivity (see Section V.Cand Appendix C for details). The analysis considers a change
in the link between labor and capital distortions and the productivity of single-plant young firms within a same industry-
state. The analysis assumes that this link changes for all states in which an industry operates at the same time. This link
drops by the amount implied by the results in Table IX (Columns (1) and (6)). Panels A and B report the implied gains
for aggregate industry productivity computed using Equation (4) and plausible assumptions about the underlying
parameters. Industry VA Gain (%) captures the implied percentage increase in industry value added. Drop in Local
Misallocation (%) measures the percentage drop in the local misallocation loss described in Section IV. Firm Productivity
Effect measures the equivalent percentage increase in the output of all individual young single-plant firms necessary to
generate the same gain in aggregate industry value added. The values implied by different values of the demand elasticity
faced by firms (σ) are reported separately. The results are also estimated separately for different values of the dispersion
in firm productivity. All TFP SD uses the average value of this dispersion in the sample of all industries. Top 50% SD
and Top 33% SD use the average value of this dispersion in the top 50% and top 33% of industries in terms of this
dispersion. Panel C analyzes the percentage contribution of labor and capital to these gains along the lines described in
the text (Section V.C).
