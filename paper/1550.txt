                 On the Optimal Taxation of Capital
                      Income in an Open Economy


                                ABSTRACT




          The optimal taxation of foreign and domestic investors' incomes is
examined with a simple overlapping—generations model.

          Even when tax rates are allowed to discriminate between these groups,
the optimal tax rates on both domestic and foreign investors' incomes in the
small open economy are identical and equal to the optimal rate of tax in the
closed economy. In light of the emphasis in the literature on the extent to
which the elasticity of international flows might lower optimal capital income
taxes, this conclusion is quite a surprise.

          In the large open economy, the optimal tax rate on foreign investors'
income alone is a weighted average of one and the small economy tax rate. The
optimal tax rate on domestic income is, again, unaffected by the openness of
the economy.

          When a uniform tax rate must be set in the large open economy, it is
generally higher than the optimal tax rate for a closed economy, a conclusion
contrary to the conventional wisdom. However, a higher elasticity of inter-
national capital flows is associated with a lower tax rate, as expected, but
the rate remains above the closed—economy rate.

          In summary, openness matters for optimal tax policy, primarily in the
case of the large economy. The reason is mainly the ability to burden foreign
investors with a tax liability.

           On the Optimal Taxation of Capital Income in the Open Economy



            The first Reagan term brought fundamental shifts in the U.S. tax

treatment of savings and investment. Even prior to this complete reorientation

of policy toward an encouragement of capital formation, the taxation of capital

income had become probably the most popular topic of researchers in public

finance, and interest has increased since. In light of the growing integration

of the world's economies, it is curious that in all of the recent literature on

taxation   and investment, little attention has been devoted to international
capital flows.
            At best, authors recognize the possibility of capital flowing abroad

and point out that international flows could prove to be problematic for their

closed—economy results.1 A major exception is the work of Goulder, Shoven, and

Whalley (1983), in which investment abroad is explicitly incorporated in a

large general equilibrium model of the U.S. GSW conclude that if capital

outflows are highly elastic, the welfare effects of various tax changes can be

drastically altered. International capital mobility is, thus, viewed in the

literature as a potential constraint on domestic policymaking which becomes

important only under the condition that the degree of mobility is quite high.

           Having focused on the elasticity of international capital flows as

the   key factor in determining whether the traditional closed—economy models of
public finance are appropriate, researchers have been reassured by the findings
of   Feldstein and Horioka (1980) and Feldstein (1983) that capital apparently

does not flow freely across national boundaries. The conclusion that inelastic

capital flows are not a matter of great concern has been shown in a previous

paper to be deceptively simple (see Hartman (1985)). What the existing litera—
                                    —2—


ture has ignored and that paper highlighted the possibility that foreign

ownership of a portion of the domestic capital stock could imply that a tax

burden could be imposed on those "outside the system." That is, a welfare gain

to the economy could result from tax revenue collections from foreign

investors. Since the tax revenue change can be a first—order effect, as corn—

pared to the welfare effects of capital income taxation in a closed (and other-

wise non—distorted) economy, this consideration could loom large in the

determination of welfare effects, as Hartman (1985) suggests.

          It was, until very recently, understandable that the presence of

foreign—owned capital in the U.S. was ignored despite its growing magnitude,

since the U.S. position was that of a large net creditor. In fact, though, it

is far from obvious that the net flows being outward implies that welfare ana-

lyses can neglect the gross inflows. Now, with the U.S. becoming a net debtor

nation and the foreign—owned portion of the U.S. capital stock growing rapidly,

it is far more difficult to ignore the foreign component.

          In this paper, the issue of optimal taxation of capital income is

addressed in the context of an economy facing an elastic supply of capital from

abroad. It will be of particular interest to investigate whether the optimal

tax is lowered by "openness" in line with the conventional wisdom, or raised,

as one might suspect based on the fact that tax burdens borne by foreign

investors represent a domestic welfare gain. While our primary motivation is

to determine how, if at all, the openness of the economy affects the optimal

tax rate on all capital income, it is also simple to derive an optimal tax rate

for foreign—owned capital for situations in which that rate can be set indepen—
                                        —3—


dently.

            To clarify the role of the open econorrr assumption yet adequately

address the motivation for saving and investing, we choose a much—simplified

overlapping—generations model for analysis. As is true of similar models in

general, the justification for taxing capital income on welfare grounds is very

limited for the closed economy.



2. A Simple Growth Model

            The purpose of this section is to lay out the elements of a steady—

state growth model with overlapping generations of individuals who work in the

first period of their lives and are retired in the second period.2 Since our

focus will be on the effects of foreign ownership of capital on the optimal tax

rate, the approach will not lead to quite as compact a specification as could

be used in a closed—economy analysis. At the same time, the model will be spe-

cified quite simply; in particular, it will take no account of complications

such as government investment or the labor supply response examined by

Feldstein (l98).3 We simplify further by assuming that any deficiency in tax

revenue from that required to finance a fixed per capita level of government

expenditure is made up through use of a lump—sum tax. By building on such a

straightforward closed—economy model in which a very traditional set of optimal

taxation results obtain, we can more readily highlight the implications of

"openness

            Our simple economy is characterized by population growth at rate n.

The utility of each of        =
                                  Nt(1+n) members of the younger generation at time
                                        —4—


t is given by u =
                    u(c1,   c2) where c1 is consumption in the working years and

C2 is consumption during retirement. The young employ          of capital which

lasts only one period and, thus, represents the savings (s1) of the older

generation during the prior period. Production per person can be expressed as

f(k), where k     [Kt/(Nt(1+n)fl. The gross—of—tax return paid to members of the

older generation equals rk per worker (or, equivalently-, rk((1+n)/n) per

recipient). The young, in turn, save     s = ESt/(Nt(1+n))] per capita. In
steady state, S must, of course, equal k(1+n). Dropping the time subscript

for simplicity, the young's consumption is period 1 (the period of work)

equals:

(2.1)     c = f(k)—rk—s

Suppose, further, that the government spends       =                    in each
                                                       [Gt/(Nt(1+n))1
period, financing their expenditure by a "tax" at rate t on the capital income

of retirees and/or a lump sum "tax" on retirees. We will allow either "tax" to

be negative if such a result turns out to be optimal. Per capita consumption

of today's young in their retirement is given by:


(2.2)     c2 =   (l+r(l—t))s—[g—trs]    (l+r)s—g


          The government utilizes its capital income taxing and lump—sum taxing

capabilities to maximize steady—state utility, subject to the constraints of

technolor and of consumers' and producers' decisions. Consumers optimize

across the two periods by choosing s such that:

(2.3)     —U1 + U2 (1+r(1—t)) = 0

The government, in turn, would evaluate tax changes according to:
                                                       —5—




                       dc            U       dc
           dt         1 dt   l+r(1—t) dt

From (2.1), (2.2), (2.I), and the condition of steady—state growth in capital,

the government sets:


(2.5)       0 =
                  /U1 =      [—ku-
                                         —
                                             (i+n)1          +
                                                                 l+r(1_t)1+E + k(1+n)--1
With some tedious manipulation, we arrive at the optimal tax rate:


/   ,_.,                     (n—r)
2.oi       t0           1(l+n) dk/dt
                      —r k dr[dt +                ii
           It is useful at this point to define the capital demand and

supply elasticities:


(2.1)             — dk r         e       ds r(1—t)
           ek         •ri-

To simplify our descriptions of the results, we will usually implicitly assume

that e > 0, although a postive value is not assured. Now, we can re—write the

optimal tax expression as:


(2 8)             -
                  —      (n-r)
            opt       (l+n)ek_r

As expected in so simple a model with the possibility of lump—sum taxation, the

optimal tax on capital income is zero if the economy is at the "golden rule"

level of capital per worker already (that is, if f'=n). Otherwise, there is

some scope for a "tax" (positive or negative) to improve welfare by moving the

economy in the direction of the golden rule.

           This result highlights the point made by Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980)

that the optimal tax moves the economy part way to the golden rule; the result
                                       —6-.



is   even clearer when rewritten as:


(2.9)       rt =
                    (1+n)ek


This equation illustrates the tradeoff being made between reducing the distor—

tionary effects of the tax and realizing the benefits of getting the net rate

of return facing savers "correct't in the sense of the golden rule. If, for

instance, the capital demand schedule is perfectly inelastic, so that distor-

tions are absent, a subsidy or tax, as the case may   be,   is imposed, to insure

equality of the rate of growth and the net rate of return to capital.

           Since this result is not surprising (see Atkinson and Stiglitz

(1980), Feldstein (1981), and Ihori (198)-)), it will not be discussed in further

detail. It is intended mainly as a basis for comparison with later findings for

the open economy.



3. A Model of the Small Open Economy

           The simplest type of open economy to analyze is the "small" open eco-

nomy, faced with a perfectly elastic supply of capital from abroad. The small

open economy will probably not provide the most interesting results, since the

ability to burden foreign investors with a capital income tax was a critical

element in our belief that openness might matter for tax policy. The govern-

ment of a small open economy can impose no such burden. Nevertheless, the

small economy case is a useful starting point since the model is simple to

describe and is also the characterization almost exclusively found in the

public finance literature. There are several similar tax questions we will
                                         —7—




address in turn: the optimal differential tax on foreigners' capital income

when the domestic tax rate is fixed, the optimal differential tax when the

domestic tax rate is set simultaneously and optimally, and the optimal uniform

tax rate for all capital income.



        A. The Optimal Tax on Foreign Investors' Incomes with a Fixed Domestic
            Tax Rate

            We begin our analysis with an issue which has attracted the most

attention from economists in the past: the optimal taxation of foreign

investors' returns, when the domestic tax rate is given. The conventional wid—

som holds that a country faced with highly—elastic capital inflows should not

tax foreign investors' incomes. For reasons we will examine in some depth, the

result obtained here is quite at variance with the received wisdom.

            The model is very similar to that already considered, except that the

presence of foreign—owned capital supplied with infinite elasticity (assuming

that the autarky return in the domestic econoriy exceeds the world return)

implies complete separation of the savings and investment decisions.

Furthermore,    the net—of—tax rate of return earned by   foreigners is determined

abroad. Thus, the tax rate, t*, and the foreign return, r*, determine the
gross domestic rate of return as r*/(l_t*). As before, consumption in the
first   period is given by equation (2.1), which now simply indicates that gross

payments to all capital owners plus the workers' savings must account for the

entire non—consumed production of the economy. Consumption in period 2,

however, must    explicitly   reflect the payment of taxes by foreign owners of

capital, and is given by:
                                                 —8—




(3.1)     c2 =   (1+r)s   —   [g_t*r(k(1+n)_s)

That is, the lump sum tax on the older generation is reduced to the extent

that the foreign—owned portion of the capital stock generates tax revenue.

The government, then, optimally sets t so that:

                           k     s                (l+n)ek + e


Ignoring the second term for the moment, it may                 be   somewhat awkward but is

quite helpful to think of the optimal tax on foreign investors' income as being

a weighted average of the fixed tax rate on domestic investors' income and

zero, with the weights being determined by the relative elasticities of

domestic savings supply and domestic investment demand.

          The result is highly intuitive when we consider that a tax on foreign

investors distorts the domestic investment decision, while a differential tax

on foreign investors' returns differentiates the domestic investors' returns

from the given world level, distorting the domestic savings decision. The

higher is the elasticity of capital demand relative to the domestic savings

supply, the more is the optimal tax on foreign investors pushed toward zero and

away from the domestic tax rate.

          The second term is a "golden rule" adjustment to the optimal tax,
                                              —9—


which affects the optimal tax rate unless t has been set so that nr(l—t).

Since we have indicated nothing about how t is determined, we cannot be much

more specific about the implications of this expression. We can see, however,

that the extent to which the economy is pushed toward the golden rule depends

on the elasticities of the savings and investment relations. Also, it is clear

(as long as e > 0, as we are assuming throughout) that t is positively

related to t. So, if the domestic tax rate is fixed at a level below the opti-

mum, the optimal tax rate on foreign investors' incomes is reduced as well.

               More interesting is the problem of setting both t and t simulta-

neously, to which we will now turn.



          B. The Optimal Tax Rates on Foreign and Domestic Investors' Incomes

               In determining simultaneously the optimal tax rate on foreign

investors' returns and domestic investors' returns, the government's basic

behavior is governed by the same equations for utility and consumption in

Section 3.A. This time, however, the government is able to differentially

influence the net rate of return which determines k (by changing t*) and that

which determines s (by changing t). Corresponding to (3.2) ,                       then,   is:



              0 =           = —k- + l+r(l_t)        dE1r +       rk*   +
                                                                           t*k*   +
                                                                                      t*r(l+n) .i
so,

(     )              = (n—r(l—t))
               opt
                          (1+n)ek

For comparison purposes, the optimal tax on domestic investors is given by:


(3.6)         0 =   /TJ    — — ds +
                                      l+r(l—t) t(i+r)--      —   t*r-]
                                              —10—




or:

(3.7)     t
           opt
                 =   t, thus   t
                                opt
                                      =   t   = _________
                                                (n—r(l—t))
                                                  (l+n)ek
                                                             _________
                                                                (n—r)
                                                              (l+n)ek_r


          This conclusion deserves emphasis. Despite the fact that the nature

of foreign investors' and domestic investors' behavior may be quite different,

both tax rates are independently set to be equal. Also, they are non—zero only

when the world economy does not generate a rate of return consistent with the

golden rule growth path.

          Furthermore, looking back at equation (2.8) we note that the optimal

tax rate on capital income is the same as that produced in a closed—economy

model. That is, the small              economy's optimal tax olicy        for   capital income

is uniform and identical to that of the closed economy. While such a

conclusion is certainly striking and clearly at odds with the conventional wis-

dom, the intuition is straightforward. Obviously, the government of the small

open economy is unable to burden the foreign investor with any tax liability.

The tax rate placed on the foreign investor is translated directly into an

impact on the domestic rate of return. Conversely, the only way the return to

capital in the domestic market (and, hence, the domestic rate of capital for—

mation) can be altered is by taxing the foreign investor. In general, the

objectives toward which the closed economy directs tax policy must be met by

taxing foreign investors' incomes. In this case, the taxation of foreign

investors is dictated by the desire to move the economy toward the golden rule.

An equivalent tax rate applied to the domestic investor is required for an

efficient level of savings to be generated in the domestic economy, although

the domestic tax rate has no influence on the rate of capital formation. Thus,

the problem of how to tax the foreign investor is directly analogous to the

problem of capital taxation in the closed economy, despite the fact that the

questions, at first glance, seem unrelated. Consequently, it is hardly

surprising in retrospect that the optimal tax formulae for the domestic

investor in the closed economy and the foreign investor in the small economy

should turn out to be identical.

          It should be noted that it is because the foreign investor cannot be

forced to share any burden of the tax, that a tax is levied only for "golden

rule" reasons. That is, if any other government policies can be used to

achieve n=r, then a zero tax on capital income, regardless of recipient, is

optimal. In the closed economy, government debt or social security could be

used as alternative instruments, but in the open economy the options are

limited to those affecting foreign investment.

          Parenthetically, it should also be noted that if a small   open economy
is somehow prevented from taxing the income of foreign investors, it should not

tax domestic capital income either. Naturally, such a result is necessary to

insure the optimality of domestic savings decisions.



     C. The Optimal Uniform Tax Rate on Domestic and Foreign Investors' Incomes

         Since the exercise carried out in Section B led to a uniform tax rate

on foreign investors and domestic investors, the tax treatment appropriate to

situations which the taxing authority is forced to set a uniform tax rate is

obviously the same (given by equation (3.1)). When we relax the strict small
                                            —12—


open economy assumption in the next section, a variety of factors will contri-

bute to the inequality of optimal tax rates set separately and, thus, make the

restriction of equal rates a binding constraint on government action.



1. A Model of the Large Open Economy

              The optimal tax analysis for an open economy sufficiently "large" to

influence the net return it mast pay to foreign investors is significantly more

complex than that for the small open economy. At the same time, it is probably

the case for a number of countries, and is certainly true of the United States,

that the small economy assumption is unrealistic. Thus, we turn to the more

complex situation; as in Section 3, we will consider the setting of an optimal

tax on the foreign investor under three different assumptions about the way the

tax on domestic investors is determined.



         A. The Optimal Tax on Foreign Investors' Incomes with a Fixed Domestic
             Tax Rate

             As before, we first take the domestic tax rate as pre—deterinined.

The government's optimization problem remains basically the same as before, but

now we mast take explicit account of the simultaneous determination of the

domestic rate of return (and, hence, domestic savings and investment) and any

tax—induced change in the level of foreign investment. Since the supply of

foreign capital is no longer determined simply as the excess of domestic capi-

tal demand over supply, k* mast be explicitly introduced (as will be its

elasticity e ):


(11.1)       c2 =   (l+r(1—t))s   —   g_trs.t*rk*   =   (l+r)s   —   [g_t*rk*]
                                                      —13--



The basic relations to be solved are, then, the familiar equation for welfare

change, plus:


          dc1            dr -         ds
    .2)             - -kfw

                    = (l+r)- +                  +   rk*   +
                                                              t*r-. + t*k*--
(4.I)     S    +k        =   k(1+n)

The optimal tax is, finally, given by:

                    -—           es                  e               (n-r(1+t))      e           1
(   5)                       (l+n)ek       +   es              +                            ÷
              opt                                   l+ek*          (l+n)ek +   e-   l+ek*       l+ek

          The optimal tax expression could have been written in a slightly more

compact form, but each of the three terms in p4.5) represents a distinct motive

for taxing foreign investor's income. The first term obviously represents the

"domestic tax factor." In this term, the domestic tax rate is multiplied by an

expression representing the domestic savings elasticity relative to the

domestic investment demand elasticity and an expression in the elasticity of

foreign capital supply. The first bracketed expression, as noted in our

discussion in Section 3.A, can be viewed as a weighting factor indicating that

the optimal foreign investors' tax rate is pushed closer to the domestic

investors' tax rate as investment demand is relatively less elastic (and, hence,

the distortionary effect on investment of discouraging capital inflows is

less). The second bracketed expression in the first term indicates that this

domestic tax factor becomes less important as the elasticity of foreign capital

supply is lower.
          Similarly, the second term of p4.5) consists of the familiar "golden

rule factor" multiplied by the same expression in the elasticity of foreign

capital supply. Again, this factor becomes less important as the foreign capi-

tal supply elasticity declines.

          In turn, as the supply of capital by foreign investors becomes less

elastic, the final term, which we can call the "revenue factor" comes to domi-

nate tax policy. That is, the less elastic is the supply, the greater is the

fraction of the tax borne by the foreign investor and the higher is the optimal

tax. Thus, for instance, as the elasticity goes to zero, the optimal tax rate

approaches one.

          A simple way of viewing (1.5) is that the optimal tax is a weighted

average of the optimal tax derived in the small open economy case (given by

(3.3)) and one, with weights ek*I(l+ek*)I and l/(l+ek*)]. The government

would like to tax away all the return earned by foreign investors, but is

restrained by the foreign investors' response to tax policy. The significance

of that response determines the extent to which the government moves away from

that revenue objective and toward matching domestic tax policy and moving

toward the golden rule path, as would the government which could impose no bur-

den on foreign investors.



     B. The Optimal Tax Rates on Foreign and Domestic Investors' Incomes

          Now, suppose that the domestic tax rate is also a flexible element of

government policy and can be set jointly with t in order to improve welfare in

the steady state. The mathematical exercise is similar to those previously

carried out, so the only expressions we will report here are the basic maxirni—

zation result:

                                                 1           dr    dk*

                                                                         +
                                                                                 dr
                                                                                      +   rk*}

and the optimal tax rate expression which follows from it:


(1   .1 *t
      )                (nr(l_t))
                        (1+n)ek
                                          ek*
                                         l+ek*
                                                  +
                                                         1
                                                        l+ek*

          Similar to the result of the previous section, this expression is

readily interpretable as the weighted average of one and the optimal tax rate

previously derived for the small open economy. As discussed in Section 3.B it

also is equal to a weighted average of one and the optimal domestic tax rate

derived for the closed economy case. Expression (lt.T), then, reflects a

balancing of the desire to collect tax revenue from the returns of foreign

investors and the desire to treat domestic and foreign investors similarly in

terms of pushing of the capital stock toward the golden rule level.

          Since a major focus of this exercise is on the impact of foreign

investment on the optimal domestic tax rate, that rate is also derived. It

might be supposed, because t is available as an instrument for influencing the

level of foreign investment, that t                     would be the same as in the closed—
                                                  opt
economy case. Algebraic manipulation yields:

                       (n—r(l—t)) —           (k*/k)(1_t*(1+ek
(.8)      t0p                                         k*/k
                                   (l+n)ek +     ek
which, when combined with V4.T), does, indeed, imply that


(    9)   t      -
                 —     n-r(1-t)
           opt         (l-4-n)ek

the same conclusion as in the closed economy (and in the small open economy).

Thus, the presence of foreign investment does not alter                      the optimal     domestic
                                       —i6—



tax   policy so long as the tax rates facing foreign and domestic investors can

be differentiated.



      C. The Optimal Uniform Tax Rate on Domestic and Foreign Investors' Incomes

           Unlike the case of the small open economy, in which the optimal

domestic and foreign investor tax rates turned out to be equal even when not

constrained to be so, the revenue term in (14.1) implies an important difference

in the case of the large economy. Thus, the setting of an optimal uniform tax

rate is a distinct problem here.

           This exercise is the most interesting one in the context of our main

original question, that of the extent to which an economy open to foreign

investment would optimally select a different domestic tax policy than would a

closed economy. To simplify the presentation, we recognize that the consump-

tion derivatives are the same as given by (14.2) and (14.3),       with   t* replaced by

t. Solving for the derivative of welfare with respect to t and setting it

equal to 0 yields:


                                e +es/k*
                                 k*     s                     1
                — (n—r(i—t))1                       +
 14
            opt     (l+n)ek   1 +
                                  ek*
                                      +     es/k*       l+ek* +   es/k*

           Thus, the optimal uniform tax rate on domestic and foreign investors'

incomes exceeds the optimal tax rate for the closed economy. In particular,

the optimal rate turns out to be a weighted average of one and the closed eco-

nomy rate of tax or subsidy. The more inelastic are the supply of foreign

capital and the supply of domestic savings, the higher is the optimal tax rate.

While the former conclusion is not consistent with the prevailing wisdom, the
                                    —17—


latter is.



5.   Conclusions

          In this paper, we have examined the optimal taxation of foreign and

domestic investors' incomes. The model is a very simple one in which the only

reason for taxing capital income in the closed economy is to move the economy

closer to the golden rule rate of capital formation. Other complications could

be introduced and some additional exercises have been carried out, but the

broad outlines of optimal policy seem likely to be similar to the results

obtained consistently throughout this paper.

          The choice of an optimal capital income tax rate for the closed eco-

nomy is made to partially close the gap between the economy's undistorted

equilibrium and the golden rule. Tecause capital income taxes cause efficiency

losses, the elasticity of supply of capital is the factor (inversely)

influencing the extent to which the golden rule should be approached.

          it is something of a surprise that the optimal tax rates on both

domestic and foreign investors' incomes (when these can be set separately) in

the small open economy are identical and equal to the optimal tax rate that

would be set in the closed economy. The reason for this result is that the tax

rate on foreign investors' incomes in the small open economy is the only

instrument available to affect the level of the domestic capital stock and,

thus, move the economy toward the golden rule. The tax rate on domestic

investors' incomes, by contrast, affects only the savings rate and should be

set to avoid any unnecessary welfare losses suffered if savings were distorted.
                                        —18—


             In the lar&e open economy, the tax rate on foreign investors' incomes

alone is used to meet two objectives: approaching the golden rule as in the

small economy case but also shifting a tax burden onto foreign investors (whose

welfare is assumed not to matter). The optimal rate is simply a weighted

average of one and the small economy tax rate, with the optimal tax rate rising

toward one as foreign investment is less elastic in supply. The optimal tax

rate on domestic investment income is, again the same as in the small open eco-

nomy and the closed economy, since there is no "revenue" effect on welfare to

motivate a different outcome.

            With respect to the question of primary importance, we note that in

setting an optimal tax rate to apply to all capital income in the small open

economy, we reach the conclusion that the openness of the economy does not

matter —    the   same optimal tax rate reflecting deviations from the golden rule

prevails.

            In the large economy, by contrast, the government's optimal tax

policy is affected by the possibility of and elasticity of the inflow of

foreign capital. The optimal tax rate to be applied uniformly to capital

income turns out to be a weighted average of one and the tax rate that would be

set in the closed economy or the small open economy. That is, the optimal tax

rate is higher than that for the closed economy. An exception would be the

case of a negative doemstic elasticity of savings which exceeds, in absolute

value, the elasticity of supply of foreign capital, since the weights are

determined by the weighted sum of •the two supply elasticities. The general

conclusion is directly in contradiction to the received wisdom that the open—
                                     —19--



ness of the economy should tend to lower the optimal tax rate. In fact,

through, increased openness (an increase in the elasticity of foreign capital

supply) is associated with a lower optimal tax rate (one closer to that derived

for the closed economy), since the possibility for extracting a tax burden from

foreigners is reduced relative to the foreign investment discouraged.

          In summary, then, the openness of the large economy timatters?? but,

somewhat surprising, the openness of the small economy does not. The impact of

openness itself (that is, the presence of foreign investment) on the optimal

capital income tax does not accord with the arguments ordinarily made; but, the

extent of the openness (that is, the elasticity of foreign investment) affects

the optimal tax in a direction consistent with our intuition. Nevertheless, the

optimal tax rate remains above that derived for the closed economy.

     1. See, for example, Boadway (1919), Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980), and

Kotlikoff (198). An exception is, naturally, the literature which directly

focuses on the tax treatment of the foreign income of multinational cor—

porations. For an excellent review, see Caves (1982). An analysis to which

the current paper owes a great deal, Dutton (1982), provides another example.

However, this literature does not address the broader issues of tax policy in

the open economr.


     2. We, thus, have chosen simplicity over the richness of multi—period

specifications, such as those used by Summers (1981) and Auerbach and Kotlikoff

(1983). Our model is constructed much more in the spirit of King (1980), for

example.


     3. We also ignore such issues as the bequest motive for savings, the

possibility of technical progress, and the availability of other policies to

affect savings, as well as the welfare effects of tax policy along the path to

a new steady state. We also follow the tradition of not discounting future

generations' welfare, to simplify the algebra.
