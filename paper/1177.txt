 I. Introduction

      The adoption of floating exchange rates in the seventies was coupled with

 massive real shocks and consequently with current account imbalances. These

 phenomena have renewed interest in theories of exchange rate and current

 account determinations. Both the exchange rate, and the current account can

 be viewed as windows that provide links between different economies. Their

 role is to help to accommodate adjustment to various shocks. Their behavior

 can be understood better if the underlying internal forces affecting each

economy are traced out. Those forces are like an iceberg, whose observable

 tip is the current account and the exchange rate. Such a structure can be

summarized in reduced form equations that describe the dependence of prices

and current account on various parameters. The equations are derived from a

number of theories that explore various approaches explaining the behavior of

the exchange rate and the accumulation of foreign assets via the current

account. However, since the various reduced form equations are not always

derived explicitly from a unified framework, the connections between the

different approaches deserve further exploration. The purpose of this paper

is to derive the reduced form equations from a detailed structure of the

economy, a procedure that will give us a better understanding of the

interaction among different theories. This is done in a perfect foresight,

optimal behavior model, where the role of money Is introduced by describing

the technology of exchange. Despite the natural limitations of this

simplified model, it enables us to trace out the various channels that are

summarized by the reduced forms, explaining them in a general equilibrium

fashion.

     A necessary step In any theory of exchange rate is modeling and under-

standing the role of money. This has been the topic of Intensive research



                                     —1—
that has yielded various possible frameworks. Among them, we find the Clower

liquidity—type and the Sidrauski utility type as possible alternatives.1 The

liquidity—type models concentrate mainly on the role of money as a means of

exchange, assuming that money is a necessary means of payment in any

transaction. Helpinan and Razin recently used this approach in a theory of

exchange rates. Although the approach proved to be a useful tool, its

usefulness is limited when it comes to explaining the dependence of the

velocity of circulation on expected inflation. This dependence might be

crucial in any intertemporal model, and might provide a possible link between

future expected policies and current prices. The utility approach (adopted by

Sidrauski) includes real balances as a component of the utility function in

addition to the physical consumption of each good. It provides a useful

framework in analyzing inflationary effects; however, critics of this approach

have found it unsatisfactory because of the lack of economic motivation for

treating real balances in a fashion similar to consumer goods.

     The purpose of this study is to employ a modified approach to modeling

the use of money that takes advantage of the insights of the above two

approaches. Instead of using real balances as a component of the utility

function, this approach uses a utility function that depends on leisure and

consumption of consumer goods. The primary role of real balances is to enable

more efficient exchange and trade and in so doing to save costly resources.

Those resources might include time and capital, which would be used to

coordinate various transactions. To simplify exposition, the paper studies

the case where the exchange is time intensive.2 A possible way of capturing

this notion is by assuming that leisure is a decreasing function of the

velocity of circulation, that is, a function whose nature depends on the

technologyof. exchange. The paper demonstrates the potential usefulness of



                                     —2—
this approach by employing it to analyze the determinations of exchange rate,

current account, terms of trade and real interest rate. The model is

developed in Section II; Section III analyzes prices and current account

determinations, and Section IV closes the paper with concluding remarks.



II. The Model

     Assume a two country world, where each country specializes in production

of one good. To simplify exposition, the analysis concentrates on the case of

two periods, where the case of n periods could be analyzed in a similar

fashion vithout changing the main results. To facilitate the discussion, the

analysis is conducted in terms of a representative consumer. Consumers share

the same tastes. They might differ, however, in their endowment. A typical

consumer in the home country lives two periods. His utility depends on

consumption of goods X and Y, as well as on leisure:



                                                                 (1)
     u(x0, Y, L) + pU(x1, Y1, L1)


where X, Yj, Li are consumption of goods X, Y, and leisure in period I     (i=O,

1) and p is the rate of time preference. A typical consumer in the home
country is endowed in the beginning of period i with      units of good X,.

where good X is the home—produced good. At the beginning of period i, our

consumer is also provided with      extra money balances, via a transfer

mechanism. This mechanism is analogous to printing money, and is exogenously

given. Within each period exchange occurs and allows the home consumers to

trade the domestic product (x) with the foreign good (Y). The two goods are

nonstorable, and the consumer can carry wealth from period 0 to 1 only by

bonds (domestic and/or foreign) and money balances. Those bonds are issued in
 period 0, where debt repayment occurs in period 1. The exchange of goods is

 facilitated by the use of money or by time to coordinate transactions: the

 consumer can save on the use of real balances by spending more time on

 coordinating various transactions. This trade—off Is assumed to be described

 by:



         =                           (1=0,1), where              (2)
             L(vi)

       v =   (x1 ' 'x,i +   •pii               0




       and P,j are the prices of goods x and y in period I, and Xj and Yj

 correspond to the consumption of the various goods by the consumer in period

 1. v1 is the value of the velocity of money in period I. It describes the

 intensity of the use of money (N) relative to expenditure. Eq. 2 states that

 higher intensity of using money balances enables one to save resources and

 reduce the time needed to co—ordinate various transactions.3 During the

 analysis it is assumed that foreign exchange is not used in circulation. Our

 economy is characterized by consumers who are distributed In various

 locations, and face the problem of coordinating their transactions. The

 underlying structure of the economy is that of markets centralized only for

 financial transactions (bonds) and for the exchange of goods and bonds across

 borders. There is no centralized exchange of goods among consumers. Such an

 exchange is facilitated by shopping time and the use of money balances. Eq.    2


 provides the reduced form for such a system. The asymmetry between financial

 transactions and the exchange of goods among consumers is reflected in the

 specification of the velocity of money, which is defined only for transactions

• that involve consumption. The approach described In the paper can also be



                                      —4—
adapted for the case where money is needed to coordinate bond transactions.

The assumption that foreign exchange is not circulated can be relaxed, to

allow for simultaneous demand for both currencies. One way to proceed is to

consider a more symmetrical framework, in which foreign money is needed to

facilitate transactions involving foreign goods.4 Another asymmetry in the

model is the assumption that a change in velocity affects leisure, the latter

does not affect output. Those assumptions are made in order to simplify

exposition. The appendix describes the case in which the level of production

depends inversely on the amount of leisure. This allows us to analyze

endogenous output fluctuations within an intertemporal open economy model.5

lit is shown that the determinants of the current account are also the

determinants of the intertemporal allocation of leisure. The problem facing a

typical home consumer is described by:

period. ej corresponds to the exchange rate in period i (price of foreign

currency in terms of home currency), where B0 and e0. B0 are the purchases of

domestic and foreign bonds in period 0 by our consumer. Negative values of B

correspond to borrowing position. The initial endowment in period 0


(P ' +                  is   given by the market value of the endowment of the domestic

good, plus the money balances (j) that are transferred to the consumer at

the beginning of the period. This endowment is used to finance the consump-

tion in period 0, the purchase of domestic and foreign bonds, and the hoarding

of money (M0) used to facilitate transactions. The initial money balances in

the next period are given by             +          , where               is the exogenous transfer

that has taken place at period 1.

     Debt repayment takes place at the beginning of period 1, providing our

consumer with B0 (1+R) + BO* (1+R*) e1, where R and                              are the domestic and

foreign interest rates.6 The left—hand side in eq. 3b is the budget

constraint in period 1, and it is composed of the initial money balances, the

value of the bonds, and the market value of the endowment of the domestic

good. This budget is used to finance consumption and the hoarding of money

balances (N1). It is assumed that transaction costs are nil, thus arbitrage

ensures that:



     e(1+R) =                                                                            (4)
                      e1(1+R*)

     The foreign country is populated by consumers whose tastes are identical

to those of the home country's consumers, however they produce only good Y.

Thus, the motivation for international trade comes from differences in

production basket and from a potential difference in the intertemporal

distribution of income across countries. The first gives rise to trade in

goods, the second to trade in securities. The problem of a typical consumer

in both the foreign country and the home country can be described

symmetrically: Choose for the foreign country consumer

III. Prices and Current Account Determination

        To   gain further insight into the determinations of prices and current
account,     let us specialize the model by assuming the following log additively

separable utility function:



               (x0)             (y)1_Y'
        mt                  +             +
                   1—i          1—-f          6•ln(L0)
                                                                                (7)
                         )1_1    ( y1
     + p(ln( (x1            +                 +
                                                  Sln(L1))
              1—i                 1—y



where I < 1, and p is the rate of time preferences.
    The choice of the utility function is motivated by its ability to provide
an interesting and traceable explanation for current account and money market
behavior 8
     The problem facing each consumer is to maximize utility subject to the
given    technology of exchange (L(v)). The result of this process enables us,

using world budget constraints, to determine all prices and the current

account.

     The next step is to solve the consumer problem (eq. 3 and 6) for the

utility function given by eq. 7. It is clear that the solution for our consumer

of this problem depends on the realized values of variables specific to him

(like          ,
                           To gain further insight, let us present the solution as a

function of aggregate values. This is done by aggregating the first order

conditions across all the consumers of each country. Due to the nature of our

framework, the only effect of this aggregation is that the sum of Mi across

all the consumers can be identified with the supply of money in period i,

which is given by               and       +       in   period zero and one, respectively. From

this point on, all variables stand for the aggregate consuuiers in each

country. To simplify, let us use the following notation:

      = P                     =    the      terms of trade in period 1.
           y, i/P x,



                    =         P +Y                 .P                = money expenditure in period i (in the home

output (in terms of period 1). Similar notation applies for the foreign

country. Notice that the aggregation across all the consumers yields that:



                =   i(1-i-R) +                 .                                                         (8)


Thus, W1 corresponds to the wealth of the home country, defined in money terms

prevailing in the second period. Using this notation, the first order

conditions for each country provide us with the following information:

        Eq. 9a describes the velocity of money in period o. It depends on three

considerations: the interest rate, the technology of exchange and the

relative importance of leisure versus consumption in the utility function.

The higher the interest rate the higher the opportunity cost of money,

motivating the substitution of real balances with time. The greater the

techno1ogica1 substitutability between time and real balances () ,                                           the

greater the use of real balance and the lower the velocity. The greater the

importance of leisure relative to consumption                                      )   , the smaller the

velocity, because it             increases        the weight that the consumer gives to the gain

in time induced by higher real balances.9 Eq. 9c describes the equilibrium

money interest rate. It corresponds positively to the rate of printing money

(ii),   and negatively to the rate of time preference. Eq. 9 d—e give the demand
for the goods, and eq. 9 f—g describe the dependence of nominal expenditure on

the time preference rate, the interest rate, and wealth. Notice that


                                                            —10—
condition 9a implies that to avoid a corner solution the substitutability

between time and real balances (B) should be less than                            1—i     .    During
the course of the analysis we assume a non—corner solution. Notice that the

terms 8 and q depend on the elasticity of leisure with respect to the

velocity of money. To simplify exposition, we take the case in which those

elasticities are assumed to be time—invariant and equal for both countries.

Thus                    =        =       =8   ,   and q =        1. 10 The contemporary world

supply constraint implies that,



               =
                   x+4;          =       + 4 for      1=0,1.                            (10)




These constraints, together with the equilibrium conditions (9) and the law of

one price yield the solution for relative prices (terms of trade):

       Let       us denote by Z the relative world supply of the two goods in period

relative prices (11) we get:

The evolution of the price of X over time depends upon the relative supply of
  x
X(—2—), the rate of time preference (p) and printing money (j), and a

measure of the relative intertemporal distribution of output across countries

 first term) as well as real factors (summarized by the second term). Notice

 that higher initial money supply (N) increases prices in both periods at the

 same rate (for a given p).                             A higher rate of printing money in period 1

 (higher ji)           is   going to increase prices in both periods. The reason is that

 higher u is associated with higher cost of using money balances in period o,

 resulting in lower demand for real balances. For given initial nominal

balances (M0), prices should go up to equate the demand to the supply of real

balances. The actual increase in nominal balances in period 1 is responsible

for higher prices in that period. Higher output tends to reduce money prices

because it implies higher demand for real balances (higher output increases

wealth, inducing higher consumption and higher demand for real balances due to

more transactions). This analysis could be conducted using the wealth of each

nation as the explanatory variable, where wealth itself is endogenously

determined by the output stream. Combining eq. 11 and 14 gives us that:

     Thus, the exchange rate depends upon monetary considerations, summarized

by the first component, and real considerations, summarized by the second

component. An increase in the relative home/foreign money supply (M/N*)

induces a depreciation at the same rate. Increase in the rate of future

growth of the money supply anticipated today (ii)      results   in a current

depreciation. The above results emphasize the dependence of current prices on

expectations of future policies, a point that is highlighted by the various

assets approaches to exchange rate determination. Although the above results

are derived from a detailed structure of the model under discussion in this

paper, they can also be derived from a variety of models of exchange rate

determination that are likely to share a similar reduced form.12         A possible

channel by which anticipation of future policies could affect current exchange

rate can be described in the following way: an increase in the rate of future

growth of the money supply, anticipated today, induces a higher domestic

interest rate and a lower demand for real balances. For given nominal

balances it induces current depreciation and higher domestic prices. In a

similar way, an increase in present or future output (anticipated today)

induces appreciation.

     Notice that for a given rate of future money supply growth (ii)        , higher
   is equivalent to a "permanent" increase in money supply. To study the

effects of a "transitory" increase in the money supply we should impose the

condition that di0 > 0 comes with d(i0 .    .i) = 0,   implying that the transitory

Increase comes with a lower interest rate. The first effect (d > 0)

induces current depreciation; the second effect (du < 0) implies current

appreciation. With the help of eq. 16 we see that for the case studied in

this paper the net effect of a transitory increase in the money supply is a

lower interest rate and depreciation. Recall that the effect of a higher rate



                                     —14—
of future Increase in the money supply (11)                                      implies   a higher interest rate and

depreciation. Thus, we can conclude that the sign of the correlation between

movements of interest rates and exchange rates is ambiguous, depending on the

nature and the permanence of the monetary shocks.

     An alternative presentation of the exchange rate can highlight the role

of wealth in exchange rate determination. Defining real wealth by

     An increase In real wealth in the home country Induces appreciation.

Higher real wealth is associated with higher consumption and more transac-

tions. This implies higher demand for domestic real balances, inducing

appreciation. This result conforms with the predictions of the asset approach

presented by Branson et al., Kouri, and other writers.

     The current account in period o corresponds to the excess of current

Income over the current absorption. Using the previous results we get that

the real current account surplus (in terms of output price) is given by:

     The current account behavior depends on the relative intertemporal

                          xl        Yl


(and income) is more biased to the present relative to the foreign country.

In such a case, the current account is the channel which enables intertetnporal

shifting of resources across countries in order to provide a more desirable

distribution of consumption. A current account surplus in period 0 enables

the home country to shift resources to the future, that is, to the less

favorable period (in relative terms). Notice that starting with a balanced

current account, a "permanent" Increase in output (X and           going up at the

same rate) has no effect, whereas a transitory output shock (increase only in

    or in )     , will   induce a shift in resources via the current account (and

the world capital market) to the less favorable period (In relative terms).'5

     Using eq. 16", we can conclude that output expansion (in the present or

the future) implies appreciation in both periods due to higher real wealth.

This appreciation, however, is associated with current account surplus in

period o only to the extent that the output expansion is biased to the

present. This result diverges from the predictions of the framework used by

Branson et al., which assumed that an increase in wealth should be accompanied

by present accumulation of foreign assets.



                                          —16—
    Notice that real shocks might result in correlated changes between

exchange rate, current account and terms of trade.'6 This result is in

agreement with Mussa and Stockman's findings. The nature of this correlation

depends, however, on the timing, location, and permanency of these shocks.

Moreover, there is no clear—cut sign for these correlations. For example,

present domestic output expansion induces negative correlation between the

present exchange rate and current account (current account surplus +

appreciation);           whereas future domestic output expansion (anticipated today)

results in positive correlation today (current account deficit ÷

appreciation). In the first case we get appreciation and deterioration in the

terms of trade, while in the second case the appreciation comes with no change

in the terms of trade.

    A two—country model also enables us to analyze the determinations of real

interest rates and how they affect the current account. Define the real

interst rate in terms of good Z(Z = X,Y) by



     1+r z               P
                             1 /P

     Since consumption at time zero corresponds to a fraction 1/(1+ p) of real

wealth, defined by the term In the bracket, it will adjust to transitory

income to the degree that transitory income affects wealth (and permanent

income). This outcome is the familiar proposition of the permanent income

hypothesis. The role of the current account is to bridge the gap between

current income and consumption. It can be presented by

resulting in a higher expected price inflation in terms of X, which in turn

tends to depress r. The same argument works in the opposite direction for Y,

mitigating the reduction in r that is induced by dX0 > 0. As can be seen

from eq. 22, the Increase in saving at home results in an increase in the

current account surplus of the home country. This is because the direct

income effect of d > 0 dominates the substitution effect of lower r. The

first effect favors increase in net savings; the second favors lower savings.

For the foreign country, the output stays the same and, therefore, the sub-

stitution effect has the dominant influence resulting in a higher dis—

saving. Thus, the adjustment of real interest rates ensures that the current

account Improvement in the home country is matched by an equal deterioration

of the current account in the foreign country.

IV. Concluding Remarks

     The above analysis constructed a two—period, two—country model that

derives the current account, the exchange rate, the terms of trade, and real

interst rates from optimal behavior principles. The model uses money mainly

as a means of exchange, where the technology of exchange is flexible due to

potential substitutability of time and real balances as means of coordinating

transactions. This framework is helpful in deriving the reduced forms of

prices and current account which result from the optimizing behavior of

economic agents in each economy.


                                       —19--
    The analysis demonstrates that a useful way of understanding the current

account is by concentrating on net saving decisions.   The current account

function is to enable more desirable intertemporal allocation of resources

across countries. Thus, it depends on the (relative) difference of the

intertemporal distribution of output and income across countries. The effect

of various real shocks on the current account depends on the timing and

permanence of these shocks. The study of the exchange rate determinations

demonstrates that a useful way of analyzing the exchange rate is by consider-

ing the effects of various policies on the excess demand for money in each

country. The results of this analysis are in agreement with the monetary

approach.

     The nature of general equilibrium analysis enables us to specify the

exchange rate also as a function of wealth, in a way that is consistent with

the contributions of Branson and others. Studying the Interaction between

prices and current account emphasizes that real shocks might induce a

correlated change In the exchange rate, current account, and terms of trade.

The nature of this correlation depends, however, on the timing, permanency,

and geographical origin of those shocks. The above discussion results in a

framework that integrates elements of net saving theories and the monetary

approach into a unified structure in which the different approaches are

complementary viewpoints.

     The purpose of this appendix is to generalize the paper's framework in

two dimensions. First, we consider the case of endogenous labor supply

determinations. This will allow us to trace the interaction between financial

considerations and the production decision in the context of an open

economy. Next, the last section of the appendix presents the general case to

which the main results derived in the paper apply.

     Let us make two assumptions: first let us take the case of a small

country and second, let us assume the country has a Ricardian production

technology. Both assumptions are made in order to allow of a simple reduced

from solution. The approach considered can, however, be extended to the case

of a large country with diminishing marginal productivity technology. Suppose

that the small country specializes in producing X, with an output given by:



        =                       0,1);
            a        Lxt(t =                                      (Al)




where a summarizes the input—output coefficient at time t. The time spent on

exchange activities at time t is given by:




     f(v) ,     f'   > 0                                          (A2)




Thus, leisure is given by


            —              Xt
    LL_f(v )——.                                                   (A3)

    The problem facing our consumer is to choose {x ,      , Mi            in


                                         —21—
such a way as to maximize his utility function subject to the budget

constraint given by eq. 3 , where leisure is given by A3. Let us assume that

the utility function is the same as that used in the paper. Thus, the problem

facing our consumer differs from the one analyzed in the paper In two

dimensions: First, the endowment is solved endogenously, due to the trade—off

between output and leisure. Next, the leisure is now a function of both the

velocity and the output level. Thus, eq. A3 replaces eq. 2. The first order

conditions for the small country provide us with the information summarized by

eq. 9 (applied only for the home country). The endogenous choice of

             gives us two extra conditions:


     L               (1+r x) p

where X =             1_;61            and n       is   the leisure—velocity elasticity. As in the

paper, we assume for notational simplicity that n                          is   time invariant.

     Notice that interest rate parity and the law of one price imply that:


                              *
     1+rx                = 1+R
                                   *   =1+r*x                                             (A6)
                              1+•Tt
                                   x


where

                 x    (*x,1/*x,o)_                                                        (A7)




     Thus, the small country is faced with exogenously given rates of return

in terms of each good. From A6 and eq. 9 we get:



        1 +              =     +p                                                         (A8),

     Inflation, as measured in output terms, goes up with the rate of monetary

expansion.                                                                                          Eq.

A8 implies also the existence of a negative correlation between inflation and

real interest rates (all in terms of a given good). This reflects the fact
                                                     o1Iy
that the money interest rate (R) depen u and p.

      a in eq. A4 corresponds to the rate of technology improvement. This

equation states that if the discounted real interest rate (in product terms)

exceeds the rate of technology improvement, we will favor future leisure (L1)

over the leisure in period zero (L0). Comparing eq. A4 to eq. 22 reveals that

the determinants of intertemporal distribution of leisure are also the

determinants of the current account in the previous framework (notice that the

intertemporal technology ratio (a1/a0) replaces the intertemporal output

ratio (X1/X)). That is because both the current account and the inter—

temporal leisure decisions serve the same end:interteniporal re—distribution of

utility. From eq. (A4) — (A5) we get the reduced form solution for the supply

of labor:

improvement, and lower inflation anticipated in period zero favor inter—

     The underlying forces shaping the current account and prices are similar

to the ones shaping them in the paper. The new aspect of endogenous

production decisions Is in allowing us to trace the allocative effects of

inflation on the supply of output. Inspection of eq. A15 reveals that a

higher inflation (due to d i > 0) anticipated today will deteriorate the

current account, because of the intertemporal re—distribution of output. A

higher anticipated inflation will cause a depreciation and a current price

increase because of both interest rate and wealth effects. The resultant

higher money interest rate will create a drop in the demand for money, causing

depreciation and a current price increase. This adjustment Is further

strengthened by the drop in real wealth, (dw/di < 0), which further reduces

the demand for real money balances.

    The case studied in the paper corresponds to a specific utility

function. The purpose of this section is to present the general case to which

the main results derived in the paper apply. This is the case where the

nominal expenditure In each period depends only on nominal wealth, money

interest rate, and the time preference rate. The demand for money is

described by a functional dependence of the velocity on the interest rate.

The composition of expenditure on different goods in each period depends only

on the prices of the different goods in the given period.

    Using the notation of the paper, such a system is described by:

            =                  • L.Q(L)                                   (A23)
                M
                 0


where S =
                 g(Q(L1))/g(Q(Z0)),


 s =                     I
                                              =   '
        [1—g(Q(L1))          /[1—g(Q(R0))],


       With the help of eq. A21 — A23, it can be shown that the main results of

the paper hold for this system as well.

1.   This list is far from being exhaustive. Among several other approaches

     we find the overlapping generation approach and transaction demand.



2.   For a related study see Dornbusch and Frenkel. They model the exchange

     activity to highlight the issue of inflation and growth, where the

     exchange of goods is facilitated by money balances, labors and capital.



3.   This approach can be viewed as an example of modeling the use of money

     as a means of saving transaction costs, where those costs are time spent

     in coordinating transactions. For a related study see Karni. A crude

     example of a system that will result in a functional form described In

     eq. 2 is the case where each consumer is facing a uniform flow of

     receipts, which are accumulated in his bank account. Let us assume that

     he also faces a uniform flow of expenditure, which can be financed only

     by cash balances. If each bank transaction consumes CF time, he will

     spend at least CF • v   time (per period) in coordinating transactions.



4.   This strategy is used by Helpman and Razin for the case of a rigid

     velocity. For a discussion of currency substitution in a Sidrauski type

     model see Llviatan (1981). For simplicity of exposition the current

     paper proceeds by neglecting the possibility of currency substitution.

     Thus, the exchange rate is set indirectly according to implicit goods

     arbitrage conditions. Extending the framework for the case of currency

     substitution will modify the analysis in two ways. First, the velocity

     of each currency will depend also on contemporaneous relative prices of

     goods, whereas in our case the velocity of money will be shown to be


                                   —27—
     independent of them. Next, under currency substitution the relative

     demand for each good at a given period will depend also on the velocity

     of the various monies, whereas In our case the relative demand for the

     goods will depend only on the goods' relative price.



5.   The current paper's framework can be extended to allow also for

     Investment and for a production process that uses other Inputs (like oil

     and capital). Such an extension will cause the production path, prices,

     and the current account to depend also on the price path of those

     inputs. For an analysis of those topics in the context of a real model

     see Sach. On the output effects of money, introduced through changes in

     leisure, see Claassen.



6.   The assumption of no initial indebtedness in period 0 could be

     generalized without changing the main results.



7.   The assumption of identical rates of time preference for both countries

     can be relaxed, allowing the current account ot dend also on

     differences in taste. This was done in the context of rigid velocity by

     Helpman and Razin.



8.   Analysis of a two—period current account behavior in a real model of a

     small economy based upon additively separable utility can be found in

     Sachs. Another related study is Helpman and Razin. They use a Cobb

     Douglas version of the utility function in a Clover type model. The

     approach adapted in this paper could be applied for their analysis as

     well. The utility function in eq. 7 is preferred because it provides a

     more interesting theory of the current account than the Cobb Douglas case.


                                   —28-
9.    Notice that because the analysis is conducted In two periods there is no

      future" In period 1. Thus, the velocity in period 1 (eq. 9) lacks a

      measure of future inflation. It could be shown that in a model with n

      periods, n > 2, in period k(k < n) exists                  =          •


      and
            =          (1+Rk+l). Thus 9a represents the more general expression
                Rk+I
      for the velocity (for k < n). The main results of the paper could be

      generalized for the case of n       2    periods.




10.   The main results of the current paper are not affected by this

      assumption. The condition needed to generate the paper's results can be

      expressed as:


                                                     L ,V

                            11   +.J,v+
                                     00 °•(v—1)           0


         This condition ensures that _a> 0.


11.   Notice that this exercise does not change the interest rate, which

      depends only on the time preference rate and monetary considerations.
                                                 x                   *
      Another   way to increase S (for given _2_)         is   by cl?1 < 0 (for a given

                The above analysis applies for tAis case as well.



12.   For further discussion of these points, and detailed references, see

      Frenkel (1981). For discussions of related reduced form see Bilson,

      Dornbusch (1978), Nussa, Sachs, and the studies in Frenkel and Johnson.

                                   and w =       (1+pS*).


14.   Notice that the assumption of price flexibility implies that the real

      current account is free from monetary considerations. Equivalent

      definition of the current account is as the net export of goods and

      services plus transfers and net factor payments from abroad. Our

      assumption of no initial indebtness implies that net interest payments

      in period zero are nil.



15.   This result is in accord with Sachs and the predictions of the permanent

      income and life cycle hypothesis.



16.   The   above results and the model presented in this paper should be viewed
      as intermediate—run. This is the run over which prices are flexible and

      aggregate demand effects on output may     be ignored. In the short run,

      price inflexibility and demand effects on output can induce a different

      structure of correlations between prices and current account. The

      analysis of the current account behavior is in accord with Svensson and

      Razln's contribution, which provides a general analysis of the Laursen

      Metzler effect in a real model.




17.   In the context of n periods,          2, d i > 0 is equivalent to an

      increase in the rate of monetary expansion for one period.
