               The Corporate Cost of Capital in Japan and the U.S.:
                                  A Cortparison



                                    ABSTRACT




       This
          paper presents evidence about the coats of corporate
capital in Japan and the US, for a sample of large companies, and
evaluates a variety of hypotheses about why the cost might be lower
in Japan.
     We find that the before-tax return to capital in Japan appears
slightly lower than in the U.S. when corrected book measures of
earnings are used, but that this result would be reversed if market
returns to Japanese equity were used in place of corrected earnings
to measure the cost of equity.
     To whatever extent the cost of capital may actually be lower in
Japan, we show that. this is unlikely to be due either to a lower
overall corporate tax burden or the particular tax advantages of
corporate borrowing.

      1. Introduction



      Very high real interest rates and a trade deficit that exceeded
 100 billion dollars in 1984 have caused much concern over the

 ability of American firms to keep up with their foreign competitors.
A greet deal of the discussion of this topic has focused

particularly on Japan, since Japan alone accounted for a large
fraction of this enormous overall 1984 trade deficit through its

success in exporting to the U.S. goods once supplied primarily by
domestic producers.

     Attempts to explain this favorable Japanese performance have
taken many forms. Some have suggested that Japan may impose
barriers to American firms' attempts at establishing markets, either

through explicit policy actions, or collusion among government,
producers, distributors end banks, or a lack of faith in the quality
of U.S.-produced goods. Others have argued that the U.S. trade
imbalance is the inevitable result of our elevated real exchange

rate, which makes American goods more expensive than those of our
trading partners. This high real exchange rate is, in turn,
attributed by many to the unprecedented peacetime fiscal deficits
currently being experienced.

     While each of these potential explanations may be important,
there is a third on which we focus in this paper: the cost of

capital. Some have suggested1 that Japanese firms en-ioy a lower
before-tax cost of raising funds in capital markets that   allows theni
                                    2




--   to   gain a competitive advantage in the capital intensive industries
     where they have made particularly striking progress during the past
     two decades, such as autos and steel.
           This explanation is not entirely independent of those already
     mentioned. The mechanism through which the high real exchange rate

     is supposed to have occurred is the strong foreign demand for U.S.
     assets brought on by high domestic real interest rates; one of the
     forms of Japanese industrial policy is said to work through the

     direction of funds to promising enterprises. There are, however,
     many additional factors that could contribute to a cost of capital
     differential between the two countries. The purpose of this paper

     is to state clearly what these might be, and adduce evidence that
     will shed light on their validity. Something more than claims of
     unfair competition should be required as evidence before such a

     complex proposition as a major difference in capital cost is

     accepted as a "fact." Hence. we begin with some basic calculations
     for our sample of Japanese and American firms to see whether there
     is convincing prima facie evidence of a lower cost of capital in

     Japan.
           Our approach involves the use of market arid financial statement

     data for a representative but non-random sample of 19 American and
     21 Japanese firma to answer first the question of whether the cost

     of capital really has been systematically lower in Japan.
           In the case of an affirmative answer, our next step is to test
     predictions based on different theories of why these costs differ.
     Because we consider only a small sample of firms, our results must

     be regarded with caution in extrapolating to economy—wide
     conclusions. Nevertheless, we consider this to be an important.

 first step in determining where further research should be directed.


    2. Is the Cost of Capital Lower in Japan?



     For several reasons, one cannot simply look at the real interest
 rates in the U.S. end Japan to determine what the cost of capital is
 in each country. Because of differences in tax treatment, financial
 policies and legal end financial institutions, to cite Just some of
 the complicating factors, there is no simple way to translate an
 interest rate into a relevant measure of the cost of capital without
additional information.

     One alternative approach is to look at total before-tax returns
to debt and equity over a period of several years. A still simpler

approach is to look exclusively at equity alone by examining

earnings—price ratios. In each case, one assumes that, over a
sufficiently long period of time, these ex post measures reflect
their ex ante expectations. There are several problems with such
measures of which we are well aware, but they are frequently used
and cited and easy to calculate, making their presentation a good
place to begin our empirical analysis.

    Listed in the first column of Tables la end lj are the names of
the American and Japanese firms used in our study. The second
column of each table lists total market value of debt plus equity at
the end of the company's 1981 fiscal year.

     Our selection criteria included availability of data, firm
size, and coverage of important industries. For each country, we
have one representative of the airline industry (Delta Airlines arid
All Nippon Airways) and two retailers (Sears and Macy's, Mitsukoshi.

and Takashimaya) .   In   steel, cameras end film, and consumer

products, we have one American and two Japanese firms (U.S. Steel.
Kawasaki Steel and Nippon Steel; Kodak, Fuji Film and Konishiroku
Photo; Procter and Gamble. Kao Soap and Lion). In the automobile
industry, we include all three major companies (GM, Ford and
Chrysler) because of differences in their recent experience.      We

include only Nissan from Japan because the largest producer, Toyota,
underwent a malor merger during the sample period that makes its

date difficult to use.
    In the consumer and business electronics area, we include
General Electric for the U.S. and Sony, National (Matsushita) and
Toshiba for Japan. Companies in the computer and semiconductor
industries include IBM, Control Data, Digital Equipment and National
Semiconductor for the U.S. and Fujitsu, NEC and Oki Electric for

Japan. There is a substantial amount of overlap in the areas of
business of these two groups of companies.
    Drug and pharmaceutical companies included in the sample from

the U.S. are Merck and Pfizer, while Shinogi. and Teisho are included
for Japan. In the related chemical industry, we have Dow Chemical
and Mitsubishi Chemical, Sumitomo Chemical and Takeda Chemical.

Finally, although we do not have any suitable Japanese counterparts.
we include AT&T and Exxon in the sample of U.S. firms because of

their importance.
    Data for the Japanese companies come primarily from the NEEDS -

Nikkei Financial Tape. This data file is based on public balance
sheet and income statement information provided by the companies on
an annual basis. Our version of the file extends from 1964 to 1983,
with individual companies having data either for 1964-82 or 1965-83
                                    7




 depending on their fiscal years.

       For the United States, we use Standard and Poor's Compustat
 file which has comparable date for the American companies from 1963

 to 1982. with most companies having data from 1963-81 or 1963-82,
 depending on their fiscal years. The two exceptions are DEC end
 National Semiconductor, for which data is not available before 1966.
     In Tables la arid    lj,   we also report average rates of return for
 each company for the period 1966-81, including the before-tax
 earnings—price ratio end the total before-tax return to debt plus
equity. For purposes of computing the latter statistic, we add
 interest payments to earnings to obtain the total return to capital.
Debt is defined for each country to be the sum of long-term debt and

short-term financial liabilities. Thus, although we include
financial trade credit, we exclude the general category of accounts
payable from debt. One exception to this rule is "accrued
employees' severance indemnities", which we do exclude from debt.
In the third column of Table lj, we report the size of this account,
which we shall hereafter refer to as "Pension Reserves. Columns 4
and 5 arid   6 and   7 in Table lj show how much difference the exclusion
of this item makes in the earnings price ratio and the total return
on capital. In the remainder of this paper, we exclude this account
from debt unless otherwise noted.

     From these tables there is only mixed evidence in support of
the proposition that Japanese firms enjoy a lower cost of capital.
If one concentrates on total returns to capital, there are some

industries in which Japanese firms have a substantially lower return

(e.g., airlines, steel, and, excluding Chrysler, which should be
considered a special case because of its near bankruptcy, autos)
                                8




but others in which the reverse is true (e.g., pharmaceuticals)   arid


many in which there is no clear pattern. For the U.S. sample of
companies, the median average return to capital for the period was

10.3 percent, while it was 9.5 percent for the Japanese sample, and

10.3 percent with the correction made for pension reserve
accounting. Given the size of our sample, this does not constitute
very strong evidence that returns are systematically lower in Japan.


     3. Corrected Measures of the Return to Capital


      There are many problems with the use of book value earnings

data to measure the cost of capital. Perhaps the most serious is
the distortion caused by inflation to book value measures of
income.3 Because of the general lack of inflation adjusted
financial data, we must make such corrections ourselves to the book

value information. This is especially important for a cross—country
comparison, since historical patterns of the rate of inflation in

the two countries are substantially different and accounting
practices, debt equity ratios and tax structures, three factors that

affect the relationship among inflation, profitability and
accounting biases, are also markedly different. The most critical
distortions to remove are the misstatement of depreciation and the
cost of goods sold and the absence of any accounting for real gains
and losses on nominal liabilities arid assets. Given the nature of

the data for each country, certain assumptions must be made in order

to carry   out each of these   three corrections. These are described

as   we discuss   how the corrections were performed.

        3a. Depreciation



        We assume that depreciation would be properly measured in the

 absence of inflation. This reflects our fervent belief less than
 our inability to assume otherwise.         To restate depreciation based
 on original cost in current dollar terms requires information on the

 vintage structure of each year's overall depreciation, since the
 price factor by which book depreciation must be inflated depends on
the age of the asset to which the depreciation applies. We produce
an estimated vintage structure in the following manner.4 We first

assume that the net (of depreciation) capital stock listed in the
first year requires no correction. This is reasonable, given, the
low rates of inflation in both countries in the years immediately

preceding the mid-1960s. We then assume that each corporation's
depreciable assets are written off using the declining balance

method at a single rate. Finally, using the perpetual inventory
method, we solve for the value of this rate that would yield the
listed book value for net capital in the last year for which data

are available. That is, the declining balance rate, c, is defined
implicitly by:


        (1)
               T
                   =   K
                           o   *(l T 1(l)T1 +   ...
                                                      T


where         is the book value of net capital at the end of year t and
   is the book value of gross investment during year t.       Since all
these values of I and K are positive, the solution for       is unique.
There are additional problems presented by each country's data set.
For Japan, there are no separate figures listed for gross
                                  10




    investment. We impute an investment series from the sum of
    depreciation and the first difference of the net capital stock. For

    the U.S., there are no separate figures for land arid depreciable
    assets, only the sum. This should lower the estimate of the average
    depreciation rate, since land is nondepreciable.    In addition, the

-   treatment   of assets acquired through merger rather than direct

    investment is inconsistent; they appear in the capital stock, but

    are not in reported investment.5     We performed calculations for the

    U.S. using both reported investment and, as was necessary for Japan.

    imputed investment. Estimated values of      were generally lower end

    more reasonable (given previous estimates) when imputed investment
    was used. Because of this, as well as to be as consistent as
    possible in our methodologies for the two countries, we present

    calculations based on imputed rather than actual investment.       This

    generally leads to a somewhat higher estimate of the overall return
    to capital (in the neighborhood of 1 percentage point before-tax)
    than when actual investment is used. The depreciation rates are
    interesting in their own right, and are given in the second column

    of Tables 2a and 2j. The variation across companies is consistent
    with general expectations. Firms in the computer industry, for

    example. evidence very rapid rates compared to retailers, whose
    capital is largely in the form of buildings.
        It is difficult to know how much the generally more rapid
    depreciation rates for Japan are due to the omission of land from

    the calculations.6     To the extent that this does not completely

    explain the difference, one might hypothesize that some of the gap
    in rates of return in the two countries lies in different procedures

    for measuring depreciation.

     With these estimated rates of economic depreciation, we went

 beck and estimated current dollar capital stocks using the
 expression:


      (2)
               T
                   = P
                         T
                             *}o (18)TJ 01
                                         +1 (18)T1/p1   .   . . I T/PT

where Pt is a price index (the gross national expenditure deflator
for Japan and the gross domestic business product deflator for the

U.S.). Depreciation in year t is estimated to be 8*Kctl, and the
difference between this measure arid the listed book measure is
subtracted from earnings.


    3b. Inventories



    Companies can use any one of several accounting methods for all
or part of their inventories and can shift from one method or

combination of methods to another. Japanese firms list all methods
used in each year for each stage of fabrication (materials, work in

process, and finished goods). U.S. firms also include information
on which method is the most common, but information is not broken
down by stages of fabrication.

    In the presence of inflation, only a system of indexed FIFO

(First-In, First-Out) inventory accounting would correctly state the
cost of goods sold in current dollars. Though this system is not in
use, the same outcome occurs under the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)
method in the absence of relative price changes or decumuition of

inventories. All other major methods syatemetically understate the
cost of goods sold in the presence of inflation. Hence, this
                                   14



correction will reduce measured returns to capital, potentially more
for the U.S., which has experienced more inflation than Japan in the

past two decades.
    The algorithm used to restate the cost of goods sold proceeds as
follows. First, we assume that firms use a combination of FIFO.

LIFO and Average Cost accounting in each year. Other methods listed
(such as Specific Cost) are assigned to whichever of these three

major methods they most closely resemble, in our judgement.
    Based on stated methods, we estimate, for Japan. the fraction of
inventories carried under each method in each year. We then average
these fractions over the sample period to obtain for each firm a
single fraction corresponding to each of the three methods.

Finally, we divide book inventories into three categories based on

these fractions, and adjust each separately in a manner appropriate
for the accounting method.
    Our approach for the U.S. differs slightly, because there was a
much more pronounced trend (toward the use of LIFO) over the sample

period. To accommodate this fact, we calculate average fractions as
for Japanese firms, but allow one break during the sample period
where the fractions may change. Thus, a firm switching from FIFO to
LIFO in 1972 will have a FIFO fraction of 1.0 through 1972 and a
LIFO fraction of 1.0 thereafter.

    To perform the inventory corrections, once these separate stocks
have been estimated, we begin by assuming that all goods purchased
in a given year had a price equal to that year's price index, and
that the initial year's inventories are correctly stated. We then
use book information on the cost of goods sold and the change in
inventories to estimate a time series of the cost of goods sold in
                              15



 current dollars. The method by which thia is done is different for
 each of the three methods. For LIEU, no change in cost of goods
 sold is made unless book inventories declined, in which case the

 last previous year of accumulation not already run down in the
 intervening years is determined and an appropriate price correction
 made. For FlED, a one-year price adjustment is necessary for those
 goods sold in the current year attributable to initial inventory

 stocks. For average coat, our correction is based or the assumption
 that goods purchased in the current year are added to stocks and the
 price corresponding to the cost of goods sold is the averaqe price
at which this pool of goods in inventory is carried.

     Once a current dollar measure of the cost of goods sold has been
calculated for each of the inventory method categories, the

difference between their sum end book cost of goods sold is
subtracted from book earnings.



    3c. Nominal Assets and Liablilities



    This correction to earnings is simple. We tel-ce the book vaaue
of nominal liablities net of nominal assets, multiply by the

concurrent annual inflation rate, end add the resulting estimate of
the capital gain on nominal liabilities to book earnings. Since we

are studying nonfinancial companies, this is always a positive
correction.

    Nominal assets and liabilities include not only financial
assets, but also accounts payable and receivable. The major balance
sheet items not included are real assets: inventories, depreciable
assets, and lend.
                            16




    Because of generally higher Japanese debt—equity ratios,   one
might expect this correction to increase estimated Japanese earnings
(as applied to the total return to capital) by a greater fraction.

However, Japan's more favorable inflation experience works in the

opposite direction.
    We have made no attempt, at this stage of research, to correct
for deviations of the market values of long term liabilities from

their book values resulting from changes in long-term interest

rates.


          3d. Results of the Corrections


    Tables 3a and 3j report the results of these three corrections

to before-tax book earnings-price ratios. Average
(1966-1981) values of these series are presented in Tables 2a and

2,. column 4. For the U.S., these corrections increase estimated
earnings-price ratios for many firms, and decrease them for slightly

more. This may be seen by comparing the averages in Tables la and
2a. The direction of the effect depends on whether increases due to
accounting for gains on liabilities offsets decreases that result
from correct statement of inventory and depreciation costs.
     For Japanese firms, the effect of the corections is much

clearer, increasing estimated earnings for virtually all firms.

This is probably due to the generally higher debt-equity ratios
found in Japan. Average percentages of debt in total market value
(debt plus equity) are shown for U.S. and Japanese firms in column 3

of Tables 2a and 2j, respectively. The median value of this
statistic is 48.5 for Japanese firms, but only 18.2 percent for

    Tables 4a and 4j    present corresponding corrected measures of the
total returns to debt plus equity.7 Average (l966-l) values of
these series are presented in the sixth column of tables 2a and 2j.
As before, the denominator of this measure is the sum of equity and

the book value of financial liabilities, while the numerator is the
sum of corrected earnings and corrected interest payments, equal to
interest payments less the inflation rate multiplied by the book
value of financial liabilities.. Since the addition of interest

payments offsets most of the inflation gain on nominal liabilities
included in corrected earnings, the effect of inflation corrections
on the overall return to capital is clearly negative for firms in
both countries. For the U.S., the reduction in the average value of
RIM ranges between _Q4 and 3.2. For Japan, the average reduction
is typically somewhat larger, ranging from -0.3 to 4.6.
     The median average before—tax return to capital in the U.S.
falls from 10.3 percent without correction to 9.4 percent. The
median value for Japan falls substantially more, from 10.3 percent
to 7.5 percent. These larger reductions strenghten the case that
the return to capital is systematically lower in Japan.
     This is evident in several industries. Consider, for example,
computers where the inflation corrections are much larger for
Japanese than for U.S. firms. Here, average rates of return for the
three Japanese companies range between        and       while the
range is 4.6' -        for U.S. firms. In chemicals, the range is
4.0' -   l0.2   in Japan, compared to Dow's l0.7' for the U.S. There
remain exceptions to this rule, in the drug industry, for example.
but the result is clearer when corrected measures are used..   In our

sarnple, there are clear differences in rates of return (with Japan

having a lower rate) in airlines, film and photographic equipment,
steel, autos, computers and chemicals. While we would emphasize

again that caution is necessary in regarding results from such a
small sample, there seems to be some evidence that a difference in

returns to capital exists. The remainder the the paper is devoted to
considering the potential sources of this difference, and whether it

reflects a true difference in underlying capital costs.


    4. Explaining Differences in the Rate of Return



    In this section, we explore two types of explanations for the
apparent rate of return differential between the U.S. and Japan.

One approach is to try to explain why the costs of capital do
differ; another is to show why the rate—of—return calculations of
the previous section may need further adjustment before they can be

 identified with costs of capital. Explanations of these two types

would obviously have different policy implications.


    4a. Taxation


    Although there are no scholarly sources that we know of to cite,

there is certainly a common perception in the U.S. that business

taxes are at the root of our problems of competition with Japan.
This argument is difficult to substantiate using our data.

    Tables 5a and 5j present corrected after-tax earnings-price
ratios for U.S. and Japanese firms, respectively, calculated by
subtracting income taxes paid from the corrected before-tax earnings

used to produce Tables 3a and     3j. In similar fashion,   we produce
after—tax returns to capital, presented in Tables 6a and 6j, by
adding to after—tax corrected earnings corrected Interest payments
less the imputed tax deduction for such payments defined to equal to
nominal interest payments multiplied by the relevant corporate tax
rate. These correpsond to the financial concept of earnings before
interest, after taxes. One may think of them as the after-tax
returns the firma would earn if they were unlevered. Averages for
these two measures for the period 1966—81 are provided in columns 5
and 7 of Tables 2a and 2j.

    By comparing before—tax and after—tax returns to capital, one
can assess the impact of the corporate tax system, holding financial
policy constant. Both returns are those the firm would earn if
unlevered, end the difference thus represents the tax burden on the
firm's real, rather than financial activity.

    Even a cursory comparison of before-tax and after-tax rates of
return shows that it is Japanese, not American firms that are taxed
more heavily on their real income. All but five of the 21 Japanese
firms have average after—tax rates of return to capital that are
less than half of their before-tax rates of return. This Is true
for only 10 of the 19 American firma. Moreover, because of the
substantial tax reduction introduced by the 1981 tax act, the trend
beyond the 1966—81 period over which these averages were taken
should be toward even more favorable comparative tax treatment in
the U.S.8

     There are well—known pitfalls involved in using average rates

of return to infer marginal effective rates relevant to the cost of
capital for new investment. It would be preferable to use such

measures9 in the current discussion, but they are not, as yet,

available for Japan.
     There is a second channel through which corporate taxes could
affect the cost of capital. The previous calculations of before-tax
and after-tax returns to capital are based on costs to the unlevered
firm: earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and earnings before
interest, after—taxes. To the extent that there are no differences
in the after-tax costs of debt and equity finance, these are the
appropriate statistics to use. If such differences do exist because
of the corporate deductibility of interest payments, the extent to
which this tax advantage is available in the two countries would

also affect the coat of capital.
    An extreme upper bound on the size of this advantage is the

firm's annual tax deduction for interest payments. For example, if
firm had a fifty percent debt-value ratio, a nominal interest rate

of 8 percent and a tax rate of      this would represent a maximum

gain of 1.6 percentage points in its cost of capital.   Even this

would require that there be no offsetting costs to leverage, such as
increased taxation at the individual level. Since equity income is
taxed less heavily than interest income In both countries (capital

gains are not taxed at all in Japan) , one would not expect this to
be the case, even if a full tax offset (as hypothesized by Miller

1977) Ia absent.
     We have calculated these upper bounds for each company in each

year. Averages for each company for the period 1966—1981 are given
in Table 7a for the U.S. and 7j for Japan. The U.S. averages range
from O.O7 for Kodak to 2.55' for Macy's with a median value of
O.7O (Exxon). For Japan the maximum, minimum and median are 2.34

 for Nippon Steel, O.l6 for    Taisho, arid l.24'   (Nissan Motors),
 respectively.

      These measures indicate only a very smell difference in the

 maximum potential gains from leverage in Japan and the U.S. Given
 that these upper bounds may greatly overstate the gains from
 leverage in both countries, we would argue that greater Japanese
 ability to finance with tax—deductible debt is of negligible

 importance in explaining before-tax cost of capital difference
 between the two countries.

      We conclude provisionally that corporate taxes cannot explain
why Japanese firms would enjoy a lower cost of capital then those in
the U.S.



     4b. Differences in National Savings Rates


    It appears from calculations of after—tax rates of return that

Japanese corporations earn substantially less for the holders of
their securities than do U.S. corporations. Some have been tempted
to ascribe this result to the higher personal savings rate in Japan.

There are two problems with this conclusion. First, savings rates

do not necessarily translate into rates of capital accumulation in a

world of open capital markets, since capital would flow abroad to
gain higher rates of return.

    There is some controversy about the openness of the Japanese

capital market. However, there is a second factor that must be
considered. The Japanese economy, including, of course, its capital
stock, has been growing much more rapidly then that of the U.S. over
the past two decades. A greater rate of investment out of GNP has
                             32



been required for Japan simply to maintain any given capital-output
ratio. A comparison suggests that the capital-output ratios for
productive sectors in Japan are no higher than comparable figures

for the U.S.1°


   4c. Differences in Growth and Risk


    One is accustomed to seeing some firms in the U.S. have higher
price—earnings "multiples" than others. Systematic differences of
this sort can be due to one of two factors. One is differences in
risk. Riskier firms have higher rates of return to capital, on
average, because investors are risk averse. It is a matter of
semantics whether the riskier firm has a higher cost of capital,
since it must earn the same risk-adiusted rate of return as the less
risky firm. A second reason for variation in earnings—price ratios
is related to growth; not simply growth itself, but the unusual
investment opportunities that one normally associates with rapidly
growing enterprises. Firms with access to projects with high
marginal products would be expected to grow more quickly, and the

excess returns on these future projects should be capitalized into

the current stock price.11
     This would certainly not represent a cost of capital
difference, only a difference in the composition of economic
earnings: a greater fraction would be accounted for by capital
gains, (in excess of retained earnings) which are not included in
our calculations thus far.
    If Japanese firms are less risky than U.S. firms, or possess

greeter "exceptional growth opportunities," these could help explain
                                 33



 why the observed before-tax return to capital appears to be somewhat
 lower in Japan. To assess these possibilities, one must use data on
 total market returns to investors instead of the reported earnings
 of firms. For the U.S., this calculation is straightforward. To

 compute the annual return to equity, we add common and preferred
 dividends to the change in the value of the firm (net of new share

 issues), and divide this by the beginning of year value of the firm.
 This yields a measure of the rate at which the firm's equity is

 capitalized.12

      Deriving similar statistics for Japan presents some

difficulties involving the growth in equity. In Japan, there have
been many more new issues of equity shares than in the U.S., and to

complicate matters, some are given at no cost to current share
holders (stock dividends), some are sold in the market at the market
price, while still others are sold to existing stock holders at its

face value (more frequently 5O per share, a fraction of the market
price). Fortunately, we have been able to obtain, for each of the
companies in our sample, the complete history of new issues
including the price at which they were issued. We therefore define
the rate of capital gain on shares as the increase in the market

value of outstanding shares less capital paid in the form of new
share purchases, divided by the market value of shares outstandir-iq

at the beginning of the period. The market rate of return on equity
then is defined as the sum of the rate of capital gain so defined

plus the dividends paid divided by the market value of shares
outstanding at the beginning of the period.

      The results of our calculations are presented in Table 8a and
8j.   In   these tables, we first list earnings-price ratio after tax,

both unadjusted for inflation and adjusted for inflation, averaged
over the period of 1971 to 1981, in columns 2 and 3. Column 3 would
have been the same as column 5 of Tables 2a and 2j, except that in

Table 8 it is averaged over shorter period of 1971
                                                      -   1981 rather

than over 1966-81, because some detailed information on new issues

records was missing on the Compustat tape before 1971.
     Results are quite dramatic. On en inflation adjusted basis, the

median earnings price ratio for the U.S. is 7.2 (Sears) while it is

8.1 (Shionogi) for Japan. Looking at the third columns of Tables Be
and Bj, we may conclude that there is little to distinguish between

the distribution of the earnings price ratio for the U.S. (excluding
Chrysler, which is a special case) from that for Japan.       In terms of

the market rate of return shown in the fourth column, however, the
difference is enormous. The median for the U.S. is 2.2' (Delta
                                                                  13
Airlines and Merck), while it   is   13.6" (Toshiba) for Japan.

     There may be any number of reasons not to take these figures
too seriously. Among them, we may note that during the period
covered, the capitalization rate in general in the U.S. may have
risen significantly, and figures for the U.S. may include a large

one time capital loss which may be distorting our results. Japan
may still have been on the post-war declining trend of the general
capitalization rate during this period, which appears to have ended

in the early 1960s for the U.S.
     We do not wish to assert here, on the basis of information
presented in Tables Ba and Bj, that the required rate of return on
equity has been this much higher in Japan than in the U.S. On the
other hand, even a much smaller revision in this direction of the
after-tax costs of equity reported earlier would be sufficient to
                               37



 nullify any apparent difference in overall returns to capital in the
 two countries. Given all the evidence presented in this paper,
 therefore there do not seem to be any grounds to conclude that the

 cost of capital in Japan was significantly lower than in the U.S.
 for the period covered.



      5. Conclusions


      We have not as yet reached any firm conclusions about whether

the Japanese cost of capital is lower than that in the U.S.. but we

have made some progress. There appears some evidence of lower
before-tax rates of return in Japan, though given our sample size

and selection method, this result is by no means defInitIve.

      In searching for potential explanations, we have been able to
rule out one that is among the moat frequently cited, business

taxation. Japanese real investments appear to be more, rather than
less, heavily taxed than those undertaken in the U.S., and the

maximum potential gain from the greater use of leverage is very
small. It also appears that the understatement of capital gains by
book value data is sufficient to explain any apparent gap in returns
between the two countries.

     We have based our analysis on samples of firms from the U.S.
and from Japan, but we have chosen these firms very informally on

the basis of their size, industry to which they helonq,

comparability, and availability of date. It would be quite useful
to work with a somewhat larc*er and more syatematiosily chosen

sample.   It would also be very useful to estimate ex-ante cost of
capital measures, rather than workinq with purely ex-post
                             38



realization data. Finally, we hope to make parallel computations
using data for industries and the whole economy, in order to
supplement the results based on individual firm data reported here.
Ultimately, one wishes to understand variations in the rate of

return in the context of the savings arid investment patterns of the
countries involved, and how two or more countries may dust to each

other when their savings and investment behavior differ

substantially.

     "Accrued employees' Severace Indemnities" is a special reserve
 account in Japanese corporations set up to meet a requirement of the
 tax   law.   To begin with, it must be understood that moat employees
 of Japanese corporations are not given retirement annuities, but a
 large cash payment at the time of retirement, 3 to 4 times the
 annual salary for the last year of employment. The corporate tax
 law of Japan says that (1) corporations must estimate the amount of

 the total severance payments that must be undertaken if the company
 is to cease operations immediately and pay every employee the

 severance pay which he or she is entitled to; (2) "Accrued

Employees' Severance Indemnities" should be 4O of the amount
calculated under Cl); (3) the retirement benefits actually paid

during the fiscal year should be charged against this account; and
(4) the difference between the amount defined under (2) and the

remaining balance at the end of the fiscal year can be charged as
current expenses, and it is deductible for corporate income tax

purposes. In other words, this liability item is a book entry, a
device to maintain the account for the retirement benefits on an
accrual basis, and it is not an actual liability against which

interest is paid. Indeed, there is no interest payment on this item
in the income stetment of a company. The entire contribution into

this reserve account is treated as labor coat in the income
atatment. Thus, it is not appropriate to include this item in
liabilities of corporations in Japan.

       To bring the accounting with respect to this item to a cash
basis as in the case for U.S. corporations, we have subtracted the
                                40


net change in this account from the current costs of Japanese

companies.
    See, for example, Shoven and Bulow (1975,6), for an evaluation of

the effects on American corporations.
    This procedure was also used by Auerbach (1984), where it is

described and evaluated more fully.
    We are grateful to Bronwyn Hall for calling this problem to our

attention.
6    In principle, one could get a rough estimate by redoing the
estimates for Japan with land included.
    The use of such corrected estimates of the return to corporate
capital to infer the required return are familiar in the literature.
See, for example, Feldstein and Summers (1977) or Feldstein et.al.

(1983).

volume edited by King and Fullerton (1984).

     For the U.S., for l979. gross national produce originating in the
non—financial corporate sector divided by the stock of reproducible
tangible assets excluding inventories at the replacement cost is
approximately 1.10 (Survey of Current Business, July 1983, P. 30,
and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Balance Sheets

of the United States, 1945-1982, p. 44).. For Japan, one needs to
make some approximations in terms of the sectors included to come as
close as possible to the one ued for the U.S. We have taken fixed
reproduciple assets other than inventories for non—financial
incorporated enterprises (p. 309, Annual Report of National
Accounts, 1985) less estimated residential structures owned by this
                                41



 sector as the capital stock, while we have used GNP originating in
 the private producer sector less agriculture, finance and insurance,
 real estate, and service industries as output. The corresponding
 figure for Japan is 1.14.

      This can be rigorously shown using, for instance, the "q" theory
 of investment. Suppose there is the anticipation that an outward
 shift will occur in the production frontier in the future,

 increasing the marginal product of capital. This will increase
 investment, and market value, immediately, decreasing measured
earnings in the short run because of capital deepening. Hence, one

would observe a low earnings-price ratio in the short run. The

capitalized value of higher future marginal products rises as their
date of appearance nears, giving investors a sufficient overall
return to equity.
12
      the marginal source of equity funds is retained earnings,
rather than new shares, then one should adjust dividends in this

calculation, multiplying them by a factor less than 1 that
represents the relative cost to the firm of delivering an after—tax
dollar to the investor in the form of capital gains as opposed to

dividends. This is the ratio (l-B)/'1-c, where B is the dividend
tax rate and c is the accrual—equivalent of the capital gains tax.

See Auerbsch (1979, l983b). This correction is important in the
current context to the extent that dividend yields differ between
the U.S. and Japan.
13
     This set of results is broadly consistent with those reported by

Baldwin [1985), who found Japanese market returns to equity to be
higher in the aggregate than those in the U.S. (but also riskier).
