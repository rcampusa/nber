                                         ABSTRACT

We examine the golden age of U.S. innovation by undertaking a major data collection exercise
linking historical U.S. patents to state and county-level aggregates and matching inventors to
Federal Censuses between 1880 and 1940. We identify a causal relationship between patented
inventions and long-run economic growth and outline a basic framework for analyzing key macro
and micro-level determinants. We find a positive relationship between innovation and drivers of
regional performance including population density, financial development and geographic
connectedness. We also explore the impact of social structure measured by slavery and religion.
We then profile the characteristics of inventors and their life cycle finding that inventors were
highly educated, positively selected through exit early in their careers, made time allocation
decisions such as delayed marriage, and tended to migrate to places that were conducive to
innovation. Father's income was positively correlated with becoming an inventor, though not
when controlling for the child's education. We show there were strong financial returns to
technological development. Finally, we document an inverted-U shaped relationship between
inequality and innovation but also show that innovative places tended to be more socially mobile.
Our new data help to address important questions related to innovation and long-run growth
dynamics.

                                   1    Introduction
At the heart of the 25-year old endogenous growth literature is the basic premise that innovation
and technological progress are engines of long-run economic growth (e.g., Romer (1990), Aghion
and Howitt (1992)). Due to data limitations, however, evidence from longer time horizons
is missing from this literature even though innovations from history such as light bulbs, air
conditioners and storage batteries have tremendous influence on the way we currently live,
consume, and produce (Gordon (2016)). Learning from the creators of these types of inventions
has the potential to shed light on several current debates in the innovation and growth literatures.
An abundance of modern data has helped to inform theoretical perspectives on key aspects of
the growth process including the impact of firm entry and exit, reallocation, the role of cities,
the distribution of talent, and the relationship between inequality, social mobility, innovation
and growth (e.g., Klette and Kortum (2004), Akcigit and Kerr (2016), Acemoglu et al. (2015),
Hsieh and Moretti (2015), Hsieh et al. (2013), Jones and Kim (2014), Aghion et al. (2015a)).
   This paper develops a number of facts about the environment in which many of the essential
technologies that we use today were created, the life cycle of inventors who developed these
inventions and how innovation affected economic inequality and social mobility. We construct
a large-scale micro-level historical dataset on inventors that can be mapped to both state and
county-level economic aggregates and to socio-economic variables on individuals.
   We use comprehensive data covering United States patents geocoded to the level of individual
inventors and data matching inventors in patent records to Federal Censuses from 1880 to 1940.
Typically such data has only been available historically for specific sub-samples of inventors
(e.g., Lamoreaux and Sokoloff (1999)), superstar inventors (e.g., Khan and Sokoloff (2004)) or
for broader populations in modern time periods (Aghion et al. (2015b), Bell et al. (2015)). The
new data allow us to examine who became an inventor and the types of environments that were
most conducive to innovation during a critical period of US economic growth.
   While the present paper presents numerous new facts about long run growth and innovation
in the United States since the late nineteenth century, it is not unique in its goal. Kaldor
(1961) presented six stylized facts around which the theory of economic growth developed.
Jones and Romer (2010) updated Kaldor’s facts to reflect the subsequent fifty years of data,
providing the empirical foundations for modern growth theory. Both papers have facilitated
informed discussion and permitted important breakthroughs in our understanding of the process
of economic growth. Our paper has a similar goal in mind: to establish the fundamental facts
regarding the process of innovation and its relationship to long run growth.
   As an overview of the underlying innovation data, Figure 1 (Panel A) plots the time-series of
log patents filed at the USPTO. It shows that innovative activity (proxy measured by patenting)
has been growing over time. In keeping with the predictions of the large theoretical literature
highlighting the central role of technological progress in endogenous growth we find a positive
association between our innovation measures and output growth over the long run.
   Panel B shows that at the beginning of our time period most inventors in the US developed
technologies outside the boundaries of firms with the rising share of patents assigned over time

Notes: Panel A: Excluding the exceptional years around World War II (1930-1950), a regression of annualized
5-year GDP per capita growth rates on log patents yields a coefficient of 0.639, which is statistically different from
0 at the 10% level. The correlation between these five year growth rates and log patents is 0.3915. Correlation
between log patents and log GDP per capita (levels) is 0.8897, while the estimated linear relationship between
the two is 0.7511 (with heteroskedasticity robust standard error 0.0325). Panel B: The share of US patents

reflecting the development of R&D labs inside the modern corporation (Mowery and Rosenberg
(1999)). The time period we cover is central to recent debates on innovation and growth. Indeed,
we analyze the years that Gordon (2016) associates with the second industrial revolution, which
produced major innovations like electricity and the motor vehicle. We also span the 1930s, which
Field (2003) identifies as the most innovative decade of the twentieth century.

Roadmap We analyze the innovation process through the experiences of inventors over their
life cycles. Some famous case studies can be useful to motivate our approach. Born to a poor
family in rural Ohio, Thomas Edison (1847-1931) faced tight financing constraints in his early
career. He ultimately relocated to New Jersey, building the Menlo Park Lab in 1876, a pioneering
research laboratory where creative inventors could collaborate to develop new technical ideas.
To develop his technologies further Edison accessed capital from a group of financiers, including
J.P. Morgan. The investment bank Drexel, Morgan & Co. (which later became J.P. Morgan &
Co.) provided loans, acted as a financial intermediary for Edison’s firm, and provided wealth
management (Brunner and Carr (2007)). Edison was granted 1,093 US patents. His experience
suggests the importance of access to external finance, population density and human interactions
in the innovation process. Edison’s career also exemplifies social mobility and the potential for
strong financial returns to innovation.
   As another example, Nikola Tesla (1856-1943), a Serbian immigrant, demonstrates the con-
tribution of international migration to US technological progress. Tesla was granted 112 US
patents, the timing of which also illustrates how productivity could change over the life cycle of
an inventor’s career. 64 of Tesla’s patents (57% of the total) were granted within a decade of
his arrival in America in 1884 at age 28, where he worked at the Edison Machine Works in New




                                                                                                                              2
York (Carlson (2013)). But his patenting rate attenuated sharply later on. He acquired just 16
patents (14% of the total) after he was age 45. Tesla held uncommon personal preferences. He
believed that private relationships detracted from productive research time, and never built a
family. His decision not to marry shows that inventors faced trade-offs when it comes to time
allocation.
   As a final example, Melvin De Groote (1895-1963), one of the most prolific inventors in US
history, received two degrees in Chemical Engineering. His highly-educated background was
crucial for turning his creativity into valuable innovations. De Groote was granted 925 US
patents, mostly developing novel methods to separate crude oil emulsion into its oil and water
components.1 De Groote moved from his state of birth in West Virginia to various places in the
US where innovative firms were located.2
   The above case studies hint that myriad factors, such as immigration, social mobility, access
to finance, human interactions, education, time allocation, might spur innovation. Our new
dataset can document these patterns in a systematic fashion, and thereby inform theories of
endogenous growth. To organize our exposition, we set forth a very simple model of innovation.
Consider a firm or agent deciding its investment in costly innovation activity. The agent can
choose the probability p of discovering a new invention in order to maximize its expected profits.
That is, the agent solves
               
       max         p · Π(Macro factors, Micro Factors) − C(p|Micro Factors, Macro Factors)
         p


where Π(·) is a function returning the expected profit the firm can receive if it successfully
innovates. This payoff function will depend on both surrounding micro and macro factors,
such as personal income or local market size. Likewise C(p|·) represents the cost choosing
an innovation probability p given the micro and macro factors that could impact the cost of
innovation, such as education or the cost of borrowing. Naturally, there may be many factors
that affect the costs and benefits of innovation. To address these systematically, we provide a
framework to consider the innovation process, outlined in Figure 2.
   As a broad summary of our approach, we first establish a link between innovation and growth
at the state level, and then consider the environment in which an inventor operates. We examine
various characteristics of the inventors’ state of residence including population density, financial
development, geographical connectedness and social structure (measured using data on slave-
owning families and religiosity). For our macro-level analysis we first present state-level results;
we then perform checks for robustness of the findings at the county level.
   Next we examine the basic demographic facts of inventors: their life cycle, education, and
migration decisions. For example, we examine the family background of inventors, which may
affect both the costs and benefits of innovation through factors such as relaxed credit constraints,

   De Groote is also noted as an innovator in food processing. For example, his inventions for extracting flavor
    from vanilla beans without using alcohol as a solvent were important to the production of ice cream.

    Pittsburgh, Procter and Gamble in Cincinnati, and Petrolite Corporation in Webster Groves, Missouri where

or improved social networks, among others. We then provide evidence on the private rewards
to innovation by studying the wages of successful inventors from labor income data in the
1940 Census. Finally, we investigate the societal consequences of innovation by establishing the
correlation between patenting activity and income inequality or social mobility at the state level.
  Our analysis uncovers the following stylized facts about the process of innovation and tech-
nological development during the golden age of US economic growth and beyond:

                                                  Regional Facts
  Fact 1. More inventive states and sectors grew faster on average.
  Fact 2. Densely-populated states were more inventive.
  Fact 3. Financially-developed states were more inventive.
  Fact 4. Geographically-connected states were more inventive.
  Fact 5. States associated with slavery were less inventive but religiosity is not robustly
correlated with inventiveness.

                                                  Personal Facts
   Fact 6. Inventors were more educated on average and were most productive between the
age of 36 and 55.
   Fact 7.    Inventors were positively selected through exit early in their careers, but were
less productive and more likely to exit late in their careers.
   Fact 8.    The patents of new inventors received more citations on average, and were
more likely to be in the top decile of the citations distribution.
   Fact 9. Inventors delayed marriage and had fewer children.
   Fact 10.     Inventors were more likely to have migrated from their state of birth. They
moved to states that were more conducive to innovation.

                                              Family Background
  Fact 11. Father’s income was correlated with becoming an inventor. This effect disap-
pears once child’s education is controlled for.




                                                                4
                                 The Return to Innovation
  Fact 12. Successful patentees had substantially higher labor income, even controlling for
demographics, occupation, and education.
  Fact 13. Inventor’s income was highly correlated with the quality of invention measured
by patent citations.

                             Inequality and Social Mobility
  Fact 14.      Broad measures of income inequality, such as 90/10 ratio, Gini coefficient,
were negatively correlated with innovation.
  Fact 15. However, the top-1% income share has a U-shaped relationship with innovation.
  Fact 16. Innovation was strongly positively correlated with social mobility.

   More specifically, our analysis of regional facts begins by identifying the relationship between
innovation and long-run economic growth, as postulated by the active endogenous growth lit-
erature. We study the relationship between innovation and long-run growth across states over
100 years between 1900 and 2000. Our results show that the link has been strongly positive
and economically sizable. Estimates suggest that if two states had the same initial GDP per
capita in the beginning of the period and one state innovated four times more than the other
(Massachusetts vs Wyoming, for instance), this could lead to 30% higher GDP per capita in the
innovative state after 100 years. We verify a positive relationship in the data at the sectoral
level. We also use an instrumental variables approach exploiting an historical shift in innovation
activity during World War II to show that these estimates could be causal.
   Our analysis of the characteristics of innovative states sheds important light on the macroe-
conomic environments where inventors operated. We find that innovative regions were more
densely populated, were more financially developed, and were better connected to other parts
of the country by transport links. We also test the extent to which the social structure of re-
gions was correlated with their inventiveness given the notion that societal attitudes towards
innovation affects “openness” to technological disruption (e.g., Florida (2002), Acemoglu et al.
(2014)). We find that states associated with high levels of slave ownership before the Civil War
were less inventive. Although we find some evidence of a negative relationship between religios-
ity and inventiveness, it is not as robust as that found for modern time periods (Benabou et al.
(2013) and Benabou et al. (2015)). We relate these findings to large theoretical and empirical
literatures in macroeconomics. In particular we highlight the modern drivers of innovation and
long run economic growth which retain their importance in a historical context, and show which
factors exhibit different patterns in recent and historical data.
   We then transition from the macro environment to the micro-level. We find that inventors
were not uneducated amateurs; rather they were typically highly-educated individuals and were
most productive between ages 35-55. We report a range of summary statistics, indicating, for
example, that the vast majority of inventors were white males.
   To investigate personal characteristics further we benchmark the profile of inventors using
different groups and sub-groups of the US population. First, we find that, just like individuals
in other high-skill occupations, inventors tended to postpone marriage relative to the average



                                                5
low-skill person in the population. Second, we find that inventors were significantly more likely
to have migrated from their state of birth than both high-skill and low-skill persons. Third, we
document that conditional on moving, inventors tended to relocate to more densely-populated
and better financially-developed places.
   Due to the richness of our patent data, where we can track inventors longitudinally, we also
present novel life cycle facts. We find that inventors produced their highest quality inventions
(measured by patent citations) early in their careers and that the early exit of low productivity
inventors led to positive selection. Moreover, we find that the probability of exit was high
as inventors faced obsolescence later in their careers. We relate these central findings to the
empirical literature on productivity and firm dynamics (e.g., Haltiwanger (2012)) and theoretical
models in which firm entry and exit play important roles in the growth development process
(e.g., Acemoglu et al. (2015), Jovanovic (1982) and Hopenhayn (1992)).
   We add to our analysis of career patterns by investigating the family background of inventors
which reveals important differences between the extensive and intensive margins. While we find
that some inventors gained privileged access into a career as an inventor, this effect operated only
in the upper tail of the father income distribution. Entry was quite democratic, in keeping with
the argument that rapid innovation and growth in the US economy at this time was facilitated
by open intellectual property rights institutions (Khan (2009)). On the intensive margin we find
no effect of father’s income on patent productivity or quality.
   Innovation is a process where inventors invest in costly effort ex ante in the expectation of
gaining ex post returns, financial or otherwise (e.g., Stern (2004)). Yet, the financial returns
to inventors in particular are rarely measurable even for modern time periods (e.g., Astebro
(2003)). Subject to some limitations associated with the income data from the 1940 Census,
(which we discuss in Section 2) we show that inventors had high incomes, even after controlling
for their observable characteristics. We find that inventors had three times higher labor income
on average. Indeed, inventors had a steeper earnings profile over their life cycle. Fully 73% of
inventors were in the top decile of the overall income distribution. We identify strong returns to
the quality of innovation: inventors with higher citation-adjusted patents received higher wage
income.
   Finally, in a key component of our analysis, we study regional income dynamics as an out-
come measure in relation to prior-period patenting activity. We focus on various measures of
inequality: the 90/10 ratio, the Gini coefficient and the top-1% income share. We also construct
a measure of social mobility using information in the 1940 Census that focuses on the fraction
of those with a low-skill father who themselves have a high-skill occupation. We find that inno-
vative regions in the US had lower income inequality measured as the 90/10 ratio or the Gini
coefficient, yet the top income share features a U-shaped relationship with state innovation. In
general we find that the most innovative states had higher levels of social mobility.
   Overall, our analysis uses novel historical microdata linked to regional aggregates to provide
key macro and micro-level facts to inform critical questions in the study of technological progress
and long-run economic growth. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
outlines our data, Section 3 presents the empirical results. Section 4 codifies our findings in



                                                 6
relation to existing studies, and Section 5 concludes. Appendices A to D provide a detailed
description of the data we use, our matching methodology and additional robustness checks.

                      Patents, Technology Areas and Citations

Patents are a commonly used measure of innovation in the empirical literature on technological
change. A patent entry shows the name and address of an inventor: it shows the surname, first
name, middle initial(s) where relevant, state, city, county, and country of the applicant when the
patent was granted. For example, Figure 3 shows the famous USPTO patent 223,898 granted to
Thomas Edison in Menlo Park on January 27, 1880. Patents also represent transferable property
rights. If a patent was assigned to another individual or firm, the assignee is also recorded on
the document. Edison’s patent was unassigned at the grant date. As shown in Figure 1 (Panel
B) the share of patent assignments in the US grew over time.

                     Figure 3: Pages of USPTO Patent Number 223,898




   We use a comprehensive collection of over 6 million US patents, which allows us to gain
unique insights into the characteristics of US inventive activity over longer time horizons, by
linking patents to both regional economic and social aggregates and by matching patents at
the inventor-level with information in the decennial Federal Censuses from 1880 to 1940. The
construction of the patent data are described in Appendix B.
   In addition to the raw patent data we use two datasets to augment the information available
from the original patent documents. First, we use the USPTOs classification of patents to isolate



                                                7
the technology area of inventions. This classification is consistent over time because whenever a
new classification is introduced, existing patents are retroactively re-classified. Patents list sev-
eral technological components, and we observe main classes and subclasses for each invention.
Second, we use historical patent citations to identify the most influential technological develop-
ment. Our data include 3.8 million citations to patents granted between 1880 and 1940 from the
population of patents granted between February 1947 (when front page citations began to be
systematically recorded) and September 2008. Following Hall et al. (2001), we adjust citations
to account for bias due to truncation or aggregate fluctuations in citation propensity.3
   Several aspects of patenting are worth highlighting in the context of our linkage between in-
ventors and the Census records. First, access to patenting was widespread. The cost of obtaining
a US patent was very low by international standards. Lerner (2002) estimates that in 1875 to
hold a patent to a full term of 17 years in the United States cost just 5% of the amount in the
United Kingdom, 11% of the UK amount in 1900 and 10% of the UK amount in 1925. Moreover,
inventors were actively encouraged to innovate and file for patents by the way the application
process was configured. They could mail documents to the US patent office in Washington, DC
through the extensive network of post offices connecting the country (Khan (2009), Acemoglu
et al. (2016a)). Inventors could also use a large network of intermediaries (patent agents and
lawyers) to administer the patenting process (Lamoreaux and Sokoloff (1999)).
   Second, although patents could be sold because a market for technology had flourished since
the middle of the nineteenth century (e.g., Lamoreaux and Sokoloff (1999), Akcigit et al. (2016a))
the location of the original inventor is still recorded on the patent document. US patent law
stipulated that the “first and true inventor” be listed in the patent application even if the patent
was assigned to another individual or firm at its grant date. Even as the law of the of employee-
inventor evolved to make pre-invention employee assignment agreements legally enforceable, the
original inventor can be identified on the patent (Fisk (2009)).
   Third, at least for the early years of our study the timing of a patent being filed by an applicant
and the timing of a patent grant—when we observe their location—were quite close. In 1880
an average of 170 days elapsed between the filing and grant date. In 1900 343 days elapsed.
For this time period there is a reasonable alignment between the patent grant year and when
an individual was observed in the Census year. By 1910, however, the average patent pendency
period was almost a year-and-a-half (536 days). In 1930 it had extended to over 1,000 days and
it was still over 800 days in 1940.4 We would therefore expect to see more measurement error
in our matching ceteris paribus for later years. In terms of the further link between the timing
of the idea behind an invention and its fruition Schmookler (1966) reports that it took about
one-and-a-half years for an invention by an independent inventor to be produced.

     By comparison, the average difference between a patent application and grant date for US patents granted
      between 2008 and 2015 was 1,278 days.

                                                  Census Data

The release of the complete-count Census data by the Minnesota Population Center (IPUMS)
provides an opportunity to examine a number of questions related to the historical development
of innovation in the United States. We use the decennial Censuses in 1880, 1900, 1910, 1920,
1930, and 1940.5 We start our patent-Census matching exercise in 1880 because that is the first
year a reasonable number of patent observations become available. Around 11,400 patents were
granted to inventors residing in the US in that particular year. We end in 1940 because that is
the latest Census available given the Census Bureau’s 72 year lag release rule.
   We view these data analogously to modern studies using administrative records such as Bell et
al. (2015) who uncover major new facts about the nature of US innovation. Not only is it possible
to link the historical Census data with patent records (as we show below) but data on the entire
population permits analysis of inventor life cycles relative to other sub-groups of individuals—
for instance with different occupational skill levels. This type of systematic information across
large groups of individuals for the entire United States has never been available before for long
historical horizons. Nevertheless, although the Censuses present an especially useful source of
data, it is also worthwhile understanding some of the potential limitations.
   First, the quality of the Census records varies over time. While the Census included quality
control procedures in an effort to ensure consistent enumeration, a lot depended on the way
the Censuses were generally administered. For example, the 1920 Census was conducted in the
winter (January 1st 1920) whereas the 1910 Census had been conducted in the spring (April
15th). Winter enumeration had a large effect on seasonal occupations like agricultural labor and
movement back and forth to cities. Although we show in Appendix C that our match rate is
lower for 1920 than for other years, the level of underenumeration is not sufficient to bias our
results. Dorn (1937) estimates underenumeration in the native white population (which would
be most relevant to the inventors in our dataset) of between 1% and 1.1%.
   Second, beyond standard variables like the name and location of individuals, the information
contained in the Censuses varies widely over our period of interest. Although a number of
variables are commonly recorded across Census years such as age, race, gender and marital
status, in other instances variables are recorded in one year only to be dropped in another. As
an example, occupation is listed in 1880 but not in 1900 or 1910. Generally, a wider array
of variables are available in later years. Beginning in 1920, for instance, enumerators asked
specifically about education (school attendance) and home ownership.
   Third, some variables are subject to measurement error. An advantage of the 1940 Census is
that it questioned individuals about income. Prior to the availability of these data, researchers
routinely imputed incomes by assigning individuals the median income in their reported occu-
pational category (e.g., Abramitzky et al. (2014)). But, the income data needs to be carefully
interpreted. Enumerators were instructed to report incomes of greater than $5,000 a year at

     For a full description of the Census datasets, the variables they contain, and our attempts to clean them, see
      Appendix A. The 1890 Census was largely destroyed in a fire in 1921 and others records from this Census
      were destroyed under intransigent Federal record management polices in place at the time. Only a limited
      set of 1890 Census schedules survived.




                                                          9
$5,000+. Hence, the data are “top-coded.” For example, Melvin De Groote, a superstar inventor
we profiled earlier in the paper, reports this level of income in the 1940 Census (average income
was $1,368). Furthermore, Petro (2016) finds that “if a farmer worked for himself and sold his
crops, he did not report that money” in the 1940 Census. By the same token we assume that
inventors selling their inventions would not have reported this as income.

                 Approach to Matching Patent and Census Records

The main challenge associated with matching inventors, as listed on patent documents, to in-
dividuals listed in the Census, is the absence of a unique identifier across datasets. The first
Social Security number was issued in 1936. Although a supplementary question was asked in
the 1940 Census about whether a person had a Social Security number, the number itself was
not recorded. Social Security numbers were not included in patent documents at the time.
   In both the patent and Census datasets we observe variables denoting surname, first name,
initial, state, city and county. This vector of information provides a basis for our matching.
Of course, the challenge of matching observations without unique identifiers is self-evident.
For example, in their study of intergenerational occupational mobility, Long and Ferrie (2013)
tracked fathers and sons across the 1851 Census and the 1881 Census using the proximity of
the name and birth year. In a recent paper, Feigenbaum (2015) estimates intergenerational
income mobility using a machine-learning approach to match individuals from the 1915 Iowa
State Census and the 1940 US Federal Census. He matches on first name, surname, middle
initial, state of birth, and year of birth finding approximately a 59 percent match rate.
   Unlike these prior studies we do not observe year of birth in the patent records, but we can
still limit the likelihood of matching “false positives” by restricting our analysis to only those
observations where we match precisely across a range of our matching variables. We proceed in
two steps. First, we adopt a “basic” matching approach where the criterion for matching is that
the inventor listed on the patent has the same first name and surname as the individual in the
Census, and lives in the same state. Naturally, this leads to repeated individuals in some cases.
   Therefore, we next adopt a “refined” matching approach. In addition to the criterion in
our basic match we require additionally that individuals listed on the patent document and
individuals in the Census reside in the same county. Then, if there are still many observations
for a given inventor, we first check if there is an inventor which has the same middle initial in
both the patent and Census datasets, and we keep that inventor if there is a match. We then
keep only Census inventors who live in the same city or township as is listed on the patent
document, if one exists. Next, we ask if there is any matched inventor between 16 and 85 years
old. If so, we keep that inventor only. Finally, we repeat the age refinement, keeping only
matched inventors between 18 and 65 year old, if one exists. In other words, to be in our final
dataset requires that individuals match systematically on surname, first name, (where relevant
initial), state, and county. Although there are still data matching issues we cannot overcome—
for example, sometimes the Census uses registration areas (e.g., Precincts or Districts) rather
than cities, making it impossible for us to identify the right individual by location—overall our




                                               10
matching rates are encouraging. We match an average of 46 percent of patentees in the Census
with a high of 62 percent in 1880 and a low of 34 percent in 1920. A detailed description of the
matching process is provided in Appendix C.

                                         Additional Data Sources

Finally, our analysis uses additional important datasets.

     1.   Demographics. Intercensal population estimates are provided by the Census Bureau.
          We also use the Census data to construct measures of slave ownership (from the 1860
          Census), and we construct measures of religiosity from the Census of Religious Bodies.
     2.   State-level Output. State output data is taken from the Bureau of Economic Analysis
          (BEA) for 1929 through the present day. In addition, Klein (2013) provides estimates of
          gross state products in 1880, 1890, 1900, and 1910 and Martin (1939) provides estimates
          of state incomes from 1919 to 1938.6
     3.   Sector-level Output. Sector value added and full-time equivalent employment data
          come from the BEA.7
     4.   Financial Development Measures. To establish proxies for financial development,
          we use Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) data. The FDIC dataset, from
          the University of Michigan’s ICPSR repository (number 0007) provides the number of
          deposits, banks, and bank suspensions at a county level from 1920-1936.
     5.   Transportation Cost. Obtained from Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016).
     6.   Scientific Research and Development Contracts. In our instrumented growth re-
          gressions (detailed below) we use data obtained from the Library of Congress on Office
          of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) contracts for technological development
          efforts during World War II.


                                      2.1      Summary Statistics
As a precursor to the main analysis we present descriptive statistics on our data, which we
discuss in more detail in subsequent sections. In keeping with our approach of examining US
innovation from macroeconomic and microeconomic perspectives, we structure these data to
characterize inventiveness at both the state and individual inventor levels.
   In Table 1, we compare the most and least innovative 10 states on an average patents per
capita basis between 1880 and 1940 whereas in Table 2 we report the summary statistics for
all states. In Table 3, we present a statistical profile of inventors based on information in the
Censuses and we compare inventor characteristics with those of the population as a whole.
   As Table 1 shows, the top most and least inventive states differed along numerous observable
dimensions. The top 10 inventive states were more populous and much more densely populated.

      the SIC codes change then. The match from USPTO classes to SIC codes is done using files provided by Bill
      Kerr and assigns patent classes to the SIC code which manufactures the highest share of patents in that class.

Indeed, the top 10 inventive states contained 11 (55%) of the largest 20 cities in the United
States in 1880 and 9 (45%) of the the largest 20 cities in 1940. By contrast, the bottom 10
inventive states contained none. The inventive states were distinctly more urban.
   Additionally, the most inventive states had higher GDP per capita, and average and median
wage income suggesting a positive relationship between inventive activity and the level of eco-
nomic development. The population in the inventive states was also more educated, implying a
link between human capital and inventiveness. The most inventive states also had larger migrant
populations, especially international migrants, who accounted for about one-fifth of the popula-
tion in the top 10 inventive states but less than one-fiftieth of the population in the bottom 10
inventive states. The population of the most inventive states was largely white, whereas almost
a third of the population in the least inventive states were black. Notably, seven of the bottom
10 inventive states were associated with slavery in the antebellum era.
   In terms of similarities, the states shared a largely common age structure. The employment
rate was almost exactly the same across these state groupings and both the male and female
labor force participation rates were roughly equivalent. However, the distribution of occupations
was different in that the inventive states contained a larger share of individuals with a high-skill
job. These states also appear to have been more “open” to external influences insofar as this
can be inferred from minorities being more likely to be employed in a high-skill job.

 Meanwhile, Table 3 shows inventors were more likely to be married, middle-aged, white males,
who had fewer children early and were migrants relative to the population as a whole. Figure

4 highlights again that our data consists overwhelmingly of white male inventors. Our time
period roughly coincides with phases Goldin (2006) identifies (i.e., from the 1880s to the 1950s)
where women’s involvement in the labor market was generally restricted to positions like office
and clerical work. There were some exceptional female inventors, but not very many. For
example, Khan and Sokoloff (2004) found only one female inventor in their list of 400 superstar
US inventors listed in the Dictionary of American Biography who were born before 1886.

  Finally, the base of Table 3 shows that inventors represented a very small share of the pop-
ulation.8 Yet, when knowledge diffuses rapidly, inventors developing breakthrough inventions
can have a large influence on economic growth (e.g., Comin and Hobijn (2010)). During the
US golden age and major epochs of economic development more generally, the technological
ingenuity and innovative capabilities of the minority tended to matter the most (e.g., Mokyr
and Voth (2012), Squicciarini and Voigtlaender (2015)).


                                                                   3          Empirical Analysis

Following the road map outlined in Figure 2 we start by discussing the regional facts that we
observe in our data. In particular, we first exhibit the strong positive relationship between
innovation and economic growth at the state level. We then consider the relationship between
innovation and population density, financial development, geographic connectivity at the state
level, and social structure measured by association with slavery and religiosity. As checks on our
state-level results, where possible we carry out the analysis at the county level for robustness.
The county-level results are reported in subsections labeled “Robustness” within each fact.

     By comparison, in all years for which occupation data is reported in the Census, 0.46% of the working age
      population was a doctor or a lawyer.

  Figures 5A and 5B illustrate the geography of inventiveness defined as patents and inventors
per 10,000 people in 1940. Both figures reveal concentrations of activity in rust-belt manufac-
turing areas, which mirrors the distribution of industrial activity at the time (Glaeser (2011)).
California also stands out as a center of innovation and this holds for most of the years we
observe. This is not caused by sparse population counts mechanically inflating the patent and
inventor counts. While Los Angeles ranked as the 36th largest city in the US in 1900, it was
ranked number 10 in 1920 and number 5 in 1940. Wyoming was innovative in several of our
snapshot years, perhaps because of developments related to the evolution of the Union Pacific
Railroad. However, as noted above, Wyoming under-performed relative to other states in GDP
per capita growth over the very long run. Figures A-6 and A-7 in Appendix D show that the
geographic patterns displayed in Figure 5 are remarkably stable across our six census years.

Notes: Figure maps the number of patents (panel A) or inventors (panel B) per 10,000 residents in each state of
the mainland US in 1940. Darker colors represent more inventive activity per resident. Patent data come from
the USPTO’s historical patent files, while population counts are calculated using the US Census. Appendix D
reports similar maps in different decennial census years.



Fact 1. More inventive states and sectors grew faster on average.

   The long-standing endogenous growth literature builds on the premise that long-run growth
is driven by innovation and technological progress. Although this idea is intuitive, providing
empirical support for this premise has been challenging due to data limitations on historical
innovations. In fact, even though a large literature has studied the empirical determinants of
macro-level economic growth (e.g., Barro (1991)), to our knowledge no study has documented a
causal empirical relationship between innovation and growth for the US over the long run.
   Figure 6 shows the basic correlation between a proxy measure of innovation (patents) and
economic growth. To account for scale effects we plot variables residualized against 1900 log
GDP per capita. The relationship is strongly positive.
   Table 4 reports coefficients from growth regressions controlling for the long-run effects of initial
conditions and population density. The dependent variable in these regressions is the annualized
growth rate in state-level GDP per capita between 1900 and 2000. We find that the log of patents

horizontal axis, and the annualized growth rate in state GDP per capita between 1900 and 2000 on the vertical

granted between 1900 and 2000 had a consistently positive and statistically significant effect in
columns 1 and 2. These results are robust in columns 3 and 4 to measuring the growth rate
using the approach established by Davis et al. (1996) in the employment literature that corrects
for any potential bias associated with transitory shocks to growth and mean reversion.9

Notes: Table reports estimated coefficients from a regression in which the dependent variable is the state-level
annualized growth rate in real GDP per capita from 1900-2000. White heteroskedasticity robust standard errors
reported in parentheses. DHS growth rate refers to the growth rate measure as proposed by Davis, Haltiwanger,
and Schuh. Output data provided by Klein (2013) and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. ∗ ,∗∗ ,∗∗∗ represent that
coefficients statistically differ from 0 at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level.


  The economic magnitude of these estimates is especially informative. As an example, consider
Massachusetts (MA) versus Wyoming (WY). As shown in Figure 6, Massachusetts had 4 times
as many patents per capita than Wyoming during the twentieth century. Assume MA and WY

     Figure A-5 in appendix D shows that this strong positive relationship between long run growth and innovation
      holds for historical output calculated using the methodology of Martin (1939).

had the same initial GDP per capita in 1900 and identical population densities. Our estimated
coefficients imply that the gap between MA and WY would have increased dramatically as
illustrated in Figure 7. By the end of the century, MA would be 30% richer than WY just
because of the differences in their innovativeness.

                                          Instrumental Variables

We now attempt to identify a causal effect in our growth regressions using OSRD contracts for
wartime technological development as an instrument for innovation. Table 6 reports coefficients
from a regression of post-war state-level growth in GDP per capita for a four decade time horizon
(1947-1987) on state innovation levels immediately following World War II (1945-1950).11 We
report OLS estimates from this regression (columns 1, 2, 4, and 5) the corresponding IV estimates
using OSRD contracts as an instrument (columns 3 and 6) and the first stage regression of log
patents on the number of OSRD contracts (column 7).
   The first stage relationship is strongly positive and interesting in its own right. Several studies
including Barro (1981) and Field (2008) show that general wartime spending had little impact
on economic growth and may have even crowded out private sector investment. Fishback and
Cullen (2013) find that “growth in per capita measures of economic activity [to 1958] showed
little relationship with per capita war spending” and Jaworski (2015) finds little effect of general

11
     The results are similar if we instead study the effect of patenting during the war, between 1940 and 1945.

wartime spending on subsequent growth rates in the US South. These studies suggest that our
use of OSRD contracts as an instrument will not be invalidated by any correlated contempora-
neous response of GDP per capita to other forms of government-spending. Furthermore, OSRD
contracts were targeted towards technological development, whereas more general government
contract spending on combat-related equipment like aeroplanes and tanks or incidentals such as
clothing was not.
   Our instrumental variables strategy requires that these contracts were correlated with inno-
vation, uncorrelated with omitted determinants, and only influenced state growth rates through
their effect on innovation. Note that if the OSRD contracted with only the best firms or aca-
demic institutions (which it did not), this would not be a violation of the exclusion restriction,
so long as initial location decisions were orthogonal to a state’s future growth rate. A brief
survey of the institutional setting for the OSRD along with quantitative tests lends support to
the credibility of our instrumentation approach.

   The OSRD was established under President Roosevelt’s Executive Order in June 1941 and
operated until it was terminated in December 1947. It was headed by Vannevar Bush at the
Carnegie Institution of Washington. The OSRD was responsible for major innovations that
had an impact in wartime and beyond, including miniature electronics like the proximity fuse,
navigation systems, solid fuel rockets, detonators and most famously the basic science used in the
Manhattan Project (the Manhattan project was later transferred to the Manhattan District of
the Army Engineers). Because of its significant impact, the OSRD spurred federal involvement
in the development of US science and technology in the postwar years (Stephan (2014)).
   The OSRD did not operate laboratories of its own; rather it contracted out the development of
inventions. This reflected a new way of mobilizing public funding for the development of scientific



                                                        19
resources. During World War I scientists had worked at rudimentary laboratories established by
the government on an ad hoc basis, and there was a long-standing concern among scientists that
federal involvement in their activities would threaten creativity and intellectual independence.
As Mowery (2010, p.1227) comments, “the contractual arrangements developed by the OSRD
during World War II allowed the office to tap the expanded range of private sector and university
scientific and engineering capabilities that had developed during the interwar period.”
   However, the OSRD did not know ex ante which firms or academic institutions would be
successful because “the OSRD had long insisted that it was not working on materials or methods
of wide use in industry” (NAS, 1964, p.28). In fact, due to uncertainty, the OSRD sometimes
contracted with multiple entities to solve the same problem. The OSRD spent $450 million
in total, about six and a half times the federal budget for science in 1940. Around this time
universities had been spending about $50 million on research of which around $6 million was
funded by the federal government to support mostly agriculture-related research (Payne, 1992,
p.145). The OSRD created a large boost to firm-level R&D. For example, Radio Corporation of
America invested heavily at its plants in Indiana and New Jersey (Chandler, 2001 p.27-28).12
   We collected data on all contracts granted by the OSRD. We observe 1,717 contracts across
39 US States. The coverage of the OSRD contracts is wide. For example, Iowa State College
received 10 contracts and the University of New Mexico received 7 contracts. Firms and academic
institutions in the state of New York accounted for 30 percent of the total with the next largest
concentrations of contracts being in Massachusetts (13 percent) and Pennsylvania (11 percent).
The mean number of contracts per firm/academic institution is 4.3 and the median is 1. The
most prolific private firm in terms of contracting is the Western Electric Company with 107
contracts. The most prolific university is MIT which was granted 89 contracts.
   Using these data, columns 3 and 6 of Table 6 reveal that the OLS coefficients are confirmed by
the IV estimates. To evaluate the validity of the exclusion restriction, we provide quantitative
tests of the instrument in Table 7. Specifically, we check if contract allocation is correlated
with pre-trend growth. A main concern would be that OSRD contracts simply proxy for states
that were already growing relatively rapidly. We do not find a statistically significant effect of
pre-period growth rates on contract allocation for a range of different time periods.
   Finally, it is worth noting that the regression coefficients we have estimated in this section are
informative about time period effects and the nature of the channel through which innovation
influences economic growth. The effect we estimate at the state level (0.139 in Table 6) for the
period 1947-1987 is double the size of the effect we estimate at the state level (0.066 in Table
4) for the period 1900-2000. This difference is consistent with US technological leadership being
tightly linked to economic growth in the post World War II years (Nelson and Wright (1992)).
In turn, both coefficients in Table 6 and 4 are substantially smaller than the estimated aggregate
relationship between log GDP per capita and log patents from Figure 1 (0.64). When a new

12
     Procurement related contracts generally “allowed for work on a fixed price plus a reasonable profit for the
      contractor” ((Payne, 1992)). In terms of rights to patents, the contractor generally retained these, though the
      government was permitted to a royalty-free compulsory license from the contractor or to a patent buyout at a
      reasonable price. If the contractor chose not to patent, the government retained the right to do so, and would
      in turn grant the contractor a non-exclusive royalty free license to use the invention (Wellerstein, 2008).

product or process is invented, the knowledge embodied in the innovation diffuses across the
economy, and is not confined by state borders. Because we do not take into account the positive
cross-state spillovers from successful innovations our state-level estimates (and IV estimates) will
likely understate the aggregate relationship between innovation and economic growth. Equally,
this spillover argument may also contribute to the larger coefficient on innovation at the sector
level in Table 5 than is found at the state level. While knowledge may easily diffuse across
geographies and generate important spillover effects across states, knowledge at the sector-level
may be more specialized, and less likely to influence other sectors directly.

Fact 2. Densely-populated states were more inventive.

   We now seek to understand the environmental factors that determine whether a state is
particularly inventive. We first consider the relationship between urbanization and state-level
innovation. Table 1 shows population density was much higher in the most inventive states.
This finding is in line with two parallel literatures: First, a growing theoretical literature argu-
ing that human interaction is key for human capital accumulation and economic growth (e.g.,
Lucas (2009), Alvarez et al. (2013), Lucas and Moll (2014), Perla and Tonetti (2014)). Second,
the agglomeration literature has long argued that physical proximity promotes creativity, the
exchange of ideas and spillovers of knowledge capital among inventors (see Carlino and Kerr
(2015) for a survey). We also find that the top inventive states were associated with higher
levels of education and higher skilled occupations. Although inventor expropriation risk can
be higher in cities where competing inventors can more easily learn about ideas, these results




                                                      21
are consistent with denser places being more likely to create positive externalities that lead to
sustained economic growth.
   Figure 9 confirms the relationship between urbanization and innovation. Panel A plots the
percent of a state’s population that lives in an urban area in the 1940 census against the average
number of patents per capita granted in that state between 1940 and 2004. We see a robust
positive relationship between a state’s degree of urbanization and future inventive activity. This
relationship is significantly different from zero at the 1% level. A one standard deviation increase
in the percent of a population living in an urban area is associated with an increase in innovation
that is 41.5% of its mean. Because the Census adopts a low threshold for urbanization as
places that encompass at least 2,500 people, we repeated the analysis at different thresholds
with substantively the same result.13 Panel B repeats the same analysis using the fraction of
population living on a farm. It shows that average patents per 10,000 people between 1940 and
1960 was decreasing in the percent of the population living on a farm in 1940.

   Robustness. We now show that the positive link between population density and innovation
shown in Figure 9 holds at a finer level of aggregation. Table 8 report OLS estimates confirming
a statistically significant relationship between innovation and population density at the county-
level. To aid interpretation, we standardize the independent variables to have a zero mean and
unit standard deviation. Table 8 also shows that this estimated relationship is not entirely driven
by the sectoral composition of urban counties. Columns 2 and 4 control for the fraction of the
population working in agriculture or manufacturing and condition on state fixed effects. More
densely populated counties were also more inventive, even conditional on the county’s industry
mix and characteristics common to states. Conditional on our set of controls, a one standard
deviation in the percent of a county’s residents living in an urban area is associated with an

     In Figure 9 Panel A, the slope coefficient is 0.063. When we use a threshold of 5,000 people the coefficient is
      0.061 and at 10,000 people the coefficient is 0.056. All are significantly significant at the 1% level.

Fact 3. Financially-developed states were more inventive.
   There is a vast literature relating access to capital and innovation. Cross-country growth re-
gressions have shown that higher levels of financial development are associated with faster rates
of economic growth (e.g., King and Levine (1993), Rajan and Zingales (1998)). Within the US
a range of evidence indicates capital availability mattered for innovation. For example, Lam-
oreaux et al. (2004) find that venture-style provision of capital dramatically reduced financing
constraints for inventors in Cleveland, an important Second Industrial Revolution city. Accord-
ing to Kortum and Lerner (2000) venture capital had a strong causal impact on patenting rates
in the US in the late twentieth century.
   Modern financial markets are largely national in scope but were more local in the early twen-
tieth century. Because of legal constraints on the functioning of the banking sector, banks were
limited in their ability to operate across state lines and were often made up of unit banks that
serviced local communities. Although California had extensive branching outside the bank’s
home office city this was not the norm (Carlson and Mitchener (2009)). From individual in-
ventors up to large, publicly-traded corporations, an important component of finance could be
sourced locally (Nanda and Nicholas (2009)). As such, one might expect a positive relationship
between the health of a state’s financial market and its propensity to innovate.
   Measuring the level of financial development is fraught with difficulties. Private transactions
between investors and inventors are not observable systematically and most later stage R&D
is financed by firms internally. However, we can gain useful insights using FDIC data, which
provides broad indicators of financial market development. We measure the health of a state’s
financial sector by bank deposits per capita in 1920 in order to proxy for the size of available
funds in the state. We choose 1920 in order to avoid the pre-Depression inflation in stock prices
and the market’s subsequent collapse. Figure 10 plots the relationship, showing that a healthier
financial sector is correlated with greater innovation levels, in line with expectations.

   Robustness.     We now repeat and extend the analysis at the county-level. For this purpose
we exploit the fact that dependence on external financial might vary across different types of
inventors: those operating outside and inside the boundaries of corporations. Specifically, we
would expect independent inventors to be more responsive to changes in the external financing
environment than firms, where internal funds would be a more important driver of R&D in-
vestment. Empirical studies have shown that larger and more established firms exhibit a strong
preference for financing innovation internally, to the point where they manage their cash flows
in order to be able to do so (e.g., Hall and Lerner (2009)). With this fact in mind, Table 9 cor-
relates individual- and firm-level patenting with the measure of financial development. Columns
1 and 4 reproduce at the county-level the basic correlation shown at the state-level in Figure 10.
Columns 2 and 5 introduce sectoral controls as well as state fixed effects.
   The results show a clear relationship between innovation and the level of financial development,
and in the direction that we would expect based on the groups of inventors on which these
specifications are run. The coefficients are more precisely estimated for non-corporate versus
corporate patenting and their economic magnitude is also larger. Moreover, the results are
robust to the possibility that even though the availability of finance may have been local at this
time, inventors may have crossed state borders to access capital. When we run regressions at
the state level in columns 3 and 6 we find a strong and statistically significant effect of finance
on innovation for non-corporate patentees for whom we would expect the effect to be largest.

Fact 4. Geographically-connected states were more inventive.

  Another important dimension for innovation is access to other geographical regions. This could
increase both the market size for innovation and the potential flow of knowledge spillovers. Both

mechanisms receive support in the literature. Acemoglu and Linn (2004) and Aghion et al.
(2016) have shown that market size is a crucial factor for innovation in the pharmaceutical
and auto industries, respectively. Sokoloff (1988) found that inventive activity in the early
nineteenth century accelerated in locations that were proximate to navigable waterways, while
Perlman (2016) finds strong effects on invention and agglomeration from the nineteenth century
development of railroads. Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016) measure the increased level of market
access caused by an expansion of the US railroad network between 1870 to 1890, finding the
aggregate impact on growth to be large.
   We use data provided by Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016) to investigate the relationship be-
tween a state’s geographic connectivity and its level of patenting. By observing the development
of roads, railroad, and waterways over time, and assigning different per-mile costs to each mode
of transport, they construct the cost of shipping one ton of goods between every county pair in
the United States every 10 years from 1830 through 1920. A high cost of shipping goods out of
a state indicates that the state is geographically isolated.
   Geographic connectivity may increase innovation both by allowing inventors to sell their inven-
tions to a larger market, and by encouraging the free exchange of ideas across geographies. The
average cost to transport goods out of a state is an imperfect proxy of these two measures. We
therefore consider alternative measures of geographic connectivity derived from these transport
cost data. Additionally, we ask whether the observed positive relationship between geographic
connectivity and innovation persists at the more granular county level.
   We construct two measures of a county’s connectivity. Define κc,c0 to be the cost to ship one
ton of goods from county c to county c0 in 1880, and let κ̄c be the weighted average outgoing
transport cost for county c:
                                              1 X

for N the number of distinct c0 . To account for the fact that connection to markets with more
economic activity may increase the reward to innovating more than connection to relatively
poor areas, we weight these averages by the mean wage income in county c0 in our principal
measures.14 Let µ and σ be the mean and standard deviation, respectively, of κ̄c in the sample.

A one unit increase in a county c’s cost advantage has the interpretation that the average out-
bound transport cost for county c is one standard deviation below the mean outgoing transport
cost. Our second measure of connectivity measures the number of people who live in counties
which lay within the median county-to-county transport costs radius of c. Specifically, letting
π 50 be the median value of κc,c0 , define M (c) = {c0 : κc,c0 ≤ π 50 } to be the set of counties within
median county-to-county transport costs of c. For Pc to the population living in county c in
1880, we define a county’s “market size” to be

  The agglomeration literature would predict a positive relationship between transport cost
advantage and innovation. Figure 11 tests this hypothesis.

all states. However, closer inspection reveals that the weak relationship between transport cost
advantage and innovation is driven by a number of states with high transport costs. These
states are all in the West of the United States. Although regional economies within the country
integrated to form a national economy from the nineteenth to the early twentieth centuries (Kim
(1995)), in such places the cost of transporting people, goods and information still represented
a significant constraint.
   Hence, the results are notably different when we consider the older, more integrated East
Coast and Midwestern states where economic activity was concentrated. At the turn of the
twentieth century the manufacturing belt contained almost three quarters of total manufacturing
employment (Krugman (1991)). Panel B focuses only on the states with average shipping costs
below $18, which includes most of this area. The nonlinearity is important. Among the states
where the average outgoing transportation cost is below $18, the relationship between innovation
and transportation cost advantage is strongly positive, suggesting that access to outside markets
was an important component of innovation among traditionally developed states.

  Robustness. These state-level patterns are confirmed through county-level analysis in Table
10. We report the coefficients from a county-level regression of patents per 10,000 residents on
our two measures of county connectivity.

Notes: Table presents estimates from OLS regressions of average patents per 10,000 between 1920 and 1940 on the
degree of state geographic connectivity in 1920, as measured by a state’s cost advantage or the population living
within median transport cost of the county. A one unit increase in a state’s cost advantage has the interpretation
that the average outbound transport cost is one standard deviation below the mean outgoing transport cost in
that state. All independent variables measured as of 1920 and standardized to have zero mean and unit standard
deviation. Standard errors clustered at state level reported in parentheses. Observation counts drop in columns
2 and 4 due to missing occupation data in the county. ∗ ,∗∗ ,∗∗∗ represent that coefficients statistically differ from

   Columns 1 and 3 show little evidence that more connected counties were more innovative,
unconditional on any covariates. However, this is subject to the same concerns as the state-
level scatter plots presented in Figure 11: grouping states further westward with established
eastern states masks the economic mechanisms at play during this time period. Once we control
for state fixed effects and the county-level sectoral mix in columns 2 and 4, we find a strong
positive relationship between a county’s geographic connectivity and its innovation intensity. A

one standard deviation increase in a county’s cost advantage (market size) is associated with an
increase in patents per 10,000 of 0.583 (0.713) between 1920 and 1940, conditional on state fixed
effects.

Fact 5. States associated with slavery were less inventive but religiosity is not
robustly correlated with inventiveness.

   One potential explanation for these underlying state-level and county-level differences is that
innovative places are relatively more open to unconventional and disruptive technological ideas.
The recent literature has shown that the opening of the labor force to women and minorities
has important consequences for growth. Viewing the changes in labor market outcomes for
women and minorities through the lens of a Roy (1951) model, Hsieh et al. (2013) show that the
convergence in the occupational distribution between white men, women, and black Americans
can account for 15 to 20% of growth in aggregate output per worker between 1960 and 2010.
The effect of this convergence on innovation, however, remains an open question.
   Cultural differences may be an important determinant of a region’s innovative activity and
growth ((Gorodnichenko and Roland, 2011)). Yet, culture can have a positive or a negative
effect. For example, productive aspects of social capital have been linked to financial development
(Guiso et al. (2004)), whereas negative aspects of social capital have been linked to the rise of
fascism (Satyanath et al. (2016)). Insofar as the makeup of society influences the incentives
for creative invention (e.g., Florida (2002), Acemoglu et al. (2014)), we would expect to find
correlations between a state’s level of innovation and its demographic characteristics.15
   An important aspect of openness of a society to innovation and economic growth could be
seen from its approach towards slavery. Wright (1986) argues that the southern economy of
the US was constrained by a lack of technological innovation in agriculture and manufacturing
because of slavery. Slavery can undermine trust, having a persistent effect on beliefs and behavior
(Nunn and Wantchekon, 2011). A lack of cultural freedom to deviate from established norms can
strongly inhibit innovation. Cook (2011) finds that while African American inventors often made
important technological discoveries during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, they
were much less likely to do so in closed environments such as places that implemented segregation
laws. Logan and Parman (2015) link racial sorting to a doubling in a newly constructed index
of residential segregation in the US between 1880 and 1940.
   Another important dimension through which societal attitudes towards innovation and eco-
nomic growth can be shaped is through religion. Following Weber, “ascetic Protestantism”—the
idea that idleness is sinful and rigorous self-discipline is necessary to serve God—is often hypoth-
esized to have a positive effect on economic growth, though the relationship has proved difficult
to verify empirically (e.g., Cantoni (2015)). A more recent set of studies has directly addressed
the question of whether religiosity promotes or inhibits innovation. Benabou et al. (2013) and
Benabou et al. (2015) conclude that the relationship is robust and strongly negative. While their

     Another project attempts to match patent data to the Censuses. Sarada et al. (2016) match patent data from
      the Annual Report of the Commissioner of Patents at decennial intervals from 1870 to 1940 to the US Federal
      Population Censuses in those years. Their study is complementary to ours as it focuses on the relationship
      between the demographics of patentees and economic and demographic characteristics at the county-level.

evidence is compelling for the United States in the modern era, we lack corresponding empirical
evidence on the relationship between religion and innovation for the US in our time period.
   We incorporate slavery and religion into our analysis. We use data from the 1860 Census to
determine the percentage of slave-owning families.16 If a state’s slave ownership rate captures
a society’s openness to change, one would expect that innovation would correlate negatively
with the slave ownership rate. Given the multidimensional nature of religion we use a variety
of measures based on data in the Census of Religious Bodies. Specifically, we construct two
measures: the share of the population belonging to any religion, and a Herfindahl Index of
religious membership. The intuition behind the last measure is that it captures religious diversity
and therefore the extent to which different beliefs are tolerated within broad communities. This
variable proxies for the degree of openness to disruptive ideas, as a conduit to technological
innovation (Acemoglu et al. (2014)).
   Our results with respect to slavery have a natural interpretation. Figure 12 shows the re-
lationship is unambiguously negative and statistically significant both when we correlate slave
ownership with patenting in all US states and when we do this for only states in the south-
ern part of the country, where slavery was most prevalent. The basic correlation can be taken
alongside the descriptive statistics in Table 1 showing that slave states were disproportionately
among the least inventive in the United States. Our findings are consistent with the view that
slavery severely stunted economic growth (e.g., Wright (2006)).

Notes: Figure plots the relationship between the percent of families which owned slaves in the 1860 census, and
the average patents per capita between 1880 and 1940. Panel A plots the relationship for all states, while Panel
B only includes states which have positive slave ownership rates. Many northern states did not have positive
slave ownership in the 1860s. Source: 1860 Historical Census Data, USPTO patent records.


  As shown in Figure 13, the relationship between religion and inventiveness is more complex.
We find no strong correlation at the state level between the Herfindahl Index of religious openness
measure (Panel A), or the share of the population of a state belonging to a religion (Panel B) and
inventiveness. Although these findings contrast with Benabou et al. (2013) and Benabou et al.
(2015) this difference could be explained by the fact that the effect of religion on innovation may

literacy and access to education (Goldin and Katz (2001)). The positive (though statistically
insignificant) effect of religion that we find in Figure 13 may simply be capturing the underlying
impact of human capital. The upshot of these results is that the effect of religion on innovation
at the state-level is ambiguous.

variable.

  Although with additional controls for occupational mix the coefficient becomes statistically
insignificant in column 2 and even reverses sign, this only tells us that differences in the share



                                                                                                                                                 30
of slave ownership across counties but within states had no effect on patenting. Variation in the
cross-section of counties (and states) should be more important in this case given that unob-
servable traits like discrimination or institutional weaknesses that would be strongly correlated
with slavery will tend to be be fixed within states.17
   Table 12 reports corresponding estimates at the county-level for the relationship between
religion and patenting. In columns 1 and 2 the coefficients on the Herfindahl Index of religious
membership are economically small and statistically indistinguishable from zero. However, we
do find a negative estimate in columns 3 and 4 on the broadest measure of religiosity, which
is statistically significant in column 4. This finding is consistent with the negative effect found
by Benabou et al. (2013) and Benabou et al. (2015) for the modern era. Overall, however,
when taking the evidence in 13 and Table 12 together, it appears that religion was not a strong
predictor of technological development during the US golden age.

                                          3.2      Personal Facts
Moving on from environmental factors, we now make use of our microdata to present facts about
the inventors of the golden age. While the macroeconomic facts we presented above are informed
by linking our patent data to regional aggregates, this section relies largely on our dataset of
patents matched to the Censuses. We examine the personal background of inventors, paying
special attention to their educational attainment and age, entry and exit over the life cycle of
inventiveness, lifetime migration decisions and marriage patterns.

     In Table 11 when we run the regression in column 2 without state fixed effects and just with controls the
      coefficient is still negative (-0.169, s.e. 0.232). Alternatively, if we include just state fixed effects but no
      controls, the sign on the coefficient reverses (0.179, s.e. 0.225).

Fact 6. Inventors were more educated on average and were most productive between
the age of 36 and 55.

   A large literature suggests that education is a key factor for economic growth (see, for instance,
Lucas (1998), Benhabib and Spiegel (1994), Bils and Klenow (2000), Goldin and Katz (2009),
Barro (2001), Vandenbussche et al. (2006), Stokey (1991)). One of the main channels through
which education affects economic growth may be its impact on innovation. Figure 14 shows the
number of inventors per 10,000 people within each education group. While education seems to
be an important determinant of becoming an inventor, the effect is particularly strong at the
college degree level. Although the 1940 Census tended to overstate education levels (Goldin
(1998)) the differences we see between categories are large. For example, an individual with at
least a college degree is four times more likely to become an inventor than an individual with
just a high-school diploma. Indeed, 40% of inventors had a college degree in 1940, compared
with just 10% of the non-inventor population.

   The opportunity cost of education is time spent in an active career. In theoretical models
of education, individuals face a tradeoff between the benefits of higher education, which ac-
cumulate over the life cycle, and the costs which are incurred early on (Becker (1967), Card
(2001)). By extension economic growth can be affected by the tradeoff inventors face between
acquiring human capital to innovate and the potential delays this creates in the production of
new technological discoveries that, in turn, benefit society. Jones (2010) argues that if true
breakthroughs are developed by younger cohorts of individuals, the growth-slowing delay effect
can be pronounced, especially if more human capital is required for the production of creative
ideas as the demands of developing novel innovations increases over time. He finds that the age
of great invention shifted upwards by about half a decade over the twentieth century.
   We find that inventors were most productive between ages 35-55 as illustrated in Figure 15.



                                                                                                      32
This is true for males and females, although we observe few female inventors. Interestingly, as
shown by Sarada et al. (2016) the average age of invention in 1900 was approximately 40 years
old, about what it is converging to today. Our data indicate that inventors had a reasonably
long productive career-length. Long career-length is consistent with Khan and Sokoloff (2004)’s
data on superstar inventors. They found that while 37 percent born prior to 1820 had careers
over 30 years, 57 percent did in their post-1820 birth cohorts. A broad inventor life cycle, like
we observe, tends to maximize creative output (Galenson, 2016).

Fact 7. Inventors were positively selected through exit early in their careers, but
were less productive and more likely to exit late in their careers.

   We extend the analysis to study career dynamics. If inventors approximate the life cy-
cle of firms, some should enter, develop and succeed whereas others should fail and exit—
entrepreneurial churn is an essential feature of a well-functioning innovation sector (Haltiwanger
(2012)). There is a large growth literature examining firm selection and its mechanism. Ace-
moglu et al. (2015) examine potential misallocation of R&D inputs using a model in which old
firms may be positively selected through endogenous exit of low-quality firms (as in Jovanovic
(1982) and Hopenhayn (1992)), or negatively selected through obsolescence.
   Figure 16 plots the career cycle of inventors using the universe of inventor data, as opposed to
just the inventor data matched to the Census. Panel A plots the exit rate for inventors over their
life cycle, where an inventor is said to have exited in period t if they file no successful patent
applications in every period t0 > t. Panel B plots the average number of patents conditional on
survival for inventors over their tenure in the data. In both panels, the horizontal axis plots the
number of years since the inventor filed his first successful patent application.

   The figure reveals both similarities and differences with the life cycle dynamics of firms. We
find evidence for both positive selection through exit, and eventual obsolescence of inventors.
Panel A of Figure 16 shows that inventor exit rates exhibit a U-shape, while Panel B shows
that the number of patents conditional on survival has an inverted-U shape over the life cycle.
Positive selection occurs early in an inventor’s career, where low productivity inventors stop
applying for patents. This yields a decreasing exit rate and increasing average productivity over
the average inventor’s life cycle. In later years of life, however, skill obsolescence and old age set
in, reducing inventor productivity, and increasing exit rates. In the limit, biological constraints
ensure that the inventor exit rate converges to one.

Fact 8. The patents of new inventors received more citations on average, and were
more likely to be in the top decile of the citation distribution.

  Young firms are an important source of employment creation (Haltiwanger, 2012), and the
entry of young firms may yield particularly radical innovations. Akcigit and Kerr (2016) estimate
a model with heterogeneous innovations and find that innovative young firms do indeed invest
more heavily, relative to their size, in products outside their normal span of expertise. Bernstein
(2015) shows that publicly listed firms have less novel innovations and instead advance internal
projects. In a recent survey, Lerner (2012) examines the advantages and liabilities of large
companies for pursuing new innovation areas compared to start-ups.
  There are reasons to suspect that the economics governing the differences between young and
old firms might not carry over to the dynamics of a human inventor’s career. For instance,
the intuition laid out in the Lucas (1978) span-of-control model suggests that large firms might
curtail innovation due to limits on its managers’ time. On the other hand, there might exist
innovation benefits for old, large firms if idea circulation is key to the innovative process (Hellman
and Perotti, 2011). These mechanisms rely on the organizational structure of a firm, which has
no clear counterpoint in an individual inventor’s life cycle.



                                                                    34
   We therefore investigate the quality of the patents granted to inventors over their career
path. We proxy a patent’s quality and influence by considering its citation count, adjusted
following the methodology of (Hall et al. (2001)). Figure 17 plots various moments of the patent
quality distribution measured each year of an inventor’s career, conditional on survival. Panel
A plots the probability that a patent granted t years after the inventor’s first successful patent
application lies in the bottom quartile and Panel B repeats the same exercise with the top
quartile of citations received. They show that patents granted by new inventors are more likely
to be highly cited than patents granted by inventors with a long record of patenting, mirroring
the dynamics of innovative firms found in the previous literature. Indeed, patents in the first year
of an inventor’s inventive tenure are 4.74 percentage points more likely to lie in the top quartile
of patent citations, and 3.3 percentage points less likely to be in the bottom quartile than are
patents granted 6 or more years after the inventor’s first patent, conditional on individual and
technology-year fixed effects. These plots are especially striking since they are conditional on
survival, given that Figure 16 shows positive selection, measured by raw patent counts, among
inventors who continue to innovate over a long career.

a patent was granted t years after the inventor’s first appearance in the patent data. All regressions include
individual and technology-year fixed effects. Grey bands indicate 95% confidence interval around point estimates,

   Table 13 repeats the same analysis in a regression framework. Column 1 regresses the log of
citations on an an indicator that is equal to 1 if the patent is granted within the first two years
of inventor career and 0 otherwise. It shows clearly that patents obtained early in the career are
of higher quality on average. Columns 2 to 5 replace the dependent variable with an indicator
showing if the patent belongs to the relevant citation quartile. Again, on average, we see that
inventors produce more influential work early in their career.

Fact 9. Inventors delayed marriage and had fewer children.

  To the extent that this life cycle dynamic created tradeoffs with respect to time allocation,
one area in which we would expect to observe this is through marriage. Theory models specify

that commitment to a spouse soaks up time and effort, and that if married partners did not gain
from a union then they would remain single (e.g., Becker (1974)).
   Anecdotally, some of the most prolific inventors did not believe in marriage. Nikola Tesla
thought that marriage was inconsistent with great invention. He commented in the New York
Herald in 1897 “I do not believe an inventor should marry, because he has so intense a nature,
with so much in it of wild, passionate quality, that in giving himself to a woman he might love,
he would give everything, and so take everything from his chosen field.” Tesla went on to argue
that “I do not think you can name many great inventions that have been made by married men.”
However, other great inventors did marry. Elias Howe (1819-1867), the sewing machine inventor,
married when he was 21 years of age. Thomas Edison married first at age 24 and within a year
had developed the revolutionary quadruplex telegraph for sending messages simultaneously over
a single wire. Following the death of his first wife, Edison married again at age 39.

Notes: This figure plots the probability that an individual is married over their life cycle using data averaged
across our six census years (1880, 1900, 1910, 1920, 1930, 1940). The data are constructed from this repeated
cross section. The solid green line shows the marriage rate for inventors, while the red dashed line shows the
rate for the universe of non-inventors. For comparison, the marriage rate for non-inventor high-skill occupations
is plotted in the blue dotted line. Source: 1880-1940 Historical Census Data, USPTO patent records.




                                                                                  36
   Figure 18 shows that inventors delayed marriage substantially relative to the population as a
whole although inventors did indeed marry (or stay married) at a higher rate than their non-
inventor counterparts at older ages. Inventors also tended to have fewer children. Table 3 above
shows that inventors delayed fertility relative to the average American: 72.9% of inventors had
a child before the age of 35, while 80% of non-inventors had a child by this time. Of course the
relationship between delayed marriage and fewer children is mechanical. As Becker (1974, p.22)
points out, “the age of entry [into marriage] would be earlier the larger the number of children
desired.”
   Figure 18 also plots the probability of marriage for those working in a high-skill occupation,
such as doctors and lawyers. The figure shows that inventors’ marriage decision mirrors that of
this group almost one-for-one. This comparison suggests that inventors’ difference from the rest
of the population is driven by underlying skill differences and human capital investment choices.
This similarity in observable marriage patterns with high-skill workers can be reconciled with
theoretical models of marriage markets like Bergstrom and Bagnoli (1993), where high-wage men
gain by delaying marriage relative to low-wage men because accumulated income is a signal of
quality when searching for the best partner.

Fact 10. Inventors were more likely to have migrated from their state of birth.
They moved to states that were more conducive to innovation.

   Individuals migrate in order to seek better job prospects in their destination state. This
argument may apply particularly strongly for inventors, since, as shown above, environmental
factors shift both the costs and benefits of innovation. The example of Thomas Edison illustrates
this point. Not only did he stand to gain more from marketing his inventions in the larger market
of New Jersey and New York but he also benefitted from the larger supply of skilled labor and
financial development there. When inventors systematically move to such places, this generates
spatial concentration giving rise to agglomeration externalities (Carlino and Kerr (2015)).
   Figure 19 confirms that Edison’s example is representative of the broader inventor population.
The figure shows that inventors were most likely to move after the age of 35: the beginning of
their most innovative period according to Figure 15. The high migration rate for inventors does
not simply reflect their higher average skill level. Indeed, we see that highly skilled individuals
in non-inventor occupations migrate significantly less than do inventors.
   Migration can boost innovation at a more aggregate level as well. Immigrants can bring new
ideas, expertise, and specialized labor to an area, all of which facilitate the production of patented
innovations. Although modern studies have produced opposing conclusions on the role played
by immigrants in US knowledge production (e.g., Kerr and Lincoln (2010); Hunt and Gauthier-
Loiselle (2010); Borjas and Doran (2012)), historical evidence is more unequivocal. Moser et al.
(2014) estimates that German emigres who fled the Nazi regime provided a significant boost to
US invention during the twentieth century. In our data, Table 1 shows higher levels of interstate
and international migration in inventive states. The higher share of international migrants we
see in the top 10 inventive states is in line with Akcigit et al. (2016b)’s finding that inventors
are internationally highly mobile. In the top 10 most inventive states, 20.6% of the population

Notes: Figure plots interstate migration rates by age of individual for the population of high skill individuals.
An individual is defined to be an interstate migrant if their birth state is different from their current state of
residence. Each point represents a 5-year forward-looking bin. For example, the point at age 20 measures the
average migration rate for 20 to 25 year-olds. Figure uses data averaged across the four census years for which
we have occupation information: 1880, 1920, 1930, and 1940. Source: 1880, 1920-1940 Historical Census Data,

were international migrants, while just 1.7% of the population of the least inventive states were
born abroad.
   Conditional on moving to a new location, where did inventors go? To answer this question,
Figure 20 plots the characteristics of geographic origin and destination amongst inventors who
move across state lines in our matched dataset of inventors to the Census. To facilitate the
exposition, a 45-degree line is also plotted which denotes no change at all. To understand the
plot, consider a point with 20 on the horizontal axis, and 60 on the vertical axis in Panel A.
This point shows that an inventor migrant from a state in which 20% of the population lives in
an urban area moves to a state with 60% of the population living in an urban area on average.
   Most of the observations are clustered above the 45-degree line in Panel A, implying that
inventors generally moved from less to more urbanized regions. Likewise, Panel B shows that
inventors moved toward regions where deposit ratios were higher, suggesting that access to
finance could have played a role in their migration decisions. Panel C shows that inventors
moved toward regions where slave-ownership had been lower. Panel D shows little movement to
places with a strong religious presence. Overall, inventors generally migrated to regions whose
characteristics were well-suited to innovation.18


              3.3     Family Background: Who Became an Inventor?
Having documented the basic facts about inventor careers, demographics and education, we now
examine family backgrounds. Does parental affluence matter for the propensity to become an
18
     Equally these were places where the population was moving as well. Thus while Figure 19 shows inventors
      were much more likely to migrate than were non-inventors, conditional on migrating, inventors moved largely
      in lock-step with non-inventors. This is how clusters of economic activity start to emerge: the movement of
      people to centers of innovation becomes cumulative as it reduces the cost of moving products, accessing labor
      and diffusing new ideas (Ellison et al. (2010)).

inventor? If so, through what mechanisms might this operate? Throughout this section we rely
heavily on our parent-child matched dataset.19 Because this covers individuals residing in the
same household, we are capturing inventors early in their career. Home-leaving ages increased
noticeably during the early twentieth century only starting to decline after World War II. Using
Census data Gutmann et al. (2002) find that in 1940 the median home-leaving age for white
males was 24 whereas 85% of unmarried white males lived at home between ages 15 and 29.

Fact 11. Father’s income was positively correlated with becoming an inventor. This
effect disappears once child’s education is controlled for.

  Figure 21 illustrates the relationship between father’s income and the probability of becoming
an inventor. We find a strong association between the two, especially for the highest-income
fathers. The convex relationship between parental income and the propensity to become an
inventor is striking in its ubiquity. Aghion et al. (2015b) and Bell et al. (2015) document re-
markably similar patterns in modern administrative data from Finland and the United States,

respectively. The persistence of this relationship across time periods, geographies, and institu-
tions is among the most noteworthy facts in this new literature on the backgrounds of inventors.
   Several mechanisms can plausibly drive the patterns illustrated in Figure 21. If education
was an important determinant of innovation, then the fact that only wealthy individuals had
access to education could imply that credit constraints were binding for low-income families (e.g.,
Celik (2015)). Furthermore, credit constraints may inhibit the ability of prospective inventors
to raise starting capital to develop their ideas. Alternatively, it is possible that high income
parents interact in better-connected social circles, permitting their children to access high-quality
funding, labor, and marketing resources. Finally, high income parents may have useful skills,
knowledge, or genes which they pass on to their children.
   We provide insight into some of these potential mechanisms through Table 14, which examines
the relationship between fathers and sons using linear probability regressions. The dependent
variable is an indicator for being granted at least one patent, scaled by a factor of 100 for
legibility. Column 1 establishes a positive correlation between the father being an inventor and
the child being an inventor. Column 2 introduces parental income instead and column 3 includes
both measures. Having a father with income in the right tail of the distribution is very strongly
correlated with the child becoming an inventor, even conditional on basic covariates.
   Of course, a potentially confounding effect is that high-income parents could themselves be
highly-educated, and so invest more in their children’s development. To address this, column
4 adds parental education. Interestingly, parental income still matters. Finally, in column 5
we include the child’s own education. The effect of parental income disappears, which suggests
that parental income only positively affects the probability of becoming an inventor through its
effect on children’s access to education. In column 6 we show that this finding is robust to the

   While Table 14 focuses on the extensive margin—the characteristics of those becoming inventors—
Table 15 considers the relationship between an inventor’s background and his productivity on
the intensive margin, measured by the number of career patents and citations he generates. In
column 1 we find a weak positive effect of the father being an inventor. In columns 2 through
4 and 6 through 8, we do not detect a strong effect of father’s income, or father’s education.
In column 5 we introduce the child’s own education and this is strongly correlated with long
run inventiveness. In other words, the most highly educated inventors tended to be the most
productive.
   Two findings emerge when taking Table 14 and Table 15 together. First, the importance of
education holds both at the extensive and intensive margins, which is consistent with a human
capital explanation of invention. Second, both father inventor status and parental income matter
on the extensive margin but not on the intensive margin, which suggests that the existence of
credit constraints might have undermined inventiveness. This second finding is related to a long
line of research in the family firm and management practice literatures, showing that privileged
access to career paths (e.g., inherited CEO roles) is associated with under performance (e.g.,
Perez-Gonzalez (2006); Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) Caselli and Gennaioli (2013)).

                                  3.4      Return to Innovation
With our dataset of inventors matched to the 1940 Census we can examine the private returns to
innovation, with two caveats in mind. First, information on labor income is not recorded for all
observations in the Census; and second labor income itself provides only a partial measure of the
total financial returns to innovation. The discovery of new inventions may permit individuals
to start their own business and earn a return on new capital assets. Hurst and Pugsley (2011)
show that non-wage factors may be an important benefit of self-employment.
  What we can do is examine the distribution and life cycle of wage earnings for inventors, both
unconditionally and conditional on observable characteristics. Insights from inventor earnings
profiles are important because the literature in this area is quite sparse due to data constraints.
There is no systematic empirical evidence on inventor earnings during the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries, even though anecdotally this was seen to be a key determinant of
inventor behavior. Schmookler (1966) argued that the expectation of pecuniary gain was implicit
to most inventors’ careers, citing Thomas Edison as an inventor whose motivations were largely
commercial and demand-driven by anticipated market size.
  Even for modern periods, few studies on the profile of inventor earnings exist. There are some
studies on the topic, however. For example, Astebro (2003) characterises the distribution of
returns to independent invention for Canadian inventors between 1976 and 1993 as being highly




                                                        42
skewed, with the average inventor earning less than an equivalent investment in a portfolio of
high-risk securities. Toivanen and Vaananen (2012) estimate a varying premium across inven-
tions for a sample of Finnish inventors who patented in the US between 1991 and 1999, although
they show the returns to the quality of technological development are particularly high. Depalo
and Di Addario (2014) also find that superstar Italian inventors patenting between 1987 and
2006 earned the most.

Fact 12. Successful patentees had substantially higher labor income, even control-
ling for demographics, occupation, and education.

  Figure 22 plots the distribution of wage income for inventors and non-inventors in the 1940
Census. Panel A plots the unconditional CDF of log wage income for both groups. The solid
green line represents the distribution of inventors’ income, while the dashed red line shows the
distribution for non-inventors. Unsurprisingly, inventors have relatively high incomes. Indeed,
the inventors’ income distribution first order stochastically dominates that of non-inventors.

Notes: Figure plots the distribution of the natural log of wage income for inventors and non-inventors, as reported
in the 1940 census. Many individuals report 0 wages, and are excluded from this plot. Solid green lines plot the
distribution of inventors’ wages, while dashed red lines plot the distribution of non-inventors’ wages. Panel A
plots the unconditional CDF of log wages. Panel B plots the density of log wages residualized against observable
characteristics. Specifically, it plots the distribution of residuals from a regression in which the dependent variable
is log wages, and includes controls for race, education, sex, international migrant status, residence state fixed
effects, occupation fixed effects, and a quadratic in age. Source: 1940 Historical Census Data, USPTO patent
records.

   Of course, this result is expected given that inventors are better-educated, higher-skilled, and
live in more urban states than non-inventors. Panel B therefore plots the distribution of wages
for inventors and non-inventors after conditioning on observables. Specifically, we regress an
individual’s log wages on race, education, sex, international migrant status, residence state fixed
effects, occupation fixed effects, and a quadratic in age. We then plot the distribution of residuals
from this regression for inventors and non-inventors. Even after controlling for all observable
characteristics, inventors have higher wage incomes throughout the distribution.
   Inventors also have a steeper life cycle profile of wages. Figure 23 plots the average life cycle
of log earnings for inventors, non-inventors, and non-inventors in high skill occupations. This



                                                                                      43
figure is constructed from the cross-section of individuals at each age. We see that inventors
have higher earnings throughout their life cycle than non-inventors and high-skilled individuals.
Indeed, Table A-5 in the Appendix shows that the difference between the wages of inventors and
high-skill non-inventors is statistically significant at the 1% level from the age of 19 onwards.
These figures provide suggestive evidence that invention was a key labor income differentiator.

Fact 13. Inventor’s income was highly correlated with the quality of invention, as
measured by patent citations.

   If the returns to invention reflected pecuniary gains from technological development we would
also expect to observe a correlation between labor income and the quality of patents. Our data
shows a strong correlation between the the quality of an inventor’s patent portfolio and log
wages. Figure 24 Panel A plots the relationship between the number of patents an inventor files
over his life time and log average wages. Panel B mirrors Panel A, except the horizontal axis
now weights each patent in an inventors portfolio by the number of citations the patent receives.
Both panels exhibit a robust positive relationship between inventor productivity and log wages,
suggesting that the higher-quality inventors were being compensated for their inventions.
   There are two possible explanations for this positive relationship between wages and inventor
productivity. First, an inventor may simply be more productive as a result of his past inventions.
Alternatively, if invention is a signal of underlying worker type, an employer may pay an inventor
more of a financial premium in anticipation of future productivity.
   To disentangle these two effects, we regress log wages, measured in 1940, on an inventor’s
innovative activity both before and after 1940. If the current productivity effect dominates, we
would expect pre-1940 innovation to have a strong effect on wages. However, if the anticipation
effect dominates, the forward-looking innovative activity should predict an inventor’s wages,

so long as employers correctly anticipate an employee’s future productivity. The results are
reported in Table 16. Each regression controls for inventor demographics, education, and state.
Whether we measure innovative activity as the log number of patents or as the log number of
citations received, we find the anticipation effect to be a stronger determinant of wages.
   One might expect the anticipation effect to be stronger for young inventors who have a longer
career ahead of them at the point in time that they enter the most productive part of their
careers (see Figure 15). In columns 2 and 4 of Table 16, we interact our forward- and backward-
looking innovation measures with an indicator for whether the individual is over 35 years old in
1940. In line with theory, past productivity is a stronger predictor of wages for those over 35,
while the reverse is true for those under age 35.


                           3.5    Income Inequality and Social Mobility
In this section we use the income data in the 1940 Census to study the effect of innovation on the
make up of local societies. Do more inventive states have higher or lower wage inequality and
social mobility? The nature of the relationship between innovation and income inequality is ex
ante ambiguous. If innovation displaces incumbent firms and creates new wealth for competing
entrants, more innovative societies are more likely to have lower income inequality. However,
if innovation primarily strengthens incumbent firms, allowing them to increase markups and
constrain output, income inequality in a society may rise with its level of innovation.
   This issue is especially relevant given the large literature on income inequality and recent
attempts to analyze the relationship between the top income share and patenting. The existing
empirical literature is divided on the topic. Aghion et al. (2015a) examine modern US data
finding a positive causal effect of innovation-led growth on top incomes shares at the state-level.
However, they also find some sensitivity to measurement. The relationship between inequality
and patenting becomes much weaker at different thresholds like the top 10% share, and they find



                                                                45

a negative relationship when using the Gini coefficient, which considers all parts of the income
distribution not just the top share. By contrast Jones and Kim (2014) shows theoretically that
if innovations come from new entrants, the relationship between inequality and innovation could
be negative. Given the lack of consensus on the topic, it is important to place these modern
studies in a historical context.

Fact 14. Broad measures of income inequality (90/10, Gini) were negatively cor-
related with innovation.

  Our results in Figure 25 generally point to a negative relationship between income inequality
and inventiveness.
  The vertical axis plots the state-level 90/10 ratio and Gini coefficient as measured in the 1940
Census, while the horizontal axis plots backward-looking average patents per capita between
1920 and 1940. Both of these measures of inequality are strongly negatively associated with
regional inventiveness.
  Table 17 reports the results from a state-level regression of 1940 wage income inequality on
average patents per capita between 1920 and 1940, and the state’s occupation mix. All indepen-
dent variables in the regression are standardized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation.
Column 2 shows that increasing the number of patents per capita by one standard deviation is as-
sociated with a decline in the 90/10 ratio of 0.28 (= 0.828/2.98) standard deviations, conditional

Fact 15. Top-1% labor-income share had a U-shaped relationship with innovation.

   The estimated relationship between innovation and income inequality is sensitive to measure-
ment.
   Contrary to the findings of the previous section, the top 1% income share exhibits a non-
linear, U-shaped relationship with patenting. In the least innovative states we find a negative

     We do not present evidence on the relationship between county innovation and county-level inequality, as such

relationship. However, in the most innovative states such as New York, New Jersey and Mas-
sachusetts we find that more patenting was associated with more income held in by the top
1%. One potentially confounding effect is the different mixes of occupations in these innovative
states. For example, Philippon and Reshef (2012) show that between 1909 and 1933 skill-based
wage-compensation in finance was high. Addressing this concern, Appendix Figure A-8 shows
that these patterns are robust to excluding individuals who work in the financial sector.

  Although we do not claim to show a causal link between innovation and income inequality,
our analysis yields a number of important insights. First, alternative measures of inequality may
yield startlingly different results. The literature has not yet reached a consensus on the economics
behind these various measures. Second, the correlations presented here suggest that innovation
may indeed have an important effect on income inequality. Our time period covers a period in
US history when income inequality was high (Goldin and Katz (1999), Piketty and Saez (2003)),
and it was also associated with the diffusion of electricity as a major twentieth century general
purpose technology(Jovanovic and Rousseau (2005)). Our findings are therefore consistent with
the idea that technological change may drive a wedge between the relative earnings of the skilled
and unskilled.

Fact 16. Innovation was strongly positively correlated with social mobility.

   While places with high income inequality tend to exhibit low levels of social mobility (e.g.
Chetty et al. (2014)), innovation might actually decrease inequality if it acts as a social elevator.
The Schumpeterian paradigm suggests that innovation allows a new entrant to capture markets
from old incumbents. This process of creative destruction creates churn in the economy, allowing
individuals and firms with limited market shares to grow. This mechanism lies at the heart of a
large class of economic models, such as Aghion and Howitt (1992), Klette and Kortum (2004),
and Akcigit and Kerr (2016). Yet, data constraints have prohibited direct evidence relating
innovation to social mobility at the societal level.



                                                                                                              48
  We examine the relationship between innovation and social mobility directly using our occu-
pation data. Figure 27 shows how a state’s level of social mobility in 1940 correlates with the
number of patents per capita granted between 1920 and 1940. Social mobility is measured as
the fraction of individuals with a low skill father, who themselves have a high skill occupation.
We see that more innovative regions feature more social mobility.

   Of course, more innovative states may have higher social mobility for a number of reasons. For
example, we have shown that innovative states tend to be more urban which may be correlated
with social mobility while states with different types of economic activity (agricultural versus
manufacturing) may also vary in their degree of change. To counter this concern, we regress
our measure of social mobility in 1940 on average patents granted per capita between 1920 and
1940, and controls for a state’s occupation mix. The percent of people in a state who work in
the agricultural sector serves as a proxy for the state’s degree of urbanization, while the states
least open to technological disruption tended to be agricultural and in the south. Table 18 shows
that the relationship between patents per capita and social mobility is positive and statistically
significant, even after controlling for occupational variation.
   These results are informative from the standpoint of innovation as a driver of social mobility
given that Long and Ferrie (2013) find that around the turn of the twentieth century Amer-
ica was (from its mid-nineteenth century high-point) generally becoming a less socially mobile
place. While we do not measure changing mobility levels over time, our results do indicate that
innovative places were also socially mobile places. As we showed in Table 3 inventors were a
small share of the total population who had a large effect on US development. Our findings
underscore the need to study social movement within this sub-group of the population given the
implications for the relationship between social mobility and economic growth.

                       4      Relation to Previous Studies
Finally, we attempt to overview our findings by codifying the facts we have presented throughout
the paper in relation to the existing literature. We frame the discussion using Table 19, which
summarizes areas in which our findings tend to agree with previous studies or disagree. In some
cases our findings have no real counterpart in the literature. We highlight these as representing
new facts about the dynamics of US inventive activity.
   Our regional-level findings agree with the basic arguments underpinning four main literatures.
The long-standing endogenous growth literature is framed by the idea that innovation and tech-
nological progress are key determinants of sustained development (e.g., Romer (1990), Aghion
and Howitt (1992)). Our results (Fact 1) have verified that basic premise holds true in the data
and in Section 3 we also attempted to show that the relationship between innovation and growth
is likely to be causal. We have also been able to identify key mechanisms. Consistent with the
large literature on agglomeration (e.g., Glaeser (2011)), we found that densely populated places
were more innovative (Fact 2). Our findings (Facts 3 and 4, respectively) also emphasise the
importance for innovation of access to finance (e.g., King and Levine (1993)) and spatial links
that would increase the extent of the market (e.g., Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016)).
   Equally, some of our findings create a degree of ambiguity in relation to the current literature.
Given the frequently postulated relationship between the degree of openness of a region and its
inventiveness we find some contrasting results (Fact 5). The experience of US slave states is
perhaps the exemplar case of being closed to new ideas and we do find an empirically strong
negative relationship between slavery and innovation. On the other hand, religiosity is a weak
predictor of innovation in our data and time period. In the modern era the relationship is
robustly negative (Benabou et al. (2013) and Benabou et al. (2015)). We consider these types
of contrasting results to be equally informative because they reveal what has changed over time
in the types of social structures that affect a society’s propensity to innovate.
   Given the large literature on the profiles of inventors historically (e.g., Lamoreaux and Sokoloff

Fact 6    Inventors were more educated on average            X
          and were most productive between the age
          of 36 and 55.
Fact 7    Inventors were positively selected                                      X
          through exit early in their careers, but
          were less productive and more likely to
          exit late in their careers.
Fact 8    The patents of new inventors received                                   X
          more citations on average, and were more
          likely to be in the top decile of the citations
          distribution.
Fact 9    Inventors delayed marriage and had                                      X
          fewer children.
Fact 10   Inventors were more likely to have mi-                                  X
          grated from their state of birth. They
          moved to states that were more conducive
          to innovation.

          coming an inventor. This effect disappears
          once child’s education is controlled for.
Fact 12   Successful patentees had substantially             X
          higher labor income, even controlling for
          demographics and education.
Fact 13   Inventor’s income was highly correlated            X
          with the quality of invention measured
          by patent citations.
Fact 14   Broad measures of income inequality,               X         X
          such as 90/10 ratio, Gini coefficient, were

(1999) and Khan and Sokoloff (2004)), our data help to confirm major findings about age profiles
and education characteristics using a large sample of inventors (Fact 6). It is also reassuring that
our results on the age distribution mirror those of Sarada et al. (2016) who match inventors to
Census records for the same time period as us using different data and methods. These types of
data are crucial to understanding the relationship between human capital and economic growth
(e.g., Lucas (2009), Alvarez et al. (2013), Lucas and Moll (2014), Perla and Tonetti (2014)). Our
results pinpoint productivity variation over the life cycle and continue to dispel the traditional
argument that US inventors during the golden age were uneducated back-yard tinkerers.
   We have also attempted to extend the analysis in a new direction by examining the life cycle
of invention through the lens of career dynamics. Following the literature on firm dynamics
(e.g., Haltiwanger (2012)) and the economic growth literature on entry, exit and reallocation
(e.g., Acemoglu et al. (2015) and Akcigit and Kerr (2016)) we find that inventors were positively
selected early in their careers on the quality of their inventions but their productivity dropped
sharply later in their careers, presumably as new entrants disrupted existing ideas (Facts 7
and 8). These findings help to reconcile why the age distribution is heaped around middle-age
(Fact 6) as does our evidence on marriage patterns, child rearing and time allocation (Fact
9). Finally, while it is known that inventors were susceptible to migration (Sarada et al. (2016))
we have presented further evidence on the nature of re-location decisions (Fact 10). These
findings, in turn, relate to our regional results showing that inventors tended to move to urban
and financially-developed places that were more likely to foster innovation (Facts 2 and 3).
   We are also able to present new evidence on the family background of inventors (Fact 11). On
the extensive margin our finding that the entry of inventors was increasing in father’s income, but
the mechanism appears to be operating through better off families providing access to education,
is consistent with a human capital explanation of invention (Fact 6). Furthermore, our finding
that father’s income had no effect on the intensive margin of productivity is consistent with the
broader hypothesis that US technological development was characterized by the democratization
of invention (Khan and Sokoloff (2004)).
   A large literature going back to Schmookler (1966) suggests that financial incentives drive
innovation and our findings confirm that rewards did accrue to individuals developing new
technological ideas. Most of the literature in this area is confined to modern periods where large
scale administrative records are available.(e.g., Bell et al. (2015) and Aghion et al. (2015b)).
While our results are novel given the lack of evidence on the returns to income for inventors in
historical time periods, they confirm the hypothesis that incentives matter. Inventors earned
more, especially if they produced high quality innovations (Facts 12 and 13).
   Our results pertaining to the relationship between innovation, income inequality and social
mobility are controversial relative to the recent literature (e.g., Aghion et al. (2015b) and Bell
et al. (2015)) and they also indicate the need for more research. Much depends on the approach
to measuring inequality: the relationship between inequality and innovation is different if one
considers society as a whole (Fact 14 on the 90/10 ratio and Gini coefficient) or only the upper
echelons (Fact 15 on the top-1%). Our final finding, that innovation appears to be a major
social elevator (Fact 16) has important implications for how mobility connects to economic

growth. Inventors are a small sub-group of society who have a large influence on everyday life
because of their technological ingenuity. We find that invention could be an important social
elevator even though the US population as a whole was becoming less socially mobile over time
(Long and Ferrie (2013)).


                                     5     Conclusion
This paper presents a series of facts emerging from a major data collection and matching exer-
cise combining information from US patent records with state and county-level aggregates and
data on individuals from Federal Censuses between 1880 and 1940. The new data provide a
comprehensive profile of inventions and their creators during the golden age of US invention.
Our analysis begins with an attempt to identify a causal relationship between innovation and
long run economic growth. We proceed to explore some of the main mechanisms driving this
relationship using a framework for establishing macro and micro-level facts about the innovation
process.
   Examining the drivers of innovation during this historical time period is critical and sheds
light on numerous key debates on innovation and long-run economic growth. Our data can also
complement modern studies such as Aghion et al. (2015b) and Bell et al. (2015) to provide
a more complete picture of inventor profiles over time and space. These new historical data
exhibit a positive relationship between state-level innovation and regional growth, population
density, financial development, geographic connectedness and social mobility. We further find
that inventors during this period were largely middle-aged white males, with above-average ed-
ucation. Inventors in 1940 were positively selected through early exit, had steeper life cycle
wage earnings profiles and right-shifted earnings distributions compared with similarly-skilled
individuals; this was especially true of the period’s most prolific inventors. Finally, our data sug-
gest a non-monotone relationship between a state’s level of innovation and its income inequality.
These areas have allowed us to gain preliminary insights into the birth of technological ingenuity
during one of the most important eras of American economic development.
   A number of opportunities exist for further research. We have provided a range of interesting
correlations in this paper, and establishing causal links between our variables will help to shed
light on the nature of these facts and the various mechanisms at work. Yet taken at face
value, our study has important implications for the design of innovation policy. Establishing
the background of the most effective inventors informs well-targeted innovation interventions.
Furthermore, while regional innovation yields growth, it is also related to inequality and social
mobility. The extent to which innovation contributes to growth, inequality, and mobility is
central to determining the societal costs and benefits of technological advance.

                                             Appendix
                           A      Census Data Description
In this section we detail our Census data and the methods we use to prepare it for analysis. We
use IPUMS complete-count data from the decennial Censuses in 1880, 1900, 1910, 1920, 1930,
and 1940. We are limited to this set of years because the complete Census records are released
only with a 72 year lag. In addition, the 1890 Census was largely destroyed in a fire in 1921. We
start in 1880 because the Census for this year is systematic and contains a set of family related
variables we use in our analysis. As the codebook for the 1880 Census writes:
         “The 1880 Census is in several critical respects the first “modern” Census; it broke new
         ground in its completeness of coverage, accuracy of enumeration, and range and detail
         of questions. The supervision of enumerators shifted from a part-time responsibility of
         regular U.S. marshals to 150 Census Supervisors specifically appointed for the purpose.
         To make a full, accurate, and speedy enumeration practical, the size of enumeration
         subdistricts was reduced from a maximum of 30,000 inhabitants in 1870 to a maximum
         of 2,500 in 1880 while the number of enumerators was increased from 6,530 to 31,282.
         A variety of new questions were added that greatly enhance the value of the 1880 Census
         compared to earlier years. It was the first federal Census to inquire about marital status
         ... Equally important, a question on relationship to head of family was added, which
         makes it possible to distinguish kin from secondary individuals and allows construction
         of a wide variety of variables on family structure.”

  The set of variables contained in the Census varies greatly over time. In addition, the micro-
data from the 1940 Census is continuing to be populated with additional variables. Table A-1
summarizes the information available in our six decennial Census years.


                             A.1      Cleaning the Census Data
The Census provides a unique identifier for each individual in its records. These person identi-
fiers, or “PIDs,” are unique within Censuses, but are not constant across each Census year: an
individual with PID 1 in 1880 is not the same individual with the PID 1 in 1900. We are unable
therefore to create a panel dataset using our six Census datasets. Although the PIDs are unique
in the vast majority of states and years, there are occasions in which the same individual shows
up twice in the same year. Supposing data entry errors, we drop these duplicate PIDs.21
   We take steps to impute missing data where it is easy to do so; for instance, we fill in missing
age data by calculating the difference between the observed Census year and the individual’s
reported birth year.22
   Before 1940, many variables are coded in strings rather than as categorical variables. For
instance, sex variables can take on values “MALE,” “FEMALE,” “M,” “F,” and additional

   One individual in Georgia (PID 559409) has consistently non-sensical data, and is thus dropped from the 1900
    Census.

   A number of individuals in 1900 have negative ages, or some ages above 130 years old. We drop these individuals
    from our analysis, supposing data entry errors.

non-missing information. Home ownership variables are populated only for select group of individuals, and cannot
be robustly matched to patent data.


codes indicating unknown. In many cases, these are easy to categorize into numeric categories.
However, in certain instances, additional categorization must be done by hand. For instance,
the race variable often mixes race and nationality. We therefore must make some assumptions
as to what nationality corresponds to which race. For example, we classify those reporting that
they are “Asian,” “Chinese,” “Filipino,” “Japanese,” “Korean,” “Mongolian,” or “Siamese” as
one category “ASIAN.”
  There are two additional places where such categorization plays an important role in our
analysis. First, the occupation variables contain over twenty thousand unique values in 1880,
1920, and 1930. Many of these unique values are the result of misspellings – such as “FARMR”
in place of “FARMER” – or due to differences between British and American English, such as
“LABOURER” instead of “LABORER.” In order to reduce the dimension of the occupation
data, we collapse the raw occupation data into three skill groups – low, medium, or high – and




                                                     A-2
three occupation categories: doctors, lawyers, and farmers. The three skill groups are mutually
exclusive, and account for 79.4% of individuals with non-missing occupation data. Doctors and
lawyers are all high skill, while farmers can be any skill level so long as they appear to work in
farm related activities.
   The skill classification proceeds as follows. We first classify individuals into low skill occu-
pations using a string match. Low skill individuals perform routine jobs, sell their labor as
hired hands, or work as servants or maids. For instance, if an individual reports an occupation
containing the string “ASSIST,” “CLERK,” “LAUNDR,” or “FARM,” they are initially classi-
fied as low skill.23 This method will classify those who say they are a shop clerk, blacksmith’s
assistant, laundry girl, or farm hand as low skill individuals. However, it will also classify farm
supervisors and legal clerks as low skill. To correct for this, we next begin the classification of
middle skill occupations.
   Middle skill individuals are 1) those with particular specialties, such as carpenters or black-
smiths 2) those who perform middle management roles such as supervisors, or foremen, and 3)
those in the clergy or law enforcement. We replace those coded with low skill occupations with
a middle skill code if the individual both reports a string associated with a medium skill job,
and is not an assistant or apprentice. Therefore, those who report that they are a “Foreman
on a farm” will initially be classified as low skill because their occupation includes the string
“farm,” but will be updated to medium skill due to the string “Foreman.” On the other hand,
a “Blacksmith’s apprentice” will not be updated to medium skill, as the string “apprentice”
disqualifies classification as middle skill, even though the individual works with a blacksmith.
   A similar routine is carried out for high skill classifications. Individuals are classified as high
skill if 1) their occupation requires higher cognitive thought, such as a scientist, lawyer, or
financier, 2) they are owners, directors, or upper management of ventures, 3) they are highly
skilled manual workers, such as jewellers, goldsmiths, or silversmiths, or 4) they are public
officials such as members of congress, or politicians. In addition, they must not be assistants,
apprentices or hired hands. Once again, therefore, one who “Owns a farm” will initially be a
low skill individual, but will be updated to high skill as a result of the string “own.” Finally,
students and those retired have missing occupation skills.
   The occupation categories are more straightforward to classify. Doctors are those who are
both high skill and who report an occupation string containing “DOCTOR,” “MEDIC,” “MD,”
“PHARM,” “DENT,” “PSYCH,” or “OPTOM,” among others. Thus pharmacists, dentists,
psychiatrists, and optometrists will all be classified as doctors. Lawyers are high skill individuals
with an occupation string containing “LAW,” “JUDG,” “ATTORN,” and a number of legislator
strings such as “SENATE.” Thus attorneys, lawyers, judges, and legislators all count as lawyers
by our broad definition. Finally, farmers are any individual who have an occupation string
containing broad categories and common misspellings like “FARM,” “FRM,” “FIELD,” and
“CROP,” or more narrow strings such as “HUSKER,” “COTTON,” “PICK,” or “CHICKEN.”

23
     This example is far from the full set of strings used to classify individuals. A full list of terms is available
      from the authors upon request. The set of strings was chosen by hand after examining the most common
      occupations.




                                                         A-3
   The second major instance in which careful classification is required is in determining the
birthplace of individuals. The majority of individuals report their place of birth at the state or
country level. However, many give more specific answers such as the city, county, or (if abroad)
principality of birth. In order to calculate robust migrant flows, it is necessary to aggregate these
more refined answers to a state or country level. While there are too many small cities listed
to code each person by hand, we make substantial progress in matching individuals to their
state of birth: 86.7% of Census records with non-missing birthplace information are successfully
matched.
   We begin this refinement process by standardizing place names to be upper case, with no
spaces. Next, we assign the largest cities in each state to its logical destination. For instance,
“MOBILE” and “BIRMINGHAM” are assigned to Alabama. Note that individuals who were
born in the much smaller town of Birmingham, Connecticut, for instance, will be incorrectly
matched to an Alabama birthplace. While we are comfortable with this small error in most
cases, it can prove quite difficult to address for city names that are large in multiple places.
For instance, many people live in both Kansas City, Kansas, and Kansas City, Missouri. In
such cases, we assume that the individual did not migrate across state lines if possible. That
is, we assign an individual’s birthplace to be Kansas if they currently live in Kansas and to be
Missouri if they currently live in Missouri. These large cities that appear in multiple states are,
as far as we can tell, only cities that straddle state lines. Therefore this conservative approach to
migration appears to be justified - even if an individual moves from Kansas City, MO to Kansas
City, KS, he will still be living in the same metropolitan area. Since classifying this individual
as a migrant is thus misleading, we believe this no-migration error is justified.
   A similar routine is carried out for international migrants as well. In particular, many German
migrants provided specific states of birth, such as Bavaria, Württemberg, or Hamburg. Again,
we aggregate these to the country level. We then divide the reported countries into nine regions:
Western Europe, Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, Oceania, Africa, the Middle East, Latin America,
Canada, and East Asia.24
   With the cleaned birthplaces, we can then define the migration status of individuals. An
individual is said to be an international migrant if they were born in any of the nine global
regions defined above. An individual is defined as an interstate migrant if their birth state is
different to their state of residence in the Census. Although we cannot calculate year-on-year
migration flows, we can ask whether an individual has moved out of his state of birth, and has
yet to move back.


                                           A.2       Father Match
In order to study social mobility and the role of parental affluence, we attempt to form a robust
link between individuals and their parents. The 1940 Census provides an explicit match between
individuals and their spouse and parents, so long as they live in the same household. Using a
household identifier and a variable giving an individual’s person number in the household (e.g.

24
     A full list of classifications at both the state and country level is available from the authors upon request.




                                                          A-4
household head is 1, spouse may be 2, father may be 3, etc.), and the person number of their
relevant family, we can explicitly ascertain the PID of the individual’s family members.
   Before 1940, however, we use our own algorithm to determine the PIDs of individuals’ family
members. First, we generate a family identifier, given by a unique surname, household ID,
and city. We then use the relationship to household head variable recorded by the Census
to determine the PID of individuals’ family members. Specifically, we first limit ourselves to
families with only one household head. Then we consider those individuals who report being
either the household head or his/her spouse. We extract the PID of these household heads, and
assign them to individuals reporting to be either the son or the daughter of the household head.
This builds a crosswalk dataset - every son/daughter of a household head is matched to the PID
of his/her mother and father.
   To test the validity of this matching routine, we use our algorithm on the 1940 data, checking
that we match the correct father to the correct child using the person number variables provided
by the Census. Our match is nearly perfect: among individuals for whom the Census provides a
person number match, we correctly ascertain the PIDs of an individual’s father in over 99.99%
of every state’s population.
   While this high match rate is encouraging, it does not suggest that our algorithm is perfect.
Instead, it suggests that we are able to successfully replicate the Census’ own algorithm for
matching parents to children. The match is still subject to two important caveats. First, we
can only match individuals to their parents if they live in the same household, and therefore our
match may be more successful for younger children or poorer families. Second, we only match
parents if at least one of them is the head of the household. In principle, one could attempt
to match other members of the family by considering, for instance, the brother and nephew
of the household head. However, matching based on non-nuclear family members introduces
additional noise and incorrect matches, particularly in cases in which large families reside in
the same household. We therefore avoid these kinds of matches in the construction of our final
dataset.


                       B     Patent Data Description
Our analysis is based on three main patent datasets we assembled using a mixture of hand entry
and optical character recognition (OCR) techniques based on the original patent documents,
and information from existing databases. These data are summarized as follows:

  1.   Patent Dataset A. 6,675,311 patents. Consists of close to the universe of patents
       granted by the USPTO between 1836 and 2004 covering the location of the first named
       inventor listed on the original patent documents down to the city level.
  2.   Patent Dataset B. 60,594 patents. Consists of the universe of patents granted by the
       USPTO for the years 1880, 1900 and 1910 covering both the name and location of the
       first named inventor down to the city level.




                                              A-5
  3.   Patent Dataset C. 5,739,225 patents. Consists of the universe of patents granted by
       the USPTO including the name of all inventors and assignees from 1920 to 2006.

   Note that these datasets contain overlapping and sometimes complementary information—for
instance, Patent Dataset A contains the location of inventors but not their names whereas
Patent Dataset C contains names but not locations.
   We obtained address information for the first inventor from the original patent documents
using OCR and hand entry (Patent Dataset A). This dataset contains US patents that were
granted to both US citizens and individuals living abroad, but in our analysis we obviously limit
ourselves to patents granted to individuals and entities based in the United States. In 1880 94%
and in 1940 86% of patents were granted to inventors located in the US.
   For the years 1880, 1900, and 1910 (Patent Dataset B), we extracted the name and address
of the first inventor listed on the patent document, under the assumption that this individual
was the principal inventor of the art. Single inventors were the norm during this time period.
In 1880, 1900 and 1910 approximately 92%, 90% and 91% of patents were granted to a single
inventor respectively.
   From 1920 through 2006, we retrieved the name of every inventor listed on every patent each
year using data supplied to us by the European Patent Office (Patent Dataset C). Additionally
we created a panel dataset with an inventor identifier through disambiguating the inventor data
using the algorithm of Li et al. (2014).


                              B.1     Citation Adjustment
Our data includes the number of citations each patent receives from patents granted from
September 1947, when the USPTO began to note citation data in a systematic way, to February
2008. Thus, we have the full universe of citations received by patents granted during this time
period. Citations start in 1947 because a USPTO Notice was issued on December 19th, 1946,
instructing examiners to add citations in the published format of the patent, a practice that was
incorporated into the Manual of Patenting Examining Procedure (paragraph 1302.12).
   For patents granted before 1947, the noted citation count is left censored: a patent granted in
1940 will only have citations from patents granted after 1947, but will not have citations from
patents between 1941 and 1946. This artificially deflates the number of citations received by
patents before 1947, confounding attempts to use citations as an objective measure of a patent’s
quality. Furthermore, aggregate citation trends may weaken the link between raw citation counts
and patent quality. For instance, if patents granted in 1960 cite an average of 5 prior patents, but
those granted in 1990 cite 20 patents, one might expect the average citation received from a 1960
patent to be more indicative of a high quality innovation than a citation received in 1990. We
therefore adjust the number of citations received by each patent following the quasi-structural
approach laid out in Hall et al. (2001).
   This approach relies on two critical assumptions. First, we assume that the citation process is
stationary. That is, we assume that the evolution of citation shares does not change over time:
a patent will on average receive a share πkτ of its citations τ years after it is granted, regardless



                                                A-6
of the grant year. This allows us to project back our adjustment factors to patents filed before
the citation data began in 1947. Second, we assume proportionality. That is, we assume that
the shape of the citation evolution does not depend on the total number of citations received
so that highly cited patents are more highly cited at all lags. This allows the application of the
same adjustment factor to every patent in our data granted in a given period and belonging to
a given patent class.
   The adjustment proceeds as follows. We start with the full patent citation network data,
keeping only those patents granted in the United States. Let Ckst be the total number of citations
to patents in year s and technology category k coming from patents in year t.25 Further, define
Pks to be the total number of citations received by patents granted in year s in technological
category k. One can then define πkst = Ckst /Pks to be the average share of citations received
by patents in class k in year s from patents granted in year t We assume that πkst is some
multiplicatively separable function of grant year, patent category, and a citation lag. That is,
we can write
                              log[πkst ] = α0 + αs + αt + αk + fk (L)                        (A-1)

for L = t−s the lag between cited and citing patent grant years, and fk (·) some category-specific
function of these lags. For our purposes, we define fk (L) = γ̃k,L . We may then estimate equation
A-1 using OLS to recover estimates of α0 , αs , αt , αk , and γ̃k,L for each value of s, t, k and L in
our data.26 Taking exponentials of equation A-1 yields

                                       Ckst /Pks = eα0 eαs eαt eαk eγ̃k,(t−s)                                 (A-2)

This formulation allows us to standardize citation counts over time and across categories. Specifi-
cally, in order to adjust for patent class, cited year, and citing year effects, we weight each citation
from a patent in year t to a patent in class k in year s by exp (−α̂k − α̂s − α̂t ). Each patent’s
citation counts are therefore reflective of the patent’s quality relative to the average patent in
some base year and category.27
   While this procedure accounts for aggregate differences across patent classes and grant years,
it does not yet correct for bias arising from the left truncation of citation records. To build
intuition for the truncation correction, consider an example in which each of the estimated α
coefficients were 0: the only bias in our citation data arises from the lag. In that case, the
assumptions of proportionality and stationarity suggest a natural adjustment factor for a patent
granted L years before the 1947 cutoff. Define Gk (L) to be the CDF of the lag distribution:
the share of an average patent’s citations received within the first L years after its grant. The



25
   For the purposes of the adjustment, we use technological categories as defined by the NBER patent data. For
    a detailed description of these data, see Hall et al. (2001).
26
   It is rare for a patent to receive citations more than 30 years after its initial grant date, and thus we top-code
    the citation lag L to have a maximum value of 30. That is, we define L = min{t − s, 30}.
27
   For our purposes, we choose each patent citation to be relative to a patent in the “Other” category granted
    in 1975, receiving citations from patents also granted in 1975. Mechanically, this corresponds to setting the
    omitted categories in estimation of equation A-1 to be k = “Other”, s = t = 1975.




                                                        A-7
adjustment factor is then given by

                                                            1
                                              σk,L =
                                                        1 − Gk (L)

We would then predict that a patent in category k granted in year 1947 − L and receiving c
citations from patents granted after 1947 would have received σk,L c citations had the USPTO
kept track of citations before 1947.28
   In order to incorporate the year and category fixed effects into this truncation adjustment
framework, one must establish a notion of the CDF of the lag distribution conditional on year
and category effects. To do so, we interpret the exp(γ̃k,L )’s as weights for each patent in the
citation data. For instance, if the estimated exp(γ̃k,L=2 ) is 2, then an average patent is twice as
likely to receive a citation after 1 year than in the year of patent grant, conditional on year and
category effects. To construct the CDF of citations by lag conditional on year and class effects,
we can sum our estimates of exp(γ̃k,L ), normalizing the estimated coefficients so that they sum
to 1. This gives us our estimate of Gk (L):

                                                         L

                                                               exp(γ̃k,l )
                                                         l=1
                                            Ĝk (L) =     30
                                                                                                            (A-3)

                                                        l=1


We can then calculate our truncation adjustment factor as before29

                                                               1
                                              σ̂k,L =                  .                                    (A-4)
                                                        1 − Ĝk (L)

     To summarize, the citation adjustment proceeds in four steps:

     1. Estimate equation A-1 using OLS to recover α0 , αk , αt , αs and γk,L .

     2. For each citation made from a patent p0 granted in year t to a patent p in class k granted
        in year s is weighted by
                                          ωk,s,t = e−αk −αt −αs

        Define, for each cited patent p, the year- and category-adjusted citation count c to be the
        sum of the ωk,s,t it received.

     3. Calculate Ĝk (L) according to equation A-3

     4. Using Ĝk (L), calculate the truncation adjustment factor σ̂k,L according to A-4. Finally,
        define a patent p’s adjusted citation count to be c̃ = c · σk,L if p is in class k and was
        granted L years before 1947.
28
   Ignoring year and category effects and adjusting citations in this way does not significantly change the results
    presented in the main body of the paper.
29
   Note that we only calculate the truncation adjustment up to L = 20, despite estimating γk,L for L as large as
    30. This is to bound Ĝk (L) away from 1, so that we do not divide by 0 in the adjustment. For L larger than
    20, we apply the adjustment factor for L = 20.




                                                        A-8
  Figure A-1 plots the adjustment factors for truncation years for each of the six NBER patent
categories. The multiplicative adjustment factors range from 1 to almost 5, and vary by NBER
category. Meanwhile, Figure A-2 plots the distribution of log citations and the evolution of the
average citation counts according to three adjustment regimes: no adjustment, full adjustment,
and an adjustment in which we do not correct for truncation at 1947. We see that the fully
adjusted citation counts have a much flatter time series relative to the unadjusted citation counts.
This is by design: the purpose of the adjustment is to remove the aggregate fluctuations which
do not accurately measure the relative quality of patents.

                              B.2   Patent Classes and Matching Patents to Sectors
We obtain the main USPTO patent class for each patent and the NBER patent aggregations of
these classes.30 We match patents to sectors using the USPTO technology class of the patent.
  We also use value added and full-time employment data by sector from 1947 through 1986,
before the SIC was revised in 1987. These data are matched to data provided by Bill Kerr
containing the fraction of patents in each class which were manufactured and used by every
3-digit SIC code (Kerr, 2008). We first aggregate these SIC codes into the same categories
contained in the industry value added data from the BEA. Table A-2 shows this aggregation.
  Once we know the fraction of patents in each class that are accounted for by the BEA-provided
industries, we assign each class to an industry. We say a patent class c is affiliated with industry

30
     The USPTO occasionally reclassifies patents based on the emergence of new technologies. Throughout the
      paper, we use the 2006 classification.

                  C       Merging Patent and Census Data
                                     C.1      Data Preparation
We first standardize the names and places listed in the patent and Census data. We begin by
ensuring that all names are fully capitalized, and remove all special characters (e.g. “.”s) from
the names.31 In addition, we remove suffixes such as “JR,” “Senior,” and “III” from listed names.
We next parse the names into different words. The surname is taken to be the last word of an
individual’s name, while an individual’s first name is taken to be the first word. The first letter of
the second word of an individual’s name is taken to be their initial, so long as the name contains
at least three words. For example, a name originally recorded as “Thomas Alva Edison,” will
return three pieces of information: the surname “EDISON,” a first name “THOMAS,” and an
initial “A.” Note that this procedure implies that those with multiple words in their surname
are constrained to have a first name, single middle initial, and one-word surname. For example,
Robert Van de Graaff, inventor of the Van de Graaff generator (a machine that generates static
electricity), is eventually listed as “ROBERT V GRAAFF.”32
   Locations are likewise standardized. First, we capitalize all place names listed in the Census
and on the patent records. We then ensure that the spelling of common pieces of the place name
are constant across the two data sources. For instance, we enforce that the word “SAINT,” as
in “SAINT LOUIS,” are all listed as “ST.” In addition, we remove superfluous words such as
“WARD,” “DISTRICT” or “CITY;” for instance, “NEW YORK CITY” becomes simply “NEW
YORK.” Finally, we standardize a number of common place names by hand; for example, we
impose that the five boroughs of New York City – Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, the Bronx,
and Staten Island – are all coded as “NEW YORK.”


                                    C.2       Merging the Data
We next merge the patent data to the decennial Censuses. To do so, we first insist that records
in the Census have the same first name, last name, county, and state as the inventor listed on
the patent. In addition, the patent in question must have been granted in the same year as
the Census was conducted. While we make a strong effort to clean our data before matching,
there remain some cases that do not match even on these basic criteria. Of all patent-inventor
instances in the patent data, 70.8% find a match in the census based on these criteria. The
remaining 30% may not match either because their names were incorrectly entered in either the
Census or patent data, or because they may have moved across state lines between the time the
Census was conducted and the patent was granted. Predictably, this problem is particularly
pronounced immediately following the end of the First World War: we match just 61.1% of
patent-inventor observations in 1920.

31
   We drop Census records with first or last names longer than 40 characters. We do this because we suppose
    that such long names arise from input errors.
32
   The 1910 Census provides multiple name fields. We take the most well-populated field, and fill in missing values
    with the names contained in the other name variables. In the vast majority of cases, the names provided in
    the two variables are identical.




                                                      A-12
   Naturally, there may remain multiple inventor matches if, for example, there are multiple
Thomas Edison’s living in Middlesex county, New Jersey in 1900. Indeed, 44.3% of our initially
matched patents have multiple candidate inventors. We then refine the match further based
on other information in the patent documents. First, for each patent, we look to see if one of
the candidate inventors in the Census data has the same middle initial as listed on the patent
document. If so, we only keep those that match. This removes 8.2% of our multiple matches.
   At this stage, the multiplicity concern arises from the possibility of multiple Thomas A Edi-
son’s living in Middlesex, NJ in 1900. Thus we refine to a more granular geography. Our second
refinement asks whether there are any candidate inventors living in the same city or township as
was listed on the patent document. We only keep those who match on this criterion, so long as
the patent has at least one matched candidate. Thus we limit ourselves to Thomas A Edison’s
living in Menlo Park, Middlesex County, New Jersey in 1900. The refinement based on cities
removes 7.3% of the duplicate inventors, who survived the refinement based on middle initials.
   Multiplicity can still persist, however, and may be particularly common within family units
if a son is named after his father. At this stage, both John J Smith Jr and his father John J
Smith Sr, living in the same household, would be matched to the same patent. To combat this,
we finally refine the match based on an age criterion. For a given patent, we ask if there is a
candidate inventor between the ages of 15 and 85 in the Census. If so, we keep that candidate
inventor, and discard the candidate children under 15 years old and the elderly above 85. This
age refinement removes 5.5% of the multiple inventors present at this stage. We next repeat this
refinement with a sharper age criterion, keeping those between 18 and 65 years of age if such a
match exists.
   Finally, if there are still multiple matches for a given patent, then we exclude the individual
and patent from the sample altogether and they are counted neither as an inventor nor as a
non-inventor. This is done to be conservative about our match rate, and to avoid inducing
spurious correlations from incorrect matches. As a robustness check, we also run our analysis
on a sample in which we keep a random inventor for each patent with a multiple match. The
results are qualitatively similar, and are available from the authors upon request.33
   We then merge into our data every patent ever granted to each inventor we have successfully
matched. Thus, while we only match inventors to the Census if they are granted a patent in
a decennial Census year, our matched data contain patents granted to inventors in every year
from 1920 through 2006, as well as patents granted to inventors in 1880, 1900, and 1910.
33
     There is one exception to this similarity in headline results. Table 14 in the main body of the paper show
      a weak correlation between the probability that an individual becomes an inventor and the inventor status
      of one’s father. When we keep a random matched inventor, this correlation becomes large, significant, and
      positive. This change can be best understood with an example. Suppose that John J Smith Jr is 25 years
      old and cohabits with his father, the 50 year old John J Smith Sr. The younger John Smith is an inventor of
      two patents, but his father is not. Because they are both between the age of 15 and 85 with the same first
      name, last name and middle initial, and live in the same city, we must keep a random John J Smith for each
      of the two patents. For the first patent, suppose we kept the younger John Smith, while the other patent
      is assigned to his father. This generates a spurious correlation between an individual’s inventor status and
      that of his father: even though John Smith Sr was never granted a patent, it appears as though he was in
      our data. These family relationships might be a persistent source of multiplicity, and thus likely drives this
      particular difference in our results. We therefore favor the more robust results presented in the main body of
      the paper.

                                       C.3      Match Success
Figure A-3 shows the match rate by decennial Census year. Our most successful match year is
1880, in which we match 44.0% of all patents and 46.0% of all inventors in the patent data to
a unique individual in the Census. While the match rate hovers around 40% for most years, in
1920 we match 29.2% of US patents and 28.7% of inventors. The relatively low match rate we
observe for 1920 may simply be idiosyncratic. As we point out in Section 2 the 1920 Census was
conducted in the winter which led to some level of underenumeration, though not on a scale to
bias our results. The effects of World War I demobilization on the movement of ex-servicemen
in the population who were also inventors may also have had an effect.

Notes: Figure shows the percent of inventors (solid red bars) and patents (dashed blue bars) present in the patent
data who successfully match to the Census data by year. All states are aggregated together to produce this plot.

  Figure A-4 shows the match rate by state, pooling all years together. Panel A shows the match
rate for patents, while Panel B shows the match rate for inventors. There is heterogeneity in
the match success across states. While Rhode Island enjoys a successful match rate of 54.5%
for patents and 55.9% for inventors, we only match 17.3% of patents and 21.0% of inventors in
Nevada. Part of this difference may be attributable to the changing county (and even state)
boundaries in the early part of our sample, as frontier states saw rapid increases in population.
  A potential concern with our results is that they may be driven by systematic match errors,
rather than the unique characteristics for inventors. For instance, if name disambiguation proves
especially difficult for common names, our match success will reflect only rare names, which may
disproportionately represent a particular race, sex, or age profile. Alternatively, if data input

errors are common within the Census, especially uncommon or foreign-sounding names may be
matched at a lower rate than traditional American names.
   To test for any biases, we ask whether the patents and inventors that are successfully matched
to the Census are observably different from those that are not matched. For this exercise, we
consider the universe of patents granted in each of our decennial Census years in the 48 mainland
states used in our analysis. We then generate a binary variable equal to 1 if that patent and
inventor were successfully matched to our Census data and survived the refinements detailed
above. We then regress this indicator on characteristics of the patent and inventor. One might
be particularly concerned that we have more success matching common, traditional American
names, or particularly prominent inventors. We measure inventor and patent prominence by the
number of citations received between 1947 and 2008. We use two indicators for the rarity of
the inventor’s name. First, we construct the share of the population with each first name using
Census data. Second, we include the string length of the inventor’s surname.
   The results of this regression exercise are displayed in Table A-3. Column 1 show that those
with longer names are less likely to be matched, and those with common first names are slightly
more likely to be matched. However, we do not disproportionately match patents or inventors
of a higher quality. These effects are small: increasing name prevalence by 100 (approximately
1 standard deviation) is associated with just a 1.3 percentage point increase in the match rate,
roughly 3% of its mean. Meanwhile, a one standard deviation (1.75) increase in an individual’s
surname length reduces the match rate by 0.6 percentage points.
   To test for disproportionate matching of particular population groups, we again use the Census
to construct our variables of interest at the first name level. We thus include the percent of
individuals with the inventor’s first name who were international migrants and the average age
of those with the inventor’s name in the Census as dependent variables in columns 2 through 4.
Column 2 includes no fixed effects. Column 2 would suggest that, we are less likely to match
those with names commonly associated with international migrants, while there is hardly any
bias in our age match. This implies that, although we find little difference in the international
mobility between inventors and non-inventors using our matched data, it remains possible that
inventors were more likely to be international migrants. Indeed, this observation might partially
explain the difference in international migration rates between the most and least inventive
states, as shown in Table 1. A one standard deviation increase in the percent of people with the
inventor’s first name who are international migrants (13 percentage points) is associated with a
2.64 percentage point reduction in the patent match rate.
   Columns 3 and 4 control for state-year fixed effects in our selection regressions, while column 4
additionally controls for the patent’s technology class, and the technology class of the inventor’s
first granted patent. Column 3 most closely matches that of our previous regression analyses,
which use matched data for just one year of the census, and include state fixed effects (see,
for example, Table 14). The inclusion of these fixed effects does not significantly change the
patterns shown in columns 1 and 2.
   Another concern would be that the substantial heterogeneity in state match rates is systemat-
ically correlated with key state variables of interest. Although we do not use the matched data

Notes: Dependent variable is an indicator for an observation being matched to the census data, multiplied by 100
for legibility. White heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors reported in parentheses. ∗ , ∗∗ , and ∗∗∗ represent
coefficient statistically different from 0 at the 10, 5, and 1% level respectively. Inventor technology class defined
to be the technology class of his/her first patent.


for our state-level analysis, it is worth considering this claim. Table A-4 reports estimates from
an OLS regression of a state’s match rate on its observable characteristics. We see that none of
our regional variables predict a state’s match rate. Indeed, the full set of variables only explains
approximately 12% of the variation in state match rates, as measured by the regression’s R2 .

Notes: Figure plots the total number of patents granted to inventors in each state between 1919 and 1999 on
the horizontal axis, and the annualized growth rate in state GDP per capita between 1919 and 1999 on the
vertical axis. Both horizontal and vertical axes plot the variables of interest residualized against 1919 log GDP
per capita, to account for conditional convergence. Source: BEA Historical Regional Economic Accounts, and

Notes: Figure maps the number of patents per 10,000 residents in each state of the mainland U.S. in each
decennial census year of our data. Darker colors represent more inventive activity per resident. Patent data
come from the USPTO’s historical patent files, while population counts are calculated using the U.S. Census.

Notes: Figure plots the relationship between average patents per 10,000 residents between 1920 and 1940, and
the state-level wage income inequality observed in the 1940 census. All wage inequality measures exclude those
who work in the financial sector. Panel A measures income inequality with the ratio of the 90th percentile to the
10th percentile of income, while panel B uses the Gini coefficient as its measure. Panel C measures inequality by
the share of income controlled by the top 1% of the state’s wage earners. Source: 1940 Historical Census Data,
