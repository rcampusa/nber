1. Introduction

       Illicit drugs impose significant costs on society and on the individual users. These costs

include increased crime, health problems and employment problems. Because of these

considerable costs, both the federal government and state governments have made drug control an

important budget priority. According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)

1995, federal spending on drug control increased from $1.5 billion in fiscal 1981 to $17.8 billion

in fiscal 1999. This is an annual growth rate of over 14 percent. Spending on criminal justice,

interdiction and international programs has remained at about 60 to 70 percent of total drug

control spending. State government drug control expenditures are also for both criminal justice

programs and public health programs. Criminal justice programs include the enforcement of laws

pertaining to the use and sale of illicit drugs through expenditures on police, courts, prosecution,

and corrections. Public health programs include expenditures on drug education and treatment.

In addition, government must provide for the defense of individuals who are unable to provide

their own defense. Although the available data on state and local level spending are limited to

1990 and 1991, these expenditures have probably also grown over time. In 1991, state and local

governments spent $15.8 billion on drug control (ONDCP, 1993). Spending on criminal justice

was about 80 percent of total state and local spending on drug control. The purpose of this paper

is to estimate the effects of state level expenditures on criminal justice and public health in

reducing drug use.

       To analyze the effects of criminal justice and public health spending, economists (i.e. Lee,

1993; Wagstaff, 1989) have employed a supply and demand model. This model assumes a

demand function which is downward sloping with respect to price and a supply function which is

horizontal or upward sloping with respect to price. Criminal justice spending directed at drug


                                                   1
dealers may increase the cost of doing business which would raise the price of illicit drugs and

reduce drug use. Criminal justice spending directed at users may shift the demand curve to the

left which would reduce drug use and reduce drug prices. Public health programs inform

potential buyers of the health risks associated with drug use and may also shift demand to the left,

reducing drug prices and reducing drug use. Public health spending may affect supply since some

users finance all or part of their consumption by selling drugs. Public health spending can reduce

the number of these low level user-suppliers and thus reduce supply. The effect of a given

expenditure on criminal justice or public health is dependent on the magnitude of the resulting

shifts in the two functions and the supply and demand price elasticities. While the supply and

demand model of drug markets is an important theoretical framework, there has been very little

quantification of this model until recently. The new empirical research is limited to estimation of

drug demand price elasticities. There is no empirical evidence concerning the effectiveness of

expenditures of criminal justice spending and public health spending in shifting supply and demand

functions and thus reducing drug use.



2. Theoretical Model

       The empirical equations are derived from a supply and demand model of the illicit drug

market. The most general specification of the model includes criminal justice and public health

spending in both the demand curve and the supply curve. Public health spending may affect the

demand curve since these expenditures are assumed to increase knowledge of the negative health

consequences of drug use and thus reduce demand. Criminal justice spending may enter the

demand function since some part of criminal justice expenditure goes to enforcing sanctions

against users. Criminal justice enters the supply function since these programs increase costs.


                                                 2
Public health spending may also enter the supply curve since many low level drug suppliers are

also users and public health spending can reduce the number of these dealer-users. The demand

curve can be written as:

Q IJ = β1 P J + β2 PH J + β3CJ J + β4Z IJ + µ IJQ                           (1)

and the supply curve can be written as:

P J = δ1 PH J + δ2CJ J + δ3X J + µ JP                                       (2)

where the J subscript refers to the Jth state and Q IJ = drug use by the Ith individual in the Jth state,

PJ = price in the Jth state, PHJ = public health expenditures per capita in the Jth state, CJ J =

criminal justice expenditures per capita in the Jth state, Z IJ = other demand factors for Ith

individual in the Jth state, X J = other cost factors in the Jth state and the µ are disturbance terms.

        The demand function (1) shows that the individual’s demand for drugs is a function of

drug price, public health expenditures, criminal justice expenditures, other demand factors and a

disturbance term. The supply function (2) shows that price is a function of public health

spending, criminal justice spending, other cost factors and a disturbance term. This supply

function is infinitely elastic, since price is assumed to be primarily determined by expected

penalties and independent of the market clearing quantity. Reuter (1988) argues that production

and distribution costs have no significant influence on price but rather that prices are primarily

determined by expected penalties. The effect of criminal justice spending and public health

spending can be measured by estimating these two structural equations.

        Criminal justice and public health spending can affect drug participation directly through

deterrent, education and treatment effects but can also affect drug participation by raising drug

prices. The structural demand model holds the effect of drug prices constant. A reduced form

model can be defined which eliminates drug prices. Substitution of equation (2) into equation (1)


                                                     3
results in the reduced form equation (3), which estimates the effect of criminal justice and public

health expenditures on equilibrium drug use without holding drug prices constant. The reduced

form equation can be written as:

Q IJ = π1PHJ + + π2 CJ J + π3 X IJ + π4 Z IJ + µIJRF (3)

The coefficients, π1 and π2 measure the marginal effect of public health expenditures and criminal

justice expenditures on equilibrium drug use. This specification also eliminates the collinearity

between drug prices and criminal justice spending and public health spending which is present in

the structural demand model.

        Four recent empirical studies provide evidence that drug use is responsive to market

forces. Saffer and Chaloupka (forthcoming), estimated the effects of cocaine prices, heroin prices

and marijuana decriminalization using data from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse.

The results showed a participation price elasticity for cocaine of -.28 and a participation price

elasticity for heroin of -.94. Marijuana decriminalization was found to increase the probability of

marijuana participation by about 8 percent. Grossman and Chaloupka (1998) used the

Monitoring the Future data to estimate the price elasticity of cocaine demand for youth. They

used a rational addiction model and found price elasticities ranging from -.6 to -2.4. They also

estimated participation elasticities of -.4 to -2.0. Bretteville-Jensen and Sutton (1996) studied the

price responsiveness of 500 Norwegian heroin users. The price and consumption data are self-

reported. They estimated a price elasticity of heroin demand of -1.23. A study by van Ours

(1995) employed data on opium use in Indonesia during the Dutch colonial period. Opium is

pharmacologically similar to heroin. He found a price elasticity of -.7 to -1.0 for use and -.3 to -.4

for participation.




                                                  4
       There are no prior published empirical studies of the effect of criminal justice expenditures

and public health expenditures on drug use or related outcomes. There is, however, a simulation

study by Caulkins et al. (1997) which estimates the cost effectiveness of enforcement relative to

treatment. They find that treatment is more cost effective in reducing drug use than enforcement.



3. The Data Set

       A data set derived from the 1990 and 1991 National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse

(NHSDA) was employed for estimation. This data set consists of over 40,000 observations,

which is important since a large sample increases the number of drug users surveyed and the

precision of the estimates. The NHSDA are cross-sectional surveys of the US household

population aged 12 or older and contain information on socioeconomic characteristics as well as

data on drug use.1 These surveys exclude residents of non-institutional group quarters (i.e.

college dormitories) and exclude residents of institutional group quarters (i.e. prisons). Also

excluded are those people with no permanent residence (i.e. homeless and residents in transient

hotels). Less than two percent of the population is excluded. The excluded two percent probably

have a higher percentage of frequent drug users than the included 98 percent. Although there is

no strict dichotomy between occasional and frequent drug users, these surveys are likely to be

more representative of occasional drug users rather than frequent drug users. The 1991 survey is

over three times as large as the 1990 survey.

       The dependent variable is defined as equal to one if the respondent used any illicit drug

during the past year and is otherwise equal to zero. A dichotomous variable of this type is usually




                                                 5
referred to as a measure of drug participation. Drug use is usually defined as a continuous

variable measuring a specific quantity over time.

           State and local criminal justice spending for drug control, public health spending for drug

control and public defense spending related to drug control for 1990 and 1991 were taken from

State and Local Spending on Drug Control Activities prepared by the Office of National Drug

Control Policy (ONDCP), 1993. These data were collected as part of a special survey on drug

control done by the US Bureau of the Census. The data estimate expenditures for drug control

only. All of these variables were divided by state population since spending is likely to be higher

in states with larger populations. These data were appended, by state, to the data taken from the

NHSDA.

           Criminal justice expenditures include expenditures on police activities, judicial activities,

prosecution and corrections. Increased police spending on drug enforcement is expected to have

a negative effect on drug participation because of its deterrent aspect and because it increases the

number of users who are incarcerated. Judicial activities include the cost of court activities

exclusive of prosecution and defense. These expenditures may or may not have a deterrent effect

on drug participation. Prosecution includes the cost of attorneys general, district attorneys and

other prosecutors. These expenditures may have a negative effect on drug participation to the

extent that they increase the probability of conviction. Corrections include the cost of

confinement and rehabilitation of those convicted or awaiting trial. This variable may have a

negative effect on drug participation if increased corrections expenditures proxy for longer

sentences. Correction might also have a negative effect on drug participation since some drug

    Drug use data from DC were deleted since there were no drug control expenditure data collected from DC.



                                                         6
treatment was also provided by correctional institutions during the sample period. Since the work

of the police, judicial, prosecution and corrections programs are linked together, it is also

interesting to examine the collective effect of all of these criminal justice expenditures. To do

this, the four categories were aggregated to create a single criminal justice expenditure variable.

        Public health expenditure includes expenditures on education and treatment. Treatment

includes expenditures for hospital facilities directly operated by state or local government and for

payments to private facilities. Treatment is expected to reduce drug participation. Education

includes expenditures by state and local government for elementary and secondary school drug

education and is also expected to reduce drug participation. Since these education expenditures

are limited to youth, the effect is expected to be greater for youth.

        In addition, a public defense variable was created from the ONDCP data. This variable

measures expenditures on legal counsel paid by the court, or paid by government contributions to

private legal aid societies and bar associations sponsored programs and the costs of established

public defender programs. Increased defense spending may increase drug participation since more

resources go into defending users. This reduces the probability of conviction.

        Economic theory predicts that the price of illicit drugs is a determinant of drug

participation. The ideal price variables for this study would be an index of the price of any illicit

drug, the price of marijuana and the price of cocaine. The drugs included in the any illicit drug

participation variable are marijuana, cocaine, heroin, psychedelics and a variety of other illicit

substances. An illicit drug price index variable should reflect the mix and proportions of these

substances. Drug price data, however, are very limited. Only the price of cocaine and the price

of heroin are available on a national basis. These data come from the US Department of Justice,

Drug Enforcement Agency's STRIDE data set. Drug Enforcement Administration agents and


                                                   7
police narcotics officers purchase cocaine and heroin regularly. The price, purity, weight and

other information are recorded in the STRIDE data set. The procedure described in Saffer and

Chaloupka (forthcoming) was followed to estimate state level cocaine and heroin prices.2 A state

level dichotomous indicator of marijuana decriminalization is also available. Marijuana

decriminalization is a law which specifically eliminates criminal sanctions for possession of small

amounts of marijuana and eliminates imprisonment for most first offense possession violations.

As a proxy for an illicit drug price variable, the price of cocaine, the price of heroin and marijuana

decriminalization are included in the regressions. Cocaine prices and heroin prices may be good

indicators of the price of any illicit drug since distribution problems are an important determinant

of drug prices and these problems tend to be similar for any illicit drug.

           Additional economic and dichotomous demographic variables have been defined. These

include total personal income from all sources including wages, self-employment, social security,

public assistance, child support and other pension income. Income is a continuous variable

measured in 1983 dollars. The demographic variables are indicators of age, race, gender and

marital status. A variable defined as age and its square are also included to capture differential

age effects. A dichotomous variable equal to one if the individual reports that they are Black has

been defined. A similar variable was defined for Hispanics. A dichotomous variable equal to one

if the individual is male has also been defined. A variable for married has also been defined. There

were a number of missing values for this variable. Rather than deleting these observations or

omitting this variable, the missing values were estimated. A probit regression using the non-

missing marriage data as the dependent variable with income, age, education, race and ethnicity as

    These data were appended at the state level since, due to confidentiality requirements, only the individual’s state



                                                            8
independent variables was estimated.3 This equation was used to predict the values of the

marriage variable for the missing observations. A variable measuring sentiment regarding

intervention by the state is also included. This variable is defined as the total state government

budget divided by the state population. The data on the total state budgets for fiscal 1990 and

1991 were also taken from State and Local Spending on Drug Control Activities. Finally, the

regressions include a time dummy variable for 1991. Summary definitions and means of all the

variables are presented in Table 1. The means for all variables for a subsample of individuals age

30 or less are also presented in Table 1.



4. Regression Results

        In each of Tables 2 through 5 there are three probit specifications.4 In each table, specification

1 includes total spending on drug control. Specification 2 disaggregates total drug control spending

into criminal justice spending, education, treatment and public defense. Specification 3 further

disaggregates criminal justice spending into police, court, prosecution, and correction spending and

also includes education, treatment and public defense. Tables 2 and 3 are structural demand models

while Tables 4 and 5 are reduced form models. Tables 2 and 4 are for the overall population and

Tables 3 and 5 are limited to individuals age 30 or less. Estimation of the effects of drug control




of residence was available for the entire data set.

  This equation used age, income, education, Hispanic and Black as independent variables. All variables were
highly significant. All variables were positive except Black. The regression correctly predicted 73 percent of the
known values.
4
  All specifications were also estimated with state dummy variables, non-clustered robust standard errors and with
robust standard errors clustered by state. The state dummy variable specifications resulted in considerable
collinearity problems. The non-clustered robust standard errors were almost identical to the unadjusted standard
errors. The state clustered robust standard errors were in some cases significantly larger than the unadjusted
standard errors. These alternative specifications are not presented.



                                                        9
spending for this age group is interesting since this group has higher participation in illicit drugs

than older individuals.

        It is important to estimate both the structural demand models as well as the reduced form

models since drug prices and drug control expenditures are highly correlated. The structural

models include both drug prices and drug control expenditures. Since drug price is assumed to be

independent of quantity there is no presumption of endogeneity between price and quantity in

estimating this demand model. However, there is collinearity between the drug control variables

and the drug price variables which affects the test of significance. The drug control coefficients in

the structural demand model estimate the effects of drug control on drug participation, holding

drug prices constant. That is, these coefficients represent the effect of drug control programs,

exclusive of the indirect effect that these programs have on drug prices. The reduced form model

eliminates drug prices by simultaneously solving the structural demand function and the structural

supply function for quantity. This eliminates the collinearity problems between drug control and

drug prices. The drug control coefficients in the reduced form model include the direct effects of

drug control on drug participation and the indirect effects of drug prices on drug participation.

        The results for the structural models presented in Tables 2 and 3 show that total drug control

spending has a negative and significant effect on drug use. Criminal justice spending is also negative

and significant when disaggregated from total drug control spending. When criminal justice spending is

disaggregated into four expenditure categories the results are mixed. Police and correction

expenditures are significant for both the full sample and the younger sample. Court and prosecution

expenditures are each alternately significant in one sample or the other. The two categories of public

health expenditure are both insignificant. Defense spending is always positive and significant as

expected. The drug prices have the expected sign and are generally significant. Marijuana


                                                   10
decriminalization is also found to increase drug use. Heroin price is only significant in one

specification, but cocaine price is significant in all four specifications. The results for the remaining

income and demographic variables are discussed with the results for these variables from the other

tables.

          The results for the reduced form model presented in Tables 4 and 5 again show that total drug

control spending has a significant negative effect on drug use. Criminal justice spending is again

negative and significant when disaggregated from total drug control spending. Police and correction

expenditures are also negative and significant. Education remains insignificant as in the structural

model. The most interesting change from the structural model is in treatment which becomes negative

and significant. This may suggest that treatment reduces the number of user-dealers which raises prices

and reduces use. Defense spending remains positive and significant as in the structural model. The

reduced form model has, in addition, the size of state government variable which is positive and

significant in all specifications.

          The remaining variables are income and demographic. Income is in general negative in the

overall sample, but insignificant in the age 30 or less sample. Illicit drug participation increases

with age and then decreases. The results generally indicate that drug participation by Blacks is

either lower or about the same as the overall population. Drug participation by Hispanics is lower

than the overall population. This study confirms the results found in other studies that illicit drug

participation is higher for men and lower for married individuals.



5. Discussion

          The main findings from the regression results are that overall drug control spending

reduces illicit drug participation and that police work and drug treatment are the most important


                                                     11
drug control programs. The results for police work are consistent with the empirical economic

literature on crime which in general concludes that increasing the certainty of arrest is more

effective than increasing the severity of the sanction. The results for drug treatment are also

consistent with the literature on drug treatment which finds that treatment reduces drug use for

both the general population and for individuals in the criminal justice system (ONDCP, 1999).

The limited results for drug education may result from the fact that, during the sample period,

state spending on drug education was limited to elementary and secondary schools and may also

be a result of poorly designed older programs. These problems are being addressed by the newly

funded, five year, $2 billion multimedia campaign designed to educate youth about drug use.

       There are two interesting policy questions which can be examined with these regression

results. The first question is: What is the benefit-cost ratio for government drug control? That is,

is the marginal dollar value of the social benefits from drug control greater than the marginal

expenditure on drug control? The second question is: If social benefits exceed costs, is criminal

justice spending more efficient than public health spending?

       These questions can be addressed by the assumption that the probability of drug use (the

dependent variable) is approximately equal to the number of drug users in the population and by

computing the marginal effects of the drug control variables.5 The estimated marginal effects are

equal to the change in the number of drug users, over population, with respect to drug control

expenditures, over population. Since population is in both the numerator and denominator, it

cancels out. The marginal effect thus approximates the effect of a unit increase in a drug control

spending variable on the number of drug users. The drug control variables are measured in




                                                 12
thousands of dollars. For example, the marginal effect of criminal justice spending is -.5770

which means that a $1,000 dollar increase in criminal justice spending would reduce the number

of drug users by .5570. This can be solved for the amount of added criminal justice spending

needed to deter one additional person from using drugs. This value, which is $1,733, is

convenient to compare with the social benefits of deterring one person from using drugs.

        The marginal reduction in drug use from drug control can be estimated with the reduced

form models estimated for the overall population and presented in Table 4. These regressions

may be the best to use for this exercise since they include the entire population and they include

both the direct effect of drug control on drug use as well as the indirect effect of drug control on

price, which also affects drug use. To answer the first question, the marginal effect of total drug

control spending is estimated from equation 1 in Table 4. The estimated value is -.2395. This

suggests that an additional expenditure of $4,170 on drug control will deter one person from

using drugs.

        The social costs of drug use were computed by Rice (1990) and are reprinted in Rydell

and Everingham (1994) and updated in ONDCP (1999). The Rice calculations include costs of

drug use from property destruction, victims of crime, short hospital stays of users, and morbidity

and mortality of users. Rice also includes costs from pursuing a criminal career and costs from

losing productivity of individuals who are incarcerated. These latter costs are not included in this

analysis since the NHSDA only includes individuals who are living at home rather than in prison

or who are homeless. The total cost of drug use in 1985 was $18,427 million which is equal to

$23,324 million in 1991 dollars. In 1991, the population of the US age 12 or over was

 The marginal effects are calculated by multiplying the density function for the equation by the variable’s
coefficient.

approximately 200 million and 13 percent of the population included in the NHSDA used illicit

drugs which is equal to 26 million drug users. With a total cost of $23,324 million and 26 million

drug users, the social cost of one drug users is $897.

        The regression suggest that an additional expenditure of $4,170 on drug control will deter

one person from using drugs. The social cost of a drug user is estimated at about $897. That is,

the estimated cost of deterring one person from drug use is greater than the cost to society of

letting that person use illicit drugs.

        These cost calculations must be viewed with some caution since the costs of drug use are

inherently difficult to estimate. In addition, the costs and the estimated number of users include

both users of marijuana and other illicit drugs. The limited empirical evidence indicates that

marijuana is far less costly to society that other illicit drugs.6 However, a very large percentage of

the estimated total number of drug users, use only marijuana. The result of these caveats is that

the $897 estimated social cost of drug use is probably more reflective of the social cost of

marijuana rather than the social cost of other illicit drug use. The social cost of marijuana maybe

somewhat lower than the $897 estimate, while the social cost of other illicit drugs maybe much

higher than the $897 estimate.

        The second question regarding whether criminal justice is more effective than public health

is somewhat more complicated. The complication, in part, results from the connection between

the criminal justice programs. Police spending was found to be a significant deterrent to drug use,

but for police work to be effective it must be followed by court, prosecution and in the event of

conviction, some type of sanction. The criminal justice variable in specification 2, in table 4,




                                                 14
includes all of these programs. The marginal effect of criminal justice spending is -.5770 which

means that $1,733 of added criminal justice spending will deter one person from using drugs. The

marginal effect of treatment is -.8286 which means that $1,206 must be spent on treatment to

deter one person from using illicit drugs. This suggests that treatment is more cost effective than

criminal justice in deterring drug use. Another complication in this question results from the

connection between criminal justice and treatment. Criminal justice and treatment are not

necessarily alternative approaches to drug control, and may be combined. The corrections

variable is never significant, while treatment is significant. This suggests that a more effective

method of reducing drug use might be to direct drug using offenders into a treatment and

rehabilitation environment rather than into a prison environment. That is, illicit drug participation

might be viewed as more of a public health problem than as a criminal justice problem. According

to ONDCP, 1999 the availability of treatment in prisons and through the new drug court system,

which provides alternatives to incarceration, has increased since the sample period. A recent

report issued by the Arizona Supreme Court (Wren, 1999) concludes that the state saves money

by offering convicted non-violent drug offenders probation with treatment, in lieu of prison. The

regression results presented in this study also suggest that treatment in place of prison is a cost

effective approach to spending the drug control budget.
