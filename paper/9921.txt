Motivated by public policy debates about bank consolidation and conflicting theoretical predictions
about the relationship between the market structure of the banking industry and bank fragility, this

likelihood of suffering a systemic banking crisis. Using data on 70 countries from 1980 to 1997, we
find that crises are less likely in economies with (i) more concentrated banking systems, (ii) fewer

regulatory restrictions on bank competition and activities, and (iii) national institutions that
encourage competition.

    I.       Introduction

         The consolidation of banks around the globe is fueling an active public policy debate on the

impact of consolidation on financial stability.1 Indeed, economic theory provides conflicting

predictions about the relationship between the market structure of the banking industry and banking

system fragility. Motivated by public policy debates and ambiguous theoretical predictions, this

paper investigates empirically the impact of bank concentration on banking system stability.

         Some theoretical arguments and country comparisons suggest that a less concentrated banking

sector with many small banks is more prone to financial crises than a concentrated banking sector

with a few large banks (Allen and Gale, 2000, 2003). First, proponents of the “concentration-

stability” view hold that large banks can diversify better so that banking systems characterized by a

few large banks will be less fragile than banking systems with many small banks.2 Second,

concentrated banking systems may enhance profits and therefore lower bank fragility. High profits

provide a “buffer” against adverse shocks and increase the franchise value of the bank, reducing

incentives for bank owners to take excessive risk (Hellmann, Murdoch, and Stiglitz, 2000). Third,

some hold that a few large banks are easier to monitor than many small banks, so that corporate

control of banks will be more effective and the risks of contagion less pronounced in a concentrated

banking system. According to Allen and Gale (2000), the U.S., with its large number of small banks,

supports this “concentration-stability” view since it has had a history of much greater financial

instability than the U.K or Canada, where the banking sector is dominated by fewer larger banks.

         An opposing view is that a more concentrated banking structure enhances bank fragility.

First, advocates of the “concentration-fragility” view note that large banks frequently receive

subsidies through implicit “too big to fail” policies.3 This greater subsidy for large banks may in turn

intensify risk-taking incentives, increasing the fragility of concentrated banking systems (Boyd and

Runkle, 1992 and Mishkin, 1999).4 Second, proponents of the concentration-fragility view would

disagree with the proposition that a few large banks are easier to monitor than many small banks. If

size is positively correlated with complexity, then large banks may be more opaque than small banks,

which would tend to produce a positive relationship between concentration and fragility. Finally,

Boyd, and De Nicolo (2003) stress that banks with greater market power tend to charge higher

interest rates to firms, which induces firms to assume greater risk. If concentration is positively

associated with banks having market power, this model predicts a positive relationship between

concentration and bank fragility.

         Despite conflicting theoretical predictions and policy debates, there is surprisingly little cross-

country empirical evidence on bank structure and fragility. For the United States, Boyd and Runkle

(1993) examine 122 bank holding companies. They find that there is an inverse relationship between

size and the volatility of asset returns, but no evidence that large banks are less likely to fail. In fact

they observe that large banks failed somewhat more often in the 1971-90 period. They explain this

result by showing that larger banks are more highly leveraged and less profitable in terms of asset

returns.

3
  Even in the absence of deposit insurance, banks are prone to excessive risk-taking due to limited liability for their equity
holders and to their high leverage (Stiglitz, 1972).
4
  There is a literature that examines deposit insurance and its effect on bank decisions. According to this literature (e.g.
Merton (1977), Sharpe (1978), Flannery (1989), Kane (1989), and Chan, Greenbaum and Thakor (1992)) – mis-priced
deposit insurance produces an incentive for banks to take risk. If the regulatory treatment were the same for insured
banks of all sizes, these models would predict no relationship between bank size and riskiness. Since regulators fear
potential macroeconomic consequences of large bank failures, most countries have implicit “too large to fail” policies
which protect all liabilities of very large banks whether they are insured or not. Thus, largest banks frequently receive a




                                                              2
        Although there is a growing cross-country empirical literature on banking crises, this

literature does not address the issue of banking structure. Earlier work has mostly focused on

identifying (i) the macroeconomic determinants of banking crises (Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache,

1998, henceforth DD), (ii) the relationship between banking and currency crises (Kaminsky and

Reinhart, 1999), (iii) the impact of financial liberalization on bank stability (DD, 1999), and (iv) the

impact of deposit insurance design on bank fragility (DD, 2003). Barth, Caprio, and Levine (2004)

examine the relationship between bank regulations and crises, but they do not examine bank

concentration and they use pure cross-country comparisons rather than panel analyses.

        This paper studies the impact of bank concentration, bank regulations, and national

institutions on the likelihood of suffering a systemic banking crisis using data on 70 countries over

the period 1980-1997. This is the first paper to examine the impact of concentration on crises across

a broad cross-section of countries while controlling for differences in regulatory policies, national

institutions governing property rights and economic freedom, the ownership structure of banks, and

macroeconomic and financial conditions.5 To draw accurate inferences about the impact of banking

structure on crises, we control for an array of factors that may influence both bank concentration and

fragility. We control for international differences in the generosity of deposit insurance regimes,

capital regulations, restrictions on bank entry, and regulatory restrictions on bank activities.

Furthermore, to assess the impact of concentration on crises, we need to control for cross-country

differences in bank ownership, i.e., the degree to which the state and foreigners own the country’s

banks. Finally, we control for the overall institutional environment governing economic activity as




greater net subsidy from the government (O’Hara and Shaw, 1990). This subsidy may in turn increase the risk-taking
incentives of the larger banks. For an analysis of the corporate governance of banks, see Macey and O’Hara (2003).

  Demirgüç-Kunt, Laeven and Levine (2004) investigate the impact of bank concentration and regulations on bank net
interest margins, but they do not examine bank fragility.

well as the level of economic development, economic growth, inflation, terms of trade changes, credit

growth, etc.

       The paper has three major findings. First, we find that crises are less likely in more

concentrated banking systems. This is consistent with the concentration-stability view’s argument

that banking systems characterized by a few, large banks are more stable than less concentrated

banking markets. Second, the paper shows that more competition lowers the probability that a

country will suffer a systemic banking crisis. The data indicate that fewer regulatory restrictions on

banks – lower barriers to bank entry and fewer restrictions on bank activities – reduce bank fragility.

Third, countries with national institutions that promote competition in general have a lower

likelihood of suffering a systemic banking crisis. These results are not driven by reverse causality

and are robust to an array of sensitivity checks. In terms of linking the results back to specific parts

of the concentration-stability view, the finding that competition reduces fragility is inconsistent with

the argument that concentrated banking systems boost profits and therefore reduce fragility. Rather,

the evidence is more consistent with the views that concentrated banking systems tend to have banks

that are better diversified or easier to monitor than banks in less concentrated banking systems.

       The results must be qualified. We investigate systemic banking crises, which are very

difficult to define and date. Consequently, we use different definitions of and dates for crises and

obtain robust results. Nevertheless, future work that assesses the impact of the market structure of

the banking industry and bank regulations on individual bank fragility will provide a valuable

complement to our research.

       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the data set and presents

summary statistics. Section III explains the methodology used in empirical tests. Section IV contains

the main results and Section V concludes.




                                                    4
       II.     Data and Summary Statistics

       This section describes the data. The Appendix provides more detailed variable definitions

and data sources.

       Crisis is a dummy variable that equals one if the country is going through a systemic crisis,

and zero if it is not. Following DD (2003), we identify and date episodes of banking sector distress

using primarily information from Lindgren, Garcia and Saal (1996) and Caprio and Klingebiel

(1999). Then, these episodes of distress are classified as systemic if emergency measures were taken

to assist the banking system (such as bank holidays, deposit freezes, blanket guarantees to depositors

or other bank creditors), or if large-scale nationalizations took place. Episodes were also classified as

systemic if non-performing assets reached at least 10 percent of total assets at the peak of the crisis,

or if the cost of the rescue operations was at least 2 percent of GDP. Many crises run for multiple

years. We exclude the years after the initial year of the crisis because during a crisis, the behavior of

some of the explanatory variables is likely to be affected by the crisis itself, leading to reverse

causality. Note, however, that including the crisis years does not change the conclusions. Also, some

countries experience more than one crisis. For instance, Turkey suffered systemic banking crises in

1982, 1991, and 1994. For the period 1980-1997, the sample includes all countries covered in the

International Financial Statistics, excluding countries in transition, those without data, etc., as

discussed in DD (2003). This results in 79 countries and 51 crisis episodes. Table 1 lists this

information. Later in the paper we also investigate robustness of our results to differences in the crisis

definition.

       Concentration equals the share of assets of the three largest banks. We compute a measure of

bank concentration using the Bankscope database compiled by Fitch-IBCA, which reports bank

balance sheet data in a large cross-section of countries beginning in 1988. However, because the



                                                     5
sample of banks covered increased significantly over the sample period, changes in the measure of

concentration may just reflect changes in coverage. To reduce this potential problem, we average the

measure over the period 1988-1997. We have data on concentration for 70 countries including 47

crisis episodes. As reported in Tables 1 and 2, most countries have concentrated banking systems

with a sample mean of 72 percent. Still, there is wide variation in the sample, with concentration

levels ranging from less than 20 percent for the U.S. to 100 percent for many African countries.

Simple correlations do not show a significant relationship between the crisis dummy and bank

concentration, although the sign is negative.

       Using this measure of concentration may blur the interpretation of estimation results since for

many observations the crisis date would precede the time period for which we have the concentration

values. However, we also use the initial level of concentration at the start of the sample period and

focus on crises that occurred after this date. Although this cuts the number of observations in half

and reduces crisis episodes to 20, we confirm our results.

       To investigate the relationship between banking crises and bank concentration, we control for

many factors. Specifically, we begin with the econometric specification in DD (2003) and include

the same regressors. Thus, we include the rate of growth of real GDP, the change in the external

terms of trade, and the rate of inflation, to capture macroeconomic developments that are likely to

affect the quality of bank assets. The short-term real interest rate is included to capture the banks’

cost of funds. Also, higher real interest rate may affect bank profitability increasing default rates.

Bank vulnerability to sudden capital outflows triggered by a run on the currency and bank exposure

to foreign exchange risk are measured by the rate of exchange rate depreciation and by the ratio of

M2 to foreign exchange reserves. Lagged credit growth is also a control since high rates of credit

expansion may finance an asset price bubble that may cause a crisis when it bursts. We also include




                                                    6
DD’s (2003) index of moral hazard caused by deposit insurance generosity since they find that it

contributes significantly to financial fragility.6 Finally, GDP per capita is used to control for the level

of development of the country, which DD (2003) included it to proxy for the quality of regulations

and the general institutional environment. Thus, we leave GDP per capita out of the benchmark when

we explore the impact of specific banking regulations and institutional indicators.

        Simple correlations in Table 2 suggest that banking crises are more likely in countries with

higher levels of inflation and exchange rate depreciation, and less likely in growing countries with

higher GDP per capita.

        In addition to bank concentration, we augment the benchmark specification in DD by using

measures of bank regulation and supervision, bank ownership, the competitiveness of the banking

system and the economy in general, and a summary institutional index. Measures of bank regulation

and supervision come from Barth, et al., (2001, 2004). The data set is collected through surveys of

government officials in the late 1990s, but according to additional analyses by Barth, et al., (2001)

and Carkovic and Levine (2002), these aspects of bank regulation do not change much.

        We use four measures of bank regulation and supervision.

        Fraction of Entry Denied is the number of entry applications denied as a fraction of the

number of applications received from domestic and foreign entities. This is a measure of entry

restrictions in banking and thus the contestability of the market. To the extent restricted entry

increases bank profits, this variable would be associated with a lower rate of fragility. If however,

restricted entry induces inefficiencies in the banking market, it could also lead to greater fragility.



6
  To build an aggregate index of moral hazard, DD (2003) estimate the first principal component of various deposit
insurance design features. Specifically, they use coinsurance, coverage of foreign currency and interbank deposits, type
of funding, source of funding, management, membership, and the level of explicit coverage to create this aggregate index
that increases with the generosity of the deposit insurance regime. The index varies over time since different countries
adopted deposit insurance or revised its design features at different points in time.


                                                           7
       Activity Restrictions aggregates measures that indicate whether bank activities in the

securities, insurance, and real estate markets and ownership and control of nonfinancial firms are (1)

unrestricted, (2) permitted, (3) restricted, or (4) prohibited. The aggregate indicator has therefore a

possible maximum variation between four and 16, with higher numbers indicating more restrictions

on bank activities and nonfinancial ownership and control. If these restrictions manage to keep banks

from entering lines of business that are too risky for them to adequately evaluate or manage, banking

systems with greater restrictions may be more stable. If however, restrictions prevent firms from

diversifying outside their traditional lines of business, they may increase the fragility of the system.

       Required Reserves is the ratio of bank assets that regulators require banks to hold as reserves.

Banking systems with higher ratios of required reserves may be more stable since they would have a

greater buffer to absorb liquidity shocks. However, greater required reserves are also a tax on the

banking system, which may lower profits and raise fragility.

       Capital Regulatory Index is a summary measure of capital stringency, and it is given by the

sum of initial capital stringency and overall capital requirements. To the extent that book capital is

an accurate measure of bank solvency we expect better capitalized banks to be less fragile.

       Table 2 indicates that fraction denied, activity restrictions, and required reserves are positively

and significantly correlated with each other. Capital regulatory index is also positively correlated

with required reserves but negatively correlated with activity restrictions. The moral hazard index is

negatively and significantly correlated with all regulatory variables except capital regulatory index

where the correlation is positive. It is also interesting that deposit insurance schemes in concentrated

banking systems tend to be designed such that moral hazard is significantly lower. Among the

regulatory variables only activity restrictions is significantly correlated –albeit at ten percent - with

the crisis dummy, and the sign is positive.




                                                     8
         We also control for ownership. If public banks are considered to have government

guarantees, banking systems with a larger share of public banks may be less prone to banking runs.

However, inefficiencies in public banks may also make them more fragile, destabilizing the system.

Indeed, Caprio and Martinez-Peria (2000) and Barth, et al., (2001) find evidence supporting the

former argument.

         The extent of foreign bank ownership is another important control. To the extent foreign

banks improve domestic banks’ efficiency (as found in Claessens, Demirguc-Kunt and Huizinga,

2001), they may also make the system more stable. However, reduction in profits due to higher

competition from foreign banks may also hurt the domestic banks making the system more fragile.

         State Ownership and Foreign Ownership are from Barth, et al., (2001), defined as the

percentage of banking system’s assets in banks that are 50 percent or more government or foreign

owned. As in the case of regulatory variables, the assumption is that ownership of banks does not

vary significantly over the years.7 Simple correlations in Table 2 do not reveal significant

relationships between bank ownership variables and crisis occurrence.

         We also use three additional variables to capture the extent of banking freedoms and general

economic freedoms and institutional environment.

         Banking Freedom is an indicator of relative openness of the banking system. Specifically, it

is a composite index of whether foreign banks and financial services firms are able to operate freely,

how difficult it is to open domestic banks and other financial services firms, how heavily regulated

the financial system is, the presence of state-owned banks, whether the government influences




7
  We also use state bank data from La Porta, Lopez de Silanes, and Shleifer (2002) who report figures on the percentage
of assets of the largest 10 banks owned by the government. For each country there are two data points, one for 1995, and
one referring to public ownership “before the privatizations of the 1990s.” In the regression, we use the latter figures for
the 1980s and the former for the 1990s.


                                                             9
allocation of credit, and whether banks are free to provide customers with insurance products and

invest in securities. Higher values indicate fewer restrictions on banking freedoms.

        Economic Freedom is an indicator of how a country’s policies rank in terms of providing

economic freedoms. It is a composite of ten indicators ranking policies in the areas of trade,

government finances, government interventions, monetary policy, capital flows and foreign

investment, banking and finance, wages and prices, property rights, regulation, and black market

activity. Higher scores indicate polices more conducive to competition and economic freedom. Both

variables are available from the Heritage Foundation and are average values for the 1995-97 period.

To the extent freedoms allow banks to improve efficiency and to engage in different activities and

diversify their risks, we expect increased level of freedoms to reduce fragility. However, it is also

true that greater freedoms allow banks to undertake greater risks, particularly if the underlying

institutional environment and existing regulations and supervision distort risk-taking incentives.

Thus, overall greater freedoms may also lead to greater bank fragility.

        KKZ_Composite is an index of the overall level of institutional development constructed by

Kaufman, Kraay and Zoido-Lobaton (1999). The underlying indicators are voice and accountability,

government effectiveness, political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption.

This index is available for 1998. We expect better institutions to lead to reduced bank fragility,

controlling for all other factors. Simple correlations indicate that the crisis dummy is negatively and

significantly correlated with the two freedom indicators and the institutions variable. Countries with

better institutions also tend to have more competitive banking systems with fewer regulatory

restrictions.




                                                   10
       III.    Methodology

       In estimating the crisis model, we follow DD (1998, 2003) and use a logit probability model.

Using this model of banking crisis, we can test the hypothesis that bank concentration and

competition have an impact on fragility when controlling for other factors. Thus, we estimate the

probability that a systemic crisis will occur at a particular time in a particular country, assuming that

this probability is a function of the explanatory variables (X(i,t)) discussed above. Let P(i, t) denote a

dummy variable that takes the value of one when a banking crisis occurs in country i and time t and a

value of zero otherwise. β is a vector of n unknown coefficients and F(βΝX(i, t)) is the cumulative

probability distribution function evaluated at βΝX(i, t). Then, the log-likelihood function of the

model is:

       Ln L = 3t=1..T 3i=1..n{P(i,t)ln[F(βΝX(i,t))] + (1-P(i,t)) ln[1- F(βΝX(i,t))]}.

       In modeling the probability distribution we use the logistic functional form, which is

commonly used in studying banking difficulties.8 We estimate the model with robust standard errors

since there may be heteroskedasticity across different observations. Observations within each

country group may also be correlated. We also deal with this problem below, by relaxing the

assumption that errors are independent within country observations.

         When interpreting the regression results, it is important to remember that the estimated

coefficients do not indicate an increase in the probability of a crisis given a one-unit increase in the

corresponding explanatory variables. Instead, the coefficients reflect the effect of a change in an

explanatory variable on ln(P(i,t)/(1-P(i,t))). Therefore, the increase in probability depends on the

original probability and thus upon the initial values of all the independent variables and their

coefficients. While the sign of the coefficient does indicate the direction of the change, the




                                                    11
magnitude depends on the slope of the cumulative distribution function at β’X(i,t). In other words, a

change in the explanatory variable will have different effects on the probability of a crisis depending

on the country’s initial crisis probability. Under the logistic specification, if a country has an

extremely high (or low) initial probability of crisis, a marginal change in the independent variables

has little effect on its prospects, while the same marginal change has a greater effect if the country’s

probability of crisis in an intermediate range.

        In the analysis presented below, we investigate the impact of bank concentration variable and

different regulatory, competition, ownership and institutional variables on bank fragility one at a

time. We also analyze if the impact of concentration is robust to controlling for regulatory variables

and indicators of competition and institutional development and whether there are significant

interactions with concentration and these variables. Finally, we explore the potential non-linearity of

the crisis-concentration relationship, and discuss the robustness of our results to different definitions

of concentration and reverse causality.

IV.    Results

       A. Main findings

       1. Concentration and crises

       The concentration variable enters the regressions negatively, significantly, and with an

economically large coefficient. This result suggests that concentrated banking systems are less

vulnerable to banking crises (Table 3). Evaluating the marginal impact of concentration on the

probability of crisis at the mean values for all variables, we see that a one standard deviation increase

in concentration leads to a decrease in crisis probability of one percent. Since crisis probabilities at

any point in time are quite low, with a mean value of four percent, this is a substantial reduction.

This result is supportive of the concentration-stability view that concentration fosters a more stable

banking system.

       Among the control variables, GDP growth and per capita GDP enter negatively, while the real

interest rates enter positively, as suggested by economic theory and earlier empirical studies. Credit

growth is positive, but significant only at the ten percent level, which lends weak support to the

argument that credit booms signal future fragility. Confirming the results of DD (2003), moral

hazard enters positive and significantly, indicating that deposit insurance design can have an

important impact on fragility, and the result is weaker controlling for bank concentration. The model

also fits the data well, classifying 65 percent of all observations and over 70 percent of crisis

observations accurately.9

       In column (3) we also add a squared concentration variable to the specification to check for

potential nonlinearities in the relationship between concentration and banking crises. When including

the squared term, the concentration variable retains a negative and significant coefficient at the ten




                                                    13
percent level, while the squared concentration term is positive and insignificant. Testing for the joint

significance of the two variables, we see that together the coefficients are significantly different from

zero at the five percent level. This indicates that, although weak, at very high levels of concentration,

there is an offsetting effect at work where concentrated banking systems are no longer as stable.

Below, we try to understand the nature of this nonlinearity better. Finally, the table shows that the

concentration result is not sensitive to excluding GDP per capita from the regression.

         2. Concentration, regulations, and crises

         In Table 4, we include indicators of bank regulation to the specification. These specifications

exclude GDP per capita since it is also a proxy for the institutional environment. We have also

estimated specifications where we have left out the concentration variable and included only the

regulation supervision variables one at a time. The results on these variables are virtually unchanged,

thus we do not report them for brevity.

         The results indicate that tighter entry restrictions and more severe regulatory restrictions on

bank activities boost bank fragility (Table 4). These are consistent with the results obtained by Barth

et al. (2004), who examine the impact of entry restrictions on crises in a purely cross-country

investigation that does not control for bank concentration. A higher fraction of entry applications

denied- a proxy for tighter entry regulations – leads to higher levels of fragility in the banking

system. This is consistent with the argument that restricted entry reduces the efficiency of the

banking system, also making it more vulnerable to external shocks. Similarly, we find that

restrictions on bank activities increase crisis probabilities. This result indicates that overall these

restrictions prevent banks from diversifying outside their traditional business, reducing their ability to

 In classifying observations, predicted probabilities significantly higher than 4 percent (no of crisis observations divided
by total number of observations which equals the sample mean of the crisis dummy) are classified as crisis observations
and those below 4 percent are classified as no crisis.

reduce the riskiness of their portfolios. The required reserves and capital regulatory index do not

enter with significant coefficients.

         The results also indicate that the concentration result is robust to inclusion of regulatory

variables. The overall effect of bank concentration on crisis likelihood is still negative and

significant. In unreported regressions we have also explored specifications where we have interacted

the concentration variable with these regulatory variables, but the interaction terms did not enter

significantly.

         3. Concentration, ownership, institutions, and crises

         In Table 5, we explore the impact of concentration, bank ownership, and the overall

institutional environment variables on bank fragility. We examined each of the ownership and

institutional indicators both with and without concentration included in the regression. Since the

coefficients on the ownership and institutional variables are not significantly different in either

specification, we only report the results of the regressions that include concentration. The first two

columns explore the impact of bank ownership on fragility.

         The data do not indicate a strong link between bank fragility and either state or foreign

ownership. While some regressions indicate a positive impact of state ownership on bank fragility,

this result is not very robust.10 The impact of foreign ownership on fragility is negative, but

insignificant.

         In contrast, the variables that capture the general openness and competitiveness of the banking

system and the economy enter with negative and very significant coefficients. Thus countries with

greater freedoms in banking and generally more competitive economic policies are less likely to

experience banking crises. This is the case despite the fact these policies also tend to reduce entry


10
  In the specification that excludes bank concentration, state ownership is not significant. Replicating these regressions
using LLS (1999) measure of state bank ownership confirm these findings.


                                                            15
barriers and are correlated with reduced levels of bank concentration. Better institutional

environment is also associated with a lower probability of systemic crisis, as expected. The evidence

is consistent with theories that emphasize the stabilizing effects of competition (Boyd and De Nicolo,

2003), but inconsistent with the many models that stress the destabilizing effects from competition.11

        The results on bank concentration are robust to including bank ownership and general

competition and institutional variables. In unreported regressions we also explored whether the

impact of concentration on fragility differs in countries with different levels of freedoms and

institutional development, by including interaction terms in the regressions. None of these interaction

terms were significant, suggesting that bank concentration reduces fragility regardless of the

competition environment or the institutional development of the country.

        4. Concentration, regulations, ownership, institutions, and crises

        In Table 6, we simultaneously include bank concentration, regulations, ownership, and

institutions. In each specification we enter bank concentration, the index of overall institutional

development, and a measure of regulation.

        Bank concentration remains significantly, negatively associated with bank fragility even when

controlling for the regulatory variables and overall institutional development. Indeed, the size of the

coefficient on concentration is not substantially affected by expanding the conditioning information

set.

        In contrast, the regulatory restriction variables and the overall institutional development

indicators exhibit substantial multicollinearity. Their independent significance is materially

weakened in Table 6 when they are included jointly. These results suggest that regulatory

11
  Boyd and De Nicolo (2003) stress that competition exerts a stabilizing impact on banks because more competitive
banks charge lower interest rates to firms and these lower rates reduce the likelihood of default. This prediction is
consistent with our results. However, Boyd and De Nicolo (2003) use bank concentration as an indicator of bank




                                                           16
approaches to banking are part of the overall national approach to openness, competition, and private

property in the economy.

         The evidence in Table 6 suggests that bank concentration is not a simple proxy for regulatory

restrictions or national institutions. Bank concentration enters negatively in the crisis regression

when controlling for regulations and institutions. These findings support the view that concentrated

banking systems are more stable than less concentrated systems. The data are inconsistent with

theories that predict more fragility in more concentrated banking systems.

         The findings that (i) concentration lowers fragility and (ii) low competition raises fragility

imply that future research needs to move beyond a simple “concentration-stability” versus

“concentration-fragility” debate where concentration is viewed as a simple proxy for market power.

There are at least three possible explanations for our finding that concentration is negatively

associated with bank fragility. First, concentrated banking system may have bigger banks that are

better diversified than less concentrated banking systems. Second, concentrated banking systems

may reduce fragility by boosting bank profits. Third, concentrated banking systems with a few large

banks may be easier to monitor than a banking system with many small banks. Recall, however, that

this paper finds that greater competition in banking promotes bank stability, which is inconsistent

with the argument that concentration enhances stability by boosting bank profits. If our measures of

regulatory restrictions and market openness do a reasonably good job of measuring the

competitiveness of the banking industry, then the finding that concentration remains negatively

associated with the probability of suffering a systemic banking crises while controlling for the

competitiveness of the market implies that concentration is measuring “something else” besides

market power. Thus, within the concentration-stability view, at least two remaining explanations


competition. Thus, they stress that concentration will exert a destabilizing impact on banks, which is inconsistent with
our results.


                                                            17
may account for the positive link between concentration and stability: more diversification and easier

monitoring. We hope that future studies at the individual bank-level can identify why bank

concentration is negatively correlated with bank fragility even after controlling for the degree of

competition in the banking industry.12

         B. Sensitivity analyses

         In Table 7, we try to better understand how the relationship between concentration and

fragility changes at high levels of bank concentration. In columns (1) to (6) we define a high

concentration dummy for different cut-off levels of concentration using 45th to 70th percentiles, where

the dummy takes the value one at this cut-off value of concentration or higher. Results indicate that

the high concentration dummy is significant between the 45th and 65th percentiles, for concentration

levels between 74 and 84 percent. However, once we hit the 70th percentile, at concentrations levels

of 87 percent or higher, the effect is no longer significant. The loss of significance may be due to the

fact that we only have 11 countries with concentration levels of over 87 percent that experienced a

crisis, and when the sample becomes very imbalanced with respect to crisis/non-crisis observations

estimation becomes imprecise. In the last column, we estimate a polynomial, including squared and

cubed concentration terms. The squared term is positive and the cubed term is negative in this

specification, both significant at ten percent, suggesting that there are indeed nonlinear effects at high

levels of concentration. To see if in addition to the intercept change there is also a slope change at

high concentration levels, we also explored specifications where we included an interaction term of

12
  We tried to assess directly the views that (1) concentration is negatively related to bank fragility because a few large
banks tend to be better diversified and (2) concentration is negatively related to bank fragility because a few large banks
are easier to monitor than many small banks. However, the available measures of these two views at the country level are
very crude. To proxy for the diversification channel, we used measures of bank size, economy size, an indicator of the
ability of banks to diversify abroad, and an indicator of whether regulatory authorities enforce diversification guidelines.
When controlling for these variables, concentration remained significant and these proxies for diversification did not enter
significantly. To measure monitoring complexity, we used the number of banks in the economy and the indicator of
regulatory restrictions on bank activities (since more complex financial institutions – that is, banks that are able to engage




                                                             18
the concentration variable and high concentration dummy. The coefficient estimate was not

significant.

         We conclude that while there is some evidence that the impact of concentration on stability is

less strong at high levels of concentration, this result is somewhat sensitive to how we define high

concentration. In sum, our results indicate that the overall effect of concentration on fragility is

negative at all levels of bank concentration, even after we control for bank regulation and

supervision, differences in bank ownership, the level of competitiveness in banking and the economy

and general institutional development.

         In Table 8, we investigate the sensitivity of our results to the way we define the crisis dummy

and the concentration variable. As discussed above, when a crisis lasts for more than one year, we

only include the first year of the crisis and omit the other years. In column 2, we include these crisis

period observations that occur after the first year of the crisis and treat them as crisis observations. In

column 3, we include these crisis period observations that occur after the first year of the crisis and

treat them as non-crisis observations. As shown, the results are not sensitive to the treatment of the

crisis period observations that occur after the first year of the crisis. In the next two columns we

redefine the crisis dummy using the definitions provided in Caprio and Klingebiel (1999). Column 4

still focuses on systemic bank crises13 and column 5 also includes borderline crises.14 Since the focus

of our study is on systemic crises, we think it is more accurate to only examine system-wide failures.

Nonetheless, concentration is still negative and significant at the ten percent level.




in underwriting, brokerage activities, insurance activities, etc. – maybe more difficult to monitor). Again, these proxies
did not change our findings on concentration.
13
   Portugal and Guyana are re-defined as noncrisis countries and India, Italy, Jordan, Papua New Guinea, and US are
excluded from the sample since they are classified as borderline as opposed to systemic banking crises.
14
   Portugal and Guyana are re-defined as noncrisis countries and the following crises are added to the sample Burundi
(1994-97), Canada (1983-85), Congo (1992-97), Denmark (1987-92), and France (1994-95).


                                                            19
       Next we turn to the definition of the concentration variable. In column 6 we first replicate the

baseline regression replacing the concentration variable by the one obtained from Barth, et al.,

(2001). This measure of concentration, obtained through surveys of bank regulators, is calculated as

the fraction of deposits held by the five largest commercial banks in each country as of end-1999.

We expect this measure not to suffer from problems of differential coverage in each country since the

source is the bank regulators themselves. Using this different measure of bank concentration, we get

very similar results.

       There may exist concerns regarding reverse causality. This would be the case if systemic

crises led to lower levels of concentration in the banking system through greater entry or changes in

general competition policies. When we inspect individual crisis cases in our sample, however, we do

not see a significant pattern of reduced concentration after the crisis episodes and the concentration

levels do not vary significantly from year to year.15 Nevertheless, we estimate a specification where

we define concentration as the initial level of concentration (1988 or the first available year) instead

of the 1988-97 average. As can be seen in column 7 of Table 8, this does not change our results

significantly, which is consistent with the observation that concentration does not vary much over

time. This estimation is still subject to problems though, since some of the crisis episodes have taken

place before the date for which we have data for concentration. Thus, we drop all those crisis

episodes that precede the initial concentration date. This leaves us with only 20 crisis episodes and

less than half of the total number of observations, yet the concentration variable still remains negative

and significant (column 8, Table 8). These results lead us to believe that the negative impact of

concentration on banking system fragility is not due to reverse causality.

        So far in the analysis, we have allowed for heteroskedasticity of errors and corrected for it,

but assumed that the errors are independent. However, given that we use a panel data set, it is likely




                                                   20
that the error terms within individual country observations are correlated with each other. Table 9,

column 1 reports our results relaxing the assumption that within country observations are

independent. Concentration still enters with a negative and significant coefficient. In column 2, we

estimate a logit model with random country effects. Again, the results are not significantly different.

        We also investigate the sensitivity our results to using alternative samples. In column 3 of

Table 9, we exclude from the sample all countries with populations less than 1 million. Results are

not sensitive to excluding small countries. In column 4, we exclude all African countries since they

tend to have very high bank concentration ratios. We see that our results are not driven by African

observations. In column 5, we exclude all developed countries from the analysis. Again, we see that

concentration significantly reduces fragility also in the sample of developing countries. Finally, in

column 6 we exclude a few outlier observations in terms of inflation and interest rates, which leaves

the results unchanged.16


V.      Conclusions

        This paper investigates the impact of bank concentration, bank regulations, bank ownership,

and the overall competitive/institutional environment on banking system fragility. We use cross-

country data on 70 countries and 47 crisis episodes. In concluding, we emphasize three findings.

        First, bank concentration has a stabilizing effect. Concentrated banking systems are less

likely to experience systemic banking crises, even after controlling for a wide array of

macroeconomic, regulatory and institutional factors. There is also some evidence that the stabilizing

effect of bank concentration is weaker at higher levels of concentration, although this does not

change the fact that the overall impact of concentration on fragility is negative and that the

  Excluded observations are Gabon (1993) and Ivory Coast (1993) because their M2/reserves values are outliers and Peru

relationship holds when controlling for bank regulations and the overall competitive/institutional

climate.

       Second, confirming the earlier results of Barth et al. (2003), we find that entry barriers and

activity restrictions have a destabilizing effect on banking systems. Banking systems where a larger

fraction of entry applications are denied, and those where regulations restrict banks from engaging in

non-loan making activities have a greater likelihood of experiencing a systemic crisis. The data do

not support the view that more competition induces greater fragility. Quite to the contrary, more

competitive banking systems and those with fewer entry regulations and activity restrictions tend to

be more stable.

       Finally, we find that countries with better-developed institutions and with policies that

promote competition throughout the economy are less likely to suffer from systemic banking crises.

The composite indicator of institutional development always has a negative and significant sign in the

fragility regressions. Moreover, we find that it is difficult to identify the independent effect of bank

regulations and bank policies that promote competition from the overall institutional environment.

Countries with better institutions (property rights, rule of law, political openness, low corruption,

etc.) also tend to be countries with bank regulations and bank policies that support openness and

competition. Thus, while bank regulations and policies that foster competition and contestability

promote bank stability, these regulations and policies cannot be viewed in isolation from the overall

institutional environment.

The logit probability model estimated is Banking Crisis [Country=j, Time= t]= α + β1 Real GDP growthj,t+ β2 Terms of trade changej,t + β3 Real interest ratej,t + β4 Inflation j,t +
β5M2/reservesj,t + β6Depreciationj,t + β7 Credit growthj,t-2 + β8 Real GDP per capitaj,t+β9 Moral Hazard Indexj,t+β10 Average concentrationj,t+ β11 concentration 2j,t+ εj,t. The
dependent variable is a crisis dummy that takes on the value of one if there is a systemic and the value of zero otherwise. Growth is the rate of growth of real GDP. Real interest
rate is the nominal interest rate minus the contemporaneous rate of inflation. Inflation is the rate of change of the GDP deflator. M2/reserves is the ratio of M2 to international
reserves. Credit growth is the real growth of domestic credit, lagged two periods. Depreciation is the rate of change of the exchange rate. Moral hazard is an aggregate index of
moral hazard associated with varying deposit insurance schemes. Concentration is a measure of concentration in the banking industry, calculated as the fraction of assets held by
the three largest banks in each country, averaged over the sample period. Bank data are from the BankScope database of Fitch IBCA. The sample period is 1980-1997. White’s
heteroskedasiticy consistent standard errors are given in parentheses. Detailed variable definitions and sources are given in the data appendix.

The logit probability model estimated is Banking Crisis [Country=j, Time= t]= α + β1 Real GDP growthj,t+ β2 Terms of trade changej,t + β3 Real interest ratej,t + β4 Inflation j,t +
β5M2/reservesj,t + β6Depreciationj,t + β7 Credit growthj,t-2 + β8Moral Hazard Indexj,t+β9 Concentrationj,t+ β10 Regulatory measuresj,t+ εj,t. The dependent variable is a crisis
dummy that takes on the value of one if there is a systemic and the value of zero otherwise. Growth is the rate of growth of real GDP. Real interest rate is the nominal interest
rate minus the contemporaneous rate of inflation. Inflation is the rate of change of the GDP deflator. M2/reserves is the ratio of M2 to international reserves. Credit growth is the
real growth of domestic credit, lagged two periods. Depreciation is the rate of change of the exchange rate. Moral hazard is an aggregate index of moral hazard associated with
varying deposit insurance schemes. Concentration is a measure of concentration in the banking industry, calculated as the fraction of assets held by the three largest banks in each
country, averaged over the sample period. Bank data are from the BankScope database of Fitch IBCA. The sample period is 1980-1997. The Regulatory measures in specifications
(1)-(4) - Fraction of entry applications denied, Activity restrictions, Required reserves and Capital regulatory index, - are included (one at a time) as regressors. Fraction of entry
applications denied measures the number of entry applications denied as a fraction of the total received. Activity restrictions captures bank’s ability to engage in business of
securities underwriting, insurance underwriting and selling, and in real estate investment, management, and development. Required reserves is the percentage of reserves
regulators require to hold Capital regulatory index is a summary measure of capital stringency. White’s heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors are given in parentheses.
Detailed variable definitions and sources are given in the data appendix.

database of Fitch IBCA. The sample period is 1980-1997. The Regulatory measures in n specifications (1)-(4) – Fraction of entry applications, denied, Activity restrictions, and
State ownership - are included (one at a time) as regressors. Fraction of entry applications denied measures the number of entry applications denied as a fraction of the total
received. Activity restrictions captures bank’s ability to engage in business of securities underwriting, insurance underwriting and selling, and in real estate investment,
management, and development. State ownership is the percentage of banking system’s assets in banks that are 50% or more government owned. Banking freedom is an indicator
of relative openness of banking and financial system, while economic freedom is a composite of 10 institutional factors determining economic freedom. White’s
heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors are given in parentheses. Detailed variable definitions and sources are given in the data appendix.

dependent variable is a crisis dummy that takes on the value of one if there is a systemic and the value of zero otherwise. Growth is the rate of growth of real GDP. Real interest
rate is the nominal interest rate minus the contemporaneous rate of inflation. Inflation is the rate of change of the GDP deflator. M2/reserves is the ratio of M2 to international
reserves. Credit growth is the real growth of domestic credit, lagged two periods. Depreciation is the rate of change of the exchange rate. Moral hazard is an aggregate index of
moral hazard associated with varying deposit insurance schemes. Concentration is a measure of concentration in the banking industry, calculated as the fraction of assets held by
the three largest banks in each country, averaged over the sample period. High concentration is a dummy taking a value of one in cases where the banking concentration is greater
than or equal to the cutoff listed in the footnote of the table. Bank data are from the BankScope database of Fitch IBCA. The sample period is 1980-1997. Specifications (1)- (6)
use high concentration at the 45th, 50th, 55th, 60th, 65th, and 70th percentile, respectively. White’s heteroskedasiticy consistent standard errors are given in parentheses. Detailed

Banking Freedom            Indicator of relative openness of banking and financial system:       Index of Economic Freedom (Heritage Foundation)
                           specifically, whether the foreign banks and financial services
                           firms are able to operate freely, how difficult it is to open
                           domestic banks and other financial services firms, how heavily
                           regulated the financial system is, the presence of state-owned
                           banks, whether the government influences allocation of credit,
                           and whether banks are free to provide customers with insurance
                           and invest in securities (and vice-versa). The index ranges in
                           value from 1 (very low – banks are primitive) to 5 (very high –
                           few restrictions). Averaged over 1995-97 period.

                           property rights, regulation, and black market activity. Individual
                           factors are weighted equally to determine overall score of
                           economic freedom. A high score signifies an institutional or
                           consistent set of policies that are most conducive to economic
                           freedom, while a score close to 1 signifies a set of policies that
                           are least conducive. Averaged over 1995-97 period.

                           are weighted equally to determine overall score of economic
                           freedom. Higher values correspond to better governance
                           outcomes.
