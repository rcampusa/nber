               The Real Price of Oil and the l970s World Inflation



                                    ABSTRACT




     This paper shows that the effects on real income and the price level of

the 1973—1974 oil price increase are quite ambiguous on both theoretical and

empirical grounds. The theoretical analysis reviews standard results and

extends them to analyze the steady—state equilibrium and endogenous monetary

policy reaction functions. It is shown that standard models and parameter

values imply trivial reductions in real income and ambiguously signed

changes in the price level. It is noted, however, that other special

models can rationalize empirical findings of large effects. Direct real—

oil—price effects in an extended Barro—Lucas real income equation are esti-

mated for eight countries. Although statistically significant and substan-

tial direct effects are found for about half the countries, it is noted

that these coincided with countries undergoing price decontrol during 1973—

1974. Thus price-control biases in real GNP data provide an acceptable

alternative explanation for the estimated effects. Simulation experiments

in an international model illustrate the wide range of real income and

price level effects which are consistent with the data. Further research is

proposed to narrow the range of possible effects.

           THE REAL PRICE OF OIL AND THE 1970S WORLD INFLATION

     The increase in the real price of oil during 1973—1974 is widely be-

lieved to have been a major cause of inflation both in the United States

and abroad. In part, this belief is based on a partial equilibrium (or

adding—up) approach which explains the inflation rate as the weighted sum

of the inflation rates of individual goods and services without making due

allowance for the general equilibrium effects on factor prices of an increase

in the relative price of an imported factor. But theoretically acceptable

arguments can   be made which attribute inflation —— or at least an upward
price level shift ——    to   factors decreasing the real quantity of money de-

manded or increasing the nominal quantity of money supplied by the central

banks. This paper reports an empirical investigation of the magnitude of

these possible effects consistent with general equilibrium.

        First a theoretical analysis of the long—run and short—run effects of

an oil—price    change is   presented in Section I.   It is seen there that the

long—run   effect   on real income and the real quantity of money demanded may

be quite small if not negligible, particularly when real income is measured

in terms of real GNP and money is deflated by the corresponding implicit

deflator. While this result may be due to the use of a three—factor Cobb—

Douglas production function in the context of a neoclassical growth model,

it certainly illustrates that a long—run reduction of real GNP of even 1 or

2 percent is very much an empirical question. Short—run effects on real

income and prices associated with shifts in aggregate demand and supply

appear to be similar in magnitude to those for the long run. Central banks'

reaction to the short—run real income and inflation effects may offset or

reinforce these effects once monetary policy is allowed to be endogenous.

       Tests of significance of oil—price variables in an extended Lucas—

Barro real income equation are reported in Section II. The results are mixed and

confounded by price control and decontrol programs which were widespread

at nearly the same time as the 1973—1974 oil—price change. Much future

work is required to definitively disentangle the effects of these two

factors.

       Section III reports simulation experiments on the effects of the 1973—

1974 oil—price change. These experiments are conducted using the Mark IV

Simulation Model presented in Darby (1980b). This model —— a simplified

version of the Mark III International Transmission Model' ——      is   a quarterly

macroeconometric model of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France,

Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands. In addition to the basic Mark

IV   Model, an extended Mark IV—Oil   Model is used which incorporates oil—price
                                                                             3




variables in the real—income equations for those five countries for which

the variables were found to be significant in Section II. Using the basic

model, some notable effects are found as a result of induced movements in

exports, exchange rates, money supplies, and the like. Stronger effects

are simulated using the Mark IV—Oil Model, but the price—control caveat of

Section II again applies.

     The concluding section sunimarizes the results of this paper and sug-

gests areas for future research as international data on the effects of the

1979—1980 oil—price increase come available.

                                I. Theory


      The price level, measured in dollars per basket of goods, is the in-

verse of the price of money, goods per dollar. So it is convenient to

classify the forces determining the price level according whether they in-

fluence the supply of or demand for money.

      A standard (long—run) money—demand function explains the real quantity

of money demanded     by real income y and the nominal interest rate R. The

nominal quantity demanded Nd   is   the product of this real demand and the

price level:


(1) Nd = md(y,R)     P


Equating money supply MS to money demand and solving for the price level:


(2)   P
           d
          m (y,R)

That is, the price level equals the ratio of the nominal quantity of money

supplied to the real quantity of money demanded.

      Although the inflationary impact of an oil—price change is generally

analyzed given an exogenously determined nominal money supply, this may be

misleading or at least counterfactual. That is, to the extent that the oil—

price change increases the price level and unemployment (at least temporarily)

and decreases real income for a given nominal money supply, the inflationary

effect would induce central banks to reduce M5 while the recessionary effect

tends to increase MS.    Which effect is dominant would depend on the relative

weights which the individual central bank puts on inflation and unemploy-

ment. In addition, other factors —— discussed below — may       influence   central

bank policy response to an oil—price change. With this warning, let us
                                                                               5




proceed for now to analyze the effects of an oil—price change for an

exogenous monetary policy.


Long—Run (Full Employment) Effects

       Consider first the long—run effects of an oil price change on real

output. For illustrative purposes suppose real output y is produced ac-

cording to a 3—factor Cobb—Douglas production function using domestic

capital k, labor £,    and imported petroleum


(3) y =


(4) cx++y=l

Let   us assume that output is produced by competitors who treat all prices
as parametric including in particular the real price of oil O. In equil-

ibrium, one of the first order conditions requires that the marginal product

of petroleum be equated to its real price:


(5)         =   yki'   = 0


It is straightforward to solve for the equilibrium usage of petroleum as a

function of 0, k, and £:


(6)     =



If we now substitute this equilibrium 4    into   the production function (3) we

obtain equilibrium real output as a function of the real price of oil and

given, fully—employed resources of capital and labor:



(7) y =
                                                                             6




Taking logarithms and differentiating, we find the elasticity of equilibrium

output with respect to the real oil price for given capital and labor re-

sources:


(8)    dlogy __
       d log U                          l—y
                 k,i

If for example, y were on the order of 0.01, a 1 percent increase in the

real oil price would decrease real output by only 0.01 percent (1 basis

point) for given resources and given the assumptions of this illustration.4

       The full, long—run equilibrium effect would be slightly larger due

to a reduction in the steady—state capital—labor ratio for a given growth

path of labor. To see this, suppose that saving and investment k is a

constant fraction 0         of   domestic factor income:


(9) I=o(y—O)

Dividing both sides of (9) by k and noting that y —        = (a +   )y,
           =            V
(10)           o(a +

Thus the growth rate of capital is a fixed proportion of the output—capital

ratio. In view of (7), this latter ratio is


(11) • = fy\a+6
     k
                       fi\a+
            6)         kJ

The simple neoclassical growth model can therefore be applied which, after

tedious manipulations, yields the result that


(12)  d1ogy
   diogO
This effect which allows for the (proportionate) reduction In the capital

stock would be about a third larger than that in (8) for given resources
                                                                                   7




 and a labor share equal to three quarters of value added. We should note

 that since income and capital fall proportionately in full steady—state

equilibrium, there is no long-run effect on the real interest rate.5

       A curiosity of national income accounting proves important in applying

the analysis to empirical data. Gross national product is a value—added

concept so that imported inputs are subtracted from total output to obtain

GNP. This works fine for nominal GNP or Q:


(13) Q = Py —         (P6)   P(l     —
                                         y)y

So nominal GNP is simply the price of output P times real domestic factor

income (1 —      y)y.   However, in computing real GNP or q, imported inputs are

valued at base—year relative prices e:

                                 0
(14)


Thus measured real GNF rises relative to factor income (1 —
                                                            y)y when the
real oil price 0 is increased. Nominal aggregate demand as measured by

nominal GNP is not affected sinc there is an offsetting measurement error

in the measured GNP deflator D:


                       —
       D =       = P(1
             q
                   (1 -


(15)   D=
                  0

       We can differentiate (14) to find the elasticity of real GNP with

respect to the real oil price as:


       d log g =             +   d log y
(16)
       dlog0          O—y diogO
For small changes In e before the capital stock adjusts,6
                                                                                8




        dlogg                    ___ —       —o
(17)
        dloge                —   l—y l—y
Thus we see that in the neighborhood of the original oil price, the output

effect is completely masked in measured GNP. However, for large changes in

e   relative   to 0 such as those occurring in 1973—1974, there would be a nega-

tive effect on measured real GNP.7 Using t for the change relative to base

year prices we have


(18) Liog q =     log    _       +       log (0Th


where            is from (8) or (12) depending on whether or not the capital

stock is presumed to have adjusted.8 Note that the deflator is decreased


relative                                            just as real GNP is increased

relative to real factor incomes.

        In summary, an increase in the real price of oil is predicted to de-

crease real output by the logarithmic change times
                                                       1
                                                             before   capital

adjusts or times        when capital is fully adjusted. However, such an oil

price change will cause a partially offsetting overstatement of measured

rca]. GNP (and understatement of the GNP deflator).

        Obviously the values of y and     are of considerable interest. For

current illustrative purposes, only petroleum imports will be considered.9

To the extent that petroleum imports are for resale to consumers rather

than used in production they have no effect on output or measured GM' (real

or nominal). Thus the ratio of the value of petroleum imports to GNP

serves as an upper limit on y. If we use pre—change U.S. data, this upper

limit would be about 0.003 for 1970. In 1976, this share had risen to 0.02.

This rise in the share could indicate inelastic consumer demand for imported

petroleum products, a problem with the Cobb—Douglas production function, or
                                                                                  9




 both. So while 0.003 should be an upper limit for y if the Cobb—Douglas

 function is correct, 0.02 will also be considered as an upper—upper limit.

 Finally suppose that a/Ca + ) and   /(a + ) have their traditionally
 estimated values of 1/4 and 3/4. Then the multiplier —y/(l —    y)   is —0.003

 or —0.020 depending on y. The corresponding multipliers allowing for

 capital stock change are —0.004 and —0.027. The real price of a barrel of

crude oil increased some 3.57 fold from 1973 I to 1974 I (a logarithmic in-

crease of 1.273). This is surely an upper limit on 0/0 for all petroleum

products. Table 1 presents estimates of the maximum effects on output and

measured real GNP. We see that the maximum full adjustment effects on real

output range from a decrease of 0.5 to 3.5 percent according to whether

one takes a pre—change or post—change estimate of y. For measured real GNP

the corresponding decreases are only 0.3 to 2.0 percent. Even smaller

changes correspond to the intermediate period corresponding to full—employ-

ment of resources but no adjustment of the capital stock.

       Rasche and Tatom have long argued for much larger real—income effects

of the oil—price change. They rely upon regression estimates of the quasi—

production function (7) and find much larger values of      than considered

here. Part of that difference is illusory: They use a much broader energy

price index which has a logarithmic increase of only 0.408 from 1972 to
    10
1974     compared to the 1.273 increase for a banel of oil used here; so the

larger elasticity is offset by a lower value of log (0/0). Further they

do not take account of the biases in reported real GNP so that their esti-

mates may refer to the output effect rather than the GNP effect. Finally,

in their (1980) paper, they report an equation (6) in which they estimate

the production function (3) directly (after taking logs) and also add
                                                                              10




log 0 separately. The estimated y is 0.05 while the coefficient on log 6

                     0.05,     0.70 (as reported), and log (0/6)    0.408,
is —0.07. Using '

we get an output change of —0.0215 with no capital adjustment and of —0.0291

with capital adjustment, which is in the same ball park as the figures in

Table 1. It is the things other than in the production
                                                         function ——   cap-

tured in the log 0 coefficient of —0.07 —— which permit such big estimates.

These other things may have to do with cyclical factors, induced monetary

policy, or fortuitous removal of price controls at roughly the same time

as discussed below. Further the 0.05 estimate of    may be biased upward if

energy usage (relative to capital and labor) serves as an indicator of

whether the economy is in a boom or recession. Thus the Rasche and Tatom

conclusions may have weak empirical foundations.

     This exercise has shown that even a huge change in the real price of

oil such as in 1973—1974 may result in very small if not negligible effects

on real output and especially upon measured real GNP.    Different assumptions

would result in different results, but the model used is surely a standard

one in practice. Thus it would appear to be an empirical question as to

whether the oil—price change had any significant long—run effect on measured

real GNP.

     We can now return to our original question of the long—run effect of

 the oil—price change on the real quantity of money demanded and hence,

 given the nominal money supply, on the price level.    First we note that in

long—run equilibrium real income is reduced by a constant fraction but the

 growth rate of real income is reduced only temporarily during the transi-

 tional period. Second we note that the real interest rate is unchanged.

 Under these conditions, in long—run equilibrium the real and nominal inter-

 est rate will be unchanged and the real quantity of money demanded will
                                                                                  11




behave similarly to real income —— a downward parallel shift in    its   growth

path. The logarithmic downward shift will equal to the elasticity of real

money demand with respect to real income times the logarithmic shift in

real income. Thus, if this income elasticity is around 1 there will be a

long—run increase in the price level equal to the long—run decrease in real

income. If during the early part of the adjustment period the price

level effect exceeds this long—run effect, then the inflation rate must be

reduced (ceteris paribus) below what it would otherwise be to reach long—

run equilibrium.

     Two   problems   may arise in econometric work based on real GNP as

measured in the national income accounts. First, the reduction in measured

real GNT will understate the output reduction which actually occurs. A

second problem arises only if the income elasticity of the demand for money

differs significantly from unity: Then the offsetting measurement errors

in real GNP and the GNP deflator would cause an apparent shift in the money—

demand function equal to the product of the measurement error and the dif-

ference of the elasticity from 1. This latter problem is a second—order

matter which will not be pursued further in this paper.


Short—Run Effects

     Short—run effects of the 1973—1974 oil—price shock have been analyzed

in terms of induced shifts in aggregate demand and aggregate supply curves

under the assumption that nominal wages are predetermined (or at least

sticky) in the short run. As with the long—run analysis, the analysis of

the short—run effects proceeds on the assumption that the government's

monetary and fiscal policy is unaffected by the unexpected oil—price in-

crease.
                                                                           12




     The aggregate demand effects of an oil—price shock can be viewed as

analogous to that of an increase in taxes.'2 Assume for simplicity that in

the short—run both producer and consumer demands for imported petroleum are

perfectly inelastic. For producers, this means that higher import prices

will be paid out of reduced quasi—rents, reducing private income. For

consumers, higher oil prices would directly reduce expenditures on other

consumption goods for given private income and these expenditures would be

further reduced by the reduction of private income.'3 Thus, at initial

levels of real income and interest rates, aggregate expenditures would fall

unless increased demand for exports by oil exporters equals or exceeds the

induced reduction in consumption. When we allow for some elasticity of

demand for imported oil and for increased exports of goods to oil producers,

the plausible magnitude of these basically distributional effects is sharply

reduced and could even be reversed.14 In what follows, we shall nonetheless

consider the possibility of a small decrease in aggregate demand.

     The aggregate supply effect would appear more substantial and has been

analyzed on varying assumptions by Bruno and Sachs (1979), Hudson and Jor-

genson (1978), Nork and Hall (1979), Norsworthy, Harper, and Kunze (1979),

Phelps (1978), and Rasche and Totoni (1977a, 1980). Following the latter authors,

suppose that the short—run conditions underlying the aggregate supply curve are

fixity of the capital stock, the nominal wage W, and the real price of oil.

Using the aggregate production function (3), one can readily derive output as


(19) y =   ()() k
On comparing (19) and (7), we note that for a given price level there is a

much greater output effect with nominal wages fixed than when labor is assumed
                                                                                           13

 year relative price of oil 8. The slope of S is the inverse (a/s) of the

 elasticity of aggregate supply. An aggregate demand curve D is also drawn

 to determine short—run output and the price level, y and

       As can be seen in equation (22) an increase in the real price of oil

shifts the aggregate supply curve horizontally by —
                                                                    log    (8/0) as illustrated
in Figure 2.16 This can alternatively be described as an upward shift
                                                                      equal
to minus the slope of S times the horizontal shift

         (_   )(       log (0/0)) =   - log   (6/)

If any shift in the aggregate demand
                                              curve is negligible, the new equilibrium
output and price level are y and P. The short—run displacement in output

from that corresponding to the base real oil price 0 is

where riD is the elasticity of the aggregate demand curve so that cx/ and

1/riD are the slopes of the aggregate supply and demand curves respectively.

Suppose that the aggregate demand curve is unit elastic       —1),   then


(25) tlog y =    — lJ   log (6/0)


which is identical to the long—run effect implied by (8) before the capital

stock adjusts. The increase in the price level,


(26) Lilog P =    L.1og y =         log   (e/),


reduces real wages just sufficiently to maintain employment at the natural

level. Thus, absent a shift in the aggregate demand curve, employment rises

or falls (and output is greater or less than the given—capital long—run

level indicated by (25)) according to whether the elasticity of aggregate

demand is smaller or greater than 1 in absolute value. If aggregate demand

were inelastic, increased employment would lessen the short—run decline in

output. In Darby (1976c, pp. 161—163) I have argued that short—run and

hence transitory movements in output will induce much less than proportionate

movements in money demand, which suggests that the short—run aggregate

demand curve is in fact elastic.17 This would imply a short—run reduction

in employment, which would accentuate the initial fall in output predicted

by the full—employment analysis.18 Once expected nominal wages are reduced,

this difference would disappear. In addition, the aggregate demand curve

may shift to the left as previously argued if there is a distributional

effect due to faster decreases in consumer spending than increases in oil—

exporter spending, this is illustrated in Figure 3.
                                                                             15




       Again it must be emphasized that these calculations are only illustra-

tive of the sort of effects which might be expected. If, for example, we

assumed partial adjustment of nominal wages to their equilibrium values,

the aggregate supply curve would be less elastic and the output change would

be more closely tied to the change in the given—capital long—run level of
           19
output.

       The aggregate demand curve is derived using our price level equation

(2) so the short—run price level effect


(28) Alog P =           log   y
                   D

is valid for the short—run period in which IS—LM analysis is applicable. If

—          is less than the long—run elasticity of demand for money with respect
    1/nD
to output, the short—run increase in the price level would be less than

that associated with an equal long—run decrease in output.

       Note that the same accounting problems in relating output and the price

level to real GNP and the deflator apply in the short run as in the long

run.



Endogenous Monetary Policy

       The time has now come to consider possible effects of the oil shock

upon monetary policy. Suppose that we can write the money supply reaction

function of the monetary authorities as


(29) log N =      log   N* + h• log (y/y*) + h log (P/P*) +


In logarithms, actual money equals expected money as predicted by lagged

variables systematically affecting central bank behavior plus negative
                                                                                         1.6




coefficients   times the innovations in output and the price level and a

random disturbance.2° Write the semi—reduced forms for output and the

price level as:


(30) y =


(31) P = rr(k,W,O,M,N*,c)


Denote the real—oil—price and money elasticities of these equations by
              and          Then taking the log changes in equations (29) through
fe, ' 're'
(31)   and solving for ilog N yields
                  h f0 + h
(32) Elog N =     1— h f        h        Llog 8
                         yN         pM
We   have seen above that f is negative and         Tr       is positive while h and h
                           0                             0                     y      p
are both negative. Whether money is increased, decreased, or left unchanged

by the central bank depends both on the relative sizes of the output and

price effects and       upon the relative aversion of the central bank to reces-
sion and inflation. The denominator of (32) allows for attenuation of

money changes to the extent that there are within—period (positive) responses

in output and prices. Finally, the price level effect is obtained by sub-

stituting (32) into the log—change form of (31):

                    /     (hf0+hlT0)1T        \

Here     is the value of      LdogP      such as is computed in (28) for a given

signed) effect due to endogenous nominal money supply changes.

     Simulation   experiments which allow for such endogenous movements in

the nominal money supply are reported below in Section III. It is perhaps

understandable why most analyses assume that the ambiguously signed change

in nominal money must be negligible and proceed on that basis. One can at

least explain the effect if the central bank were to hold money supply

unchanged.


Conclusions from Theory

     Considering first the results of our analysis conditional upon a given

monetary policy, with resources at their natural employment levels, the

output elasticity with respect to the real price of oil is —y/(l — y) before

capital adjusts and —'/   with   full capital adjustment. The parameter y, the

value share of oil imports used in producing domestic output, may be quite

small, certainly less than 0.02 for the United States for example. The

labor share   is on the order of 0.7 to 0.8, so the long run elasticities

vary from about y to l.3y or 1.4y. In the short—run, unemployment will

increase slightly (if aggregate demand is elastic), but the short—run output

elasticity seems to lie in the same range as for the long—run. The price

level is shifted up in the long—run by the long—run income elasticity of

money demand (around 1) times the output elasticity. In the short—run the

price level shifts less than in proportion to output since the short—run

aggregate demand curve is elastic.

     These shifts in the levels of output and prices affect their growth

rates only during the transitional period. They may be reinforced or offset

by endogenous money supply reactions of the central bank. These reactions

depend on the relative aversion of the central bank to decreases in output

and increases in prices and so are ambiguous in sign a priori.

     Biases in the calculation of real value—added imply smaller elastic-

ities in absolute value for real GNP and the implicit price deflator than

for real output and the price level. Indeed, an increase in the real oil

price of the size which occurred in 1973—1974 implies that the logarithmic

change in real GNP would be less than half that for output.

      II. Tests for Structural Change in the Real—Income Equation


     The behavior of the real price of oil is dominated by a downward

secular trend from the 1950s until the early 1970s as illustrated for the

United States in Figure 4. There was a small upward movement in 1971—1972,

but the major increase occurred in the second quarter of 1973 and especially

the first quarter of 1974. Widespread recessions in 1973—1975 provide the

major empirical evidence in support of a large real—income effect of oil

price increases. However, several alternative hypotheses focus on other

major events occurring roughly coincidentally.

     The first of these alternative hypotheses points to the final breakdown

of pegged exchange rates in 1973 which permitted (previously) nonreserve

countries to regain control of their money supplies and to stop the infla-

tion imported from the United States. In the United States, meanwhile, the

Fed reduced money supply growth in mid 1973 and again in mid 1974. The

average reduction in the growth rate of the money supply in the eight

countries in our sample exceeded 5 percentage points. Obviously any estimate

of the effect of oil—price changes must account for the effect of these re-

strictive monetary shocks.

     A second alternative hypothesis points to the widespread adoption of

price controls, following the U.S. lead in August 1971, and their subsequent

dismantling in the period 1973—1975. Such controls may have caused over-

statement of real GNP (and understatement of the GNP deflator) compared to

true values.21 When the controls were relaxed during 1973—1975, measured

real income fell back to its true value giving an illusion of a deeper

recession than was actually occurring or the occurrence of a recession when

there was none. Although it is possible to develop corrected estimates for
                                                                              20




real GNP and the deflator using physical unit series such as employment, car—

loadings, and components of the industrial production indices, that is a very

large job. The present paper will only examine whether estimated effects of

oil—price changes appear to be larger in those countries with coincident

price control relaxation. If so, future research will be indicated to dis—

entangle these oil and price control effects.

       In examining the empirical data, it is also important to note that the

normal or natural growth rate of output has declined generally in the post-

war period. In the late 1940s, after a decade and a half of depression and

war, the world capital—labor ratio was very low relative to its balanced—

growth or steady—state value.22 As the capital stock approaches its steady—

state level, the growth rates of capital and hence real income decline

toward their steady—state values. If we were to impose a constant natural

growth rate, a spurious negative coefficient might be estimated for oil to

account for slowing growth in the 1970s.

       The real GNP equations of the Mark III International Transmission Model

provide a convenient starting place for estimating the effect on output of

changes in the real price of oil.23 These equations were derived, following

Barro (1978), by combining a standard Lucas (1973) aggregate supply function

with an aggregate demand function with nominal money, real government spending,

and real exports as arguments. Specifically, they express the rational—

expectations/natural—rate approach as

                          •                                 3     A

where the time subscripts are made explicit,      is the natural—employment

level of real output In quarter t, and                  are the innovations in
                                                                            21




the aggregate demand variables log M, logarithm of real government expendi-

tures for goods and services, and exports divided by GNP, respectively.24

Thus in the absence of innovations or stochastic disturbance £,   log y ad-
justs toward its natural level at the rate a2 per quarter. Innovations in

the determinants of aggregate demand affect log y with an unconstrained

four—quarter distributed lag to allow for any inventory adjustment lags.

      To estimate the effect of the real oil price, it remains to specify

log     appropriately. A form which allows for both declining natural out-

put growth as just discussed and for an oil price effect is


(35) log y b1 + b2t + b3t2 + b4 log O

A positive b2 and negative b3 implies a declining natural growth rate. The

parameter b4 estimates the full long—run value of Og .        If the expression
(35) were simply substituted in equation (34), an oil price change would

implicitly be assumed to have no immediate effect and then a partial adjust-

ment effect at the rate a2 per quarter. This is inconsistent with the

analysis of Section I in which it was shown that the short—run effect is

similar in magnitude to the long—run effect.25 So, as with the aggregate

demand variables, a four quarter distributed lag on the first difference of

log 0 to capture a rapid short—run adjustment process.

      Substituting equation (35) in (34) and adding the short—run adjustment

process yields the estimating equation

                                                                — 1)2

This equation has been estimated using the 1957—1976 quarterly data set and

instruments for the eight countries in the Mark III International Transmission

Model. The regressions are based on the two—stage—least—squares—principal—

components (2SLSPC) technique because of the large number of predetermined

variables in the model.26 The coefficients of the aggregate demand variables

are not at issue here, are substantially the same as those discussed in Darby

and Stockman (1980), and so are omitted for the sake of brevity from the

present discussion.27

     The regression results are summarized in Table 2. The coefficient of

log O is negative in every case although only 4 of the t—statistics meet

conventional levels of significance. The implicit estimate of the long—run

oil effect is reported in the ninth column as ranging from a 2 basis point

decrease in real income per percentage point increase in the real price of

oil for the U.S. to 19 basis points for Japan. Table 3 indicates the im-

plied long—run reduction in real income for the eight countries based on

the 19731—19761V increase in    the real price of oil. Rasche and Tatom

(1980, Table 7) prepared similar estimates for their model (discussed in

Section I) based on 1973—1977 energy price increases, and those estimates

are reported for comparison. Despite some differences in detail, the calcula-

tions here tell broadly the same story as that of Rasche and Tatom. However,

this strong story does not do so well under closer examination.

    Let us first consider the possibility that the share of imported oil in

total output is so small that any effects are in fact negligible.. This is

tested by computing the F statistic for the hypothesis that all the oil co-

efficients are zero (He: a2b4
                                 c1   c2 = c3 = c4   0). As reported in

Table 2, only five of the countries have any statistically significant oil
                                                                              23




effect at the 5 percent level28 and for one of these (the United States) the

significant response is due to short—run movements which might be related

to various panic policy responses, briefly adopted here and abroad, to the

temporary OPEC embargo at the end of 1973. Further, the significant French

effects imply that French income was higher throughout 1973 as a

result of rising oil prices and so does not support the hypothesis.

     Since experience indicates that the French, Italian, and Japanese data

may be quite unreliable,29 let us focus on the results for the United States,

United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and the Netherlands. Of these five, the

F statistic is insignificant for Canada and Germany and significant for the

United States, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Interestingly these

three countries with significant F statistics all removed general price

controls coincidentally with the 1973—1974 oil price increase while Canada
                                                             30
and Germany had no price controls during the relevant period.      If, as I

have argued elsewhere (l976a, 1976b), the decontrol process results in the

elimination. of overstatement of real GNP built up during the control period,

then the spurious drop in reported real GNF relative to true GNP will be

captured as part (or all!) of the effect of the coincidental increase in

real oil prices. Certainly the pattern of significant oil effects only

where simultaneous decontrol occurred strongly indicates the value of

research to formulate real CNP estimates unbiased by price—control evasions

which overstate quantities and understate prices.

     In summary, these empirical results give a rather ambiguous answer to

the question of whether or not a large increase in the real price of oil will

reduce significantly real income for given nominal money supplies, real

government spending, and real exports. Such a reduction is estimated for

half the cases, but this may be a spurious result due to the simultaneous

removal of price controls in those countries.                          -

                            III. Simulation Experiments


       To assess the effects of the 1973-1974 oil price increase on real in-

come —— and ultimately the price level         we must allow for induced changes

in nominal money supplies and real exports aside from any possible direct

effects such as examined in Section II. To take account of these indirect

effects, one must resort to a simulation model of some sort, and this sec-

tion reports results from the Mark IV Simulation Model described in     Darby
(1981).31 The results of any one simulation model cannot be taken too

seriously except as they illustrate the possible importance of channels not

inconsistent with the data which might otherwise be overlooked. So with a

spirit of healthy scepticism, let us turn to the specific experiments.

       To assess the effects of the oil price increase we compare the results

from simulating the model in one case with the actual real price of oil and

in another case with the real price of oil held constant at the 1973 I price.

The assumed difference in the logarithm of the real price of oil (log (ole))

is   plotted in Figure 5. The dynamic simulations begin in 1973 II and con-

tinue for two years thereafter.32

       In view of the mixed evidence for direct oil price effects on real in-

come as reported in Section II, the basic Mark IV model does not incorporate

such effects. An alternative simulation model, the Mark IV—Oil, was there-

fore estimated. It differs from the basic Mark IV model only in the addi-

tion to the real income equations of the variables listed in Table 2 above

for those 5 countries for which the oil variables were significant (United

States, United Kingdom, France, Japan, and the Netherlands). These five

equations are listed with their estimated coefficients in Table 4.

      Figures 6 through 10 illustrate the simulation results for the five

countries with reliable data, Each figure displays the simulated effect of
                                                                                  25




the oil price increase on six major macroeconomic variables for one country.

The effect is estimated as the difference between the simulation values

based on the actual real price of oil and the values based on a constant

post—1973 I price. The effects simulated by the basic Mark IV model are

plotted with a square while those for the Mark IV—Oil are plotted with a

diamond.

     Examining first Figure 6 for the United States, we see a considerable

difference depending on whether or not direct oil price effects appear in

the real income equation. In the basic Mark IV Model without those effects,

the simulated effect of the oil price increase is to increase real income by

stimulating exports. The price level rises a bit to a peak effect of 2.5

percent, despite the slight decrease in nominal money supply, because the

large rise in interest rates (due to increased exports) dominates the income

effect to produce a significant decline in the real quantity of money de-

manded. That is, the denominator in equation (2) above falls by more than

the numerator. The situation is much different for the Mark IV—Oil Mode].

with direct real income effects: Real income ——     following   a brief initial

increase ——   is   reduced by up to 3 2/3 percent at the trough. This reduction

is caused both by the direct real income effects and ——    in   the second year ——

by the reversal of real export growth. The price level increase is almost
double that simulated in the basic model although simulated nominal money is

only a little higher. This is so because of much lower simulated y which

would much reduce mC(y,R) and hence increase p /mC(y,R) as compared to

the basic Mark IV Model simulations.

    The simulated effects for the United Kingdom (see Figure 7) tell a

story similar to that for the United States. The main differences lie in

the simulated behavior of the nominal money stock and interest rates in the
                                                                             26




Mark IV—Oil Model. Because the estimated U.K. money—supply reaction func-

tion is responsive to unemployment but not inflation increases, unlike the

U.S., falling output induces substantial increases in nominal money. In the

U.S. Mark IV-Oil simulations the downward pressure on the interest rate due

to lower exports was roughly offset by upward pressure from increased infla-

tionary expectations. Inflationary expectations are much less important in

the estimated U.K. interest rate equation; so the lower level of exports in

the Mark IV—Oil Model case is reflected in lower interest rates. Nonetheless,

the much higher nominal money supply and lower real income dominate the some-

what lower interest rates in increasing p J,/mC(y,R). A minor difference

between the U.S. and U.K. simulations appears in the scaled balance of pay-

ments variable: For the U.S., this variable largely represents intervention

by other countries while for the U,K. it mainly represents minimal net inter-

vention in the floating exchange market by the British government.

     The Canadian sectors of the basic Mark IV Model and of the Mark IV—Oil

Model are identical since the oil variables were found insignificant in the

Canadian real income equation in Section II. The differences in the simulated

effects thus represent the effects on Canada of lower foreign real income in

the Mark IV—Oil case. Thus the peak real income is only about 2 percent in

this case compared to about 3 2/3 percent with the basic model and so, given

the small simulated movements in nominal money and interest rates, prices

fall a bit less than in the basic model.

     Like Canada, no direct oil—price effects are included in the German real—

income equation. The German real—income equation does display an anotnolous

cumulative negative impact of higher exports, however, so real income is

lower with the higher estimated exports in the basic Mark IV Model. Since more

than complete real crowding out of increased export expenditures is inconsistent

with a priori notions, the German   simulations   are viewed as uninformative for
                                                                            27



this experiment.

     The Netherlands real income equation in the Mark IV—Oil Model includes

direct oil effects and the real income simulation yields results similar to

although much larger than those obtained for the U.S. and U.K. The price

effects differ, however, for several reasons: (1) There is an anomolous, in-

significant, but negative coefficient on transitory income in the real money

demand equation; thus lower simulated real income implies higher simulated

real money demand. (2) The estimated interest rate coefficient in the real

money—demand function has the right sign but is trivial in magnitude.

(3) Nominal money is trivially lower in the Mark IV-Oil case due to some

simulated balance—of—payments effects. Thus the price effects simulated for

the Netherlands occur only because of coefficients which are consistent with

the data but not standard a priori notions.

     These simulation results illustrate the large difference it makes

whether or not we take at face value the estimated real—oil—price effects in

the real income equations. We cannot say whether or not the 1973-1974 in-

creases in real oil prices caused price level increases on the order of 0 to

3 percent or of 4 to 8 percent and upwards. Similarly real income effects

might range from slightly positive to about —10 percent for the countries

examined here. It is both the sorrow and challenge of our nonexperilnental

science that other things were not held constant when the oil price change

occurred. One   factor   which may explain the estimated real income effects in

1973—1974 was identified in Section II: the coincidental removal of price

controls in those countries for which real effects were found. Only much

further research can show whether the large simulated effects in the Mark

IV—Oil Model have a basis in reality or are the result of other changes ——

such as price decontrol —— occurring in the same period.

                            IV.   Conclusions

     The effects on real income and the price level of the 1973—1974 In—

creases in the real price of oil are the subject of strongly held but

diverse opinions.33 Unfortunately the results of this paper indicate that

a wide range of opinions is indeed consistent with the data. Perhaps we

should not be surprised that with effectively one degree of freedom it Is

difficult to have much confidence in estimates of both an oil price coef-

ficient and its standard error.

     The Iranian hostage crisis of 1979—1980 will provide us data soon on a

second major move in the real price of oil. But these data are unlikely to

resolve the empirical question. It seems to this author that a more fruit-

ful avenue may be to develop quantitative measures of the biases in official

real output data due to price controls and then see what oil—price effects

are estimated using these corrected data. This approach is feasible because

price controls were generally imposed much before the oil price change.

Thus historical relationships between labor input, electricity production,

carloadings, and other physical unit series can be used to estimate the

biases up to the oil price change.

     If this paper has demonstrated that the effects of the real—oil—price

increases in 1973—1974 remain an open question and thus stimulates research

towards answering it, then the author will be amply recompensed for having

to report such inconclusive conclusions.

        fuller specification would include a factor eTt on the right hand

side, but it simplifies the notation without loss to choose labor units

such that the etS is eliminated and to incorporate technical progress T into

our measurement of labor in efficiency units. The basic results (8) and

(12) below are stated in Tatom (1979a, pp. 10—11) and Rasehe and Tatom (1980)

starting from the same production function (3). Their longest—run results (l2),

however, are derived from the simple assertion that the marginal product of

capital is fixed in the long—run by supply conditions rather than as the

result of a growth analysis as is done below. Their assertion ——     although
it is correct in this case ——   is   generally false. They erroneously interpret

the gross "rental price of capital" which is equated to the marginal product

of capital as "the relative price of capital" (e.g., Tatom (1979a, pp. 10—11)) and

argue that this will equal its fixed supply price in the long—run.     In the

appendix to Rasche and Tatom (1980), they instead have attempted to relate

changes in output to changes in capacity of individual firms, but this seems

to neglect the fact that the number of firms is not fixed.

     In the main body of the paper they present evidence supportive of the

usage of a Cobb—Douglas production function of this form (3). Kopeke (1980)

argues that it is improper to include energy as an argument in the aggregate

production function since energy is itself an intermediate product produced

by capital and labor. This objection does not apply to imported petroleum

which is produced by foreign labor and capital. Care must be taken, as seen

below, however in going from the domestic output concept appropriate to the
                                                                                 34




production function (3) to the value—added concept of real GNP. Unfortunately

this last step has not been made in the three—factor analyses of the effects

of oil-price changes.


     3This assumption is arguable also. For example, Phelps (1978) treated

the quantity of imported oil       as determined erogenously; the nominal price

of oil is assumed fixed by Mork and Hall (1979) and by Berner, et al., (1977)

in their Multi—Country Model. Rasche and Tatom (1980) argue persuasively

that neither of these representations capture the meaning of OPEC's ability

to set an optimal real price of oil.

     4The value of y is discussed at some length below. To the extent that

capital is in the form of existing machines which cannot be readily modified

and which require fixed petroleum inputs, the quasi—rents of existing

machines will fall without any reduction in output or petroleum usage. A

possibly offsetting factor would be the premature obsolescence of machines

on which the quasi—rents fall below zero. Neither of these factors is

operative in full long—run equilibrium discussed imeediately below, and are

taken as negligible on net here.


     5Before capital adjusts, but with resources fully employed the marginal

product of capital ka)' falls (slightly) with            and hence so does the

real interest rate.

     7klthough             = 0 initially as seen at (17) as 0 increases, the

positive BBS term in (16) decreases while the negative BBS is unchanged.

The negative effect is yet greater if capital is allowed to adjust.
                                                                                             35




         8Note that the first RHS term in (18) is approximately equal (for

 small y) to y 1 —             - which   illustrates that as 0 becomes large the adjust—

 merit for imported inputs in measured GNP              becomes trivial and all output is
 included in measured GNP.


        9it is possible to apply the analysis to energy more generally, but

 the increase in y is largely offset by a reduced logarithmic change in 0.

       10Rasche and Tatom (1980), Table 6.


             formal solution to this problem is presented in Darby (1979, Chap.                5).

                tax analysis is given little if any           weight   in recent analyses.

Rasche and Tatom (1980),             for example, term it "the 1974 view" and belief

that   aggregate demand shifts were important appears             to have been an

ephemeral     phenomenon. It is          included here for the sake of completeness.

       13The exact amount of these reductions depends on consumer expectations,

but the direction is unambiguous.

       14There is no long—run effect on output or interest rates via this

channel     unless       differences between foreign and domestic propensities to

save cause a shift in the domestic investment—output ratio.

       '5The aggregate demand curve           is   derived by solving the IS relationship

for R and substituting in equation (2).

                                                                                      d

output on the IS curve. For a normal negatively sloped IS curve, J

will be positive but insufficient to bring the denominator of              up to 1 if

short—run interest elasticity of money demand is small and the IS curve is

rather flat as argued by Hall (1977).

        Rasche and Tatom (1980) make a convoluted version of Ganib's error

(which    Purvis corrected) to conclude that the aggregate demand curve was
inelastic. Rather than accept the implication of increased employment, they
repeat their (l977a) assumption that nominal wages rise freely once the
natural    unemployment rate is reached. I can see no justification for this

appendage to a basic search view of the labor market. It is of course

irrelevant if         <   —1   or the aggregate demand curve shifts to the left

sufficiently to reduce employment despite an inelastic aggregate demand

curve.

        18If the elasticity of aggregate demand is less than —1 but greater
than —             (about     —1.5), the short—run effect will be greater than the
full—employment effect for a           given capital stock but less than the long—

run effect allowing for capital adjustment.            That is, in the absence of

significant shifts in aggregate demand, the long—run effects with full

capital adjustment such as calculated in Table 1 exceed the short—run effects

unless         <   —/(    —   a)   —1.5.


        19More wage flexibility implies less employment variation, so output
                                                               > —l   and less if
would be lower than indicated by equation (24) if

    <   -1.
        20The lack of a term in the balance of payments implies that we are

 either dealing with a reserve country (the U.S.), a freely floating country,
                                                                           37




or with a country which can and does sterilize balance of payments effects

in the relevant period; see Darby (1980). By the time of the first oil

shock (1973—1974) this is probably a reasonable characterization although

current balance of payment effects will also be present for some countries

in the simulations reported in Section III below.


     21See Darby (1976a, 1976b).

     22Even for the relatively unscathed United States, capital grew by

only about 0.4 percent per annum from 1929 through 1948 compared to a normal

growth rate of 3.2 percent; see Christensen and Jorgenson (1978, p. 56).

This implies that by 1948 the actual U.S. capital stock was less than 60

percent of the steady—state capital stock.

     23See Darby and Stockman (1980) for a description of the model.

     24The scaling of exports as a fraction of income rather than in

logarithmic terms was done to permit application ofthe balance—of—payments

identity in the model. In the results reported here all the innovations are

defined as residuals from optimal ARIMA processes applied to log M, log '

and (X/Y), respectively.

     25lmmediately after an increase in the real oil price, the capital

stock is greater than in full long—run equilibrium while labor utilization




                                                                       '
is less. The net effect depends on the elasticity rj of the aggregate demand

curve, but approximates the full long—run effect on plausible assumptions.


     26The only current endogenous variables in equation (36) are '

    and log U. Time t and government spending shocks are exogenous in the

model, but Mt and    are endogenous. The price of oil in base—year dollars

is exogenous so log 6 is exogenous for the U.S. For the other seven

countries endogenous movements in the purchasing power ratio make the real

price of oil in base—year domestic currency units endogenous, but they are

dominated by movements in the U.S. real price.

     27To the extent these aggregate demand variables were correlated with

any significant oil variables added here, their numerical values were of

course affected. However, the general pattern and conclusions remained un-

altered from the earlier discussion cited in the text.

     29See discussions in Darby and Stockman (1980) and Darby (1981).

     30The United States took the lead in imposing price controls in August

1971 which Darby (1976a, 1976b) argues led to an increasing overstatement

of real GNP (and understatement of the deflator) through the first quarter

of 1973. Controls were then relaxed in phases through the third quarter of

1974 with progressive elimination of overstatement in real GNP. That is,

real income growth was overstated from 1971111 through 19731 and then under-

stated from 197311 through 19741V. According to Parkin in Shenoy (1978,

pp. 150—151) the United Kingdom followed a similar pattern with controls

instituted with a freeze in November 1972, peaking in their effect on the

data with the end of Stage II in August 1973, and eventually abandoned

entirely after the Conservative loss of February 1974. Shenoy (1978, pp.

132—135) reports a similar albeit more complex pattern for the Netherlands

beginning also with a 1972 price freeze. Carr (1976, p. 40) points out that

Canada was free of general price controls until October 1975, too late to

cause any biases in the oil—price coefficients. West Germany imposed no
                                                                              39




price controls on the ground that such policies distract attention from the

real problems; Shenoy (1978, pp. 138—141).

     31The Mark IV Simulation Model is a simplified simulation version of

the Mark III International Transmission Wdel described in Darby and Stockrnan

(1980). The main simplifications involve (1) deletion of insignificant

variables except where they are required a priori to permit international

transmission and (2) combining variables to reduce multicollinearity where

a priori hypotheses on equality of coefficients were not rejected by the

data. The resulting model is thus both consistent with the data and

tractable for simulation. The Mark IV Model exists in versions corresponding

to pegged and floating exchange rates, but only the latter (Mark IV—FLT) is

used in this paper.

     32
          In          .
               a dynamic simulation, the input series are the exogenous variables

plus the initial conditions (endogenous variables at the beginning of the

simulation). The values of endogenous variables within the simulation

period are assigned their predicted values. As is common for a large model

with few exogenous variables, the cumulative errors in the endogenous vari-

ables eventually take the simulation off track. For the Mark IV Simulation

Model, this dynamic instability is not a significant difficulty until after

the first two years.

     33Taking two of the best studies for the long—run U.S. real—income ef-

fect as examples: Nosworthy, Harper, and Kurize (1979, p. 412) report an

average reduction in productivity growth of 0.18 percent per annum for 1973—

1978 which implies a total reduction in real income of 0.9 percent. By

contrast, Rasche and Tatom (1980), as reported in Table 3 above, estimate a

7.0 percent long—run effect.
