I.     Introduction
         In his General Theory, Keynes (1936) put forth the radical proposition

that competitive market economies have no automatic mechanism that tends, in

the    absence      of     governmental       policy     guidance,     to eliminate      or    prevent

unemployment.        After a lengthy period of debate that was often confused, in

part because of Keynes's reliance on non—traditional concepts and terminology,

it came to be widely agreed that this proposition was false as a matter of

pure    economic     theory.'         But    it also     came   to be widely       agreed     that   the

economy's        self—correcting      forces work slowly, so that well—designed                   demand

management        policy    actions    can    be   helpful      in   reducing   the   magnitude      and

duration of departures of employment and output from their                         full equilibrium

levels.     An influential expression of this point of view——the activist demand—

management position—-was provided by Patinkin (1951).

          But,    as all readers are well           aware, a number of challenges to this

position have arisen in the past 20 years.                   Arguments by influential analysts

including Friedman (1968),            Lucas (1972), Sargent and Wallace (1975). and Barro

(1979) have claimed that the intellectual foundations of the activist position

are seriously flawed, and have suggested that activist policies are apt to be

counterproductive.          Several weaknesses in these arguments have been detected,2

however, and there has recently been something of a resurgence of Keynesian

sentiment among macroeconomic researchers.3                     At present, consequently, there

exists substantial disagreement among                  leading scholars concerning the nature

of macroeconomic phenomena and the kind of policy that should be pursued.

        The present paper begins by identifying nominal price stickiness as the

logical basis for the Keynesian or activist point of view concerning demand

policy.     It then characterizes two alternative approaches to policy analysis

that    have      been     adopted    by     adherents     of    the   Keynesian      position,      the

disequilibrium       and        Phillips    curve"    approaches.         The former is inherently

defective,      it is    argued,     while    the     latter has      yet     to be satisfactorily

implemented.       Indeed,       implementation        that   is    not    open to Lucas—critique

weaknesses   Is not In sight.              In response to the Implied dilemma for policy

makers, the paper proposes a rule for the                     conduct of monetary policy that

relies   upon    minimal     understanding          of price—adjustment        dynamics       and   which

should   be robust to regulatory              and    technological        change    in the    economys

financial    and payments Institutions.                   A bit of evidence is presented               to

suggest that the rule would, If adopted, lead •to approximately zero inflation

(on   average)     and     to    output/employment          fluctuations      that    are     small    by

historical      standards.         Possible     criticisms         relating    to    recent    European

experience and to recent theoretical developments are considered.

II.     Disequilibrium Analysis

         It is widely agreed that the Keynesian                rationale for activist demand-

management policy is based on a presumption that there exists a significant

extent of nominal price             tickiness somewhere         in the macroeconomic system.

This stickiness may pertain to product prices or wages or both, but some type

is necessary      for the Keynesian diagnosis and remedy to be applicable.                          For

without    any    price     stickiness,      real    demands   and     supplies    for   commodities

including labor will be equated in a fashion that leaves no clear—cut role for

demand management.         And since demand—management actions are effected by way of

nominal instrument variables, policy manipulation of real aggregate demand is

itself dependent         upon a significant degree of nominal                  stickiness.4      It is

nominal aggregate demand that is generally open to manipulation and with which

demand-management policy is properly concerned.

          The    crucial     status of price         stickiness       in the    context of demand-

management analysis leads directly to a significant issue:                       how is the concept

of     "price    stickiness"       to    be represented      analytically?         The    concept    is

evidently one that is inherently dynamic in nature but, as we all know, the

formal analysis       of Keynes (1938) and of those writers5 who clarified the

message of the General Theory was conducted In a comparative-static framework.

Accordingly, some means had to be found for representing a dynamic concept in

a     static    setting.      The       device   adopted    by Keynes      and    the    other   early

contributors was that of conditional equilibrium analysis——comparative statics

in which the economy a slowly—adjusting prices are treated as if they were

fixed quantitIes.            Policy      experiments      conducted    under     this   approach    are

comparative—static exercises carried out conditional upon                         "given" values of

the prices that are hypothesized to adjust slowly.                       For some given value of

the nominal       wage     rate,   for    example,    the analyst      could     compare values     of




                                                    —3—
endogenous    variables    that     would     obtain under       alternative     hypothetical

                                                          use this comparison
magnitudes of the money stock or government purchases and

as the basis for analysis of an economy in which                 the nominal wage adjusts

slowly.

          But of course actual economics          are not static entities, but ongoing

dynamic systems.     So the question remains of how to relate these conditional

                      exercises     to actual problems of demand management.                One
comparative—static

conceivable approach would be simply to pretend that static analysis provides

a satisfactory approximation.             According to that approach, the analyst would

use the model in choosing policy actions at time t by treating the current

                                                                      and ignoring the
value of the sticky price         (e.g.     Wt) as historically given
                                                                                           Then
future (which can perhaps be attended to when it becomes the present).

later in period t+l the new value                 could be treated as historically given

and new policy actions selected conditional upon that value.                   By proceeding
                                                          for the analyst to
period after period In this fashion, it would be possible

use the static model in practice without ever developing any explanation for

the Wt+j values that are "given" in the successive periods.

     It would seem to be Indisputable, however, that such a way of proceeding
                                                                                          t, in
is highly suboptimal.     For even if        W   were actually a given magnitude in

the sense of being unresponsive to current policy actions, its current value

would certainly have been influenced by economic conditions and policy actions

of the past.       Any    (temporarily)       fixed    price   should   be   classified    as   a

predetermined    variable,   not     as one that is literally exogenous.                  Policy

actions taken in t will accordingly have effects on future prices-—on W,1,

       etc.—-and these effects are Ignored In the procedure under discussion.

That procedure is consequently bound to be suboptimal.

      As well as I can determine, this suboptimal approach to policy analysis




                                                 —4—
is Implicity recommended In most of the literature that has passed under the

title of 'disequilibrium                 or "fixed—price' macroeconomics.'                         The technically

sophisticated         contributors to that               literature might deny any intention that

their work be used in such a manner, but it is unclear that there is any other

way to proceed with a model that provides no explanation for the evolution

over   time of the system's                 sticky prices.               The primary objection to these

models, according to my argument, is not that they treat prices as temporarily

rigid,    but       that     they   Include        no    explanation          of   price   adjustment         between

periods.        From       a practical       policy perspective,               these models are crucially

                1
incomplete.

          A rather         vivid    illustration         of the potentially misleading nature of

policy analysis conducted with an incomplete, fixed—price model was provided

by an example          developed         in McCallum           (1980),        In the model          used     for this

example, real aggregate                 demand     y is   assumed to be dependent upon real money

balances, real government                purchases, and a stochastic shock term while                               (for

simplicity) aggregate supply is taken to be a constant,                                    y   =
                                                                                                   ,      Prices    are

set at the first of each period and are unresponsive to developments occurring

within the period, i.e., to shock realizations.                              Consequently,         y   and   y will
typically fail to coincide in which case the quantity actually transacted——the

output forthcoming——is determined as in the disequilibrium literature as the

smaller     of the         two:     t      mm      (y,   y).     When        there is a     negative shock to

to demand, there will be a tendency                      for     y       y    to exceed     y implying
Keynesian unemployment proportional to y —                        y.
       Clearly this model is such that within any period in which Yt <                                       . it    is

the case     that      if the money             stock or government                                were              in

                                                                     t
                                                                                   purchases               larger

magnitude, then        y would        be greater and y           —       would be smaller--perhaps zero.

So from the perspective of conditional comparative statics the model seems to




                                                          -5—
be supportive of the idea that activist demand management can be effective in

terms of preventing unemployment.

         But in order    to discuss the average effects over time of a sustained

policy strategy, one needs             to complete the model             by specifying     how prices

adjust    between     periods    and         adding    policy    rules     that    determine      policy

instrument settings.         In the example under discussion, the price adjustment

specification      Is an augmented Phillips relation                 in which      the proportionate

                                                                                           -         and
price change is determined by the previous periods excess supply

the expected proportionate change of the market—clearing                          price level.8      The


policy instruments, finally, are set by feedback rules that take account of
all relevant variables realized in the past.                     Current magnitudes are assumed

unknown, however, to the policy authorities.

          In this   setting,     to come to the point,              it is demonstrated           that if

expectations    are    rational        the    famous    (or infamous)        policy—ineffectiveness

proposition     obtains.        That    is,     the    evolution    of Yt (and thus            y—)    is

independent of the coefficients of the policy feedback rules:                             whether the

instrument settings feature strong responses or none at all to (e.g.) past

excess    supply    values   makes       no    difference       whatsoever     in the     time    series

behavior of Yt or

         The purpose of citing this example is not, it should be emphasized, to

suggest that the policy ineffectiveness proposition Is applicable                             to actual

economies.     It is, rather, to Illustrate the potentially misleading nature of

conditional comparative—static                policy analysis       with     incomplete   fixed—price

models.     Such analysis is prone to overstate the potential effectiveness of

demand management policy by failing to take account of dynamic considerations

concerning    the manner in which               currently   "given" prices          reflect    previous

responses.to past economic conditions.

III.     Price Adjustment Models

              Many    practical    Keynesian      analysts--especially     those   working   with

quantitative models——have             recognized   the point of the previous section, of

course, and have adopted instead a second approach.                   Instead of treating the

model's sticky price or prices as If they came out of the blue, this second

approach      adds' to the        static   Keynesian     model   another   equation   or set   of

equations—-a "Phillips curve" or a "wage-price sector——designed to explain

movements      over    time   in the slowly—adjusting price or prices.                This   step

converts the model into            one that is dynamic and          complete, and renders it

usable for policy analysis that avoids the particular source of suboptimality

described above,

         But while the Inclusion of price-adjustment equations makes the second

approach more         suitable    than the     first, as a method of adapting          Keynesian

models to demand management purposes, the price adjustment equations that have

been used       in practice are open to a number of objections.                    At the most

sympathetic level, one objection is that most of the utilized specifications

fail to satisfy the natural rate hypothesis. i.e., the hypothesis that there

is no path of price level or nominal demand values that will keep unemployment

permanently below its natural-rate value.'0                 This hypothesis, which expresses

the notion that it is not possible for a society to permanently enrich Itself

in     real   terms    by monetary       means,    is generally     accepted    by neoclassical

theorists and Is paid lip service by most Keynesian writers, but is violated

by most econometric specifications.                 Models incorporating       the concept of a

non—accelerating—inflation-rate-of—unemployment                  (NAIRU), for example,   do not

satisfy the natural rate hypothesis.                 For if there is a stable relationship

between the unemployment rate and the inflation acceleration variable, then

there are evidently           price    level   time paths    that represent     an acceleration




                                                   —7—
magnitude    that would       yield   a permanently lowered unemployment            rate.''    Of

course the builders of such models do not intend that they be applicable to

 impractical' conditions such as a maintained acceleration of inflation.                       But

this type of disclaimer amounts to an admission that the relation in question

is not structural——i.e., is not invariant to policy regimes.

        A more fundamental criticism of existing price adjustment specifications

is expressed by proponents of             the jibrium             approach   to business cycle

analysis.    All readers will be aware that this line of work began with Lucas's

(1972) celebrated theory of a Phillips—type relationship between nominal and

real variables that results from confusion due to information gaps, not from

price stickiness per se.         Most readers will also know that Lucas's theory has

recently suffered a decline in popularity as a consequence of its reliance,

for real effects of monetary            shocks, on an implausible degree of ignorance

concerning current Monetary conditions on the pmrt of rational private agents.

Since     information    regarding      various       aggregate    nominal    magnitudes--price

indices as well        as money       supply   figures——is available         both   promptly   and

cheaply, the Lucas "Monetary misperceptions" model has come to be viewed as

inapplicable to today's developed economies.'2

        Disenchantment with the misperceptions model has not, however, led to the

demise of the        equilibrium school of business            cycle   analysis.      Indeed, an

important group       of researchers has        in a sense        retained   the Lucas   model'3

despite its failure to rationalize output and employment effects of monetary

shocks.     Specifically, this group has developed a real business cycle (RBC)

approach which denies that there is in fact any significant effect of monetary

policy     actions    (even     if    unanticipated)      on   output.        The   money-output

correlations that appear in the data are attributed, by RBC proponents, to

"reverse causation," i.e., policy and/or banking sector responses                      to output




                                                —8—
fluctuations.       These fluctuations, to complete the story, are brought about by

real shocks, primarily exogenous shocks to technology.

          The RBC approach—-which          stems    from the work of Kydland           and Prescott

(1982),    Long and Plosser        (1983), end King and Plosser              (1984)--has gained a

considerable     a2ount    of support           in part    because     of the elusiveness of a

rigorous theoretical account of money—to-output                      influences, but also because

of quantitative work supportive of the RBC hypothesis.                       The pioneering study

in this regard is that of Kydland and Prescott (1982), which demonstrates that

a surprisingly good quantitative match to actual business cycle facts'' can be

obtained    (via simulations) with a quantitative equilibrium model in which a

stochastic technology         shock provides        the          source of     fluctuations.        In

particular,      the    RBC      models    imply         procyclical     fluctuations     in     labor

productivity     and real     wages,      an implication that is more consistent with

actual data than those of many traditional models that attribute                          cycles to

demand    fluctuations.       Also,       the    relative     variability    of   consumption     and

investment expenditures is well explained, as well as the serial correlation

in output      and     employment     magnitudes.            These     implications    require    the

assumption that technology shocks are highly persistent, but that is entirely

plausible.

     Other types of evidence have also been put forth as supportive of the RBC

hypothesis.     I   have argued (McCallum, 1986) that much of this is inconclusive

if not irrelevant, but it remains a striking fact that money stock and other

demand-related       variables     have    very little predictive            content    for    output

fluctuations, especially in data series that have been first—differenced.

     Probably the most serious weakness of the RBC approach is the lack of a

convincing description of the unobserved "technology shocks" that it posits as

the source of cyclical fluctuations.               If the term Is interpreted literally as




                                                   -9—
referring to shifts in the state-of--knowledge physical frontier relationship

between inputs and outputs, then it would                seem implausible that there could

exist    much      variability    at    the    aggregate      level:     specific    technological

                                                       for only a few of the
improvements should impact on the production functions

economys many products.                And    independent shocks       to different        productive

sectors would tend to average out, yielding a relatively small variance in the

aggregate.

         For this and other reasons, most macroeconomists                     have found        the RBC


hypothesis unconvincing.          But the vitality of the research being conducted by

the RBC school is a testimony to the attraction of the equilibrium approach

and to the dissatisfaction of many economists with existing models of price

stickiness,         Let us then return to our main theme                by reviewing the basic

rationale for the equilibrium approach.

        Existing equilibrium models are ones in which all prices are perfectly

free to adjust within each period, but that is not the defining characteristic

of the approach.          The latters basic requirement, rather, is that a models

behavioral relations should all be rationalized in terms of                            -   -
optimizing agents-—households            and firms——in response to their own objectives

and     the    constraints    they face       (Lucas,    1980).        The   motivation        for   this

                                                   model that is well-designed
modelling strategy is the objective of producing a

for the guidance of economic policy.               The presumption is that by focussing on

agents        objectives and constraints, it might be possible to construct a model

                   entirely   of relations      that    are   truly      structural.           Relations
consisting

derived       in   this   way would, because of the             autonomy      of   preferences       and

                                                         to policy changes.
technology, stand a reasonable chance of being invariant

          As stated above, this strategy does not necessarily rule out price

stickiness,         One can conceive of a model, for example, in which multiperiod




                                                 —10-
nominal    contracts     are endogenously      explained       as the    response        of rational

agents to adjustment, bargaining, or marketing costs--in which case the model

could be of the equilibrium variety.              But the approach does not permit the

inclusion of relations describing sluggish price adjustments effected by "the

market"    or by some fictitious         "auctioneer" with ill—defined or nonexistent

objectives.           Being   poorly understood——not           based    on    well—posed        choice

problems——such relations would not be structural.                  They would not, in other

words,    provide the analyst with any           basis    for knowing whether            they       would

remain in place or shift           if policy were substantially altered.                      But    such

knowledge is clearly crucial for designing policy, as a shift would invalidate

the models predictions about the effects of a contemplated policy change.                              In

summary, it is necessary, according to the equilibrium-approach viewpoint, to

understand      the    nature   of price-adjustment        sluggishness        to    know      if     its

quantitative      characteristics    will     remain     intact    In   the    face      of    altered

conditions.

     The forgoing argument Is of course an application of the                    Lucas critique'

developed In Lucas (1976).         In principle, its considerations are applicable to

most components of a macroeconomic model.              But because of the crucial role of

expectational considerations in the price—adjustment sectors of these models,

it is these sectors           that would    seem to be especially            susceptible        to the

critique.       Relations among variables all of one type, either nominal or real,

would seem to be less likely to break down in response to demand—management

policy changes."

          The   foregoing discussion       suggests that,       in principle,        the modelling

strategy of the equilibrium approach could provide a satisfactory basis for

demand-management policy analysis.            In practice, however, It has proved to be

extremely       difficult     to model     sluggish    price    adjustments         in   the    manner




                                               —11—
                  Tangible    resource       costs    of making       price    changes       seem     to   be
required.

negligibly small, while          bargaining" and "marketing" costs of price adjustment

are poorly understood.               Consequently,     to the present time all equilibrium

models have been ones with complete price flexibility and, therefore, no role

for demand management.               No model of sticky prices has been devised                        that

combines empirical veracity with an adjustment specification that is clearly

based on individuals          objectives and constraints.

      As a result, a sizeable group of researchers has reacted against Lucas's

suggestion        that       price     stickiness           needs     to      be     explained        along

equilibrium—approach         lines.        In reality, these researchers contend, prices do

not                            for     a    variety    of complicated          strategic        and   seal—

Consequently it is better (according to their view) to use a poorly

but   empirically        justifiable         Phillips—type          relation       than    to    pretend——

                                 all       price     adjustment       take     place       promptly,       as
counterfactually——that

equilibrium analysts have assumed in practice.                      An econometric model based on

this presumption will track data better than if it incorporated the hypothesis

of perfectly flexible prices.                And policy predictions provided by the model

could be satisfactory if the adjustment relation did not shift sharply when

policy changes were undertaken.

       It is hard not to have considerable sympathy for this last suggestion.

Yet, on the other hand, the logic of the Lucas critique is Inescapable:                                    how

can one know that the adjustment relation will not shift sharply If he does

not understand        its nature?           Finding   a way out of the implied dilemma                      is

            the    'ost crucial task confronting policy-oriented                          macroeconomists

IV.   A Strategy for Monetary Policy

      In light of the policy dilemma just described, the appropriate response

would seem to be one that is not excessively ambitious                            My proposed approach

begins     by     accepting       the    idea    that    the   nature        of     price      adjustment

relations—-and      thus    the    connection        between nominal        and    real   variables—-is


poorly understood.         There is no compelling basis for selecting any one of the

numerous competing theories of this mechanism, and no good prospect for better

understanding in the near future.               But the proposed approach reflects optimism

nevertheless, for it involves a strategy for monetary policy behavior'7 that

gives promise of being effective regardless of the nature of the mechanism.

      The basic idea is that, In whatever way it is that monetary                              (or fiscal)


actions affect output, they do so through an intermediate influence on nominal

aggregate demand.         Evidence suggests, furthermore, that cyclical fluctuations

in real output and employment are strongly related to those In nominal demand.

Real GNP growth Is usually strong, that is, when nominal GNP growth is above

           1a                           there   Is    some   basis    for    belief       that    cyclical
average.          Consequently,

fluctuations      In real output would           be significantly dampened if nominal GNP

were kept on a smooth and steady growth path.

      Of course the last statement would be questioned by proponents of the RBC

                    But    according     to their       theory,      the    behavior      of     output   Is
hypothesis.

Independent of nominal variables                In any event, and the behavior                 of nominal

variables       Is of no concern——except          to the extent that inflation imposes an

inefficient tax on the holders of real money                      balances.         Consequently,         RBC

proponents should have no objection to a policy strategy that yields a steady

growth rate for nominal ON!'," provided that it is not Inflationary.

      At what rate should nominal GNP be made to grow?                       While a mild deflation

in accordance with the "ChIcago            Rule of       Friedman (1969) is perhaps preferable




                                                  -13—
in principle, from a practical point of view there is much to be said for an

average inflation rate of zero.2°          Taking that as a goal, then,              I   suggest that

nominal GNP should be made to grow at a rate equal to the long-term average

rate of real output growth for the economy in question——about 3% per year, for

example, for the United States,

      My suggested approach does not, however, consist merely of the adoption

of a target path for nominal GNP.             Equally essential            is the mechanism         for

achieving    that   path.      In that regard        three    considerations         are    extremely

important.    First, the mechanism should involve a policy rule that dictates

each period's setting of the policy instrument.                   It is important to have a

rule, rather than relying on "discretionary" period-by-period choices of the

instrument    setting,      in order to avoid        dynamic      inconsistency          of the type

described by Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Barro and Gordon (1983).                           Those

authors   show that period-by—period          attempts       to    optimize,       by a monetary

authority who seeks to avoid both inflation and unemployment, will                           lead to

more inflation and no less unemployment (on average) than could be obtained by

adherence to a rule.         It is my opinion that this type of inconsistency offers


the best available       explanation      for the unprecedented            postwar       inflationary

experience    of most developed      countries, experience              which   has seen the CPI

climb to 4.5 times       its 1950 level in the U.S.              and nearly 11 times in the

U.K. 21

      Second, the rule needs to pertain to a directly controllable variable,

rather    than one such as the Ml money               stock       (or    any    broader     measure).

Otherwise,    the rule will      not be operationally specified.                  Third. the rule

should be designed       in a manner       that     does   not    rely     upon   the     absence   of

regulatory    change and      technical    innovation      in the payments           and    financial

industries.     While    these processes may not produce as much turmoil in the




                                             —14—
future as they have in the recent                     past         it would be unreasonable to presume

that they will not be present again to a significant extent.

            Following up on previous suggestions of mine                            (McCallum, 1984).          1    have

recently developed in quantitative terms a rule for U.S. monetary policy based

on these considerations.                   This      rule     dictates        quarterly        settings       for    the

monetary       base   that are designed to keep nominal GNP close                                to a 3% growth

path.22        It does not rely on any specific model of the economy or any details

regarding the financial system; all it presumes                               is that an increase in the

growth rate of the monetary base tends to have a stimulative effect on nominal

GNP.        Defining bt =   log    of monetary base (for quarter t), Xt                              log of nominal

GNP, and xtm          target—path value of x, the rule is as follows:

        =   0.00739 - (1/16)      [x1
                                              —
                                                  x17 - b1              +
                                                                            bt17J   +   0.25    (x1
                                                                                                        -
                                                                                                            x1).
Here    the     constant    term     is       simply    a 3% annual growth rate expressed                             in

quarterly       logarithmic units, while the second term subtracts from this the

average growth rate of base velocity over the previous four years23                                          Finally.

the third term adds a gentle adjustment in response to cyclical departures of

GNP from its target path.

       To determine whether this rule would indeed keep nominal GNP close to the

desired growth path, one must experiment with the economy or with a model.

The    former possibility           is    too expensive              and the        latter suffers from             the

absence of any reliable model.                    But it is my conjecture that the proposed rule

would       perform well     with    a wide          variety        of ode1s.            Here    I    will    briefly

summarize       results     for    three          extremely        simple     models.          The    first    is     an

atheoretic regression of            xt        on Abt and axt_l; for the sample period 1954-85

the estimates are as follows;


       = 0.00749 + 0.257 Xt_l             -   -).487 abt      i.
                                                                   et
         (.002)    (.079)                     (.121)




                                                       -15—
      0.23           =   0.0010     OW   =   2.11.

Generating     bt and xt values from          the proposed    rule    and   this model,     with

residuals     fed in each period     to represent shocks,            one estimates   that    the

                            —                for 1954-85 would have been only 2.0% had
root-mean-square value of x          xt4
the rule been in effect.          Actual historical policy, by contrast, yielded a

                                                                    24 and a
77.1% root—mean—square error (RMSE) relative to the xt4 target path

8.5% RMSE     relative   to a fitted linear trend.          The second model differs from

the   first only     in lagging abt one         quarter,    to reduce    the possibility      of

reverse      causation   in the estimated        effects.      The    resulting   coefficient

estimates are not much different and the simulated RMSE for 1954-85 is 2.2%.

The third model       explored to date       is a four variable        vector autoregression

system in which the variables are growth rates of the base, the price level,

and real GNP, plus a nominal interest rate.                With this system, the estimated

RI4SE value is again 2.2%.

        Of course each of these experiments is in principle subject to the Lucas

critique.       I would argue that       the first two are less susceptible——for             the

reason sketched       above-—than   if the models      included both real and nominal

variables.      But my main line of defense In this regard is to be based on the

robustness of the rule to widely different models.2

         My contention Is not only that the suggested policy rule would keep

nominal GNP       close to its target path and        thereby eliminate       inflation,     but

would      also    result   In smaller cyclical fluctuations            In real output and

employment than the U.S. economy has experienced in the postwar era.                   But we

know that these fluctuations have been small relative to those                    of previous

historical eras, and reasonably small in absolute terms.                 Thus the contention

is that the proposed rule would, If utilized in a developed economy,26 result

V.   Topical Issues

        Before concluding, it will be useful briefly to address a few topical

issues concerning       the proposed       policy rule       and,   more generally, Keynesian

views on the need for activist demand management.                   The first of these issues

pertains to the unusually high unemployment rates experienced during recent

years in many European nations, including the U.K.                  While some economists have

attributed this      unemployment       primarily        to inadequate demand, our proposed

policy rule would have dictated substantially less nominal demand growth than

was actually experienced over the last decade or so.                    Should this be regarded

as a mark against the rule?

       To answer that question properly one would have to identify the source of

the unusual unemployment.          Clearly, such a task is beyond the scope of the

remainder of the present paper.            Nevertheless, as a crude check on the notion

that   demand inadequacy bears          the primary responsibility,             let us conduct a

cross—nation comparison.          To that end, Figure           1   plots average unemployment

rates for 1980-84 against nominal GDP growth over the decade 1975-85 for 19

OECD    nations.21       If   relatively        high     unemployment    were    associated   with

relatively slow demand growth in this cross section, the points would indicate

a downward-sloping relationship.               But a glance at Figure 1 shows that no such

relationship Is present.        It is also the case that, for many of the individual

countries considered, nominal           CDI'   growth has been more rapid in the 1975-85

period than during the low—unemployment years of 1950-70.                       At this level of

extremely simple comparisons, then, the evidence does not support the notion

that demand inadequacy is the source of the problem.

          The   other    issues    to     be    considered    relate    to recent theoretical

developments that have been interpreted as supportive of the hypothesis that

activist demand management is both needed and feasible.                      In particular, the

so—called       'efficiency wage"               model    has   been    touted     as   justifying   this

hypothesis, while               the phenomenon     of "hysteresis" has been used to justify

calls for demand expansion.                Influential papers on the two subjects have been

written by Vellen (1984)                and Akerlof and Yellen          (1985)   and by Blanchard and

Summers (1986), respectively, while both developments have been drawn upon in

a recent argument by Buiter (1987).

      With regard to the efficiency wage idea, it is important to understand

that this model does not itself rationalize any role for demand management.

As Yellen      (1984,   p. 204) and Akerlof and Yellen (1985, p.825) recognize but do

not emphasize, the model                is concerned with the configuration of equilibrium

employment and output magnitudes in relation to their socially optimal levels.

These equilibrium quantities are determined                     in a block of the macroeconomic

system that          is exogenous         to nominal       variables,    just     as   in the   textbook

classical      model,           Changes in nominal        aggregate     demand therefore result         in

price level changes, with no effect on output or employment.

       To illustrate that point, consider the following version of the static

classical model, in which the symbols are y =                         output,    0 = employment,    n

noted that the presence of hysteresis would not be sufficient, for the reason

mentioned in footnote 10,     to contradict the natural rate hypothesis.                  And it

should be kept    in   mind   that    empirical    models   designed       to    represent   the

hysteresis   phenomenon   (e.g.      Blanchard    and   Summers,   1986,        pp.   50—55) are

observationally equivalent to expectational Phillips relations in which lagged

as well as current unemployment measures appear.              For these reasons, it is

unclear that the concept of hysteresis            is a crucial one in the context of

demand management issues.

VI.    Conclusion

        It has been argued in this paper that                   despite fifty years of active

true that its workings depend upon features of the economy that have not been

modelled in a reliable fashion.

        In these circumstances, the paper suggests, a judicious way to conduct

demand policy would be by adoption of a rule that promises to yield reasonably

1.   Even if the liquidity         trap was empirically relevant,         the real-balance

effect would       (as prices   fall) automatically     stimulate      aggregate    demand as

needed.    Some writers have questioned this standard conclusion on the grounds

that it neglects dynamic considerations involving expectations.                    In McCallum

(1983) it is shown, however,          that with     rational expectations     and flexible

prices the standard conclusion obtains when expectational dynamics are taken

Into account.

4.   Even if It were the case that the government directly controlled real

government purchases--its actual instrument is nominal government purchases-—

it would     not   follow   that   real aggregate    demand    could   be manipulated,      as

reference to the textbook model of a classical (I.e.,             flexible price) system

indicates.    A qualification to this statement, mentioned below in footnote 28,

does not overturn the point.

7.   It should be said that price adjustment relations are discussed In various

places by Barro and Grossman (1976).        But this part of their work has not been

adopted    by subsequent     contributors to the disequilibrium           literature, which

Barro and Grossman have abandoned.

Grossman (1976) in their Chapter 4.

over   time,    nor   that    it be trend—stationary       or    even independent of past

the extent to which the suggestion in the text is valid.

The precise measure of nominal output/income to be used in the policy rule is

an Issue on which        I   mean to take no position.          Gordon   (1985) has suggested

that nominal final sales would be better than GNP.

20.    One reason is that it seems likely that official price Indices overstate

inflation to a small extent.
21.     In the pre—Worid War           II    era,       monetary authorities were kept                  from   this
type    of     behavior   by     the   requirement          of adherence         to a commodity—money

desired,     be updated periodically in some specified manner.                          The monetary base,

it might be mentioned, is a controllable variable since the central bank can

read    its value     from      its own      balance       sheet    and make      adjustments            whenever

required.

24.     This huge RMSE value reflects average nominal GNP growth well in excess

of 3%, i.e., reflects the inflation that was experienced.

25. Since drafting          this paper,        I    have verified that the rule yields good

results      in   four      more    VAR      systems        and     in   small      structural"               models

the REC theory, the monetary misperceptions theory, and a version of Keynesian

theory    as    expressed       in the MPS         quarterly      econometric model.                  Details are

reported in McCallum (1988).

26.    Even for a highly open economy the appropriate objective for macroeconomic

policy    is    to keep nominal demand growing at a noninflationary                                   rate.    With

regard to fiscal policy variables, one point is that the traditional automatic

stabilizers       provided      by progressive            tax     schedules,     etc.   ,       are    helpful    in

promoting smooth growth of nominal GNP.                      Whether tax rates should be adjusted
in response to deviations of xt is debatable.

27.    The GPO growth measure is the ratio of nominal GDP for 1985 to its value

for 1975.          That different periods are used for the two variables can be

explained as follows.          The 1980—84 period is used for unemployment rates so as

to    focus   on the       greatly    increased      levels of the       1980's, with 1984      the

concluding year because comparable data are not available for all countries

for more recent years.               In the case of demand        growth, earlier years        were

included      to    take    account    of    the   possibility    that   effects   occur    with a

substantial lag.           The choice of precise dates is clearly quite arbitrary;               it

is my belief that the basic finding is not sensitive to this choice.

28.     This statement        should be qualified as follows,              There   would be real

effects of changes in g if the model were modified to permit direct government

employment and production.              In such a case, however, changes in g would not

strictly represent "demand management' actions.

29.    They provide no justification for the assumption                   that these firms keep

their nominal prices unchanged; one is attempted in McCallum (1986).

30.    While his emphasis is very different, this conclusion is consistent with

the analysis of Buiter (1987).

31.     The "core inflation" case presented by Buiter (1987) is one                        in which

anticipated demand influences are effective.                 This case provides an example of

a specification        in which       the natural rate hypothesis         does not obtain;       an

accelerating        inflation will          keep   unemployment   (expectationally)    below    the

natural rate permanently.
