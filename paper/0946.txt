             Cost Implications of Hospital Unionization:
                        A Behavioral Analysis


                              ABSTRACT

      The growth of unionization among hospital workers was sharply

accelerated by the 1974 amendments to the NLRA covering voluntary

hospital workers. tlith continuing inflationary pressures in the hos-

pital sector, the cost implications of the recent and projected growth

of hospital unions is of some concern to policy-makers. This paper

presents   estimates of union cost impacts based on   data from hospitals

in the states of Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania.

Cross—sectional regressions   with data for 1975   yield positive union   im-
pacts of   3.3 percent on total costs, 4.1 to 5.9 percent on cost per

case, and 6.1 percent on cost per day. Re-estimation of the model with

data on changes over the 1971-75 period yields similar results.

We   also find that the cost impact of unionization varies with the pattern
of   coverage (being lower for service employees and RN's) and with the

extent of cost-based reimbursement. This suggests that future cost

impacts of union growth may be moderated as prospective payment systems

for hospitals become more widespread.

COST IMPLICATIONS OF HOSPITAL UNIONIZATION: A BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS



I. Introduction

     Since the coverage of voluntary hospital employees under the National

Labor Relations Act in August of 1974, the extent of unionization among

hospital employees has increased steadily. According to data from the

American Hospital Association annual surveys, over the 1973-1980 period

the percentage of voluntary hospitals with union contracts rose from

15.7 to 23.2.1 Further union growth is expected over the next decade;

several recent studies of unionization trends project that between 45

and 65 percent of hospitals will have union contracts by 1990.1 ,2

     In the face of strong inflationary pressures in the hospital sector,

and continuing debate about appropriate policy responses, it is important

that we understand the inflationary implications of the expected growth in

unionization. Although empirical studies of hospital costs have been

numerous, analysis of union impacts on costs has been rather limited.

Most recent econometric research has been confined to one aspect of union
                                          2-5
cost impacts, namely, impacts on wages.         Evidence from other industries,

however, suggests that union effects on non-wage variables such as turnover,

worker quality, and productivity may also be important,6'7 Several recent

studies8'9 have estimated quasi-technological cost functions to

union effects on the cost of producing a given level and mix of hosp

output, but possible impacts on unit and total costs resulting from the

response of output levels and mix to unionization are not captured in thi

methodology. In contrast, reduced-form behavioral cost regressions can

capture these effects on output levels and thus provide a more comprehensive
                                 -2-



estimate of union cost impacts. Two recent studies of union cost impacts have
used this approach and reported positive union effects on cost per day

(ranging from 3.5 to 10.2 percent) and cost per case (ranging from 4.1

to 9.0 percent).'0'

       The   present   study provides additional evidence of union impacts based

on this behavioral approach. It differs from the two studies just cited

in several respects. First, it presents estimates of union impacts on

both total and unit costs. Second, it utilizes detailed information on

the duration, extent, and pattern of employee unionization to construct a

series of independent variables describing each hosoital 's collective bar-

gaining status. Third, to control for selectivity effects of omitted

variables that are correlated with collective bargaining status, it presents

estimates of union cost impacts on both the level of costs in 1975 and the

change in costs over the 1971-75 period.12 Fourth, to construct the depen-

dent   variables, the present study uses data from audited Medicare cost reports
rather than the unaudited cost data from the !merican Hospital association (AHA)
Annual Surveys.13

II. Data and Model Specification
  The analyses reported here are based on            data   for fiscal years 1971   and 1975

from   short-term non-Federal hospitals in four Northeastern            states: Maryland,

Massachusetts,     New York and Pennsylvania. These hospitals were identified
from the listings in the 1976          AHA   Guide to the Health Care Field. For fiscal
                          data were obtained on      617 of the roughly 700 hospitals     in
year 1975,     complete

these four states listed in the Guide. Complete data for both fiscal 1971

and fiscal 1975 were       obtained on       440 hospitals.
                                    —3-




        The dependent and independent variables used in the analyses are

defined in Table 1. (Details on the construction of these variables

and data sources are given in the Appendix.) Values for the dependent

variables were obtained from Medicare Cost Reports. For the 1975 cross—

sectional analysis, the cost concept used to define the dependent variables

(i.e., total reimbursable costs after Medicare adjustments) is computed

as total operating expenses (including depreciation) minus direct ex-

penses for non-reimbursable cost centers (e.g., gift shops, research)

and   for personal patient care services rendered by physicians. Since
a comparable cost concept was not used in the 1971 cost reports, the
dependent variables for the analysis of 1971-75 changes are based on
total   operating expenditures.

        Our specification of   independent variables follows that of previous
behavioral cost models)4 The hospital is viewed        as making decisions

about   product prices, quality, and input quantities so as to maximize an
objective   function subject to prevailing input and output market conditions

and technological constraints. Hence, the level of costs which results from

these decisions is a function of the exogenous determinants of product

demand and factor prices in the hospital's market area. Hospital charac-

teristics relating to ownership (PROP, GOV, CATH) and teaching activities

(NURS, MED, DRESIDNI) are included to capture differences in hospital

objectives; however, effects of these variables on costs may also reflect

product-mix   differences (including the mix of educational services versus
patient care services produced by the hospital) and factor-supply effects
(e.g. , the availability to Catholic hospitals of labor inputs from members
of religious orders). Capital stock variables (LBDA, ECFRAT, INDEX, INDEXD)
                                         -4-


capture the effects of variations in fixed capital inputs as well
as product-mix differences)5 The geographical durrunies (MASS, MD,
NYC, NYNNYC) are listed in Table 1 as factor—price variables but

they also serve to control for differences in the timing of fiscal

years.16

       Several different aspects of each hospital's collective bar-

gaining situation are           captured by our unionization variables. In
addition to a dumy variable for the presence of a collective bar-

gaining agreement (UNION), we have used data on the employee groups

covered by agreements to construct a proxy for the fraction of the

hospital work force covered (COy). The hypothesis that union cost im'-

pacts vary with the types of employees covered is tested by including

dummy variables for the coverage status of the two largest employee

groups, service employees (DSV) and registered nurses (DRN), which

respectively comprise roughly 38 and 30 percent of the hospital work

force. Since large national unions may have greater expertise in bar-

gaining, greater resources to endure conflicts, and a stronger interest

in economic issues than professional organizations (such as state nurses'

associations), we have tested for differences in cost impacts among types

of unions by including a national union dummy (DNATLUN). Cost implications

of "Balkanization" of the work force into different bargaining units         repre-
sented by     different unions are explored by including the number of urons

in the hospital (TOTALUN). Variations in cost impacts with the duration

of the collective bargaining relationship are allowed for by including the

duration variables UN74 and UN71.
                                -5-




        All regressions were estimated with ordinary least squares.

 As is indicated in Table 1, the dependent variables and most independent

 variables were entered as logarithms. Those independent variables

 which took on zero values for any data points, such as the unionization

 variables, were entered in linear form.

 III. Characteristics of the Study Sample

       Average characteristics of the unionized and non—unionized hospitals

 in the study sample are compared in Table 2.       In the 1975 cross-sectional

analysis, 236 unionized hospitals and 381 non-unionized hospitals com-

prise the study sample. In the analysis of 1971-75 changes, hosoitals

with any collective bargaining agreements in effect for at least half

of fiscal 1971 were exciudech thus, the 106 unionized hospitals in this

analysis became unionized during the 1971-75 period. (Some hospitals

were also excluded from this analysis because of missing data for fiscal

1971.)

       Comparison of fiscal 1975 data reveals that unionized hosnitals were

on average much larger than non-union hosnita1s exponentiatinci the lona-

rithmic means for LBDA and dividing by 365 days yields bed complement figures

of 236 and 150 for union and non-union hospitals respectively.17 The differ-

ence in logarithmic means for LREA implies a total cost level in union hos-

pitals that is 103 percent higher; corresponding differentials for cost ner

case   and cost per day are 74 percent   and 24   percent respectively.   Mean

values   for LMCAID and LDEN indicate that union hosnitals tend to be located
in more densely populated areas with a hirher Dercentage of public aid
recipients. The union    sample also contains proportionately more government

hospitals   (13.6 percent vs. 3.9 percent), more hospitals with medtcal -&ehool
                                   -6-




school affiliations (33.9 oercent vs. 16.5 percent) and residency

proarams (44.9 percent vs. 24.7 percent), more hospitals in Massachusetts

and in New York City, and Droportionately fewer hosnitals in Maryland

and   Pennsylvania. Pniong the unionized hospitals, 68.1 percent have con-
tracts with national unionsi,8the average estimated fraction of the 'cork-

force unionized is 55.4 percent, and the average number of unions repre-

senting workers in each hospital is 1.84.

       Looking at the 1971-75 changes, we see that the average total cost

increase    is higher for the hospitals unionized during this period (70.6
percent) than for the non-union hospitals (65.5 percent). The differential
in    the percent increase of cost per case is only slightly smaller (59.5

vs.   54.8) while    the corresponding differential in cost per day is larger

(73.8 vs.   65.2).     Comparison of average changes in   variables that miciht
indicate    external inflationary pressures (LCOL, LAVEW,     PCINC) suiaests     that

such pressures can not explain much of the difference in rates of cost

increase between newly-unionized and non-union hospitals; however, a more

careful assessment of this question requires that we examine the full set

of regression results presented below. Also note that the mean value for

UN74 in the newly-unionized sample indicates      26.4 percent of these hosoitals
had no union contracts until fiscal 1974 or 1975 while 73.6 nercent had

such contracts prior to fiscal 1974. Thus, the estimated union effects in

the analysis of 1971-75 changes reflects at least several years' exoerience

with collective bargaining for most of the newly-unionized hospitals.

 IV.    Regression   Results

       We consider first our summary estimates of average union impacts

 obtained by including the UNION dummy and all other independent variables

 not pertaining to unionization.19     For each dependent variable, regressions

 were estimated with all these independent variables included; then a second

 round of estimates was obtained excluding variables with t-statistics less

 than 1.0. This two-step process was then repeated excluding HW1 since this

variable was based on reported payroll expenses for the individual hospitals

and therefore might be regarded as endogenous. (The construction of HW1

is described in the Appendix.)

       Results are reported in Tables 3 and 4 for the second round of regression

estimates.2°    In the 1975 cross-section (Table 3), the UNION coefficients

indicate positive cost impacts of roughly 3.3 percent on total costs (LREA),

4.1 to 5.9 percent on cost per case (LREADIs)., and roughly 6.1 percent on

cost per day (LREADAY). Coefficients in both of the total cost and one of

the cost per case regressions fall just short of the 0.10 significance level

(two-tailed) while the other three UNION coefficients are highly significant.

       In comparison with these results, the estimated UNION coefficients based

on 1971-75 changes (Table 4) are remarkably similar. The coefficient magni-

tudes in the cost per case and cost per day regressions are slightly smaller,

indicating positive cost impacts of 3.4 to 3.9 percent and 5.3 to 5.8 nercent

respectively.  Moreover, t-statistics exceed the critical values for t
0.10 significance level in all cases.21
       Results for the other independent variables are less consistent. In

the 1975 cross—section, coefficients for INDEX (or INDEXD), HW1, MD, MED

and ECFRAT are always positive and significant while the proprietary. hospital

dummy (PROP) is always significantly negative. Other variables that are
                              -8-



significant in at least one regression for each of the three dependent

variables are MASS, LCOL, and SIJRGRAT, though the negative sign of the

latter's coefficients is somewhat surprising. xnong the remaining variables,

CBINS1 and GOV are consistently positive and usually significant in the

unit cost (LREADIS and LREADAY) regressions but do not significantly affect

total costs (LREA). Conversely, LHPOP, LMCAID, INSUR1, and LBDA are sig—

nifcant in at least one LREA regression but none of the unit cost regressions.

LAVEW, PCINC, DRESIDNT, and LGPPOP were not significant in any of the 1975

cross-section regressions. (The first three of these variables were not

included in the regressions shown in Table 3 since they had t-statistics less

than 1.0 in all first-round regressions.)

     In the analyses of 1971-75 changes, the explanatory power of the regres-

sions was somewhat lower and the number of significant variables was smaller,

particularly in the cost per case (LEXBDIS) regressions. Moreover, results

for many of the variables were not qualitatively similar to the corresponding

1975 cross-section estimates.22 In view of this variability in results, the

stability of the estimated union impacts seems even more striking.

     Regression results with a more detailed specification of each unionized

hospital's collective bargaining situation are presented in Tables 5-7. As

before, all regressions were first estimated with all other independent vari-

ables included and then re-estimated deleting these variables with t-statistics

less than 1.0.23 In addition to examining the cost impacts of variations in

the extent, pattern, and duration of union coverage, we also tested three

interaction hypotheses relating to unionization. First, CBINS1 x COV was

includcd to test the proposition that union impacts on costs would be more

positive when they could be passed through to third parties under cost based

reimbursement schemes.24 Second, it has been suggested that multi-employer
                                     -9-




bargaining exerts a countervailing power that reduces union cost impacts;9

since New York City is the only locality in our study states with "ulti-

employer bargaining, we test this hypothesis by including the interaction

variable NYC x COV. Third, the inclusion of (NYC + NYNNYC) x COV allows

for a differential effect of the extent of collective bargaining coverage

in New York State which niiqht result from the influence of rate regulation.25

        Looking first at the 1975 cross-sectional results for total costs (LREA)

in    the   first three columns of Table 5, we observe that COy, DSV, and DRN

are   nearly significant with HW1 excluded and become significant when HW1
is included or when other clearly insignificant unionization variables
(TOTALUN, UN71, UN74) are excluded.26 The negative coefficients for DSV
and DRN imply that the inflationary impact of union contracts for service
workers and registered nurses is smaller than for other employee groups;
in   fact, the magnitudes of coefficients suggest this impact is actually

negative.27

       Analogous regressions with data on 1971-75   changes (columns 7-9
of   Table 5) show a similar pattern of results but with several important

differences. In particular, the coefficients for COV are smaller and less

significant while the coefficients for TOTALUN are now strongly positive

when HW1 is included or DNATLUN is excluded. The large and significant

negative coefficients for UN74 imply that union impacts on total costs are

not positive during the first two years of unionization.28

       Tests of the three interaction variables with cross-sectional data

(columns 4-6) yield positive and significant coefficients for CBINS1 x COV,

as predicted by the cost-pass-through hypothesis; however, this result is

weaker in the 1971-75 change regressions (columns 10-12). The two other

interaction coefficients are never significant. Also note that inclusion
                                   -10-




of the interaction variables does not dramatically change the results

for   most other unionization variables. The one exception to this is
COV   which   is highly correlated with the interaction variables (parti-
cularlyCBINSl     x COy)   by construction. Because of this high correlation,

one   would expect the coefficients of CBINS1 x COV and COy    to   have opposite
signs.29      Note, however, that the negative coefficients obtained for COV

when CBINS1 x COy is included do not imply a negative partial effect of

COV on total cost. For example, the results in column 6 imply that the

partial effect of COV will only be negative if CBSINS1is less       than 3.44;
in fact, no observed values of CBINS1 were this low.

      The cost per case regressions (Table 6) yield a similar pattern of

results to the total cost regressions. Once again COV, DSV, and DRN are

generally significant, particularly in the cross-section regressions,

but the magnitudes of their coefficients are slightly larger. TOTALUN

is again strongly positive in the 1971-75 change regressions except when

the hospital-specific wage variable (HW1) is included. While the coeffi-

cients for    the recent unionization variable (UN74) are again consistently
negative, their magnitudes and significance are now greater in the cross-
section    regressions and smaller in the 1971-75 change regressions. Regres-

sions with the interaction variables again tend to confirm the cost-pass-

through hypothesis but they •also yield a significantly negative NYC x COV

interaction coefficient      in the cross-section analysis. This suoports the
multi-employer bargaining      hypothesis stated earlier.

      Our final set of regression results pertains to cost per day (Table 7).

Although   the same general pattern of results emerges, a few differences
from the total cost and cost per case regressions should be noted. First,
                               —11 —




the   national union (DNATLUN) coefficient is more positive and signi-

ficant in all 1975 cross-section regressions. Second, the negative DRN

coefficients are weaker in the cross-section regressions but stronger in

the 1971-75 change regressions. Third, the interaction results in the

1971-75 change regressions are rather different: NYC x COV coefficients

are more strongly positive, the New York State interaction ((NYC + NYMNYC)

x COV) is more strongly negative, and the cost-pass-through variable

(CBINS1 x CDV) has no perceptible effect.3°

V. Discussion
       The various regression models described here all confirm the basic

result that unionization increases the cost of hospital services. Thus,

it appears that gains in hospital productivity (due to improved worker

quality, lower turnover, or management responses to unionization), to the

extent that they occur at all, are not sufficient to offset union-induced

employee compensation increases. While we did not derive separate cost

impact estimates for wage and non-wage (i.e., productivity) effects of

unionization,   conjectures about the magnitudes of these separate effects
can be based on estimates of the wage-elasticity   of costs and union im-

pacts on compensation. Our own coefficient estimates for HW1 indicate a

wage-elasticity of costs of approximately +0.5 in cross-section data

(Table 3), but are much smaller and less significant in the regressions

on 1971-75 changes (Table 4). Estimates from other studies with pooled
      31
data indicate elasticities similar     to our cross-section result. Using

the +0.5 figure as an approximate consensus estimate, we find that the

union cost impacts in the +3,4 to -1-6.1 percent range (as reported above)

would only be consistent with negative non-wage effects (i.e., union-induced
                              -12-




productivity gains) if union compensation effects were above the

range +6.8 to ÷12.2 percent. Our own estimated union compensation

effects of +5 percent reported elsewhere32 as well as those from

other studies 25generally tend to be near or below the lower end

of this range, suggesting that union-induced nonwage effects are

in fact zero or positive. The contrast between this finding and

recent reports of union-induced productivity gains in other indus-

tries 33may be a reflection of a more general difference between ser-

vice and manufacturing industries in responding to unionization, but

it could also be explained by special characteristics of the hospital

industry such as the prevalence of cost-based reimbursement. The often-

significant interactions between unionization and cost reimbursement

reported here lend support to the latter of these two explanations.

       Several other aspects of our results are of interest. First, the

similarity between our cross-section and 1971-75 change regressions indi-

cates that selection bias due to omitted hospital-specific characteristics

which are associated with unionization (and stable over time) is not a

problem in cross-sectional studies. Second, the fact that union impacts

are greatest for per diem costs and smallest for total costs is consistent

with   a negative union effect on the volune of output. This could be in-
terpreted in the context of the standard behavioral cost model as a move-
                                                                   34
ment up the hospital 's downward-sloping   product demand curve.        Moreover,

since union impacts on cost per case and total cost are fairly close,

it appears that most of the reduction in output volume takes the form of

shorter lengths of stay rather than fewer cases treated.35 The negative

output-volume   effect implies that projections of growth in total hospital
expedenditures arising from future increases in unionization may be biased
                                —13-




upward if they are based on results of unit cost regressions, parti-

cularly cost per day regressions.

     Third, and perhaps most important, our results strongly suggest

that union cost impacts vary considerably among hospitals depending

upon the types of employees covered, the fraction of the work force

covered, the types of unions representing employees and perhaps even

the duration of coverage. For example, we have already noted, based

on the coefficient estimates from our cross-section total cost regres-

sions (specifically, column 3 of Table 5) that unionization of service

workers covered under a union contract with a national union has a

minimal impact on costs. By contrast, if all other employees in the

hospital are covered as well, a total cost increase of approximately

8 percent would occur according to our estimates.36

     Previous estimates of future hospital cost increases due to union

growth imply that this growth will not be a significant source of infla-

tionary pressure. In particular, Becker et al) have projected that the

percent of hospitals with union contracts will increase from 27 percent

in 1980 to 45-50 percent in 1990 but that this will increase real hospital

spending by only 5 percent in comparison with HCFA projections of overall

real spending growth of 58 percent between 1979 and 1990. While this

projection was based on cost impact estimates similar to those reported

here, our own findings point up several additional factors which miqht

anplify or   diminish the projected cost increase.    First, since cost

impacts increase with the fraction of the work force covered by unions,

and since our own data (Table 2) and figures reported elsewhere     show

that only about half of all employees in unionized hospitals are now

covered by union contracts37 it is clear that future growth in union
                               -14-




coverage within already-unionized hospitals may be an important

additional source of inflationary pressures. Second, our estimates

suggest that cost impacts for employee groups which are more heavily

unionized (e.g., service workers and RN's) are small. If future

union growth primarily involves other employee groups, the average
                                       38       .
cost                                       .
       impact of unionization will rise. Third, in view of the evidence

for cost-pass-through union effects presented here, one might at least

hope that the shift in hospital payment away from cost reimbursement

to prospective mechanisms may serve to moderate the inflationary

pressure of future union growth.

discharges, and inpatient days in the Medicare Cost Reports filed by each

study hospital;LBDA and ECFRAT were taken from the same source. It should

also be noted that ECF bed days available are not included in LBDA or

the denominator of ECFRAT. PROP, GOV, CATH, MED. DRESIDNT, and NURS are

taken from the 1975 AHA Annual Survey data. INDEX was also constructed

from these AHA data in a two-step procedure. First, AHA data for hospitals

in all other states (except Alaska and Hawaii) were used to estimate regres-

sions of average cost per case in which dumies for the presence of various

facilities and services, for medical and nursing school affiliations, for

ownership type, for service specialty code of the hospital, and for geo-

graphic location (SMSA size and region) were among the included independent

variables. Other independent variables related to bed complement, numbers

of interns, residents, and other trainees per case, and the mix of inpatient

and outpatient services. Second, the coefficients for the services and

facilities dummies, affiliation dummies, service specialty dummies, and

interns, residents, and trainees variables were multiplied by the AHA data

values for these variables for the study hospitals and the resulting products

sunnTied to create INDEX values. INDEXD was created in the same way using a

cost-per-day regression based on AHA data.

     Unionization data were obtained from a variety of sources including

AHA survey information for 1970, 1973 and 1975, state labor relations comi-

ssions   files and publications, state hospital associations, unions, NLRB
published election reports and unpublished data from NLRB files, and in a
few instances telephone contacts with individual hospitals. Per capita in-
come, population, household size, county hospital bed supply and county
                                    A-2



physician supply data were taken from the Pnerican Medical Association
annual publication Physician Distribution and Medical Licensure in the
United States. LAVEW   was   based on service industry payroll data published
by the U.S. Commerce Dept. in County Business Patterns for SIC categories
70 (hotels and lodging places) and 72 (personal services). County land

area data used to compute LDEN were from the Statistical Abstract of the

United States.

     LCOL was derived from family budget figures developed by the U.S.

Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). For hospitals located in the Baltimore,

Washington, Boston, Buffalo, New York, Lancaster, Philadelphia and Pitts-

burgh SMSA's, published SMSA data were used to compute LCOL. For hospitals

located in other SMSA's or counties outside SMSA's, a predicted value of

LCOL was developed from a regression equation estimated with published BLS

data for 39 large SMSA's. Independent variables in this regression were

per capita income, population density, SMSA size dummies and census region

dumies.

     CBINS1 was computed by summing the percentage of the population with

regular Blue Cross coverage, the percentage of the population with Medicare

coverage, and the percentage of the population with Medicaid coverage. The

Blue Cross percentage for the area customarily served by each Blue Cross

plan was based on data published in the Blue Cross-Blue Shield Fact Pok.

This figure was used for each county within the customary service area.

The Medicare percentage was based on enrollment figures in U.S. Social

Security Administration, Medicare, Health Insurance for the Aged and

abled, Section 1.1: Reimbursement by State and County.      Disabled Medicare
                                A-3



enrollees are only included in the 1975 data since they were not covered

in 1971. (The number of over-65 enrollees was also used to compute

LAGED.) As a proxy for the number of persons (under 65) covered by

Medicaid, we used the numbers of cash recipients under AFDC, SSI   (except
aged recipients), and general assistance in the county as published in U.S.

National Center for Social Statistics, Recipients of Public Assistance

Money Payments and Amounts of Such Payments by Program, State, and County

and U.S. Social Security Administration, Supplemental Security Income:

State and County Data.

     To compute INSUR1, we combined the data on Medicare and Medicaid cited

above with data from the Health Interview Survey (HIS) of the U.S. National

Center   for Health Statistics on the percent of the under-65 population with
Blue Cross or commercial hospital insurance coverage in Primary Sampling

Units (PSU's) within the four study states. Counties within PSU's were

assigned the value for the PSU. For counties outside of PSU's, predicted

values generated from an insurance coverage regression were employed. Since

HIS data were only available for calendar 1972 and 1974, estimates were ad-

justed to reflect the change in coverage in the entire state from 1971 to

1972 and from 1974 to 1975 as reported by the Health Insurance Institute in

their   Source Book of Health Insurance Data.
     HW1   was derived from AHA Annual Survey data, for each hospital, on

average payroll and employee benefit expenses per full-time-equivalent em-

ployee. (Physicians, dentists, interns, residents and other trainees, and

expenses   for these groups were exluded from our calculations.) Regression
analysis was used to adjust this 'average for differences in personnel mix
between hospitals and for union impacts on wages. The 1975 regression was
estimated from data on the 617 study hospitals plus an additional 35 hospitals
which had been excluded from the cost regressions because of missing data but
                                A-4




which met all other criteria for inclusion in the study; for 1971 data

on 434 of these hospitals were employed. To calculate HW1, coefficients

from this regression were used to adjust observed values of the dependent

value for variations in all independent variables except LAVEW, LCOL,

and PCINC.

     For further details on the hospitals included in the study and our

data sources and adjustments, see David Salkever, "The Impact of Collective

Bargaining on Hospital Costs," Chapter 4 and Appendices A-F, H, and I.

12.   Analysis ofa cross-section    of changes in costs from 1971         to   1975   is
      equivalent    to pooling 1971 and 1975 cross-sections and including
      hospital-specific dummies; this controls for effects of any omitted
      hospital characteristics which are stable over the 1971-75 period.
13.   In their comparative analysis of these two sources of cost data,
      Coelen and Sullivan concluded that the AHA data are "not of high
      quality"    and that "results obtained by using AHA data vary considerably
      from results obtained using (Medicare cost report) data." See Craig

      Coelen and Daniel Sullivan, "An Analysis of Effects of Prospective

      Reimbursement Programs on Hospital Expenditures." Unpublished manu-

      script, Abt    Associates,   1981.

15. As explained in the Appendix, values for INDEX and INDEXP der,end on each

      hospital   's special facilities and services, educational         proarams and

      numbers    of trainees as reported in the AHA annual survey data; therefore
      these values will be related to the mix of both patient care and educa-

      tional services. Other behavioral models of hospital costs (e.çi., Sloan

      and Adarnache, p.   cit.) have       controlled for   the   diagnostic mix of inpatients

      and   for the mix between inpatient days (or cases) and outpatient visits.

     Even if one views these empirical models, as well as our own, as

    short-run in nature, it should be recognized that some variation in

    product mix can occur in the short-run even when most caoital inputs

    are fixed. However, if such short-run variation is small relative

    to the total variability of product-mix in the hospitals under study,

    the degree of simultaneity bias introduced by this short-run variation

    should be relatively unimportant. A more fundamental consideration

    is that unionization may have long-run effects on product mix and

    fixed capital inputs. If so, the estimated union cost impacts in these

    short-run behavioral models may diverge somewhat from the lona-run cost

    impacts. This qualification should be borne in mind in interpreting

    the results presented here and in other similar studies.

16. For Maryland and Pennsylvania hospitals, the fiscal year covered the

    period July 1 to June 30. Massachusetts hospitals generally used an

    October 1 to September 30 fiscal year while New York hospitals used a

    calendar year. The geographical dummies alsoControl for the influence of rate-

    setting. Hospital regulation programs were in effect in three study

    states during fiscal 1975. The program in Maryland took effect in July

    of l974 covering all but Medicare and Medicaid patients, but formal rate

    determinations were not actually made until late 1975. In Massachusetts,

    rate—setting was introduced for Medicaid patients in April of 1974 and

    for self-paying and commercially-insured (i.e., non-Blue Cross) patients

    in August of 1975. Because these programs were limited in scope and cre

    just getting under way during fiscal 1975, their Presence exerted little

    influence on the results reported here. The program in New York, -which
                                       F-4



      covered Blue Cross and Medicaid patients, was initiated in 1970.

      Although well-established by fiscal 1975, its impact on costs was

      greatly weakened by a variety of administrative and political problems.

      Consequently, econometric studies of the New York oronran's early years

      show little effect on the level or growth rate of costs. See (.oe1en

      and   Sullivan, 2P cit., and David Salkever, Hosnital Sector Inflation
      (Lexington, Mass.: Lexinqton Books, 1979). In Pennsylvania, a few
      hospitals in the     western part of the state participated in a voluntary

      prospective nayment systen for     Blue Cross and Medicare patients during
      the   1972-75 neriod. Differences in reaulatory imPacts on costs amonci the

      states were also probably diluted by the Federal Economic Stabilization

      nrogram which covered all hospitals from Puciust 1971 to nril 1974. Thus,

      it seems unlikely that these differences were a major confoundinci factor

      in   our analysis.
17.   It should be noted, however, that there is considerable overlap in the size

      distributions   of union and non-union hospitals. While the difference in
      mean values for LBDA between the two grouns of hospitals is only 0.455,
      the   standard deviations for this     variable exceed 0.7.

18.   National unions in    the study sample include District 1199 of the National

      Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, the Service Employees'

      International Union, the ?nierican Federation of State County and Municipal

      Employees,   the Laborers' International Union, the International Union
      of Operating Engineers, the International Brotherhood of Firemen and Oilers,
      and the Teamsters.

19. Note that INDEXD is only included in the regressions on LREADAY and LEXBDAY
      while   INDEX is excluded from these regressions.

21. The initial regression results for UNION were very similar to those

     reported here. The only notable difference was in the LREADIS

     regression with HW1 excluded. The UNION coefficient was larger

     (0.046) and significant at the 0.10 level.

22. The dummy variables in the 1971-75 regressions, except for those per-

     taining to unionization, were not defined as changes. Thus their

     interpretation in these regressions is different from the 1975 cross-

     section.   For example, the significantly negative coefficients for

     NYC and NYNNYC in the LEXBDAY regressions imply that the rate of in-

     crease (i.e., the logarithmic change) in cost per day was significantly

     lower in New York than in Pennsylvania (the omitted geographic category).

23. As in the regressions already presented, INDEX was replaced by INDEXD

     in the cost per day regressions, and all regressions were estimated

    with and without HW1. Also note that UN71 was not included in the

     1971 -75 change regressions, and that because of missing data these

    regressions were estimated with data from only 411 hospitals when HW1

    was included.

25. A special circumstance which might tend to diminish any detectable

      regulation effect is that prior to 1975, union-negotiated wage in-

      creases were passed through in the New York rate-setting systen. See

      Diane Hamilton and Gilbey Kamens, r'ational Hospital Rate-Setting Study

      Vol. VII: Case Study of Prospective Reimbursement in New York U.S.

      Health Care Financing Administration, April 1980.


26. When DNATLUN is also excluded, the coefficients for COy, DSN,

      and DRN become slightly larger and more significant.

27. We noted earlier that service employees and RN's comprise about

      38 and 30 percent of the hospital work force respectively. (These

      figures are based on national data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor

      Statistics. For details on their derivation, see Salkever, "The

      Impact of Collective Bargaining on Hospital Costs," Appendix E.)

      Using   these figures and the COy, DSV, and DRN coefficients in
      Column 3 of Table 5, we     can calculate the predicted effects of
      service     employee and RN unionization on LREA as (0.38 x 0.321 -        0.165)
      =   -0.04   and (0.30 x 0.321 -   0.124)   =   - 0.03   respectively. Of

      course, if we add the estimated effect of national unions (DNATLUN)

      since these unions commonly represent service employees, the cost

      impact figure for this group would         become weakly positive.
28.   For example, using the coefficients estimates from column 9 cF

      Table 5, the mean    values for TOTALUN, COy, DSV, and DRN from
      column 3 of Table 2, and setting UN74 =          1   yields an estimated overall

      union effect of -0.004.
                                    F-7




29. The reason for this can be seen by considering the regression

                    =
     model              a + h X1 + b2    X2. The least-squares estimates

     of the b's in this model can be expressed in terms of zero-

     order correlation coefficients (r's) and standard deviations

     (Sj's) as follows: b1              (r31 - r32   r12) S3/(l -   r122) S1 and
                    -                                S2. When r12 is close to
     b2 =    (r32       r31 r12) S3/(l - r122)
     1.0 because of collinearity, the signs of b1 and b2 will              generally
     be the same as the signs of (r31 - r32) and (r32 - r31)              respectively.

     I   am indebted to Michael Grossman for this observation.
30. Regressions with a variety of combinations of the unionization
     variables, in addition to those shown here, were also computed.
     Results generally showed a similar pattern of union effects to that
     reported       here. However, because of collinearity among the unioni-

    zation variables, there were a few minor variations in findings

    which should be noted. First, in the regressions on LREADIS, the

     DNATLUN coefficient often becomes positive and sionificant when

     COV, TOTALUN, and CBINS1 x COy are excluded; the Mew York State               inter-
    action    also became significant when (CBINS1 x COy) and COV were

    excluded. Second, in regressions on the change in LEXBDIS, the

    New York State interaction coefficient becomes significantly nega-

    tive when DNATLUN, TOTALUN, and UN74 are deleted. Third, in the

    regressions on LREADAY, the coefficient of NYC x COV becomes smaller

    and much less significant when COy is excluded. Fourth, in the

    regressions on the change in LEXBDAY, the coefficients for DSV and

    DRN become insignificant when both COY and CBINS1 x COY are deleted,

    while the CBINS1 x COV coefficient becomes positive and significant when
                                   F-8




      COy is deleted. These results are reported in Salkever,

      'The Impact of Collective Bargaining on Hospital Costs,"

      Chapter 4 and Appendix J.

31. These other studies, which estimated wage elasticities of cost

      per case and per day, are: Frank Sloan, Roger Feldman, and Bruce

      Steinwald, "Effects of Teaching on Hospital Costs," Journal of

      Health Economics (forthcoming) and Sloan and Adamache, pcit.

      Adamache and Sloan (.       cit.)   combine these estimates with the

      presumption (based on previous research) that the wage-elasticity

      of patient days is -0.1 to arrive at a wage elasticity for total

      costs of 0.47.

      Estimates and a Review of Recent Research," in R. Scheffler and

      Quarter    Journal of Economics, December 1980.


34. The price elasticity of demand for days of care implied by

      the difference between the cost impact estimates can be cal-

      culated using the UNION coefficients in Tables 3 or 4. For

      example, since LREA = LPD + LREADAY (where LPD is the logarithm

      o.f   patient   days), it is true that    LREA/   UNION = [C D LPD/ LREADAY)

      + 1J x LREADAY/a UNION. If cost per day is approximately equal

      to the average gross price, LREADAY plus the logarithm of the
                               F-9




      average coinsurance rate approximates the logarithm of net price

      and LPD/ LREADAY is approximately equal to the price elasticity

      of demand. To calculate this price elasticity, we divide the UNION

      coefficient in the LREA regression by the UNION coefficient in the

      LREADAY regression and subtract 1.0 from the result. Thus, the

      estimates   in Table 3 yield a price elasticity of patient days of
      roughly -0.4
35.   This is consistent with a larger price-elasticity for days of care

      by patients in the hospital than for admissions. Note, however, that

      in the cross-section regressions with HW1 included, the union impact

      on cost per case is almost equal to the cost per day impact.

36.   Letting COy, DSV, DRN and ONATLUN all equal 1.0, their combined effect

      on LREA is +0.08, which implies a percentage cost increase of 8.3.

37.   According to Current Population Survey data for the late 1970's, about

      15 percent of all hospital workers were union members. (Brian Becker,

      Glen Cain, Catherine McLaughlin, Richard Miller and Albert Schwenk,

      "The Union Impact on Hospitals: A National Study.t' Final Report on

      Grant HS 02661 submitted to the U.S. National Center for Health Ser-

      vices Research. Industrial Relations Research Institute, University

      of Wisconsin - Madison, January 1981, Chapter 2. Since 27.4

      percent of all hospitals had union contracts in 1980 (Becker,

      Sloan and Steinwald, p. cit.), and since these hospitals were

      larger on average than non-union hospitals, it is doubtful that

      more than half of the employees in these unionized hospitals were

      covered by union contracts.

 38. On the other hand, the fact that the already-unionized hospitals

      are larger suggests that the total cost impact of unionization

      spreading to new hospitals will be smaller.
