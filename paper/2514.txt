     General equilibrium analysis of labor unions has taken place

primarily within the context of closed— or small—open—economy versions

of the two—sector neoclassIcal model.    The early contributIons to this

literature introduce an exogenous union wage premium In one sector and

consider the Implications for various properties of the general

equilibrium.!t    Several recent papers have made endogenous the    actions   of

the labor union in an effort to understand both the way unions respond

to changing international conditions and the implications of union

behavior for broader comparative statics results,! What has not been

considered formally is the effect of union activity on the international

location of production and the pattern of international trade:       that Is,

the simultaneous determination of the union wage and the set of products

produced by union workers.

     By modeling the union as operating In an Import—competing sector

that produces a variety of heterogeneous goods, this paper explores the

union's impact on the pattern of trade and, at the same time, the effect

on union wages of shifting international patterns of production        In

particular, It goods within the union sector differ in the intensity

with which they require union labor, and if the (domestic) union wage

premium Is an important source of international cost differences, then
                                                                be
only the least labor—intensive range of union—sector goods will

produced domestically, with goods of greatest labor intensity being

produced abroad as a result of the relatively high cost of domestic

union labor.     With goods arranged in order of increasing labor
                                       —2—


intensity, the Identity of the "marginal" good——the good of highest

labor Intensity that is produoed In the domestic union sector——will be

determined by the sIze of the domestIc union wage premium:             it defines

the scope of domestic production in the union sector, and hence the

range of domestic export goods, as a function of union behavior.

However, the scope of domestic union—sector production will itself

affect the sectoral labor intensity of production, on which the wage

premium of a rent-maximizing union depends.1"             As such, when a union

supplies labor for the production of heterogeneous goods, the union wage

premium and the pattern of international trade will be determined

simultaneously.

     The key ingredients of the formal model developed below to explore

the link between trade patterns and union behavior are that countries

differ only with respect to their degree      of'   union activity, that goods

produced with union labor are heterogeneous in the intensity with which

their production requires w-iion labor, and that there is a single labor

union setting a uniform wage across goods of the "union sector."            The

first assumption is extreme, but represents a modeling technique that

has proved useful in highlighting the contributions of such determinants

as endowments and technology to the pattern         of'   international trade../

The second assumption approximates an industry—wide union, such as the

United Auto Workers or the United Steel Workers, whose members produce a

variety   of'   products.   Finally, the assumption of a single union is made

to keep the model simple.        Extending the model to include many unions

operating within the union sector is discussed in a footnote.

     The particular   framework   upon which   the    analysis    rests   15 a variant

of the two—country continuum—of-goods Ricardian model of Dornbusch,

Fischer, and Samuelson (1977), and is similar in some respects to the

model developed in Dixit and Grossman (1982).           There are two final—goods

sectors and a non—traded Intermediate good sector.               In the union sector,

firms combine unionized labor and the intermediate good in different

proportions to produce the various goods of the sector.               For

concreteness, this sector might be thought of as the automobile

industry, the union as the UAW, and the various goods within the sector

as the array of different models produced.           The goods in the non—union

sector are produced with combinations of non—union labor and the

Intermediate good and can, without loss of generality, be ag'egated

into one non—union good.    The intermediate good is non—traded and is

produced in the intermediate good sector with non—union labor alone.                   To

neutralize any Ricardian basis for international trade, technological

differences between countries that would lead to comparative advantage

are assumed to be absent:     only the operation of a labor union in the

domestic country distinguishes it from the foreign country.                 Finally,

the domestic labor union is assumed to organize workers in the domestic

union sector and to choose a single rent-maximizing wage at which Its

members will be hired to produce the heterogeneous goods of the sector.

     The relationship between the union wage premium and the pattern of

production and trade that emerges from this model has important

implications for the model's comparative statics results.                 Since the

aggregate labor intensity of the domestic union sector Is increasing In
                                      —14—



the scope of domestic production, the wage premium of a rent-maxinizing

doemstic labor Uflion will rise in response to increased "1ntensity' of

foreign competition.     Consequently, the scope of domestic production

takes on a sIgnificance of its own, and the effects of labor migration,

demand shifts, and technological change will be altered according to

their respective impacts on domestic production.       In this way, union

activity can alter in a systematIc way the standard comparative statics

results familiar from competitive Ricardian trade theory.

     The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows,       After developing

the model in section II, section III illustrates the effect of an active

union on comparative statics results of the Ricardian model by

considering the union response to a decline In demand for union

products, to a policy of directing R&D efforts into the union sector,

and to international labor migration.        Section IV concludes.


                                II.   The Model


     The continuum—of-goods Ricardian model of Dornbusch, Fischer, and

Samuelson (1977) yields strong comparative statics results concerning

the effects of changes in technology, tastes, and national labor

endowments on the terms of trade, relative and real wages, and the scope

of production in each of the two countries of the model.        A convenient

graphical representation of the model is developed by the authors to

provide a simple and intuitive method for determining the equilibrium

and generating comparative statics results.        The purpose of this section

is to develop   a   pair of diagrams which together characterize the
                                   —5—

world trade equilibrium in the presence of a rent—maximizing labor union

in the domestic country.    This Is accomplished in two steps.       First, the

model is solved given an exogenous union wage premium.         Then union

behavior is explicitly considered, and the general equilibrium of the

model is obtained.


Union Wage Premium Exogenous

      Located in each of the two countries of the model are two final

goods sectors and an intermediate good sector.         The Intermediate good,

whIch will be called "capital" and which is nontraded by assumption, is

used as an input into the production of final goods, and is produced

with non—union labor alone according to a linear homogenous technology

common to both countries.    Define units of the capital good so that one

unit of labor produces one unit of capital in either country.         Let   r

and   w,   respectively, be the price of the capital good and the wage of

non-union labor at home, and define    r*   and   w*     similarly abroad, all

measured in any common unit.   Then perfect competition will ensure that


           r.w;r*w*                                                             (1)


as long as the capital good is produced in both countries.

      The two traded—goods sectors employ labor and capital to produce

final goods for consumption.   Consider first the domestic economy.

Goods of the non-union sector are produced with combinations of non-

union labor and capital according to linear homogenous technologies.

Since the relative price of factors used in this sector Is fixed by (1),

competition keeps the relative prices of goods produced in the non—union
                                         —6—

sector fixed as      well.    Under the assumption that subutility over the

non—union goods is homothetic, a composite non—union good can be defined

whose production requires inputs of capital and non—union labor in fixed

p'oportions.      This composite non—union good will be called good 2.

     The union sector contains a continuum of goods indexed by                zcCO,1

and produced under constant returns to scale by combining capital and

union labor in fixed proportions. The assumption of Leontief

technologies in the union sector is primarily for graphical convenience,

though its implications for the endogenous determination of the union

wage premium will be discussed below./               Goods in the union sector are

Indexed according to increasing labor intensity, and the ratio of labor

to capital, while uniquely fixed for any good, is assumed to vary

continuously between zero and infinity as              z   goes from zero to one.

Finally, domestic preferences over the entire set of consumption goods

zCEO,1J,     2)    are assumed to be Cobb—Douglas.

     Now consIder the foreign country.               As noted above, technology for

producing the capital good is Identical at home and abroad.                Further,

assume    that the   Cobb—Douglas    preferences over the final goods are shared
by both    countries. Finally, to neutralize any Ricardian basis for
trade, It. is     assumed    that, In the production of final goods, an economy—

wide efficiency differential exists between the domestic and foreign

countries which may give rise to an absolute but not to a comparative

advantage, That is, defining           9.(z)   and     k(z) as   labor and capital

requirements, respectively, for unit           production    of good   z   in the
                                     —7—

domestic country, and defining     t*(z) and    k*(z)   analogously for the

foreign country, It is assumed that


             t*(z)    e2.(z)                                                  (2)
                               ZE{EO,1L    2}
             k*(z)    ek(z)




where    e   measures the efficiency differential between domestic and

foreign production of final goods.     A rise in    e   corresponds to an

Increase in the relative efficiency of domestic producers.

     In the absence of a domestic union wage premium, condition (2)

implies that there will exist no basis for trade between the two

countries.     A single equilibrium wage    w   will be earned by all domestic

labor, while     w*   will be earned by labor abroad.    Given (1) and (2),

and assuming the absence of transportation costs, relative wages at home

and abroad must In equilibrium satisfy



                                                                              (3)




since otherwise one country would have a cost advantage In the

production of all traded goods.      Under equilibrium condition (3),

neither country has a cost advantage In the production of any good and,

as a result, the international pattern of production is completely

arbitrary.

        The introduction of a domestic union wage premium provides the

basis for trade between the two countries.        A two—quadrant version of

the Lerner—Pearce diagram familiar from L-{ecksoher—Ohlln trade theory can
                                           —8—

be used to illustrate the no-trade equilibrium and how the existence of

a domestic union wage premium gives rise to international trade.                   With

labor measured on the horizontal axis and capital measured on the

vertical axis, the right and left quadrants of Figure             1   depict the unIt

isocost lines and unit value isoquants that obtain In the union sector

and the non—union sector, respectively, in the absence of a union wage

premium.    For graphical convenIence,         e   Is set to unity Implying that

technologies are Identical in the two countries.

       In the absence    of'   a   domestic union wage premium, and with       e    set

to one, (3)      implies that, in equilibrium,          domestic and foreign wages
will   be identical.     Normalizing this common wage to unity and using (1),

the unit isocost lIne pictured in each quadrant of Figure               1   is shared by

both countries and intersects each axis            of   the two—quadrant Lerner—

Pearce diagram at one, reflecting the reciprocal of the unitary wage

paid to labor in each sector and the reciprocal of the unitary price of

capital,    Cobb—Douglas preferences imply that each good will be demanded

and thus produced somewhere In the free trade equilibrium, so that final

goods prices will adjust to ensure that every unit value isoquant just

touches    the   Isocost line In Its sector. Since the unit value
                 unit

isoquants and unit isocost lines are shared by the two countries, zero—
profit production of any good can occur in either country, and as such,

the International location for the production of any final good will be

completely arbitrary.
     Finally, recall that, In the union sector, each good z Is assumed

to be produced with a unique ratio of labor to capital; this too is
                                             —9—


reflected in Figure        1.     In particular,the ratio         Fzo for any
Z' £ (0,1] can be read from the right-hand quadrant of Figure 1 as the
inverse of the slope of the ray from the origin through the point on the
carve labeled ZZ that lies vertioally above z' • Under the assaption

in z over the interval z a (0,1] with C0) • 0 and

                the
labor—capital ratio in the way described above, will intersect the
horizontal axis at one, be continuous over 2 £ (0,1], and have
negative but finite slope.

                                      a.   Since

higher than the unitary wags abroad, the domestic price of capital must
fall below one if the anion sector is to continue to operate at all in
the domestic country. This implies, using (1), that the domestic non—
 anion wage mast.      In fact, for any given union premius, the level

of the domestic non—union wage will determine completely the scope of

depicted in Figure 2.

for any union premium will depend on the level of the domestic non—union

wage    w,       which can be determined once the demand side of the model is

completed.

       Finally, goods prices will eliminate profits in equilibrium.                                     In

the left quadrant of Figure 2, the unit value isoquant will move out

along a radial path from the origin until Its vertex lies on the

outermost unit isocost line, that                     at'   the domestic country.            Accordingly,

the non—union good will be produced domestically.                              Similarly, each unit

value isoquant In the right quadrant will move along a radial path from

the origin until its vertex lies on the convex hull of the two unit iso—

cost lines,           The good labeled                in Figure 2 is the 'marginal" good

whose production can occur in either country in equilibrium, all goods

z a E0,')            produced at home and all goods               z a (!,1]           produced abroad.

Consequently, In the presence of a domestic labor union, the domestic

country specializes in the production of the non—union good, and in the

capital intensive goods of the union sector,

       The real wage effects of the domestic labor union can also be read

from Figure 2.            The foreign nominal wage                w*     is unchanged at its

normalized value of unity,                  Prices of goods             z a             are also

unchanged relative to                 w*.   However, prices of goods                  zcEO,),2}         have

fallen relative to               w     as a result of the domestic union wage                    prefnluzn,
                                     —   ii   —



  as reflected in the outward

                                                             isoquants for
  these goods.   Therefore, foreign labor gains In real terms from the

 unionization of the domestic labor      force. This occursbecause the
  domestic union wage premium has provided the
                                                basis for trade between the
 two countries, and
                     foreign labor enjoys the benefits of t'is trade. The
 real wage of those employed in the
                                      domestIc union sector rises by an
 even greater amount, sInce

 employed  in the domestic nonunIon sector to fall In

tandem with the domestic non-union
                                     wage w. Hence, for any union aage

p = 1,      expression (6) implies that                   Z = 0    which, according to (8) and (9),

means that          F(Z(w,p=1,e),b(2))              b(2)    and     R(Z(w,p=1,e),p=1) = 0.

Model     Union Behavior


      The potential Importance of making endogenous the pattern of

production and trade from the standpoint of determIning the effects of

foreign competition on union wage—setting behavIor Is brought out by

noting that trade will have two opposing effects on the optimal union

wage premium in this model.       On the one hand, the union wage will be

constrained by international trade through a higher elasticity of

derived demand for union labor:       this results from the international

relocation of production that would occur at the margin in response to

further increases In the union wage.       On the other hand, the goods whose

production does remain at home will be those that use relatively

unintenslvely the services of union labor, and the average labor

intensity of production in the union sector will decline:         this effect

tends to reduce the elasticity of derived demand for union labor, and

consequently leads to a higher union wage.       If the former effect is

invariant with respect to the scope of domestic production, then through

the latter effect, "Intensification" of foreign competition which

manifests itself in a narrower scope of domestic production will bring

about a higher union wage premium, since the increased competition from

abroad weeds out precisely those firms whose relatively intensive use of

union    labor held down the domestic union wage premium.                         These results

are   derived formally as follows.
        Domestic union              membership Is taken as exogenously determined.

Union members who do not get jobs In the union sector are assumed to

find employment in the non-union sector at the prevailing non-union

wage.     The union is assumed to choose                         s   to maximize the rents earned

by its members, taking the domestic non—union wage and level of world

income          (Y     L*)     as fixed.!           Domestic union rents can be written as


                                f(w,p(w) ,e)

      The model developed in the previous section can be used to
illustrate the effects of changes In the international environment on

union behavior,      This section explores the union response to three

events:    a shift in consumer preferences toward non-union goods, the

imposition of a domestic targeting program aimed at union—sector goods,

and the international migration of non—union labor.

Demand Shifts

      Lawrence and Lawrence (1985) provide an explanatIon for the rising

union wage premium In the     IJ.S.   over   the period   1970—19814 which     iS   based
on   a prediction of rising union wage differentials in          response      to long

run declines in demand growth:         the decline in demand growth in          the
union sector reduces the substitution possibilities between capital and

labor, leading to a less elastic derived demand for union labor and a

greater wage premium.      The model of section II yields a similar

relationship between declining union sector demand            and   rising wage
                                            —   21 —




differentials,     but for a very different reason.

       Consider an increase in           b(2),    the proportion of income spent on

the non—union good, accompanied by a proportional decrease in the bidget

shares of all union sector goods                zs[0,1],       so that   A(z;.)         is

unchanged for      z         [0,1]    and the budget shares over all final goods

still sum to one.        The decline in union sector demand will have no

affect on the equilibrium relationship between                        and     w    given by

condition (19), since           b(2)    does not enter (19) directly (see the

definition of       r    given In (20)).        Combinations of             and     w     that

satisfy (19) are depicted by the upward sloping curve in Figure 4.

However,    b(2)       does enter into equilibrium condition (11).                      For any

p>o,    the Increase in         b(2)    will lead to a domestic trade surplus

which, according to (11), requires a rise in                        to restore
                                                                          b(2) L* E

we     and the location of production Is arbitrary, so that changes in

budget shares have no affect on relative wages.                    This is summarized by

the upward shift in the negatively sloped curve shown In Figure 4, which

depicts the relationship between                  and      p    given in (11).

       At the original                 the domestic non—union wage is bid up
                                p0,

relative to the wage of foreign labor due to the shift in preferences

away from goods of the union sector and toward good 2:                        this makes

domestic union sector production less competitive relative to production

abroad, and the production of a marginal range of domestic union goods

is lost to foreigners.              Since the domestic plants that close are the

most labor intensive of the domestic union sector, the sectoral labor

intensity   of   the domestic union sector declines           inducing the rent—

maximizing   union premium to         rise.   The new   equilibrium   is illustrated   In
Figure     by    (wT,           where the union premium has      risen as a result of
                        p1),

the declining    demand    for union sector      goods.
      Fundamentally, it        is   not the decline In union sector demand per se
but   rather the loss of marginal goods associated with It that leads to a

rise in the domestic union wage premium. The loss of marginal goods is

brought about by an increase in the domestic non-union wage resulting

from the greater demand for domestic non-union workers.                 As such, the

model associates rising union wage premiums with falling union sector

demand only when, as In the proportional case considered here, the shift

In demand away from the goods of the union sector results In greater

demand for the services of domestic non—union labor.

tin
       As Krugman (1987) has noted, the case for industrial targeting

stands or falls with the ability to Identify sectors that "ought" to be

targeted, where targeting is understood to imply a policy of affecting

the sectoral pattern of investment rather than its aggregate level.

Since the choice of the targeted sector will have Implications for the

scope of domestic union production in the model of section II, it will

also affect the union wage premium.             This In turn can provide a reason

to alter the sectoral mix of investment through a policy of Industrial

targeting.

       As an illustration of this point, consider the choice between
                                             23 -

allocating     a given amount of R&D expenditures to either the union or the

non—union sector of the domestic country, where the direct (cost—saving)

effect of the R&D     results in    an   increase in     e   in the targeted

sector.      Assume that the change in       e      alone would lead to cost re-

ductions for the domestically produced goods of the sector which imply an

equivalent increase in utility regardless of the sector chosen for

targeting.     Thus, from the standpoint of the direct effect of R&D, there

is no basis upon which to favor one sector over the other.

       If the non—union sector were targeted, all benefits would be

captured in this direct effect:          the increase in the domestic efficiency

of the non—union sector and the resulting drop in              P(2)   would be the

only benefit of the program, since endogenous variables of the model

would be unaffected.        Thts is easily seen by noting that         e   enters both

equilibrium conditions (11) and (19) only through               (w,p,e), and hence,

only   in   so far as it   captures the lnternatonal technology differences
in   production of union sector goods.            As such, the domestic utility

benefits of R&D applied to the non-union sector are captured completely

by the resulting price reduction for good 2.

       Not so for a policy of targeting the domestic union sector which,

in altering the efficiency of production of the marginal union good,

affects the equilibrium values of            w    and   p.   Specifically, consider

first the impact of an increase in            e     on equilibrium condition (11).

The efficiency parameter        e   enters (11) only through its affect on

(w,p,e)       as given in expression (6).           Thus, for any   0 < p < 1,   (6)

thus             rises by the full increase in                  e,   This Information is

reflected in the upward shift (by less than the percentage increase in

e) of the negatively sloped curve in FIgure 5a,                           Next consider the

effect of increasing e                   on equIlibrium conditIon (19),             Holding

to leave             ,       and hence    i/n,     unchanged. Thus, the upward sloping

curve in Figure Ta shifts up by the same percentage as the change In                                      e.


       The resulting equilibrium                                 Is given in Figure Os.         At the

the domestic non—unIon wage does not rise to fully offset the cost

original unit     isocost          lines of the domestic country are given by the

rise above one in that sector.               Holding       p        fIxed, Figure Sa shows

that    w   (and thus        r)     rises, but by less than             e,   to   w'.       The dotted

lines In the two quadrants of FIgure Sb reflect this new equilibrium

value of     w,   where        p     has been held fixed.             The rise in       w    and   r

shifts inward the domestic unit isocost line in the non—union sector, as

depicted in the left hand quadrant.                 In the right hand quadrant, the

foreign country's unit value isoquant will be the domestic country's

"e"    value isoquant, since the two countries no longer share

technologies for production of the union goods,                         As such, the domestIc

union sector's         "e"     isocost line is depicted by the dotted line in the

right hand quadrant.               At the original                   it has shifted out, since
                                                         P0,

w     (and thus   r)     has       fallen relative to          e.

       Even before allowing             p   to respond, it is apparent from Figure Sb

that a terms—of-trade argument can be made for targeting the union

sector in this model, since domestic wages (union and nonunion) increase

not only with respect to the prices of domestically produced union

sector goods (the direct effect), but also with respect to the prices of

all goods produced abroad (the terms of trade effect).                            In contrast,

targeting the non—union sector leads only to a direct real wage effect

with respect to the non—union good, since it leaves the (double

thi union response come in the form of lower priced union sector goods
produced domestically and lower priced imports from abroad. As a result
of the fall in p and the accompanying increase in w, the domestic
non-union wage rises with respect to the prices of       all     goods
 z £ (0,13 the relative wage increase makes foreign produced goods
more affordable at home, while the drop in p lowers the price of

domestically produced union sector goods relative to the domestic non-
union wage. Finafly, the domestic union members must benefit in real
terms as weal from the union's response to the targeting program, even
though the union s Isszmed to ignore         its effect on   w   when choosing

p. This is because the drop in the union premium serves to increase
the domestic non union wage, and hence the (iãcred) double factoral
terms of trade effect of the union response is in this case beneficial
to domestic union workers.

     Therefore,   the reduction in          p   and accompanying increase in   a


brought about by union sector targeting is welfare enhancing for the

domestic economy, and suggests a rationale for caring especially about

the competitiveness"      of the   UfliOfl   sector.'
Labor Migration

     International labor mIgration can be represented in the model as a

change In     .     In   the competitIve model explored in Dornbusch,

Fischer, and Samuelson (1977), labor migration from the low wage to the

high wage country would reallocate the world stock of labor toward the

country whose marginal—good technology iS most efficient.             This serves

to expand the world production possIbilities frontier, and makes labor

in the low wage country better off, though the (original) Inhabitants of

the high wage country suffer a welfare decline.             Of course, the

expansion of world production possibilities ensures that the gainers

could compensate the losers.        Findlay (1982) has argued in the context

of a Ricardian model that, with regard to several well-known notIons of

distributive justice, free trade cum migration is "just" in that it at

once expands the world production possibilities and brings about a more

equal international distribution of Income.

     In the model of section II, the consequences of labor migration in

response to International wage differentials can be quite different.

First, the union can cause the less efficient country to have the high

non—union wage, so that (non—union) labor migration in the dIrection of

higher wages contracts the world production possibilities frontier.

Moreover, In response to this migration abroad, the scope of domestic

production           contracts,      and the union        wage premIum        therefore      rIses,

offseting the real gains that would otherwise accrue to domestic non-

union      workers       and reducIng the amount by which migration closes the

International non—union wage discrepancy.

          This Is illustrated             ifl   FIgures 6a and 6b,           Figure 6a Illustrates

          With the initial domestic non—union wage lower than the wage

abroad, migration will occur in the direction of the foreign country.

As such,         (L*/L)           increases, and labor migrates towards the

equilibrium condition (11) Implies that the downward sloping curve in

Figure 6a will shift upward:                      for    p =   1   ,   the   percentage increase in

the domestic wage will equal the percentage increase in                                     (h),

of    union sector production in the home country.                   Since the most labor—

intensive activities are the first to go, the sectoral labor Intensity

of production in the domestic union sector declines, inducing a rise in

p.     The final equilibrium 15 given by                              in Eigure 6a, where
                                                     (p1,w1)
both the unIon wage premium and the domestic non-union wage have

increased as a resclt of the migration.

       The real wage effects of this migration are contained in Figure

6b.    The dotted lInes represent the final               "c'       isocost lines for the

home country, and reflect the fact that both                    a    and   p   have

increased.    The implications of the union response to migration for the

utility of foreign workers Is ambIguous:                  for a given domestic non—union

wage the higher     p       ma<es dornsttc goods more expensive abroad, whIle

the drop in the domestic non-union wage induced by the increase in                         p

makes them cheaper.          Overall, however, foreign residents must be hcrt by

the influx of labor, since both           a    and    p     rise.     The effect of the

union response to migration on the utility of domestic non—union workers

is unambiguously negative, since the rise in                    p    diminishes the

purchasing power of the domestic non—union wage with respect to

domestically produced union sector goods, and the induced fall in                      a

makes goods abroad more expensive as well.                  The overall effect of the

migration on domestic non—union residents is ambiguous, however, due to

the rise in both        a    and   p.   If'   domestically produced union goods

enter with sufficient weight In utility, the (remaining) domestic non-

union labor force will be made worse off by the exodus of domestic

labor.

                                IV,    Conclualon


      CompetitIve trade theory suggests that freely working market forces

in a world economy will determine optimally the international locatIon

of production, and that a country engaged in trade need have no

addItional concerns over the Identity of sectors operating within Its

borders. WhIle recent literature has questioned this result, and points

toward the potentIal national benefits of the domestic location of

sectors with   certain   attributes, the focus has been primarily on product

                  there
markets." Moreover,             is    nothing Inherently perverse about the free
trade allocation of productIon across countries in this literature:
there simply exist certain sectors that all countries would rather have
operating within their borders.
      This paper has focused on the exIstence of an optimizing labor
union,   and has explored the InteractIon between union wage demands and

the   International pattern of production and trade. In the model
considered,   the scope of domestic production takes on a special welfare

siificance of     its own, since it determines in a systematic way the

characteristics of the set of firms served by the trade union.       A

broader scope of production at home is associated with a lower domestic

union wage premium, while an 'intensification" of foreign competition

leads to a hIgher domestic union premium.

      As illustrated in section III, this relationship implies several

conclusions concerning the effects of changes in the international

environment which lead to shifts in the international pattern of

production.    First, a shift in preferences away from union sector goods
                                       —

and   into the   non—union   goods of the dcmesti3 oountry will, in driving up
the domestia non—union wage relative to the wage abroad, diminish the
scope of domestic union sector production and hence reduce the sectore.l
labor intensity of produ2tion: this leads to a rise in the rent—
maximizing domestia mien wage premium. As such, the model predicts a
rising union premium in the face of declining demand for union
products. Seconc, directing domestic R&D efforts toward the union
seotor will expand the scope of anion producticn and reduce the union
premium, while R&D in the non-union sector leaves the scope of union
sector production, and hence union behavior, unohangedi this raises the
possibility of welfare gains from a progrsm of union sector targeting.
Finally, international labor migration can have very different effects
when a labor union is present. In patioular, the presence of a union in

the technologically more advanced country can cause migration of non-
union labor to occur in the direction of the less advanced oountry.
Moreover, as this migration takes place, the union wage premium is
driven up, of festting the welfare gains of migration to the remaining
non—union population in the domestic country.

         inveres relationship between scope of production and the uni3n
       The

premium which emerges from this model depends critically on the notion
that international differences in union activity are an important
determinant of international ocet differences. An extreme view has been
adopted here, in that the presence or absence of       a union is all that
distinguishes countries in the model. The interaction of labor union
activity with other determinants of trade patterns, am well es with the

     has fooused on modeling the response of union wage demands to an
     increase in international competition when the union follows a
     seniority layoff and rehiring rule. His results suggest that such
     hiring rules could be responsible for the empirical observation
     that seotoral wages often fail to fall in response to a reduction
   in the price of competing import goods. The results of this paper
   provide an alternative explanation for such wage behavior.
   The effect of capital intensity on the derived demand elasticity

   for labor is often cited as one explanation of greater union
   activity in more capital intensive sectors. For empirical evidence
   on this relationship, see, for example, Hirsch and Berger (198*).

factor prices, but it will be accomplished by altering the mix of

goods produced within the sector, rather than by altering the mix

of factors In the production of any good.

As noted in Kill         (19814),   rent—maximizing behavior Is a special case

of the union objective function employed by McDonald and Solow

(1981),      in which union members are risk neutral.                    That the union

ignores its effect on the domestic non-union wage and level of

world income when setting its wage is an assumption which can be

motivated by thinking of this union as one of many unions, no one

of which is large         enou      to affect           agegate   variables, but which

together have a significant impact.                      For a paper focussing on many

small unions in a continuum—of—goods general equilibrium model, see

Stalger (1985).

More generally the elasticities of factor substitution and product

demand will also enter into the determination of the derived demand

elasticity for union workers.                   However, empirical evidence of

uniformly low substitution elasticities between union and non—union

Inputs can be found in Frenan and Medoff (1981, 1982), and it

seems       natural to focus on variations In cost shares as the main
element of heterogeneity among goods served by                         the   union.   Limited

       variation in factor substitution and/or demand elasticities across

       goods would complicate but not alter the conclusions of thIs paper.

9/     The   ZZ   curve is suppressed from   figures   5b and 6b since it

       remains unchanged throughout.

.2/    An argument for targeting "marginal" goods due to this terms of

       trade effect has been made recently by Itoh and Kiyono (1987).
10/    The polIcy of targeting analyzed here assumes that the union takes

       as given the government R&D decisIon when It sets lts wage demands
