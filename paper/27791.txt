                                         ABSTRACT

Identifying essential and frontline workers and understanding their characteristics is useful for
policymakers and researchers in targeting social insurance and safety net policies in response to
the COVID-19 crisis. We develop a working definition that may inform additional research and
policy discussion and provide data on the demographic and labor market composition of these
workers. In a three-step approach, we first apply the official industry guidelines issued by the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to microdata from the 2017 and 2018 American
Community Survey to identify essential workers regardless of actual operation status of their
industry. We then use data on the feasibility of work from home in the worker’s occupation group
(Dingel and Neiman 2020) to identify those most likely to be frontline workers who worked in-
person early in the COVID-19 crisis in March/April 2020. In a third step we exclude industries
that were shutdown or running under limited demand at that time (Vavra, 2020). We find that the
broader group of essential workers comprises a large share of the labor force and tends to mirror
its demographic and labor market characteristics. In contrast, the narrower category of frontline
workers is, on average, less educated, has lower wages, and has a higher representation of men,
disadvantaged minorities, especially Hispanics, and immigrants. These results hold even when
excluding industries that were shutdown or operating at a limited level.

INTRODUCTION

The COVID-19 pandemic, and with it the lockdown and demand declines affecting major parts

of the U.S. economy, has required the identification of essential workers who are vital for the

core functioning of societal infrastructure. Formation of policies to protect and meet the needs of

these essential workers depends on knowing their composition and characteristics. However,

identifying essential workers is not straightforward. The definition of essential work may differ

by state or even locality and change rapidly over time. Moreover, the risk essential workers face

is influenced by whether they are frontline workers who must provide their labor in person or

whether they can work from home. As some industries, even those deemed essential, may be for

the most part shut down or facing steep decreases in demand, who is really at work also depends

on the current shutdown or demand status of their industry.

       We address these data issues to provide information on the characteristics of essential

workers and, more specifically, frontline workers. We begin by applying the official industry

guidelines issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and

Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on March 28, 2020 to microdata from the 2017 and 2018

American Community Survey (ACS) to identify the broader group of essential workers. We then

use data on the feasibility of work from home in the worker’s occupation group (Dingel and

Neiman 2020) to identify those most likely to be frontline workers. We find that the broader

group of essential workers comprises a large share of the labor force and tends to mirror its

demographic characteristics. In contrast, frontline workers are a less educated, lower wage

group, with a higher representation of men, disadvantaged minorities, especially Hispanics, and

immigrants, on average. Both conclusions remain unchanged when excluding industries that
were considered shutdown/diminished demand during the early stages of the COVID crisis

(Vavra, 2020).

DATA AND METHODS

A common and clear-cut definition of essential workers would facilitate the rapidly evolving

social science literature on COVID-19. However, the designation of “essential” requires

interpretation and depends on the policy context. We propose a three-step approach narrowing

from essential industries to “frontline” workers to “frontline excluding shutdown industries”,

capturing those who provide their labor in person in active industries.

       First, although various states and cities under lockdown have applied their own

definitions of essential, the federal guidelines provide a logical starting point for an analysis of

essential workers. Thus, we use the federal guidelines listing essential infrastructure workers

during the COVID-19 epidemic who “protect their communities, while ensuring continuity of

functions critical to public health and safety, as well as economic and national security” issued

by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security

Agency (CISA) on March 28, 2020. We translate the 14 categories that are defined as essential

critical infrastructure sectors into NAICS industry classification, identifying 194 out of overall

287 industry categories as essential. By matching the qualitative information from the DHS into

the NAICS 2017 four-digit industry classification, we attempt to refrain from subjective

decision-making to the maximum extent possible by including all DHS-designated industries

regardless of actual operation. This approximation of essential workers that we proposed in an

Econofact memo (Blau et al., 2020) has also been used in Montenovo et al. (2020) and Gupta et

al. (2020), both studying various COVID-19 repercussions on the labor market.




                                                  2
       In a second step, we identify frontline workers by focusing on a subcategory of essential

workers; those in occupation groups where a third or less of workers can feasibly work from

home based on analysis by Dingel and Neiman (2020). They construct a work-from-home

measure using pre-pandemic surveys from the Occupational Information Network that describe

the typical experience of US workers to classify occupations at the major group (2 digit) level as

able or unable to be done entirely from home. They report high correlations of their measure

with early estimates of the share of workers who actually worked from home during the early

stage of the crisis. Making use of this measure allows us to focus on the composition and

characteristics of frontline workers, a subset of essential workers who arguably face a higher

level of risk of infection by providing their labor in person.

       For the larger group of essential workers as well as the narrower subset of frontline

workers, in a third step we additionally exclude industries that were shutdown or running under

limited demand at the initial COVID-outbreak in March 2020 as identified by Vavra (2020), e.g.

restaurants and other food services, traveler accommodation, air transportation, or a number of

manufacturing industries.

FINDINGS

Tables 1 and 2 show our results for essential and frontline workers at the aggregate level and, for

frontline workers (our primary focus), separately at the major (2-digit) occupation level. Table 1

reports demographic characteristics and Table 2 reports labor market characteristics.

       As may be seen in the tables, essential workers, using our definition, comprise a large and

varied group. Overall, they are nearly 70 percent of all workers (see Panel A in Tables 1 and 2).

Women are well represented, although the female share (44%) is somewhat lower than for the

labor force as a whole (47%). The other demographic characteristics of essential workers are



                                                  3
also very similar to the general labor market on the aggregate level, although they are slightly

more likely to be disadvantaged minorities or immigrants (foreign born) and have somewhat

lower educational attainment (see Panel A in Table 1). The share of workers in predominantly

(70%+) female and predominantly (30%-) male occupations (as classified based on 4 digit

occupational categories) is broadly similar between essential and all workers, although a

somewhat larger share of essential workers are in predominantly male occupations. Average

wages of essential workers are virtually the same as for all workers and about the same share of

essential workers as all workers earn low wages (in the bottom quartile of the overall wage

distribution) and high wages (in the top quartile of the overall wage distribution) as shown in

Panel A of Table 2. Taking into account the shutdown in the early stage of the crisis by

excluding workers in affected industries does substantially reduce the estimated number of

essential workers — to 59% of all workers; with average wages somewhat higher at $27.25

(compared to $25.65 for all workers). However, the demographic characteristics of essential

workers are almost identical when excluding shutdown and limited demand industries.

       Frontline workers also vary but come disproportionately from socio-economically

disadvantaged groups compared to the overall workforce (see Panel A in Table 1) and receive

lower wages on average (Panel A in Table 2). Frontline workers include (but are not limited to)

health care workers, protective service workers (police and EMS), cashiers in grocery and

general merchandise stores, production and food processing workers, janitors and maintenance

workers, agricultural workers, and truck drivers. Such workers constitute 42% of all workers

(and 60% of essential workers). While women are overly represented in a number of specific

frontline occupations, the average female share of frontline workers (39%) is lower than for

essential workers as a whole. Frontline workers are on average less well educated than all



                                                 4
workers, with a higher share comprised of high school dropouts and a lower share having a

college degree or higher. They also have a considerably higher share of Hispanics and a

somewhat higher share of Blacks. Immigrants are also disproportionately represented. Average

wages of frontline workers ($21.85) are lower than those of all workers and essential workers. A

higher share of frontline workers earn low wages (in the bottom quartile) and a smaller share

earn high wages (in the top quartile).

       As would be expected, health care workers comprise an important share — 20% of

frontline workers (see Panel B in Tables 1 and 2). A majority of heath care workers is female. A

sizable share of health care workers (72%) are in practitioners and technical occupations,

including doctors, registered nurses and pharmacists (among others). This is a relatively highly

educated, high paying group. Although doctors are still majority male, women comprise a

majority of health care practitioners (75%). Health support workers such as nursing assistants

and home health aids constitute the remainder of heath care workers. They are an even more

heavily female group (86%). In contrast to health care practitioners, they are a relatively less

well educated and low wage group. Additionally, this group is majority non-white (54%,

including 25% Black and 19% Hispanic), immigrants are heavily represented, and a substantial

share are single mothers (23% compared to 8% of frontline workers and all workers), suggesting

they may face greater childcare burdens.

       Essential sales and related occupations also constitute a large share of frontline workers,

15%. Women constitute a little under half of all workers in this occupation group, with a quarter

of workers employed in predominantly female occupations. Overall, the average wage is about

the same as that for all workers, but an above average share earn wages in the bottom quartile.

Almost a quarter of workers in this group are cashiers at essential retailers such as grocery stories



                                                 5
and general merchandise stores. Cashiers are 71% female, 51% non-white, and 60% earn wages

in the lowest quartile of all workers.

       A number of heavily male, blue collar categories together constitute a large share of the

frontline occupations, including transportation and material moving occupations (13%),

production occupations (11%), construction and extraction (10%), building and grounds cleaning

and maintenance (6%), installation maintenance and repair (6%), as well as farming, fishing and

forestry occupations (2%). Average wages for workers in these occupation groups are

substantially below the average for all workers.

       Protective service occupations constitute another crucial component of the frontline

workforce, accounting for 4% of frontline workers. This is a primarily male category that earns

about the same wage as the average for all workers.

       Excluding industries that are were basically shutdown or had drastically reduced demand

in the early stages of the pandemic, frontline workers remain disproportionately less educated;

disproportionately minority workers, and earned below average wages (see Panel A in Tables 1

and 2). If we take the estimates of closures and greatly reduced demand into account in

measuring the frontline workforce, the estimated number of frontline workers is substantially

reduced—to 34% of all workers. The percent female in the occupation declines slightly to 37%

and average wages rise somewhat to $23.15. However, our basic conclusion that the frontline

group is disproportionately comprised of less educated and minority workers, earning below

average wages and with a substantial share of workers in the bottom quartile, remains

unchanged. Considering shutdown industries is of particular relevance for food preparation and

serving occupations which potentially comprise a substantial share of frontline workers (11%),

but the smallest share (1.6%) when taking shutdown into account (see Panel C in Tables 1 and



                                                   6
2). While some were working and taking the risk of exposure to clients at the early stage of the

pandemic, the majority were unemployed. For both definitions this is a majority female and very

a low wage occupation group on average.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

During the course of COVID-19, we have relied on a subset of essential workers to meet our

basic needs while significant portions of the population have isolated at home. While some

essential workers can themselves work from home, this is not feasible for a significant portion,

whom we designate as frontline workers, who must take on considerable risk to do their jobs.

Although there is variation within this group, we have found that frontline workers are

disproportionately comprised of less educated and minority workers, especially Hispanics, and

immigrants, and earn below average wages, with a substantial share of workers in the bottom

wage quartile. These workers, even healthcare workers, now face much higher risks than

traditionally incurred in these occupations. Identifying essential and frontline workers and

understanding their characteristics is useful for policymakers in targeting social insurance and

safety net policies in response to the COVID-19 crisis and researchers estimating the impact of

the pandemic on different groups.

Notes: This table lists demographic characteristics of essential and frontline Workers. Essential workers are identified by mapping official industry guidelines issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to microdata from the
2017 and 2018 American Community Survey. Frontline workers are approximated by their feasibility of work from home in the worker’s occupation group (Dingel and Neiman 2020). Shutdown adjusts for industries that were shutdown or
running under limited demand early in the COVID crisis (Vavra 2020). Group averages are shown in Panel A. Panel B reports demographic characteristics at the major (2-digit) occupation group level for frontline workers, while Panel C
additionally excludes shutdown industries. Demographic charateristics consist of the share of females, racial background (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Other Race, immigrant status (foreign born), single mother, and highest educational
attainment (less than High-School (HS), HS degree, some college, higher than Bachelor Degree (BA).

Notes: This table lists labor market characteristics of essential and frontline Workers. Essential workers are identified by mapping official industry guidelines issued by the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to microdata from the 2017 and 2018 American Community Survey. Frontline workers are approximated by their feasibility of work
from home in the worker’s occupation group (Dingel and Neiman 2020). Shutdown adjusts for industries that were shutdown or running under limited demand early in the
COVID crisis (Vavra 2020). Group averages are shown in Panel A. Panel B reports labor market characteristics at the major (2-digit) occupation group level for frontline
workers, while Panel C additionally excludes shutdown industries. Labor market charateristics consist of the share of females, share of workers that work in predominantly
female 4-digit occupations (70 percent or more of workers are female) or predominantly male 4-digit occupations (30 percent or less of the workers are female), hourly wages
(income in 2018 dollars using the CPI divided by the product of usual hours worked per week and the mid-point of usual weeks worked per year), share of workers earning low
wages (in the bottom quartile of the overall wage distribution) and high wages (in the top quartile of the overall wage distribution).
