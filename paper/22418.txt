The New Keynesian Transmission Mechanism: A Heterogenous-Agent Perspective

                                         ABSTRACT

We argue that a 2-agent version of the standard New Keynesian model—where a “worker”
receives only labor income and a “capitalist” only profit income— offers insights about how
income inequality affects the monetary transmission mechanism. Under rigid prices, monetary
policy affects the distribution of consumption, but it has no effect on output as workers choose
not to change their hours worked in response to wage movements. In the corresponding
representative-agent model, in contrast, hours do rise after a monetary policy loosening due to a
wealth effect on labor supply: profits fall, thus reducing the representative worker’s income. If
wages are rigid too, however, the monetary transmission mechanism is active and resembles that
in the corresponding representative-agent model. Here, workers are not on their labor supply
curve and hence respond passively to demand, and profits are procyclical.

1        Introduction

There is significant recent interest in how inequality between consumers may affect
the monetary transmission mechanism and how inequality is affected by monetary
policy. Traditional New Keynesian (NK) models rely on a setting with a representa-
tive agent (RA) and thus by definition do not allow this topic to be analyzed. The RA
setup is analytically very convenient, however, and the hope, perhaps, has been that its
main conclusions are robust to extensions to multiple agents.1 With new analytical and
computational tools available, a burgeoning literature is now beginning to explore the
conjecture that most of the RA model’s conclusions are indeed robust to consumer het-
erogeneity. This literature also explores the possibility that models with inequality can,
under some conditions, give a richer and more realistic description of the monetary
transmission mechanism. Very interesting analyses along these lines include Auclert
(2015), Gornemann et al. (2016), McKay et al. (2015), and Kaplan et al. (2016), which
all study rich heterogenous-agent (HA) settings with nominal frictions; Kaplan et al.
(2016) coin the term HANK models to represent HA extensions to the NK model, thus
making RANK an appropriate term of NK models using the RA assumption, with no
pun intended.
        Motivated by these analyses, the present paper points to a particular challenge that
HANK models face when calibrated to the kind of inequality observed in the data.
In the data, wealth is extremely concentrated; this has been documented extensively,
with notable recent contributions by Wolff (2014), Piketty and Zucman (2015), Kuhn
and Rios-Rull (2016), and Saez and Zucman (2016). Labor income is quite concen-
trated as well but much less so than is wealth.2 In this paper we analyze the very
simplest extension of a NK model, namely, a model with two consumers aimed to rep-
resent “workers” and “capitalists”, hence capturing what is arguably the key element
of inequality in the data.3 We show that it has quite different properties than the cor-
    1
        Very simple extensions to consider inequality have been shown to give near equivalence with the
corresponding RA model in the context of real business cycle models; see the baseline results in Krusell
and Smith (1998).
   2
     The factor shares of income have not undergone major fluctuations, although they do exhibit some
movements, especially recently; see, e.g., Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014).
  3
    Our paper is related to the literature on monetary policy under limited asset market participation—
Bilbiie (2008), Galı́ and Rabanal (2004), Buffie (2013), and Ascari et al. (2016)—that has centered around



                                                    2
responding textbook RA model, where these two agents are simply merged into one
household. We show, in particular, that the transmission mechanism depends greatly
on the form of the nominal rigidity. A key finding is that it is especially challenging to
make the 2-agent model generate active monetary transmission when hours are deter-
mined by the labor supply decision by workers. This is true under the baseline model
with price stickiness. Under wage stickiness, however, where workers are de facto
supplying hours mechanically over the cycle, the monetary transmission mechanism
is active and resembles that in the corresponding RANK model.
    Given the simplicity of the 2-agent model, our insights are easy to understand. In
the textbook NK models, labor is the sole factor of production. With rigidities only in
the goods market, workers respond to wages according to their labor supply curve.
With the kind of preferences used in the macroeconomic literature—those where in-
come and substitution effects cancel (see King et al. (1988))—and without profit income
accruing to workers, the income and substitution effect from changes in the wage level
cancel out.4 Consequently, changes in the wage level will not be able to affect employ-
ment, and output becomes invariant to monetary policy. This does not mean, however,
that monetary policy is neutral with respect to real variables. To the contrary, there
are strong redistributional effects. As is well-known regarding this class of models
(see, e.g., Christiano and Evans (1997)), profits respond countercyclically to monetary
policy shocks, and from our 2-agent perspective this makes capitalists poorer while
workers become richer in response to a surprise cut in the nominal interest rate. In
sum, monetary policy cannot affect output, but there are effects on the distribution of
consumption.
    In contrast, under wage rigidity, workers are constrained to supply the quantity
exploring the parameter region in which a Taylor-type monetary policy rule produces a determinate
equilibrium. These papers also study new NK models with two classes of agents, reminiscent of our
worker-capitalist model. Moreover, with different goals in mind, Walsh (2014) analyzes the impulse
responses to a richer set of shocks in a similar worker-capitalist model that also includes taxes.
   4
     The preferences in King et al. (1988) are often described as balanced-growth preferences as they deliver
a balanced growth path for all macroeconomic variables under the restriction of a constant labor supply.
Boppart and Krusell (2016) recently argue that a better approximation to the data is that hours fall at
a constant (but small) rate and offer an enlargement of balanced-growth preferences that is consistent
with this behavior and where income effects slightly outweigh substitution effects. Such preferences
would only change our main conclusions here slightly (they would actually strengthen them).



                                                     3
of labor demanded in the short run. A stronger degree of wage rigidity thus makes
employment, and hence output, more determined by the response in consumption
demand following the monetary policy shock. Consequently, the response of output
to a monetary policy shock approaches that of the representative agent model for a
sufficiently high degree of wage stickiness. Summing up, we see that the main results
of the textbook NK model with price stickiness are not robust to introducing stylized
consumer heterogeneity, but the same model with wage stickiness is; in the former,
monetary policy cannot affect output, whereas in the latter it does.
       Besides shedding light on how the transmission mechanism of monetary policy
interacts with inequality, our results also highlight what we believe is an under-appre-
ciated feature of the transmission mechanism in the standard RANK model with price
rigidities only. In particular, both the countercyclical response of profits and their
steady-state size play a key role for the employment and output response to mone-
tary policy shocks in this environment. With preferences in the King-Plosser-Rebelo
class (King et al. (1988)), it is the deviation of total income from labor income that
determines the response of labor supply. When households receive profit payments
lump-sum, such a deviation can occur: in response to an increase in goods demand
and wages, firm profits fall, making the households poorer, thus generating the re-
quired increase in labor supply that meets the higher demand. Moreover, the larger is
the steady-state profit share, the more potent is this channel.5
       The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we describe the representative-agent
and the worker-capitalist versions of the NK model. In Section 3.1 we analyze the im-
pulse responses to monetary shock under the assumption of flexible wages. In Section
3.2 we perform the same analysis under sticky wages. To make the exposition easier,
we do not allow financial trade between the worker and the capitalist in the benchmark
version of the worker-capitalist model we study. To verify that our results are robust
to adding financial trade, we redo the impulse responses under this assumption in
Section 4. Section 5 concludes.
   5
       The standard RANK model often serves as a benchmark for business cycle and policy analysis in
the NK literature (see, e.g., Lorenzoni (2009), Christiano et al. (2011), and Werning (2012)).

2        Two models

To investigate the consequences of heterogeneity for monetary policy, we will compare
the impulse-responses implied by a textbook version of the New Keynesian model to
those of a 2-agent worker-capitalist model. In this section we describe the setups for
these two models. Apart from the household sector, the models are identical in the way
firms set prices and how the central bank sets the interest rate. Since these components
are standard and well-known, we will describe them only briefly.6
        A time period should be interpreted as a quarter of a year. As for notation, if not
otherwise stated we will for any variable Xt denote its steady-state value with X̄, its
log value with xt and its log deviation from steady state with x̂t . We will refer to the
these deviations as “gaps”. It is common to describe the log-linear equilibrium in terms
of deviations from the flexible-price rather than in deviations from the steady state. In
this paper, the only source of exogenous disturbances is shocks to the nominal interest
rate, and since the model features long-run monetary neutrality, the two measures
coincide.
        We start by describing the common elements of both models, and then describe
how the models differ in the setup of the household sector.


2.1        Common elements

The final good sector. There is a representative firm that produces the final good Yt
by combining a continuum of intermediate goods Yit through the Dixit-Stiglitz aggre-
gator with elasticity of substitution p :
                                               Z     1     p −1         p−1

                                                             p
                                        Yt =              Yit       di             .                         (1)
                                                  0


The intermediate good sector.                Intermediate goods are produced by a continuum of
firms, indexed by i, with CRS technology Yit = Nit . To allow for rigid wages (con-
sidered in a later section), we assume that Nit consists of a composite of differentiated

        For a detailed exposition, see Galı́ (2009). The only deviation from Galı́ (1999) Ch. 3 is that we assume
a CRS production function whereas he assumes diminishing returns to scale. Assuming diminishing
returns to scale complicates the expressions but does not affect the response of the worker-capitalist
model to the textbook model in any meaningful way.



                                                                5

Each firm i takes the wages Wjt as given. The intermediate goods producers set their
prices to maximize expected discounted profits using the market discount factor Qt .
They can, however, only reset their prices with probability 1 − θp in every period. From
these assumptions we can derive a log-linear relationship between inflation and the
deviation of average marginal cost from steady state, that is, a Phillips curve:

                                 πtp = βEt πt+1
                                            p
                                                + λm̂ct ,                                                (3)

                                                                               (1−θp )(1−βθp )
where πtp is the inflation rate in the goods market and λ ≡                           θp
                                                                                               .   Note that
with CRS production technology, deviations in the average marginal cost equals the
deviation in the real wage level, mc
                                   ˆ t = ω̂t .


Wage evolution. There is also an accounting equation for the evolution of real wages

                                  ω̂t = ω̂t−1 + πtw − πtp ,                                              (4)

where πtw is wage inflation.


Monetary policy.     Finally, there is central bank that sets the interest rate according to
a log-linear Taylor rule:

                               it = ρ + φπ πt + φy ŷt + νt .                                            (5)


2.2    Households in the textbook model

There is a unit mass of households, indexed by j, who only differ in the type of labor
they provide. They derive utility from consuming a final good and disutility from
working and can trade using a complete set of state-contingent assets. Each household
can reset its wage with probability 1−θw each period. A resetting household in period t
chooses a wage level Wt∗ to maximize its expected discounted utility conditional on not
being able to reset this wage. The constraints the household faces includes the labor
demand function from the intermediate good sector, (7): the hours choice is not free,

                                                    6
given that the wage is set. The household also faces a budget constraint over the future
relevant to not resetting the wage: (8).7 Specifically, the optimal wage then solves

Combining and log-linearizing (9) and (10) around steady state, we find the wage infla-
tion Phillips curve

       The overall consumer problem, which considers all contingencies, i.e., how different subproblems
associated with different outcomes for the resetting process connect to each other, is specified in Erceg
et al. (2000). We refer the reader to that paper for details.

   Notice that with fully flexible wages, i.e., under θw = 0, one can log-linearize the
first-order condition (9) around the steady state to obtain

                                          ω̂t = ϕn̂t + ĉt .                                 (12)

   The first-order condition with respect to consumption in the consumer’s overall
problem furthermore yields the usual Euler equation, which log-linearized around the
steady state delivers

                               ĉt = −(it − Et πt+1 − ρ) + Et ĉt+1 ,                        (13)

2.3   Households in the worker-capitalist model

The worker-capitalist model features a unit mass of workers and a representative capi-
talist. As the words suggest, workers only have labor income and capitalists only have




                                                       8
capital income (profits).9 In this model, we thus need to restrict agents’ smoothing pos-
sibilities across dates and states in order for the analysis to fully capture heterogeneity
and in order to remain in contact with the well-known settings in the macro-inequality
literature. Markets can be restricted in several ways, however, and it is not entirely
immaterial how the analysis is carried out. We have opted for a procedure where we
first use the simplest setting allowing for meaningful analysis and then, as a robustness
check, look at a more general structure. The simplest structure is one where capitalists
have no access at all to smoothing and thus merely receive and consume profits. Work-
ers, on the other hand, can trade in a complete set of state-contingent contracts amongst
themselves. The equilibrium of this setting implies that workers’ total consumption
must also equal total labor income and that, within the worker group, there is full in-
surance. Moreover, the Euler equation is derived from workers. In the more general
setting, we consider financial trade between workers and capitalist subject to trading
costs and for costs such that there is a limited amount of active trade in response to
shocks, the results from the simpler model are not significantly different from those of
the simplest model.10 The analysis of financial trade is contained in Section 4.


Workers. The workers in the worker-capitalist model are very similar to the house-
holds in the standard model. They face the same maximization problem as does the
representative household (6), with the exception that the budget set now does not in-
   9
       The motivation for these stark assumptions is of course the very concentrated capital income (rela-
tive to labor income). The notion is thus that the simple model here is a short-cut for a more complex
Aiyagari/Huggett-style model where some agents live mostly off of labor income and a small group of
agents mostly off of capital income. The key qualitative difference is then that capitalists in such a richer
setting would also work. However, they would work relatively little given their wealth and we conjec-
ture that such a model would have similar features compared to the much more analytically tractable
model studied here.
 10
    An alternative to the simpler model would be a specification where the worker is constrained and
hand-to-mouth while allowing the capitalist to trade in the bond market. Under this assumption, how-
ever, the model does not have a determinate equilibrium under a standard Taylor rule, which would
make a comparison of the worker-capitalist model to the textbook model difficult. The problem of inde-
terminacy, in the context of a similar model that also features hand-to-mouth households, is discussed
in Bilbiie (2008).

clude profits. That is, the budget set of the workers now reads

                 Pt+k Cw,j,t+k|t + Et+k Qt+k,t+k+1 Bj,t+k+1|t ≤ Bj,t+k|t + Wt∗ Nt+k|t ,

where we use the subscript w on consumption to denote that of the worker.11 Working
with the implied maximization problem leads to a modified wage inflation Phillips
curve:

                                       πtw = βEt πt+1
                                                  w
                                                      − λw µ̂w
                                                             t ,                                      (17)

where µ̂w                             w
        t = (ω̂t − (ϕn̂t + ĉwt )) − µ . Under fully flexible wages, (17) can be replaced by

the standard intra-temporal optimization condition

                                            ω̂t = ϕn̂t + ĉwt .                                       (18)

The Euler equation, in its log-linearized version, now reads

                                 ĉwt = −(it − Et πt+1 − ρ) + Et ĉwt+1 .                             (19)


The capitalist. The capitalist receives profits and consumes them hand-to-mouth.
This way, the consumption of the capitalist simply reads

                                               Cct = Dt .                                             (20)


Market-clearing conditions. The goods market clears when

                                           Cwt + Cct = Yt ,

where Yt is total output. The state-contingent assets are in zero net supply, which
implies that
                                                Z     1

                                                  0       Pt

Log-linearizing around the steady state, we find

                                     S̄ĉwt + (1 − S̄)ĉct = ŷt ,                                    (21)

                                                          ĉwt = ω̂t + n̂t ,                          (22)

3     Impulse responses to a monetary policy shock

We now consider the implications of an innovation in the monetary policy rate in the
textbook model and the worker-capitalist model respond. We carry the comparison out
under two different parameterizations (Table 1). In the first one, we assume that wages
are fully flexible (θw = 0) and that workers have no market power (w → ∞). This
case corresponds to the simple 3-equation model presented in Galı́ (2009), Ch. 3 that is
commonly used as a benchmark in the literature. In the second parameterization, we
assume that wages are rigid. We take the parameter values from Galı́ (2009), Ch. 6, in
which the resetting probability is set to θw = 3/4 (corresponding to an average wage
spell duration of four quarters) and w = 6.

                Table 1: Parametrization of models under flexible and rigid wages




    The rest of the parameters are the same in both experiments and directly taken
from Galı́ (2009), Ch. 3. Goods market prices are rigid with p = 6 and θp = 2/3. For the
preference parameters, we set ϕ = 1 and β = 0.99. For the Taylor rule, we set φπ = 1.5
and φy = 0.125. Under both parameterizations, it is easily confirmed that the log-linear
equilibrium systems have unique stable solutions.
    For the monetary policy shock, we assume that innovations follow the process

                                            νt = ρν νt−1 + νt ,

with ρν = 0.5. We feed a positive 25 basis-point shock to the two models.

In this section, we discuss the effects of a monetary policy shock under the paramet-
ric assumptions θw = 0 and w → ∞. The impulse-response functions following the

basis-point shock in the policy rate. Left panel: standard model; right panel: worker-capitalist model.

    As can be seen in Figure 1, the textbook and worker-capitalist models give qualita-
tively very similar responses in terms of the real interest rate gap, inflation, real wages,
and profits. Thus, a part of the transmission mechanism appears very similar across
models. However, in the textbook model, there is a substantial negative output and
employment response, whereas in the worker-capitalist model, there is no response at
all in these variables.
    What explains these key findings? We start analyzing the responses in the worker-
capitalist model. Looking at the right-hand side of Figure 1, we see the standard re-
sponse to the surprise increase in the nominal interest rate: the real interest rate in-
creases. From the Euler equation (19), we then know that the worker consumption gap
must start out negative to follow an upward-sloping path. This is because the worker
responds to a downward-sloping interest rate path by moving consumption forward

                                                                       12
in time. The worker income gap must therefore follow the same path, as worker con-
sumption equals worker income in equilibrium. Hence, either wages, hours worked,
or both must initially fall. We see that only real wages fall; hours worked do not move.
       The reason for the lack of response in hours worked is our preference specification:
we use the KPR utility function, employed in most of the applied macroeconomic liter-
ature and originally proposed in King et al. (1988). These preferences are constructed
so that hours have no trend in the long run, despite wage growth, and this is accom-
plished with an interior choice of hours only if income and substitution effects cancel.
In a model where the consumer/worker only receives labor income, as in the present
setting, this insight carries over straightforwardly. Formally, insert the market-clearing
condition (22) into the intratemporal optimality condition (18):

                                   ϕñt + c̃wt = ω̃t     and   c̃wt = ω̃t + ñt

                            ⇒      ϕñt + ω̃t + ñt = ω̃t

                            ⇔      ñt = 0.

Clearly, regardless of the Frisch elasticity, hours will not change.12 Since hours worked
are unresponsive, the fall in worker consumption matches the fall in wages. Because
wages fall, so does the marginal cost of production, which leads to a fall in inflation and
an increase in profits. The countercyclical response of profits, however, has no effect
on equilibrium output since it is directly consumed by the hand-to-mouth capitalists.
Notice, finally, that although aggregate consumption is unaffected by monetary policy,
its distribution is: in response to a higher interest rate, the consumption of workers
falls and that of capitalists increases.
       Having explained the responses in the worker-capitalist model, it is now easy to
understand the responses in the textbook model. As in the worker-capitalist model,
the real interest rate gap increases, which leads to a fall in the consumption gap. There
is also a fall in the real wage gap and an increase in the profit gap. However, hours
worked and the output gap now decrease. To explain this, we again insert the market-
  12
       With the slightly larger preference class derived in Boppart and Krusell (2016) and a parameter
restriction implying that hours fall over the long run if wages grow, we would see hours rise in response
to a drop in wages. Thus, a monetary policy tightening would make output go up, and hence make the
transmission mechanism in the 2-agent model even more different than that in the textbook model.

clearing condition (15) into the intratemporal optimality condition (12):

                      ϕñt + c̃t = ω̃t     and    c̃t = S̄(ω̃t + ñt ) + (1 − S̄)d˜t

                ⇒     ϕñt + S̄(ω̃t + ñt ) + (1 − S̄)d˜t = ω̃t
                            1 − S̄
                ⇔     ñt =         (ω̃t − d˜t ).                                              (23)
                            ϕ + S̄

Equation (23) allows us to make two related observations: hours can respond and the
                                                                                       1−S̄
size of the response depends on the steady-state labor share. In particular,           ϕ+S̄
                                                                                              is de-
                                   W̄ N̄
creasing in the labor share S̄ =   Ȳ P̄
                                           on the unit interval and equals 0 when S̄ = 1. If
the labor share is 100 percent, KPR preferences imply that hours worked are unrespon-
sive to monetary policy. When the labor share is less then 100 percent, the response of
total income can potentially deviate from the response of labor income and so hours
worked become responsive as well. The magnitude of the response is determined by
how much the response of profits deviates from the response of real wages. To gen-
erate a response in output consistent with the path of the nominal interest rate and
inflation, profits necessarily become countercyclical.
   Intuitively, the increase in profits makes the representative household choose to
work less: an income (wealth) effect. The effect is naturally decreasing in the steady-
state profit share, which is about 17 percent in our parameterization. Moreover, the
wage change has a direct effect on hours worked now since the worker also receives
profit income, thus making the substitution effect stronger than the income effect. The
fall in wages thus depress hours from this perspective as well.
   The textbook model is thus capable of generating negative responses of employ-
ment and output to a positive innovation in the policy rate because 1) the households
that supply labor also receive profit income and 2) because profit income responds less
procyclically than do wages (in fact, the former is countercyclical in the model whereas
the latter is procyclical). Although logically clear, this transmission mechanism does
not seem empirically well grounded for two reasons. The first is the one emphasized
here: few households have substantial non-labor income (see Table 2) and hence one
would not expect workers to be much affected by movements in profits.
   The second reason is that already pointed to in the literature: profits are strongly
procyclical, not countercyclical, in the data and the available evidence is also that
they fall after a monetary policy tightening (see Christiano and Eichenbaum (2005)).

Thus, although the 3-equation textbook NK model offers very intuitive reduced-form
responses to monetary policy that are aligned with intuition, the transmission mech-
anism whereby this is achieved is very hard to justify empirically. Fortunately, as we
shall see, the rigid-wage model performs much better.


3.2     Impulse responses under rigid wages

In this section, we discuss the effects of a monetary policy shock under the paramet-
ric assumptions θw = 3/4 and w = 6 while maintaining sticky prices parameterized
as before. The impulse-response functions following the monetary policy shocks are
plotted in Figure 2.
    Before comparing the responses of the textbook and worker-capitalist model, we
discuss how adding wage rigidities changes the impulse responses in the textbook
model by comparing the left-hand side of Figure 2 to the left-hand side of Figure 1.
Adding wage rigidities with θw = 3/4 to the textbook model changes the magnitude
of the responses in several variables. Notably, it almost eliminates the response in real
wages, as well as making the response of profits procyclical. The reason is that with
rigid wage setting, nominal wages respond very little to the shock. Hence, nominal
marginal costs of the intermediate goods firms respond only little. As a consequence,
the response of inflation is also muted, but still sufficiently strong to almost completely
close the real wage gap. As the real wage gap is almost zero, the movement of profits is
solely determined by the movement in output, and thus profits respond procyclically.
    Turning to the comparison between the textbook and the worker-capitalist model,
we see that the responses to the monetary shock are almost indistinguishable. With an

average wage resetting duration of 4 quarters, the income and substitution effects mat-
ter less for the determination of hours worked at the shorter horizon. The majority of
households (workers) are instead constrained to supply whatever labor is demanded
from equation (7). Labor demand follows directly from consumption demand, as la-
bor is the sole factor of production. In the textbook model, aggregate consumption
demand follows from the real interest rate. And since profits constitute a small share
of total income in the steady state (close to 17 percent) and respond procyclically, ag-
gregate consumption demand in the worker-capitalist model behaves similar to that in
the textbook model.
    Assuming rigid wages thus seems to offer a solution to the implausible transmis-
sion mechanism in the textbook 3-equation model. In fact, the difference between
the textbook and the worker-capitalist model is decreasing in θw , which means that
strength of this solution is increasing in the degree of wage rigidities. Whether the ac-
tual economies feature substantially rigid wage setting at the business cycle frequency
is an empirical question that we do not evaluate here. At the very least, however, in
light of our findings, to have accurate measures of the degree of rigidities in the labor

                                                                     16
market seems important for generating a plausible transmission mechanism with this
class of models.



4    Robustness: financial trade

In the setup of the worker-capitalist model, we did not allow for financial trade be-
tween the workers and the representative capitalist. We made this assumption for
reasons of tractability. In this section, we show that this model can be seen as an ap-
proximation to a model where the capitalist is allowed to trade a risk-free bond with
the workers.
    Without further assumptions, allowing the capitalist to trade in the bond market
implies that the model becomes non-stationary. In response to a surprise increase in
the nominal interest rate, we have seen that the response of real wages (when the nom-
inal wage is fully flexible) is negative while the response of profits is positive. In equi-
librium, the workers will therefore become indebted to the capitalist when allowing
trade in bonds. The consumption-smoothing motive makes this indebtedness perma-
nent, so that the capitalist has permanently higher consumption than the worker in
response to the shock. Hence, linearization around a given steady state does not of-
fer a way of analyzing the effects of shocks. To maintain stationarity when allowing
for financial trade in the model we therefore assume that the capitalist faces quadratic
bond-holding costs, which ensures that the capitalist holds zero financial wealth in the
long-run equilibrium. This assumption is commonly used to close two-country inter-
national macroeconomic models; see, e.g., Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2003).
    Thus, we change the capitalist problem described in Section 2 to

                                                2

As stated, in the steady state we construct, B̄ct = 0. Thus, if we log-linearizing around
the flexible-price equilibrium, we find that

                                    S̄c̃wt + (1 − S̄)c̃ct = ỹt                                     (25)

                                                     c̃wt = ω̃t + ñt .                             (26)

The rest of the worker-capitalist model is unaffected.
       We have one more parameter to calibrate now: ζ. Changes in the value of ζ have a
larger impact on the aggregate responses when wages are flexible, with a countercycli-
cal response in capital income and a procyclical response in wage income. We calibrate
ζ focusing on this case. With higher values of ζ, there is naturally less trade in bonds
in equilibrium, converging to no trade as ζ → ∞; this limit case mimics the worker-
capitalist model in Section 2. At the other extreme, when ζ = 0, the model coincides
with the standard representative-agent setting. We thus focus on an intermediate case,
with ζ = 4, implying small amounts of intertemporal trade. For this case, the response
to a 25 basis-point monetary policy shock amounts to a peak for the debt-to-GDP ratio
                      13
of 0.099 percent.
       We feed in the same monetary shock as in the previous section. The impulse re-
sponses are plotted side by side with the responses in the worker-capitalist model
without financial trade in Figure 3 and 4, for the parameterizations without and with
rigid wage setting respectively.
       As seen, the two models behave very similarly under flexible as well as rigid wages.
In the case of rigid wages this is natural, since we have already seen that the worker-
capitalist model without financial trade behaves very similarly to textbook model. In
the case of flexible wages, the similarity might be more surprising. However, because
the adjustment costs limits the response of the debt-to-income ratio to 10 percent of
GDP, worker consumption is still close to labor income every period. Hence, the deter-
mination of labor supply is similar to that in the model without financial trade. That is,
  13
       For near-zero adjustment costs, as pointed out above, debt-to-GDP responses are extremely persis-
tent. For the case we report on here, convergence rates are much faster and the debt-to-GDP ratio is back
to (very close to) steady state within less than three years.

workers do not experience the positive income effect coming from the increase in prof-
its and hence the income and substitution effects are still approximately of the same
size, so that the responses of hours worked and output are close to zero.

5     Concluding remarks

In this paper, we have discussed how income heterogeneity affects the impulse re-
sponses to a monetary shock in the New Keynesian framework. We have done so
under two different assumptions regarding the source of nominal frictions. Our main
conclusion from this analysis is twofold: (i) the benchmark textbook NK model is not
robust to the introduction of stark and real world-like inequality; but (ii) the textbook
NK model with added wage rigidity does show robustness. In the process, we also
uncovered that the representative-agent model with only price stickiness, though al-
lowing a reduced-form link from monetary policy to output that seems plausible, relies
on a transmission mechanism that is implausible: in response to a lowering of the pol-
icy rate, profits fall, making workers poorer and hence enticing them to work harder.
    In this concluding section, we briefly comment on how consumer heterogeneity of
the kind considered here has other implications as well. In particular, we study the
impulse responses to TFP shocks. After that, we discuss some possible directions for

future research.
       Let us thus first comment on TFP shocks. Galı́ (1999) has argued that the response
of a TFP shock in the textbook NK model serves as an argument in favor of that model
compared to the standard real business cycle (RBC) model. Specifically, the former
generates a drop in hours worked in response to a positive innovation in TFP, while the
later generates an increase. The response of hours to TFP shocks in the data has been
subject to debate, but a number of studies find that hours fall in response to a positive
productivity shock: Galı́ (1999); Francis and Ramey (2005); Basu et al. (2006). This Galı́
(1999) interprets as evidence in favor of the NK and against the RBC framework.14
       Investigating the response of hours worked to a TFP shocks in the worker-capitalist
model can help us understand what drives the response in the standard NK model.
Without rigid wages, KPR preferences imply that hours are constant also under TFP
shocks.15 So why do hours fall in the standard NK model? When productivity in-
creases in that standard model, both wages and profits respond procyclically. Higher
wages affect hours worked positively, as the substitution effect dominates the income
effect, while the higher level of profits weighs in negatively on hours through the
wealth effect they imply. On net, hours fall in the standard model because the latter ef-
fect dominates. This mechanism seems implausible as only few households have sub-
stantial non-labor income in their budget set. Because we find this transmission mech-
anism implausible, we are correspondingly skeptical toward the mechanism through
which the standard NK model generates a countercyclical response of hours to TFP
shocks. Rigid wages would, however, change the picture here as well.
       Our main claims of this paper are of course confined to a specific class of NK mod-
els. It can thus turn out that representative-agent NK (RANK) models that only have
stickiness in prices but that include other features not considered here lead to less im-
plausible transmission channels. Obvious such features include physical capital, in-
vestment adjustment costs, and consumption habits. However, those other features
are then crucial for the transmission mechanism and should therefore be in focus also
in textbooks, in our view. Thus, the textbook RANK model with only price stickiness
  14
       However, Lindé (2009) argues that the RBC model also can generate falling hours in response to a
positive TFP shock, namely, when allowing for a persistent shock to the growth rate of TFP.

must at best be interpreted with great caution. In contrast, the textbook RANK model
with sticky prices and wages performs well from the perspective studied here, but of
course this conclusion too is subject to the caveat that richer RANK models with wage
rigidity may not inherit this property. For all these reasons, we would welcome further
investigation into 2-agent versions of richer NK models.
   Obviously, we are also interested in the performance of full-fledged models of in-
equality of the Aiyagari/Huggett kind and indeed the motivation behind the present
paper was to help this kind of research along by focusing on specific challenges that
need to be addressed. It can, of course, be that the richer inequality settings per se help
resolve the difficulty facing the NK model with price rigidity only. Investigations in
this direction, i.e., of “true” HANK models, are obviously on the agenda of a number
of other researchers and they are on our agenda too.
