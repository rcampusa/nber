                                                ABSTRACT

        We examine resource allocation in step-households, in the United States and South Africa, to test
whether child investments vary according to economic and genetic bonds between parent and child. We
used 18 years of data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and compare food expenditure by family
type, holding constant household size, age composition and income. We find that in those households in
which a child is raised by an adoptive, step or foster mother, less is spent on food. We cannot reject the
hypothesis that the effect of replacing a biological child with a non-biological child is the same, whether the
non-biological child is an adoptive, step or foster child of the mother. In South Africa, where we can
disaggregate food consumption more finely, we find that when a child’s biological mother is the head or
spouse of the head of household, the household spends significantly more on food, in particular on milk and
fruit and vegetables, and significantly less on tobacco and alcohol. The genetic tie to the child, and not any
anticipated future economic tie, appears to be the tie that binds.

        Family living arrangements have changed dramatically in the United States in a generation.

Children in the middle of the century were, on the whole, born to married parents, with whom they lived

until adulthood. In the U.S. today, over half of all children will live apart from at least one parent before

reaching age 18 (Bumpass and Sweet 1989), and a majority of these children will live with a step

parent or foster parent.

        Until recently, most academics were not very concerned about changes in children’s family

structures. During the 1970s, single parenthood was viewed as a time of transition (Ross and Sawhill

1975) between divorce and remarriage, and step families were considered to be good substitutes for

original two-parent families. Since the 1980s, however, several developments have challenged this

optimistic view. First, declines in remarriage have lead to extended periods of high poverty for single

mothers and their children, undermining the notion that single parenthood is a time of transition.

        Second, a growing body of research has shown that children raised by only one of their parents

are less successful than children raised by both their parents, when measured across a broad array of

outcomes. Although some of these disadvantages are due to characteristics of the parents that predate

divorce, there is mounting evidence that parent-absence itself plays at least some causal role in reducing

children’s life chances. (McLanahan and Sandefur 1994, Haveman and Wolfe 1994). A primary

mechanism behind the negative association between parent absence and low achievement appears to

be poverty and economic insecurity, which accompany family disruption and have long term negative

consequences for children (Duncan and Brooks-Gunn 1996).

        Finally, and perhaps most surprisingly, many studies have shown that remarriage is not a

                                                      1
panacea. Children who grow up in two-parent families consisting of a biological parent and a step

parent have outcomes that more closely resemble those of children who grow up with only one parent

than those of children raised by both their biological parents. Numerous studies show that children

raised in step families are less successful, on average, than children raised by two biological parents

(McLanahan and Sandefur 1994, Amato and Keith 1991, Hetherington, Bridges and Insabella 1998,

Cherlin and Furstenberg 1994). Children in step families are more likely to have academic problems,

less likely to finish high school, less likely to attend college, and less likely to complete college than

children in intact families. Children raised in step families also exhibit more behavioral problems

(externalizing and internalizing), and they have more trouble finding and keeping a steady job. Girls from

step families leave home earlier, become sexually active sooner, and are more likely to become teen

mothers than girls from families with two biological parents. Finally, children from step families have

poorer mental health and report more problems with relationships in adulthood than children from intact

families. The size of these effects ranges from modest to moderate, and they are surprisingly consistent

across different racial and ethnic groups and different social classes. Male and females are similarly

disadvantaged by step family life, although in some instances girls react more negatively to stepfathers

than boys. These differences are not attributable to differences in income across family type, since step

and original two-parent families have very similar levels of income.

        There may be several reasons why children in two-parent step families fare poorly. First,

stepchildren may have been scarred by their biological parents’ separation or divorce. Stress and

conflict, which undermine the quality of parenting, occur more often in step families than in original two

parent families, especially in newly formed families (Hetherington et al. 1998). Residential movement,

                                                       2
which cuts community ties and reduces social capital, also occurs more often in step families. Further,

parental supervision and discipline are weaker, in part because of higher levels of stress, conflict, and

residential movement.

        Step families may also choose to invest less in children, which may also lead to poorer school

performance, labor market attachment, and life chances. Step parents may not expect to receive

transfers of money or time from step children in later life, and may therefore refuse to invest as heavily in

non-biological children. (For an excellent summary of this literature, see Bergstrom 1997.) A

complementary explanation is that step parents may not care about sustaining someone else’s genetic

line, and may for this reason invest less heavily in non-biological children.

        If one had information only on whether a child were the ‘biological’ offspring of a parent, it

would not be possible to identify economic motives for investment—based on anticipated future returns

of time and money—from biological motives. This paper will separate these effects by identifying

different types of non-biological relationships which are thought to carry differing degrees of economic

attachment, but identical amounts of genetic attachment. We use data from two parts of the world, the

United States and South Africa, to examine whether expenditures on an important input in the

production of child outcomes—food—vary according to the economic and genetic bonds between

parent and child. We find, comparing food expenditure by family type, holding constant household size,

age composition and income, that in those households in which a child is raised by an adoptive, step or

foster mother, less is spent on food. In South Africa, where we can disaggregate food consumption

more finely, we find that when a child’s biological mother is the head or spouse of the head of

household, the household spends significantly more on food, in particular on milk and fruit and

                                                      3
vegetables, and significantly less on tobacco and alcohol. The genetic tie to the child, and not any

anticipated future economic tie, appears to be the tie that binds.

1. Investments in Children

         Although we know a good deal about the outcomes associated with living in a step family, we

know very little about the inputs into these outcomes. We do not know, for example, whether step

parents are as willing as biological parents to invest in children. Although no one has examined this

question directly, there is some indirect evidence. That children in step families are less likely to attend

college even after controlling for differences in test scores and family income suggests that stepparents

may be less willing to subsidize college expenses (Krein and Beller 1988, McLanahan and Sandefur

1994).

         Economists often motivate the time and money parents invest in children using intrahousehold

allocation models in which parents reach some consensus decision about investments to be made in

each child, subject to a budget constraint. (See Becker and Tomes 1976 and Behrman et al. 1982.

Behrman 1997 provides an extensive review of this literature.) It is often assumed that parents care

equally about each child’s welfare (a point we will return to below). In this case of “neutrality” or “equal

concern” for children, differences in investments may be the result of differences in children’s

endowments—by which is generally meant the predetermined factors that may or may not interact with

investments made in the child, but which affect a child’s earnings. Parents may invest differentially in

children in a way that reinforces differences in their endowments, or they may compensate children with

lower endowments (to equalize marginal utility of money, for example), depending on the preferences

for equity and efficiency underlying the parents’ utility function. If step children systematically differed

                                                       4
from biological children in endowments, one might expect to see, in equilibrium, differences in the

resources invested in step children. However, as we will see below, to reconcile the differences in

investments made in the non-biological children with a simple endowment explanation, it must be the

case that on average all non-biological children of the adult woman in the household have equal

endowment deficits.

        Alternatively, if non-biological children systematically receive a lower level of investment, it may

be because the assumption of child neutrality breaks down. Possibly parents care more about children

with whom they believe they will share time and money in the future. If parental investments were

predicated on some expected future return, then we might see investments mirroring the bond the

parents have with each child. In this case, it would seem likely that non-biological children who are

expected to be closest to parents (say, adopted children) may be invested in more heavily than children

with whom the bond is thought to be less strong (foster children). Step-children might be thought to be

somewhere in between adopted children and foster children on a spectrum of attachment. Step-children

may be close to their step-parents, but may have multiple sets of parents, reducing the anticipated per-

parent return on a given investment of time or money.

        Child neutrality may break down, not because parents are concerned about a future return of

time and money, but because parents are concerned with protecting their genetic material. Hamilton

(1964a,b) hypothesizes that the level of altruism between two people should depend upon the

coefficient of their genetic ‘relatedness.’ Dawkins (1976), presenting work by Trivers (1972),

describes parental investment as “any investment by the parent in an individual offspring that increases

the offspring’s chance of surviving (and hence reproductive success) at the cost of the parent’s ability to

                                                     5
invest in other offspring.” [Dawkins, p. 133] (See also Trivers (1985).)

        There is a great deal of evidence on animals discriminating in favor of their own. For example,

Blaffer Hrdy (1977), discussing social structure and family care among langurs, observes that “though

females do not normally allow another female’s offspring to nurse, her own older offspring may return

and suckle from time to time after the birth of a new sibling. Even if the female’s own offspring has died

or is not nursing at the time, she may refuse to allow a substitute to suckle.” [Blaffer Hrdy, p. 88]

        Drawing on evidence from evolutionary biology, Daly and Wilson (1987) present numerous

examples from bird and primate studies to show that this practice of parental solicitude is common,

and that the ability to identify own offspring coincides with the potential for mixing broods. Where

breeding conditions allow for early nest leaving, for example, the capacity to identify one’s own eggs or

offspring develops early. Where conditions promote late nest leaving or where mixing is not a problem,

the ability to discriminate is delayed or does not occur. If eggs (or chicks) are deliberately switched

prior to the onset of the discriminatory facility, the parent bird will protect the foreign egg (chick). If

eggs (chicks) are switched after the onset of discriminatory power, the parent bird will refuse to care

for the foreign egg (chick) (Beecher, Beecher and Hahn, 1981.)

        In discussion of human behavior, Daly and Wilson note that stepparents, driven by “mating

effort,” may care for the child of another. However, they provide evidence that child abuse and child

homicide are significantly correlated with the presence of a stepparent. This cannot be attributable to

poverty, or to family size; incomes and family size are not significantly different between step and natural

parent households. The age of the mother is a predictor of abuse, and this does vary between these

types of households, but Daly and Wilson suggest that the effect of maternal age is not large enough to

                                                       6
explain the differences found. They note that “no confounding of step-relationships with chronic

dispositional or personality variables can explain the excess risk, since abusive stepparents are almost

always discriminative, abusing only the stepchildren while sparing their natural offspring within the same

household.” [Daly and Wilson, p. 123].

        In what follows, we distinguish economic motives to invest, based on reciprocity in the future,

from biological motives to invest, based on promotion of one’s own gene pool, by identifying separately

biological, step, adopted and foster children. If biology were the only phenomenon at work, we should

expect to see no difference in the treatment of all non-biological children, while if economic reciprocity

were the determining factor, we would expect differences based on anticipated future attachment.

2. Evidence From the United States

        Our data from the United States come from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID),

which contains information on all dyadic relationships within households between 1968 and 1985,

allowing us to identify different parent-child relationships, including biological, adoptive, step, and foster

relationships. We limit our analysis to this period in order to ensure that we have the most accurate

relationship information possible. In order to isolate the impact of family structure, we restrict our

attention to two-parent households. Food expenditure information was not collected in the PSID in

1973, which leaves us with seventeen years of food expenditure data over the period 1968 to 1985. A

detailed description of our data is presented in Appendix One.

        Table 1 presents information for all children in the file over this period, in column one, and for

children in two-parent households for whom the relationship between child and parent is known for

every child in the household, in columns two and three. It is the latter set of households that we analyze

                                                      7
below. We present information separately for the PSID-SRC two-parent sample 1 in column 2, and for

the PSID-SEO sample, which includes an original oversample of households in poverty, in column 3.

Our results are robust to the inclusion/exclusion of the SEO sample. The vast majority of children in our

two-parent sample live with both biological parents (90 percent), with the next largest group being

those who live with one biological and one step parent (5 percent in the SRC sample, 7 percent in the

SEO sample).

        There may be many relationships between children and adults living under one roof at any given

time. For example, if a woman marries a man who has custody of a biological child from a previous

relationship, and the man and woman subsequently have a child together, the younger child will be living

with two biological parents, and the older child will be living with a biological father and step-mother.

PSID food expenditure data are available only at the household level, and our estimation strategy must

be able to account for all of the relationships that exist simultaneously within each household. To

accomplish this, in our regression analysis we control for the number of children in the household and,

separately, for the number of children with a step mother in the household, the number with an adoptive

mother, and the number with a foster mother (the number with a biological mother will be the omitted

category). The same holds for fathers: we control separately for the number of children with an step,

adoptive, and foster father.

        We provide information about households, stratified by household type, in Table 2. This table

presents mean characteristics for households in which at least one child has a biological mother (column

                                                     8
one), independent of the total number of children in the household; for households in which at least one

child has an adoptive mother (column two); at least one child has a step-mother (column three); or at

least one child has a foster mother (columns four and five). In the example given above, a household

with one child living with his biological mother and one with his step mother, the household’s descriptive

information would enter the averages in columns one and three of Table 2.

        In all of our analysis, foster parents are divided into two types. The PSID allows an adult to

identify him- or herself as helping to raise a child in the household. Such an adult is identified by the

PSID as a “foster parent” if the adult is living with, but not married to, the biological, step or adoptive

parent of that child. We label this type of child fostering as “type-1” fostering, and distinguish it from

those cases in which both parents are foster parents, which we refer to as “type-2” foster parents.

        Household size, composition and characteristics vary with family structure. On average,

households with step-mothers are larger, with roughly four-tenths of an extra household member (4.55

versus 4.12), relative to households with biological mothers. The extra household member tends to be a

child—on average there are 2.55 children in step-mother households, versus 2.11 in biological mother

households—and, in particular, an older child. (There are 0.40 extra children aged 13 to 18 in step-

mother households, relative to the case of biological mothers). Step-mothers are quite a bit younger

than biological mothers (31.6 versus 34.9 years old). This is true even though the head of household is

on average the same age in these two types of households (37.9 versus 37.7 years old). Step-mothers

work more hours than do biological mothers (1117 hours annually compared to 732), and the total

household income in step-mother households is markedly higher ($40222 in 1982 dollars, relative to

$33510 for biological mother households). In summary, households where at least one child lives with a

                                                       9
step-mother have on average higher household incomes, younger mothers who work a greater number

of hours, and more teenage children, than do households with biological mothers. Some of these factors

would tend to lead to greater food consumption at home (higher income, more teen-aged children), and

some to lower food consumption at home (mothers who work more hours).

        In our regression analysis, we include controls for a wide range of household characteristics that

may determine food expenditures and that may vary between household types. These include

information on total household income; the hours worked annually by the head and wife; indicators that

the household head has less than a high school degree, that the head has exactly a high school degree,

and that the head is white; age of the household head and wife; the value of the household’s food

stamps; household’s size, size squared and size cubed; information on the children in the household, in

total and by age category (0-5, 6-12, 13-18); and the information on child-parent relationships

discussed above.




2.1 Estimation

To inform our regression analysis, we ran locally weighted (Fan) regressions of food expenditure

against total household income, separately by households with differing numbers of children. The results

are presented in Figure One, where we see food expenditure increasing, possibly at a decreasing rate,

with total household income. An increase in the number of children shifts the intercept of the food

expenditure-income relationship, but does not appear to influence its slope. In what follows, we regress

home food expenditure on total household income and its square, and the number of children in the

household, and the number of children by age category, together with information on household family

                                                    10
relationships.

        Table 3 presents our results for the PSID. The dependent variable in columns 1 through 4 is

total expenditure on food consumed at home, including food stamps, in real (1982) dollars. All

regressions presented in the paper estimate robust standard errors that allow for correlation in the

residuals of observations that share the same Family Interview Number (FIN) for 1968. (These will be

households that branched from the same original household surveyed in 1968.)

        The first eight rows provide information on the importance of household structure. Because we

control for the number of children in the household and, separately, for the number of children of each

type, the coefficients on household structure have a straightforward interpretation. The coefficients on

adoptive, step and foster children of the mother answer the question: holding constant the number of

children in the household, by how much on average would expenditure on food be expected to change

if a biological child of the mother were replaced by an adopted (or step or foster) child? In each case,

the results in Table 3 suggest that food expenditure at home would be decreased by roughly

$200—about five percent of the average food budget. Moreover, the results in column 2 say that we

cannot reject the hypothesis that the effect of replacing a biological child with a non-biological child is

the same, whether the non-biological child is an adoptive, step or foster child of the mother. (An F-test

of constraining the coefficients to be the same for different types of non-biological children of the

mother is small and insignificant, F=0.29, with a p-value of 0.8298). These results are robust to

estimating the food expenditure equation for the SRC and SEO samples jointly (columns 3 and 4).

        We find no robust pattern for non-biological children of the (male) household head. Replacing a

biological child with an adopted child of the head results in an insignificant increase in spending on food,

                                                      11
while replacing a biological child with a step child results in an insignificant decrease in spending on

food. For the household head, only replacement with a foster child results in a significant decrease in

expenditure on food.

        Although step mothers work on average more hours than do biological mothers, our results are

robust to inclusion (exclusion) of controls for mother’s hours of work. Each of the regressions reported

in Table 3 include an indicator that mother does not work (which has a positive and significant effect on

home food consumption); mothers hours of work (which has a negative and significant effect on home

food consumption); and mothers hours of work interacted with an indicator variable that she works

between 0 and 800 hours per year, and mothers hours of work interacted with an indicator that she

works between 800 and 1400 hours per year (neither of which has a significant effect on home food

consumption).

        A check on our results is provided by analyzing whether family structure influences expenditure

on food away from home. If the family structure variables were simply picking up income effects, then

we would expect to see a similar pattern for food expenditure away from home. Alternatively, if non-

biological children have a preference for eating out, we may be picking up differences in tastes if we

look only at food consumed at home. Results for spending on food away from home are presented in

columns 5 and 6 and show a very different pattern from that seen for food at home. The family

relationship coefficients are small and insignificant. It does not appear that family structure variables are

picking up income effects. Neither does it appear that mothers with non-biological children are

spending more money on food away from home.

        We have done additional robustness checks on the results that appear in Table 3. In one test,

                                                      12
we limited the sample to households with eight or fewer children; in another, to households with

incomes less than $100,000; and in a third test, to the period 1972-85 because, in the earliest years of

the PSID, it was not clear whether households were answering food expenditure questions net of their

food stamp purchases. We have also compared our results to ones obtained if the sample is limited to

households with biological and/or step children only. The results presented here are robust to all of

these checks.

         The results in Table 3 cannot be explained by step and foster children eating more meals away

from home with absent biological parents. If that were the explanation, we should expect to find no

reduction in food expenditure for adopted children, and we should expect to find a significant effect for

the head’s step children.

         We take two results away from Table 3. The relationship between the woman in the household

(who traditionally would be buying the household’s groceries) and the children in her household plays a

decisive role in the household food budget. Non-biological children of the mother appear to reduce

spending on food significantly, regardless of the type of non-biological tie that binds the mother to the

child.

         While we can say with some certainty that a woman’s relationship to the children in her

household has an effect on food spending in the United States, we cannot pinpoint where the reductions

occur. It is possible that less food spending has positive effects on children, if the spending forgone

were, say, on sugars and fats.

         As a test of the robustness of our results we turn to South Africa. In these data, we are able not

only to test the relationship between family structure and food expenditure, but also to learn more about

                                                     13
where reductions in the food budget occur.

3. Evidence from South Africa

        In South Africa, the economic and political ‘logic’ of the apartheid system led to the geographic

separation of Africans from places of employment (primarily White farms and mines). This forced

Africans to participate in a migrant labor system that separated parents from children for long periods of

time. In South Africa today roughly 20 percent of African children aged 0 to 18 live apart from their

biological mothers, and half live apart from their biological fathers.2

        To assess the impact of living apart from biological mothers, we analyze data from the 1995

South African Income and Expenditure Survey, a nationally representative household expenditure

survey collected as a companion to the annual October Household Survey. This is a large and rich data

set; expenditure data were collected from 29595 households, with complete household income

information available for 20695 of those households. Under the apartheid system, people were

classified as belonging to one of four racial groups: African (also called Black), Coloured, Indian (also

called Asian) and White. We restrict our attention to African and Coloured households, because

Whites and Asians are economically so much more advantaged and socially so different from Africans

and Coloureds. Median White household income per capita is roughly five times that for an African

household.3 Roughly one third of all African households are three generation or “skip” generation

households, the latter referring to grandparents raising grandchildren with both parents absent. Only

three percent of White households are three or skip-generation households.4 We have complete

expenditure, income and education data for 18433 African and Coloured households, and it is this set

of households we analyze below.

        These data provide detailed information on household consumption, but they are not as specific

in the information they provide on dyads within the household. We know if a child’s biological mother is

present in the household, and whether she is the spouse or head of household, and we use this

information in what follows. In South Africa, one would expect a woman who is head or spouse of

head of household to control expenditures on food, and it will prove important to distinguish between a

mother who is simply present and one who controls the household budget.

        Table 4 provides information on the household characteristics of children living with their

biological mothers, when the mothers are either head or spouse of the head of household (column 1);

when mothers are present, but not head or spouse (column 2); and when mothers are not present

(column 3). Households in which a child’s mother is head or spouse tend to have fewer children, and

fewer members overall. If a woman is not head or spouse of head, it is most likely that she is living with

her husband’s family (generally his parents), in which case we would expect to find more adults in the

household and, on average, older adults, which has the effect of increasing the age of the household

head. In our regression analysis, we control for household characteristics that may be correlated with

household structure, including household income and income squared, household size and age

composition, in addition to a full set of province indicators, age of the household head, age of the head

squared, indicators that the head is African and the head is male, and a full set of indicators for

maximum years of completed education among household members.

        Regression results for South Africa are presented in Table 5, where we present results for

expenditure on food at home, in total and by category for milk, cheese and eggs; fruit and nuts; jams

and sugars; vegetables; and cereals. We control for the number of children aged 0-5, 6-12 and 13-18,

and separately for the number of children aged 0-5, 6-12, and 13-18 with a biological mother present.

The coefficient on the number of biological children reflects the amount by which expenditure on the

good would be expected to change, holding all else constant, if a non-biological child in this age group

were replaced by a biological child. Overall spending on food would increase on average by roughly

seven rand (about 2 percent), if a biological child aged 0-5 were to replace a non-biological child in the

same age group. We can discern what this expenditure goes toward, by looking at expenditure groups

separately. Two extra rand are spent on milk, cheese and eggs, increasing the budget on dairy products

by roughly 6 percent. One extra rand is spent on fruit and nuts (an 8 percent increase). One and a

quarter extra rand is spent on jams and sugars, and one and a half on vegetables.

        Table 5 also shows that when young children live with their biological mothers, the household

spends significantly less on tobacco (about 5 percent less), less on alcohol (about 15 percent less), and

more on infant and children’s clothing and footwear. For children aged 6 to 12, the presence of the

child’s biological mother is also positively and significantly correlated with expenditure on education.

        Table 6 distinguishes biological mothers who are the head or spouse of head of household from

those who are not, in order to test whether the correlation between mothers’ presence and expenditure

patterns is due to mothers’ decisions to spend more on the children, or some other factor. When

                                                     16
women live with their husbands’ parents, they tend to have less voice in spending decisions. If the

increased spending we observe in Table 5 is attributable to mothers’ decisions, the increased spending

on biological children should be more pronounced when the mother is head or spouse. The results in

Table 6 are consistent with this argument: it is not a mother’s presence, but her control over resources,

that leads to greater spending on food for her biological children. The results observed in Table 5 are

more pronounced for almost every spending category for biological mothers who are heads or spouses

of heads. In constrast, in those households in which a child’s biological mother is present, but is not

head or spouse, resource allocation is not significantly different from what it is in households where the

child’s biological mother is not present at all. We take this finding as further evidence that the spending

on biological children is an active response of the child’s mother.

        Results in Tables 5 and 6 also suggest that it is the youngest children in the household for whom

a biological mother’s resource control appears to have the most important effect. By the time children

are teenagers, biological and non-biological children do not have significantly different effects on

resource allocation. We return to the PSID in Table 7, and find the same pattern there. In a

specification similar to that used for South Africa in Table 5, we find that the presence of a child’s

biological mother increases food spending for children aged 0-5 and 6-12. By age 13, whether the

child is the biological or non-biological child of the woman in the household appears not to affect

resource allocation.




4. Conclusions

        The presence of a child’s biological mother appears to increase expenditure on an important

                                                     17
input into the production of healthy children—food. In South Africa, the presence of a child’s biological

mother increases expenditure, in particular, on healthy foods. The benefits are limited to households in

which mothers have control over food expenditure, and they are limited to children in the youngest age

groups. In this way, biological mothers protect their offspring during the children’s most vulnerable

years.

A.1 Identifying parent-child relationships in the PSID

In order to identify children who lived with biological parents, adoptive parents, step parents, or foster
parents during the years between 1968 and 1985, we adopted the following steps:

Step 1.

We downloaded the 1968-1985 Relationship file (file name: 85relhis.dat, created on 7/10/96) from the
PSID web site (http://www.isr.umich.edu/src/psid/). The Relationship file contains information about
the relationships, on a pair-wise basis, of all individuals who were ever part of, or derived from, the
same original 1968 household. In total, the Relationship file contains 426,608 pairs of the relationship
over the 18 years, from 1968 to 1985.

Step 2.

The 1968-1985 Relationship file contains two sources of information about the relationships between
parent and child. One is the 1985 Marital and Childbirth History file (HIS); the other is the 1968-1985
Relationship-to-Head file (RTH). We identified all individuals who were ever a biological, adoptive,
step, or foster child during the years from 1968 to 1985 using the information from the HIS file. If the
information is missing on the HIS file but not on the RTH file, we used the RTH file information. If the
information on the HIS file contradicts with that on the RTH file, we used the information from the HIS
file. We also coded information for children whose relationship to a parent is unclear or unknown. Of
the 426,608 pairs of relationships on the Relationship file, we identified 17,828 pairs of parent-daughter
relationships (13,119 from HIS and 4,709 from RTH) and 18,771 pairs of parent-son relationships
(13,657 from HIS and 5,114 from RTH). In aggregate, we identified 19,057 children (9,276 daughters
and 9,871 sons).

Step 3.

From those children identified in Step 2, we located their biological, adoptive, step, and foster parents
on the Relationship file. One child had two foster mothers during 1976 and 1978, one child had two
foster mothers in 1982, one child had two biological fathers in 1985, and one child had two step fathers
in 1983, and a handful of children had more than one parent with unclear status in various years.
Moreover, 58 parents were identified as both “biological parent” and “parent with unclear or unknown
status.” These parents were treated as biological parents for all of the years.

Step 4.

We merged children identified in Step 2 with parents (whose relationships to children were adjusted in
Step 3) using the 1968-1985 Individual-Level file. By doing so, we were able to obtain the child’s and


                                                     21
parent’s Family Interview Numbers (FIN), which we used to determine whether children and parents
lived in the same household. A child and his or her parent(s) were defined as living together in the same
household in the particular year if the child and his or her parent(s) shared the same FIN in that year.

Step 5.

By comparing children’s FINs and parents’ FINs during the years 1968 and 1985, we found 38
children shared the same FIN with a biological parent and a second same-sex parent (step, adopted or
foster) in the same year. We treated these children as living with the biological parent. We then created
48 types of living arrangement for each child in each year by the type and gender of the parents.


A.2 Food expenditure questions in the PSID

In each year except 1973, the PSID asked questions about food consumption. The questions are
worded:

“How much do you (your family) spend on the food that you use at home in an average week?”

and

“About how much do you (your family) spend in an average week eating out, not counting meals at
work or at school?”

Family Interview Number (FIN) unit in a given year. Column 3 restricted to children in two-parent SEO (poverty
oversample) for whom complete relationship information is available. All children in a family are excluded if a parent’s
FIN is missing for any children in the household. Individual children are excluded if their FIN is missing (which
would be due to non-response in a given year), or if the child is not living with any parents.

Notes on Table 3: Robust standard errors presented in parentheses, estimated allowing for correlation between
observations sharing a 1968 Family Interview Number (FIN). Variables included in all regressions are: Year
indicators; Head’s age; Wife’s age; indicator variables for Head’s education (less than high school, 12 years of
school), and an indicator that head is white; number of children in the household; family size, size squared and size
cubed; an indicator that wife does not work, Wife’s hours of work, and interaction terms between Wife’s hours of
work and indicators that the Wife worked a low number of part time hours (no more than 800 hours per year), and an
indicator that the Wife worked a high number of part time hours (800-1400 hours per year). Number of observations
in columns 1, 2 and 5 (1968-85, SRC) = 15809; in columns 3, 4, and 6 (1968-85 SRC and SEO) = 24660. Last row of the
table presents F-tests for restricting the coefficients to be identical for step, adoptive, type-1 and type-2 foster
mothers.

The sample is restricted to two-parent households for whom relationships between all parents and children in the
same FIN-year are known. The following outliers were removed, which had no qualitatively or quantitatively
important effect on results: households reporting food at home greater than $25000 (1982 dollars) (9 household-
years); households reporting total real incomes greater than $250000 (9 household-years); households in which
some children were reported with negative ages (70 children are reported with negative ages, leading to the removal
of 199 children). The regressions have been re-run (results not reported here) restricting sample to households with 8
or fewer children and, separately, restricting sample to households with real household income less than $100000,
with no significant change in results. Results do not change when sample is restricted to the period 1972-1985.
Results are also robust to instrumenting real household income and real household income squared using Head’s
annual hours of work, hours of work squared, and an indicator that the head of household is white.

Notes: Robust standard errors appear in parentheses, where allowance has been made for correlation between observations from the same sampling cluster. Also included in the regressions
are a full set of province indicators, age of household head, age of head squared, indicators that head is African and head is male, and a full set of indicators for maximum years of
completed education among household members. 19182 African households were surveyed in OHS95, of which 18609 reported information in the expenditure survey. There were 3833
Coloured households surveyed in OHS95, of which 3757 reported information in the expenditure survey. Of these 22366 households, 22 were missing information on education of
household members, and 3908 were missing information on total household income. Observations were removed if household expenditure exceeded household income by more than
R62000 (6 cases). Total sample size = 18433. Results in this table are robust to instrumenting total household income and income squared using total household expenditure and
expenditure squared, to limit the effect on results of measurement error in household income.
