I. Introduction



 Stock prices appear to be very volatile, and some researchers suspect that

business psychology may play an important role.        One   candidate of such
extrinsic psychology is a speculative bubble, which pushes the stock price

above the fundamental value implied by expectations of future dividends until

the bubble crashes.      However, conditions for the existence of a rational

bubble are often very restrictive.    (See, for example, TIrole [1982). )   This

paper takes an alternative approach and asks under what conditions on the

fundamentals the value of the firm behaves like a bubble, that is. the value

of the firm tends to increase for a while before it suddenly drops.

  In the environment we consider, the change of the net cash flow from a

firm's production depends on uncertain quality of a manager and noise, and the

manager is occasionally replaced by a new manager.     People know whether the

manager is replaced, but they, including the manager himself, do not know

exactly how good the manager is; they gradually learn about it by observing

the changes in net cash flow under the current manager. We can show that, if

the current manager Is good, people gradually become more and more optimistic

about the manager, and that the value of the firm tends to increase more

rapidly than the net cash flow, until the optimism disappears with sudden

retire of the manager.     The value of the firm appears to contain a bubble,

because the value gradually deviates from the present value of the current net

cash flow and then the deviation disappears. While this bubble—like deviation

of the value of the firm can be both upward and downward in the basic model.

we later allow the firm to replace the unsuccessful manager endogenously with

some fixed cost, in addition to the exogenous stochastic retirement (e.g..

sudden death) of the current manager. Then it can be shown that the downward

movement in the value of the firm will not last as long as upward movement on



                                 2
average, because the firm will fire the current manager as soon as it finds

him not worth continuing.       The value of the firm more frequently deviates

upward from the present value of current net cash flow than downward, and that

the value of the firm tends to increase over time because of the truncation of

relatively inferior managers.     A similar story may be applied to replacement

of Investment projects rather than managers.1

  There have been previous attempts to apply stochastic regime shifts and

learning to explain the abnormal behavior of asset prices. For example, Flood

and Garber [1980a] develop a model with a regime switch to explain the

movement of the price level; Flood and Garber [1980b[, Hamilton and Whiternan

[19851   and Flood and Hodrick         [19861   discuss identification and the

observational similarity between a bubble and fundamentals when the underlying

process of fundamentals may change in future.       Also, Wang [1989) develops a

continuous—time dynamic asset pricing model with informed investors,

uninformed investors and noise traders, showing that the uninformed investors'

learning about the gradually changing trend of the dividends increases

volatility and risk—premium of the stock returns, and Barsky and DeLong [1989]

empirically examines how much learning explains volatility of stock prices.

In the literature of foreign exchange rates, the peso problem is extensively

analyzed, where the seeming deviation of the exchange rate from fundamentals

can be explained by the anticipation of a regime shift in future.          Lewis

[1989a,b] and Tabellirii [19881, for example, use learning to explain the

apparent deviation and volatility.2 The value—added in the present paper is

analyzing the time series properties of the value of a firm under recurrent

shifts In the trend of the net cash flow rather than a once—and—for—all shift

and, also, to explain the shifts that are partly endogenous.

 Section II develops the basic model where replacement of managers and shifts

in trend are exogenous.          Section III compares with the alternative



                                   3
specifications one without learning and   the   other sisspecified so that shifts

are ignored.   Section IV extends the basic sodel to allow for endogenous

replacement of managers by the firs.

II. Model



  Economy consists of s representative agent and many firms producing a

homogeneous product. Consider the net cash flow from the firms production

activity as sales of the product minus costs of employing factors of

production and purchasing investment goods. Suppose for now that the net cash

flow       follows the exogenous process



(1)           =
                  y_ +
(2)     x =          +


( t = (l—&t).zt              +




where                and         are mutually independent,         and identically and
independently distributed over time.           snd    are normally distributed with

zero mean and variances              and     The value of 6 is equal to 0 with
                                 y                             t
probability m and equal to 1 with probability l—m. For instance, imagtne that

the change in the net cash flow of the firm depends on uncertain quality of

the manager (trend component) p and noise               If   the quality of the manger

is good,          is positive and the net cash flow tends to increase, while the

cash flow tends to decrease with a bad manger.               With probability a, the

previous manager stays               and   is unchanged, while with probability I—it,

the manager is replaced 6=' and new random              is realized. Although later

we are going to analyze how the firm replaces unsuccessful managers, we assume

for now that the replacement of the manager is exogenous and that the

probability of the replacement is independent of the history of the

performance.

  The representative agent is risk—neutral with a constant discount factor .             t
He observes the net cash flow and whether the manager Is replaced or not, but

does not observe the quality of managers nor the noise.          In other words, he

observes the history of
                               x    and      but not , nor c. In fact, we
assume the only information the agent has Is the history of y, x and &,          and

general knowledge about the structure of the economy. There is no tax and all

the values are measured in terms of the homogeneous product. Define the value

of the firm's productive capital as the sum of the value of equity and debt

net of the value of monetary assets held by the firm.                Under rational

expectations, the value of the firm        at   the beginning of period t satisfies



(4a)
           1'             E[P1] =         E[ 't+T ] + bt
(4b)       bt =


where     Et(.] is the conditional expectations operator, conditional upon

Information at the period t, which includes the cash flow in period t,           and

whether a shift occurs or not,            The first term In the right hand side of

equation (4a) Is the expected present value of the future net cash flow which

is often called fundamentals.       The second term bt represents the effect of

extrinsic expectations about future value of the firm, called a speculative

bubble.

  In order to concentrate on the fundamentals, we assume there Is no

speculative bubble:



(5)         bt = 0,    for all t.




Then, because Et(xt) =     Et()           TE() and E(y1) =
we have

without the trend, and the second term is the effect of expected quality of

the manager.

  In order to formulate expectations about the quality of the manager, we

assume the agent is a Bayesian learner.5                        Suppose that the current manager

came to the firm at period s, while the current period is t, where s a t.

Since there was no replacement of the manager between period s and period t,

the agent's prior probability density function of                             is the same as i,       which
Is also the same as c

                                                                                                              *

Therefore the posterior distribution of                        Is normal with mean m and variance

Note that               and              are the only information necessary for the

distribution of manager's quality              and future net cash flow       conditional

on the information in period t.

  This yields an explicit expression for the value of the firm at period t


                                                 ma

The first term may be interpreted as the present value of an infinite stream

of the current net cash flow from production.             The second term reflects the

learning about the current manager.            Figure 1 illustrates the behavior of the

value of the firm in this model.              When the underlying unobserved quality of

manager is good and           is positive, not only the first term tends to Increase,

but also the second term tends to increase over time because the agent tends

to raise the assessment of the quality of the current manager with more

favorable observations.6 The second term appears to behave like a bubble,

because the absolute value of the second term tends to increase over time and

then suddenly crashes. Both terms of (11) are, however, fundamentals in the

sense that they come from intrinsic expectations of the future net cash flow

from production, rather than extrinsic beliefs about the value of the firm in

future.

  We also know from (11) that the sensitivity of              to ttn increases with

a /a
 y .z
             02/a2 and it.
                 y
                                If   change in the net cash flow xt reflects more

managerial quality than noise, so that a/a is large, then                           responds



                                          8
substantially to a change in the net cash flow, because such changes are very

informative for guessing the underlying managerial quality.                If manager is

replaced Infrequently, so that m is close to unity, then the current manager

is more likely to stay and has more impact on the expected present value of

the future net cash flow.




III. Comparison to Two Alternatives



  In order to evaluate the effects of learning, consider the case in which the

quality of manager      is    directly observable.       Then the value of the firm is


                              1           ___________
(12)        Pt =     (1—p)             + (l—)(l—m)


Since the second term is constant under the same manager, it does not look

like a bubble.       Recurring trend shifts with replacement of managers may

increase the volatility of the value of the firm, and the firm value will

deviate from the present value of current net cash flow.                  The deviation,

however, will not tend to grow over time and then crash, unless we include

learning about the unknown managerial quality, as in (11).             (See Figure 2.)

  The second alternative is when the true process of the unobserved quality of

the manager is (3), but a researcher misspecifies the managerial quality to

follow the AR(1) process:



                 =             +
(13)
                       Pt—i        c.
                                                                                            I

where     is distributed normally, independently, and identically with mean
zero and the variance (i—m2)c'2.             The variance and the auto—covariances of the   S
                                   P


                                         9
change in the net cash flow x are identical for the true systea (1.2.3) and

the misspecified system (1,2,13):



(14)   Var(x) =         + o, and Cov(xx+) = miti        e, for t s   0.




However,   the Bayesian learning process for the unknown trend in the

miaspecified system is very different from that in the true system.            The

process of m =   E[z)   can be represented by Kalman filtering



                                       —
(15)        m = it m1      +   z (xt       m1)

where (iT) satisfy v = Z/(Z+it2) and 2 = m2[))-v)22+i2it2]+U-m2)c'2.      We can

think of 2 as the variance of       conditional on time t—1 information, and   as

the weight of the unanticipated change in the net cash flow in revising the

expectation of the trend. Then the Implied process of the value of the firm

deviates systematically from the present value of current net cash flow, but

the deviation will not suddenly crash as in (11).         See Figure 3 for the

comparison. Therefore the researcher who specifies the trend to be AR(1) may

find it difficult to explain bubble—like volatile movements in the value of

the firs, since the variance-covariance of changes of net cash flow does not

reveal the true structure of the net cash flow.       If changes in the trend of

the net cash flow are not directly observable, the system might become

somewhat in between the basic model )ll) and the model (6,15), but this is a

topic for future investigation.




                                    10
IV. Replacing    Managers.



  One difficulty with our basic model is that it predicts both positive and

negative deviations of the firm value from the present value of the current

net cash flow.     But observations about the value of firms appear to suggest

more frequent upward deviations followed by crashes than downward deviations

followed by sudden upward jumps. Thus, we extend the basic model to allow the

firm to shift the trend of the net cash flow by replacing managers

endogenously8.

  Suppose that the firm decides whether to keep the current manager or fire

him at the end of each period. Even if the firm decides to keep the manager,

the manager retires (or dies) with probability 1—s each period.      After the

manager either is fired or dies, the firm hires a new manager with a one—time

adjustment cost k in the beginning of the following period.     Here we assume

for simplicity that the adjustment cost does not depend on whether the

previous manager was fired or died.     All new managers look identical in cx

ante, but in cx post the trend of the net cash flow is different depending on

a match between his skill and the firm's environment9.     The net cash flow,

apart from the adjustment cost, is characterIzed by equations (1,2,3).     The

difference from the previous model is that the manager's quality changes

(t=1) when the previous manager Is fired in addition to a period he dies

exogenously. Also we assume all firms are free to replace managers but that

the adjustment cost of a firm increases with the number of firms who replace

managers in the economy.

  In the steady state, the value of the firm depends on the number of periods
                                                                                 'I
the current manager has managed the firm (the age) n, the expected quality of

the current manager m1, and current net cash flow y. It satisfies Bellman's

where Etixinewl means the expectation of x conditional on the information in

period t with a new manager, while Et(xlold] is the expectation conditional on

the current manager continuing. Equation (16) says that the value of the firm

at the beginning of period t is equal to the current net cash flow plus the

discounted maximized expected value of the firm in the next period with or

without replacement.     The first term in the braces Is the value with firing

the current manager and recruiting a new one.                      The second term is without

firing the manager, where with probability a the current manager continues to

manage and gets older by one period, and with probability 1—it he dies and is

replaced exogenously.

  Define        = P(n,m,y)—(1—)y.                 It measures the deviation of the value of

the firm from the present value of the current net cash flow, when the manager

is n periods old and has the expected quality in.                  Then the assumption of free

trial of new manager with the upward—sloping adjustment cost function implies

that the adjustment cost in equilibrium is equal to the value—added of

introducing a new manager

The second equality comes from the fact that when there is no change in the

From (18), we know J(m) is a non—decreasing continuous function of m, and

non—negative because the firm always has a choice Of replacement. 10 Thus the

value of the fire is never below the present value of the current net cash

flow.      Also, from (17), the value of the firm immediately after the

replacement of the project is higher than the present value of the current net

cash flow by the ssgnitude k on average. 11                    Therefore, the magnitudes of

upward jumps in the value of the fire tends to be smaller than downward

crashes caused by the exogenous death of a previously successful manager.

  Figure 4 illustrates the value of the firs with endogenous replacement of

managers. When the net cash flow tends to be increasins with a good manager,

the value of the firs tends to increase sore rapidly than the present value of

the current •net cash flow with the appreciation of the manager.                            The firs

chooses to keep his until he dies, and the death of the successful manager

causes a drop in the value of the firs. When the net cash flow is decreasing

with either a bad manager or a bad luck, the firs will keep the manager as

long as the option value                     of the current manager is still positive.




                                        13
But when   the evidence becomes   unfavorable enough so   that the option value

becomes no longer positive, the firm will decide to replace him for a new

manager. Since bad managers are more frequently fired before die than good

managers, good managers tend to stay longer than bad ones, and the value of

the firm tends to increase over time.

VI. Conclusion



  In this paper we study theoretically conditions under which the value of the

firm is not only volatile, but also sometimes increases more rapidly than the

underlying net cash flow from production for a while then crashes.   We found

that the value of the firm appears to contain a bubble when the trend in net

cash flow occasionally shifta but is not directly observable so that an agent

learns only gradually.   One obvious question is how much this type of model

can explain empirically aspects of data which are difficult to explain with

existing models. We have to overcome a number of problems for such empirical

implementations. First, here, we study the relationship between the value of

the firm and the net cash flow from production, because our environment

incorporates the Modigliani—Miller theorem, which implies the dividend process

and the debt—equity ratio are indeterminate.   But data on the net cash flows

and the value of the firm are inferior relative to data on dividends and

equity prices. Second, we should study the relation between the aggregate and

the individual values of firms in order to explain fluctuations and growth of

the aggregate value of firms. Our hope Is that the results in this paper may

convince the reader that models like this and its potential generalizations

are worth pursuing.

     1. Rogoff [1990] independently develops a similar model to analyze political

     business cycle, i.e., replacement of manager of a country.



     2. Froot and Obstfeld [1989] study a model where a stock price bubble depends
I,

     on the dividend in a nonlinear way.          Although our model has similar aspects,

     it explains where the deviation comes from and how it is related to learning.

     Also. Hamilton [1988,89] develops an econometric model when researchers do not

     directly observe the shifts in trend of aggregate variables.



     3. In some literature,       trend includes all of y, i.e., the effects of both
         and          But here, we call only        'trend or 'quality of manager", and
     call      "noise".




     4. This relationship is independent of the debt—equity ratio and dividend

     policy by the Hodigliani-Miller theorem, and can be explained as follows.

     Assume that the firm issues one type of equity and a one-period riskless

     discounted bonds. The value of the firm at the beginning of the period is
     =                where      and St are the price and amount of equity at the

     beginning of period t, and         is the value of the firm's net bond position

     (i.e., the value of the firm's bonds minus bonds of other agents that it

     holds).       The net cash flow from production y is related to financial

     transactions as follows

               —                                           —
                   dtSt
                          +
                              st_dt)tst+it)   +
                                                  Bt8t+1       8t   =   0,

     where dt is the dividend per share and                is the price of the one-period

     discount bond which pays one unit of output at the beginning of period t+1.

     This equation says that the excess of dividend payments over the net cash flow


                                        16
from production is finanoed by either new equity issues at the post—dividend

price (the third term) and bond issues net of the bond repayment (the fourth

term). Expected utility maximization of the risk—neutral agent under rational

expectations implies     =
                             dt+Et[Psti[     and    =   . Applying    these and the

definition of the value of the firs to the cssh flow constraint, we get the

expression in the text. An unfortunate feature of our model, shared with some

other literature, is that the value of the firm is negative with positive

probability.   But we ignore this for now until Section III, where the

endogenous replacement virtually overcomes this probiem.



5. See DeCroot [1970) for a detailed discussion on Bayesian learning.



6. When the underlying trend .i       is   positive from period t—n+1 the term

         on average grows proportionally with           while the denominator grows

less than proportionally with n.



7. Equation (11) might provide a rational to technical analysis, although

usually shifts in trend are not direotiy observable in technical analysis.



B. See .Jovanovio [1982] and Pakes—Ericson (1988) for the relationship between

learning and exits of firms.          The subsequent analysis builds from their

formulation.




9. Although a good match between a manager and a firs say provide bargaining

power to the good manager, we ignore the effect of the manager' s compensation

on the net cash flow.



10. The firs's choice of whether to continue or intentionally replace the


                                 17
current manager, can be characterized by the reservation m strategy: continue

an n periods old manager if m a m(n), and fire the manager if m <       m(n), where
m(n) solves


       0 =    (l—)   +J    n+i + /((w+n)(w+n+l))        z)d(z)


We hope to show that J Cm) a J         Cm) and m(n) a mCn+l) a 0.   In other words,
                       n         n+l

the option value of the current manager is an Increasing function of the

conditional variance of the expected quality, and thus a decreasing function

of the age of the manager.        Therefore, the reservation value of m for

replacing the manager is non-decreasing with the age of the manager. Another

issue of interest is how the slope of the adjustment cost function affects the

growth in the long run.     If the economy has a limited capacity to adjust so

that the adjustment cost quickly becomes large even when a small number of

firms replacing the managers, then only a small number of firms replace the

managers in equilibrium and average growth will be low.



11. With endogenous replacement of managers, the average increase in the value

of the firm is k, but the average equity price change is zero.             This is

because the value of an additional issue of bonds or equities is equal to the

adjustment cost by the cash flow constraint. For example, if the firm issues

debts to finance the adjustment cost k, the value of the firm (debts and

equities) will increase by k on average, while the equity price will not.
