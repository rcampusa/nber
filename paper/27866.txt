Retail Raw: Wisdom of the Robinhood Crowd and the Covid Crisis
Ivo Welch
NBER Working Paper No. 27866
September 2020, Revised October 2020
JEL No. D9,G11,G4

                                          ABSTRACT

Small retail investors at the Robinhood (RH) retail brokerage firm from 2018 to 2020 shared with
Finnish and larger US investors from the 1990s a preference for extreme recent winners and
losers. Interestingly, this preference held even for the overall stock market during the March-2020
Covid crisis, indicating an absence of panic and margin calls. Thus, RH investors acted as a
(small) market-stabilizing force. They were also unusually interested in some “experience” stocks
(e.g., Cannabis stocks). Nevertheless, the narrative of pure irrational exuberance is misleading.
Collectively, RH investors principally held stocks with large persistent past share-volumes and
dollar-volumes, making them invest overwhelmingly in large rather than in obscure stocks. A
portfolio constructed on the basis of just these two (slowly moving) variables can mimick the
investments of RH traders, plausibly even beyond the sample. (2000 would have been an
exceptionally bad year.) The collective RH crowd portfolio did not underperform with respect to
standard academic benchmark models.

              The online retail brokerage company Robinhood (RH) was founded in 2013 based on a
       plan to make it easier and cheaper for small investors to participate in the stock and option
       markets. RH has never charged brokerage fees, making it possible to buy and sell single
       shares of stocks. Instead, RH earns its revenues through margin fees and cash balance
       interest, payment-for-order flow, and sales of its investor data to more sophisticated high-
       frequency traders. RH’s also appealed with many other small technological innovations,
       such as mobile-first user interface.

              As of mid-2020, RH had attracted a clientele of over 13 million investors—widely
       believed to be small, young, computer-savvy but also mostly first-time novice investors.
       “According to Robinhood...first time investors accounted for 1.5 million of its 3 million
       funded accounts opened in the first four months of 2020” (WSJ, Sep 12, 2020). The website
       brokerage-review.com estimated that the average account size at RH was only $2,000. By
       August of 2020, RH had raised another $200 million of fresh capital, boosting its valuation
       to $11.2 billion. It is widely considered a disruptive force in US investing.

              RH also offered an API from mid-2018 to mid-2020 that made it possible to obtain the
       (anonymous) number of RH investors holding a particular stock at that particular moment.
       In turn, the website robintrack.net wrote some scripts to continuously pull down the RH
       information (at a speed of about 20 stocks per second, cycling through all stocks about
       once an hour) and then reposted the data online with RH’s blessing.

              My paper investigates this Robintrack history. It first documents that the small RH
       investors of the 2018-20s shared some of the behavioral traits of retail investors first
       observed in other contexts. In particular, Grinblatt and Keloharju (2001) and Barber and
       Odean (2008) had shown that other retail investors in the 1990s bought stocks that had
       recently gone up or gone down a lot. This could be due to stocks catching the attention of
       investors1 or investors deliberately seeking of sensation. Barber and Odean (2013) surveys
       the behavioral literature on individual investors.

              In addition to establishing that this was also the case here for individual stocks that
       underperformed or outperformed the market dramatically the day before, my paper can
       show that such behavior extended to the sharp market-wide Covid decline in March 2020.

       RH investors did not panic or experience margin calls. Instead, there is evidence that as
       the stock market declined, investors actively added cash to fund purchases of more stocks.
       Their first “purchasing” spike (i.e., increase in the sum-total number of holding investors
       in all stocks) occurred as early as the next day, presumably reflecting account purchasing
       power. The second spike occurred 3-4 days after a large market movement, roughly the
       time that it takes to complete a cash bank transfer. Thus, the evidence suggests that RH
       investors collectively acted as a (small) market-stabilizing force.

              There is plenty of opportunity to poke fun at the holdings of RH investors. For example,
       they purchased and overweighted stocks that seemed to appeal to their interests—Ford
       (but not GM), Facebook in 1998 (but not in 2000), airline stocks in 2000 (but not in 1998).
       AMD, Snapchat. Cannabis stocks were particularly popular. At the end of January 2019,
       Aurora Cannabis (ACB) was briefly the most widely held stock, with 244,532 investors
       (AAPL being second with “only” 237,521 investors)!

              Nevertheless, there is also a different perspective. Although RH-type investors may very
       well have played a role in the demand for many otherwise obscure cannabis stocks, an
       “actual Robinhood” crowd portfolio (ARH) was not as crazy as these “anecdotal holdings”
       would suggest.2

              Most of the collective holdings of RH investors revolved around larger and highly
       liquid firms. Two readily available stock attributes—share trading volume and dollar
       trading volume over the last year—can explain about 50-60% of the ARH crowd portfolio’s
       investment weights.3 The abnormal 5-F returns (from this two-attribute “quasi-RH” portfolio
       [QRH]) can explain about 2/3 of the abnormal 5-F investment returns of the ARH portfolio.
       This is similar to if not higher than the mutual associations of 5-F abnormal returns among
       the equal-weighted, value-weighted, and S&P market portfolios. The QRH portfolio is not
       a perfect but a reasonable proxy of the ARH portfolio.

              Yet it is perhaps most surprising that the ARH portfolio, based on the collective wisdom
       of the crowd, did not underperform. This was the case for the 0-factor model (i.e., returns
       above the risk-free rate), the 1-factor model (i.e., abnormal returns adjusted for market-
       beta), and the 5-factor model (Fama and French (2015)). The alphas were positive—-and,
          2
            My paper even understates the sanity of the RH portfolio. RH investors also held better-diversified ETFs,
       but these were not part of the study here.
          3
            I can speculate that the remaining 40% relate to the visibility of products and stocks for my target investor
       group. Unfortunately, there are no readily available long time-series that would make it easy to measure this.


                                                               3

       despite the very short sample period, even statistically significant for the 5-factor model
       with a respectable abnormal rate of return of 1.3% per month. The QRH portfolio did not
       underperform over a much longer horizon, starting in 1980, either.

           The evidence in my paper does not contradict any evidence from earlier research, which
       tended to focus more on portfolio changes (buys and sells). In contrast, my analysis of the
       synthetic and aggregated ARH and QRH portfolios focuses more on level holdings. These
       are more akin to the buy-and-hold benchmark in Barber and Odean (2000) than their
       active traders. It is also not likely that the ARH portfolio was held by any one retail investor,
       either. Instead, ARH should be viewed as crowd wisdom, akin to consensus forecasts in
       Zarnowitz and Lambros (1987).



       I    Background

       Wikipedia describes Robinhood Markets, Inc., as an “American financial services company
       headquartered in Menlo Park, California. The company offers a mobile app and website
       that offer people the ability to invest in stocks, ETFs, and options through Robinhood
       Financial and crypto trading through Robinhood Crypto. Robinhood operates a website
       and mobile apps for iPhone, Apple Watch, and Android. The company has no storefront
       branches and operates entirely online without fees. Robinhood is a FINRA regulated broker-
       dealer, registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and is a member
       of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. The company’s main source of revenue
       comes from interest earned on customers’ cash balances, selling order information to high-
       frequency traders (a practice for which SEC opened a probe into the company in September
       2020) and margin lending. The company has 13 million users.”

           Presumably, with their payment for order flow, RH spread the eliminated fixed-cost fee
       component into higher per-share variable costs—making it cheaper to buy and sell small
       positions and more expensive to buy and sell larger positions. However, given the lack of
       data on execution costs by all retail brokers in the market—and a criminal law related to
       price manipulation against testing execution quality with sample roundtrip trades—the
       relative execution quality of RH is difficult to ascertain.

              RH’s rapid growth led other brokers to abandon brokerage fees by October 2019. It
       was also reputed to have played a role in inducing the merger between Charles Schwab
       and Ameritrade.

              RH had its fair share of controversies, relating to service outages, cryptocurrency,
       banking, payment for order flow, a security breach, and even the suicide of one of its
       investors.4

              Robintrack.net (RT) was created in 2018. For about three years, RT regularly and
       irregularly ran a script to download all RH data made publicly available on RH’s API.
       RH terminated its public API in August 2020 and RT froze its operations. By this time,
       the data base had accumulated into 3.5GB worth of data.                      After removing repeated
       intra-hour observations and unchanging holdings, it contained about 12 million ticker-
       hour observations.        For each stock, I extracted the last UTC observation for each day.
       (Conveniently, the NYSE closes at 4:30pm, which is 11:30pm UTC.)

              This resulted in 5,777,002 RH ticker-day observations from 802 unique days and 8,597
       useful tickers.5 Of the 8,560 RH tickers, 8,387 tickers were matchable to CRSP. Of these,
       3,834 had sharecode 10 or sharecode 11. Thus, my paper pertains only to this specific
       investment universe, ex-ante identifiable.

              Some tickers do not appear at all or appear late in the RT data. Early versions of
       the script probably omitted dual-class tickers ending with ’.A’ and ’.B’, most prominently
       Berkshire Hathway. RT remedied this with an upgrade on 2020/01/16.6 Nevertheless,
       some stocks are not in the RT dataset at all for reasons unknown, most prominently CELG
       (Celgene) and TWX (Time-Warner).

              From 2018/05/02 (the incept day on RT) to 2020/06/30 (the end day of my CRSP
       data set), there were 545 valid CRSP trading days. RH suffered some systemwide outages
       on 2020/03/02 and 2020/03/09. The RT script should have been but was not run on
       2018/08/09, on 2019/01/24-29 (4 days), and 2020/01/07-15 (7 days). The last followed
          4
             Fong, Gallagher, and Lee (2014) found that discount brokerage firms had less informative trades than
       full-service brokerage firms. My paper tests whether their base finding (low informativeness) also holds for
       Robinhood investors.
           5
             The data contained some non-sensical tickers, such as _OUT, _PRN, MTL-, PKD∼ (and its sibling PKD),
       which I hand-removed.
           6
             Thus, BRK.B suddenly appeared with 38,023 users (BRK.A with 134 users). (Figure 3 shows that BRK.A
       was right on the fitted line on 2020/06/30.) Other noteworthy dual-class examples, also appearing on
       2020/01/16, included Royal-Shell Dutch and Lions Gate Entertainment.

       the dual-class script update. This left 533 valid trading days, which are the basis for my
       analysis.

              Over time, the number of RH investors increased, and with the law-of-large-numbers,
       presumably the reliability of the number of RH investors holding individual stocks. On
       2018/06/29, the RH data covered only 2,947 stocks that could be matched to 3,635 CRSP
       stocks. On 2019/12/31, the respective numbers were 3,522 and 3,613.

              The only other academic paper that I am aware of that has studied RT data is Moss,
       Naughton, and Wang (2020). It shows that RH investors did not care much about ESG,
       contrary to some experimental studies.7


              Before offering an analysis, it is important to offer appropriate caveats. RH investors
       are a small and perhaps unusual part of the overall retail investor clientele. Their behavior
       may or may not be representative of the behavior of retail investors in general.

              Without access to the investment holdings and transactions of individual RH investors,
       one can investigate only aggregate and relative stock-specific holding patterns. Realistically,
       research can investigate only (1) changes in the number of RH holders for a stock over
       time; (2) changes in and the performance of synthetic investment portfolios that include
       information based on the relative number of RH holders.

              I define my Actual RH (“ARH”) crowd portfolio as

                                                            ni,t
                                                    wARH
                                                     i,t
                                                         ≡ P        ,                                            (1)
                                                             i ni,t


       where i is a stock index and t a day index. The ARH portfolio invests more when the
       number of investors holding a stock is higher.8 ARH assumes that each investor holding
       represents an equal amount of dollars. For example, if RH posts twice as many owners of
          7
            A non-public J.P.Morgan research report by Cheng, Murphy, and Kolanovic (2020) was privately emailed
       to me in September 2020. It also studied purchases and sales of RH data, focusing primarily on changes in RH
       holdings, i.e., following earlier Barber-Odean studies. It is clearly independent, roughly contemporaneous,
       and different in its research questions. It does share some findings with my own paper, especially with respect
       to RH purchases of strong winners and losers.
          8
            An analogous assumption would be used for changes in holdings. Thus, it is required in Section II. If
       investors diffuse their portfolios from concentrated positions, more RH investors will be holding each stock
       without a necessary overall increase in investment dollars. Nevertheless, though possible, it seems implausible
       that the amount invested by RH in a particular stock would not increase when the number of investors in this
       stock increases.


                                                             6

       stock A compared to stock B, the weight of A in the ARH portfolio is twice that of B. The
       number of investors in each stock is unlikely to be a good approximation for shares in a
       value-weighted portfolio of RH or retail investors in general. It probably overweights small
       investors.

              The performance of this ARH portfolio is not likely to be representative of the perfor-
       mance of the average RH investor, either. In particular, few if any RH investors are likely to
       hold the widely-spread ARH portfolio. Instead, individual RH investors are more likely to
       suffer (or enjoy) diversifiable risk.

              For papers investigating changes in holdings (and my Section II), multiple stock holdings
       could increase suddenly when investors transfer brokerage accounts from elsewhere to
       RH. However, transferring assets from another brokerage firm to RH does not seem to be
       common. My repeated email interactions suggested that my customer-service represen-
       tative did not even understand my question of how to do this. Instead, she repeatedly
       suggested funding the account by linking to a bank cash account. It is also not possible
       to transfer fixed amounts of funds (e.g., via paypal or check) to fund an account.9 More-
       over, Section IV focuses on questions about ARH investment levels rather than questions
       about (simultaneous) ARH changes. Thus, it does not even matter whether investors had
       purchased stocks earlier and just transferred them or whether they had purchased them
       anew.

              Importantly, this ARH portfolio is not the only one that could be considered. One of
       its drawbacks is that when a stock increases in value, this stock’s titlt does not increase in
       the ARH portfolio. An alternative crowd portfolio would be one in which each investor
       (holding) represents an equal number of shares. In this case, w i,t ≡ (ni,t ·Pi,t )/( i ni,t ·Pi,t ),
                                                                                            P

       where Pi is the prevailing stock price. A drawback of this alternative portfolio would be that
       any variable that is correlated with price (such as marketcap or dollar trading volume or
       simply price itself) becomes nearly mechanically correlated with this portfolio’s investment
       weights. That is, the portfolio investment weights would no longer be primarily measures
       of information obtained from RH.
          9
            To fund their accounts, 13 million RH investors were willing to hand their user credentials including
       passwords for their bank accounts to an intermediary named “PLAID,” that links Robinhood to these banks.
       If PLAID were to be hacked, the consequences for these investors could be disastrous. All banks advise their
       customers not to share their account credentials and will contest any liability if bank account funds disappear
       through such a channel.

            Another source of noise is that RH gives each investor one free randomly-chosen share
       upon signup or referral. 2% of these new investors are “winners,” in that they receive
       one share that is drawn from one of six stocks explicitly named on RH’s bonus page with
       stock prices above $10. The shares given to the other 98% are impossible to ascertain. A
       survey of past recipients confirms that the selections did not adhere to a literal reading of
       the description in the bonus offer—that is, these shares were not drawn from the three
       highest-capitalized stocks with prices below $10. While this should not matter to RH
       investors, it can influence the reported holdings. I suspect that Robinhood merely reassigns
       some random share just sold by another investor to the new investor, thereby saving all
       external costs. If this is correct, then the sale of a larger position could easily splinter into
       more holders rather than fewer. It is also likely that many investors simply hold on to their
       share, despite the near-zero marginal trading-out cost. Thus, this holding could persist
       over time and effect even portfolio levels. This is noise in my study, tilting it against finding
       any effect.

            In sum, the ARH portfolio considered in my paper is one feasible crowd-wisdom portfolio.
       Its investment weights summarizes the RH crowd participation in one particular fashion. It
       was investable in-time.



       II     Idiosyncratic Responses To Large Stocks Returns

       This section first examines changes in RH holdings as background evidence. It investigates
       whether the buy/sell behavior patterns of retail investors documented in Grinblatt and
       Keloharju (2001) and in Barber and Odean (2008) also apply in my sample. The Grinblatt
       and Keloharju (2001) data was for Finish investors from 1994 to 1997. The Barber and
       Odean (2008) data was stitched together from various clienteles for U.S. investors from
       1991 to 1999.

            The result is not a foregone conclusion. Causality is local. It is not impossible for my
       investors to behave differently. Neither the time period nor the types of investors overlap.
       My sample consists of smaller investors 25 years later, perhaps even wiser after the 2000
       Tech collapse. It also includes the 2020 Covid experience—the most severe contraction of
       the economy since the Great Depression, all in the midst of a sharp stock market decline

       followed by a sharp bull stock market. Thus, it requires empirical evidence to find out
       whether RH investor behavior was similar or different.



       A         Active Holding Changes

                            [Insert Table 1 here: Extreme One-Day Increases in RH Holdings]


                Before proceeding to the statistical evidence, Tables 1 and 2 help gain an intuitive
       understanding of the data. They describe the most extreme cases of changes in the ARH
       investment weight, i.e., in a portfolio formed in accordance with the number of RH investors
       holding each stock.

                Table 1 lists stocks with unusual one-day increases in investor interest. The common
       feature seems to be highly unusual one-day stock price increases or decreases.10

                            [Insert Table 2 here: Extreme One-Day Decreases in RH Holdings]


                Table 2 lists stocks with unusual one-day decreases. There are again some rather stark
       stock price changes, tilting more towards losses. Sounding somewhat trite, IGC investors
       seem to have decided to realize their profits after a stark price increase a few days earlier.
       However, I could not detect a strong pattern in these extreme declining-sentiment changes.



       B        Individual Contrarianism and Sensation-Seeking

                        [Insert Figure 1 here: RH Holding Changes by Net-of-Market Daily Return]


                Figure 1 investigates whether RH investors were “sensation-seeking” in the Barber and
       Odean (2008) sense. I first categorized all trading days by their rates of return net of the
       market (both from CRSP). The plots then tabulate contemporaneous RH change statistics.

                No attempt is made to distinguish between causal and correlative-only associations.
       However, it would seem unlikely that small RH investors alone would be influential enough
           10
           Some events involve stock splits. Note that a stock split does not mechanically change the number of
       investors in a stock.




                                                           9

       to cause major price changes. Similarly, no attempt is made to distinguish between antici-
       patory and consequent purchases. It seems even less plausible that small retail investors
       would collectively have had advance knowledge.11

              The top plot tabulates the fraction of stocks that experienced increases in their RH
       holdings vs. decreases in their RH holdings on each trading-day. It shows that when
       stocks either increased or decreased by about 30% on one day, the number of RH holdings
       increased in about 4 out of 5 times. This contrasts with stock-days that had non-descript
       performances, in which the number of increases and decreases was about even. The plot
       also shows (in lighter colors) lines based on pre-2020 and post-2020 data. The observed
       pattern was stable over time.12

              The bottom figure tabulates ARH portfolio weight changes. This takes into account both
       that an increase from 50 to 51 holders is not the same as an increase from 1 to 100 holders,
       and that other stocks on the same days may also have experienced changes. The response
       is still a U-shape, but the plot shows that the increase in RH investors was stronger on the
       positive than on the negative side. This suggests that increases of interest on the down-side
       were often in smaller stocks, where just a few net purchasers would have increased the
       total number of RH investors.

              In sum, the evidence suggests that the “sensation-seeking” evidence in Grinblatt and
       Keloharju (2001)) and in Barber and Odean (2008) also appears in RH investors. It is
       proportionally weaker for large stock price decreases than it is for large stock price increases.




         11
           These questions are investigated in a different data set in Barber, Odean, and Zhu (2008).
         12
           Kaniel, Saar, and Titman (2007) use an order-based proxy for individual investor trading. The pattern
       then changes somewhat. Investors are still contrarian over monthly horizons, but they did not purchase
       (extreme) winners. Surprisingly, retail investors’ returns were quite good over the subsequent month.

       III        Systematic Contrarianism in the Time-Series

       Retail investor could behave differently in stark and/or prolonged market-wide downturns.
       They could start to panic or they could face margin calls. Neither Grinblatt and Keloharju
       (2001) nor Barber and Odean (2008) examined this question. There simply was no large
       decline in the Grinblatt sample; and the biggest decline in the Barber sample was only 15%
       (July 1998). In contrast, my sample contains an interesting episode. After multiple days
       of decline in March 2020, the stock market had dropped by about 1/3, with reasonable
       expectations of a calamitous economic depression caused by Covid looming ahead. As of
       September 2020, although the economic depression has materialized, the stock market has
       recovered and reached new all-time highs.

                [Insert Figure 2 here: Sum-Total RH Holdings and Stock Market Performance, 2018-2020]


              Interpreting the aggregate time-series behavior is complicated by the fact that the
       Robinhood brokerage firm was not stable but experienced good growth throughout the
       entire sample period. Figure 2 shows a full-sample tally of the number of holdings. The
       sum-total of investor holdings grew steadily from 2018 to 2019—and then dramatically
       accelerated in 2020.

                  [Insert Figure 3 here: Sum-Total RH Holdings and Stock Market Performance in 2020]


              The plot in Figure 3 is a closeup view. It shows that the most dramatic acceleration in
       holdings by RH investors appeared roughly contemporaneously with the stark decline in
       the stock market.13

                       [Insert Figure 4 here: 2018-2020 RH Systematic Contrarianism By Horizon]


              Figure 4 presents the same information but for different horizons in an x-y graph,
       plotting the performance of the S&P 500 and the percent change in RH sum-total holdings.
       It shows that over horizons from 1 day to 1 month, both large decreases and increases in
       the S&P 500 associated with large increases in the sum-total number of holdings by RH
       investors.
         13
              A spike in January hints at tax-related, bonus-related, or New-Year-resolution related purchases.


                                                              11

                     [Insert Table 3 here: Daily Innovations in the Sum-Total Number of RH Holdings]


              Table 3 investigates the association between daily changes in the S&P 500 and daily
       innovations in the aggregate number of RH holdings. The two left regressions use the entire
       sample, the two right regressions begin in February 2020 (thereby omitting the January
       2020 RT script update).

              The estimated coefficients suggest a first spike in innovations in RH holdings exactly
       one day after the stock market increased or decreased. This suggests that RH investors
       learn about strong market movements towards the end of the day and purchased further
       holdings the following day with their remaining (margin) purchasing balances. The 0.13
       up-coefficient suggests that a 10% market increase resulted in a 1.3% increase in the
       number of RH holdings; the 0.04 down-coefficient suggests that a 10% market decrease
       resulted in an 0.4% increase.14 A second spike occurred about 3-4 days later—roughly the
       time that it takes for a bank transfer to complete. This second spike is more symmetric,
       with strong bull and bear markets having an equal influence on innovations in RH holdings.
       The two-day coefficient of about 0.1 suggests another 1% increase—this one almost surely
       funded by dollars previously held in cash or savings accounts and now flowing into the
       riskier equity markets. Not shown in the regressions, there is also some evidence that lower
       volatility and returns in bitcoin increased RH participation. However, this effect is smaller.


              In sum, just like strong price increases or decreases of individual stocks can explain
       additional individual RH purchases of a stock, strongly positive or strongly negative overall
       market movements can predict/explain unexpected increases in RH positions. This evidence
       suggests that RH investors did not retreat from the stock market during its starkest decline.
       It appears that RH investors served a small but active market-stabilizing role during the
       Covid crash. In this case (as in the other U.S. stock-market crashes in our lifetimes),
       holding on and/or increasing the position would then have paid off well in the subsequent
       stock-market boom.




         14
              The stock return is negated in this variable to make the interpretation easier.


                                                               12

       IV      The ARH Portfolio Perspective

                     [Insert Table 4 here: Highest ARH vs VW Log-Investment-Rank Difference]


            Reading popular descriptions, the behavior of RH investors is subject to common ridicule.
       Indeed, RH investors ended up with some rather unusual portfolio positions. In the most
       extreme example where the value-weighted market cap rank was much lower than that
       of RH investors at a year end, Table 4 shows that RH investors were particular fans of
       India-Cannabis (IGC), which ranked 27th on their holdings in 2019 with 0.59% of their
       portfolio. Yahoo!Finance describes this 50-employee company as follows

              India Globalization Capital, Inc. purchases and resells physical infrastructure
              commodities. The company operates through two segments, Infrastructure Busi-
              ness, and Life Sciences. It buys and sells infrastructure commodities, such as steel,
              wooden doors, marble, and tiles; rents heavy construction equipment, including
              motor grader, transit mixers and rollers; and undertakes highway construction
              contracts. The company also develops cannabinoid-based products and therapies,
              such as Hyalolex for the treatment of patients from anxiety, agitation, dementia,
              depression, and sleep disorder diseases; and Serosapse for the treatment of Parkin-
              son’s disease. In addition, it offers offer extraction, distillation, tolling, and white
              labeling services under the Holi Hemp brand; and hemp crude extracts, hemp
              isolates, and hemp distillates. The company operates in the United States, India,
              and Hong Kong. India Globalization Capital, Inc. was founded in 2005 and is
              based in Potomac, Maryland.

       It is difficult to think of a rational portfolio in which IGC would deserve an investment
       holding similar to that of J.P.Morgan.

            Not shown, other Cannabis stocks similary attracted unusual interest by RH investors.
       (The RH mobile interface even has a special button dedicated to pulling up the most popular
       Cannabis stocks.) As already noted in the introduction, at the end of January 2019, Aurora
       Cannabis (ACB) was briefly the most popular stock on RH.




                                                        13

                Moreover, Table 4 shows that RH investors also had a relative preference for certain
       oil&gas-related exploration companies and bio-pharmaceutical-related companies. All
       these investments tended to be highly risky, too.15

                In sum, it is easy to tell a tale that RH retail investors fit the stereotype of the unsophis-
       ticated gambler, earning low returns and being taken advantage of by more sophisticated
       professional traders.


                However, the remainder of this section will show that this narrative seems incomplete.
       Although RH investors were presumably relatively common investors in some rather odd
       stocks (as in IGC) and suffered from all sorts of behavioral and perhaps harmful patterns
       when buying and selling, this does not mean that the most important holdings in the ARH
       portfolio were in these odd or bought-and-hold stocks, too. This section provides evidence
       that the ARH crowd portfolio was a lot more ordinary.

                Put differently, the odd holdings described in Table 4, though real, were not the rule
       but the exception. From the perspective of the ARH portfolio, they could be described as
       “interesting experience and curiosity holdings.”16



       A         Large Holdings

       Figure 5 provides a graphical perspective of ARH portfolio holdings for two snapshots, one
       at the end of 2018, the other towards the end of the sample in mid-2020.

                         [Insert Figure 5 here: Snapshot ARH Weights by Log-Rank of Market Cap]


                Although IGC was perhaps the strangest popular holding in Table 4, it was not particu-
       larly noteworthy in the overall portfolio. After all, even at its height, IGC still represented
       only 0.5% of the portfolio. This leaves 99.5% for other holdings. Many other stalwarts
       represented more than twice of IGC’s weight. The outliers other than IGC from Table 4
       would be even less notable.
           15
            Remarkably, the historical standard deviation of stock returns is not a great predictor of ARH holdings,
       because it is largely subsumed by trading volume in Table 7.
         16
            As already mentioned in footnote 2, my analysis understates the “sanity” of ARH, because it excludes
       many better-diversified ETF portfolios with share codes other than 10 or 11, also commonly held by RH
       investors.


                                                           14

              This does not mean that the ARH portfolio mimicked the marketcap-value weighted
       portfolio. For example, the top plot (2018) shows that GE and F were as popular as AAPL
       and both exceeded the holdings in MSFT. Other popular stocks were AMD, Fitbit, GoPro,
       Netflix, Snapchat—firms with products familiar to computer-savvy Millenials.17 The blue
       line is a near perfect fit of the value-weighted market-cap weight, by design, for comparison.

              The bottom plot shows that the (blue) market-cap weighted curve had steepened by
       2020, with AAPL valued at $2 trillion representing about 4% of the overall stock market. In
       contrast, the black RH curve for ARH weight by marketcap remained roughly unchanged.
       Yes, the ARH portfolio continued to invest strongly in AAPL (with about 2% weight), but
       less aggressively so than the value-weighted market. Instead, RH investors overweighted
       Disney, GE, Ford, and airlines stocks. A fair characterization is that although retail investors
       had loved “new-economy” stocks in 2018, their portfolio had been tilting more towards
       fallen “old-economy” stocks by mid-2020.


                   [Insert Table 5 here: ARH Investment Weights Far Above VW Investment Weights]


              Table 5 lists the largest holdings by RH-portfolio investment weight. With data for both
       snapshots for a given stock, it also provides a perspective on their evolutions. A stock can
       see increases both in its ranking relative to other stocks and in its marketcap-relative weight
       in the RH portfolio if

          1. it is more actively purchased by (new) investors relative to other stocks;

          2. its price (and thus its weight in the value-weighted market portfolio) decreases
                relative to other stocks.

       The table shows some instances of both. For example, although American Airlines (AAL)
       dropped from a high of about $50/share in late 2018 to about $10/share in mid2020,
       reducing its weight in the value-weighted CRSP index from about 0.06% to 0.02%, Yet RH
       investors adored it. The 7,300 original holders in 2018 had turned into 654,611 holders
       by 2020. American Airline’s weight in the ARH portfolio increased from 0.12% to 2.39%.
       Facebook (FB) had good stock market performance, raising its weight in the value-weighted
         17
          It seems unlikely that Robinhood attracts the same lower socioeconomic clienteles that were studied in
       Kumar (2009). However, they do seem to share some of their gambling predilections.


                                                          15

       market from 1.34 to 1.78. But it fell out of relative favor with RH investors, with holdings
       increasing only 40% rather than the 360% that the sum-total number of RH holdings
       increased. PLUG (a hydrogen fuel researcher) benefitted both from strong rate of return
       performance and increased interest.

           In sum, even though some of the buying and selling and even investments in odd
       small-cap experience stocks were eye-popping, these positions represented only a small
       part of the RH crowd portfolio. They were a storm in a teacup. The big picture happened
       in larger stocks, typically more familiar to and focused on retail consumers and especially
       Millenials.



       B    The Performance of The ARH Crowd Portfolio

              [Insert Table 6 here: Return Performance of the ARH Crowd Portfolio, 2018 – mid-2020]


           Table 6 shows the next-day performance of daily rates of return for the ARH portfolio.
       Again, this portfolio is not representative of those of individual investors. It is more
       appropriately viewed as a “crowd wisdom” or consensus portfolio.

           To analyze the performance of the ARH portfolio, I rely on the familiar methods of Fama
       and French (2015). The left side of Table 6 shows that the average daily performance of
       the ARH portfolio was a positive 10 basis points per day on the 0-Factor model, i.e., net
       of the prevailing risk-free rate (from Ibbotson via Ken French’s website). This abnormal
       performance declines to about 5 basis points on the 1-Factor model. This is performance
       above the stock market rate of return when the (ex-post realized) market exposure of 1.1
       is taken into account. The abnormal performance increases back to 9 basis points on the
       5-Factor model. This is because the ARH portfolio had positive exposure on the SMB factor
       and negative exposure on the CMA factor.

           The right side of Table 6 shows that when portfolios are formed at the end of each
       month and held until the end of the following month, the performance remains about the
       same. The factor exposures become less precise, perhaps explaining the change in the
       5-factor model CMA exposure. The abnormal rate of return on the 5-F model is a very
       respectable 1.30% per month and statistically significant.



                                                        16




This preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3696066
              The results are not sensitive to delay. After all, these are portfolios based on investment
       weights, not portfolios based on changes in investment weights. The RH holdings and thus
       the ARH portfolio are mostly very stable.

              These performance regressions assume equal investments in different periods. They
       ignore the effects of time-varying entry and exit into the stock market. They thus understate
       that investors had deployed more capital just after the March 2020 decline, which would
       have benefitted further from correctly timing the market.

              In sum, the ARH portfolio performed surprisingly well. Collectively, the RH crowd may
       have anticipated subsequent interest of other slower retail and other investors.18 It also
       suggests that the narrative that RH investors were cannon fodder for more sophisticated
       day traders seems misplaced.



       V        Mimicking The ARH Crowd Portfolio

       What stock attributes explain the investment interests of the RH clientele? The answer can
       allow us to explore when a strategy mimicking the behavior of RH investors would have
       performed well and when it would have performed poorly, even beyond the short available
       RH 2018-2020 sample period.

              To answer this question, a few issues must be kept in mind. First, it is more important
       for a prediction of investment weights to explain the top 50 holdings than the bottom 3,000
       holdings—and these 50 top holdings are by-and-large not odd experience micro-stocks like
       IGC. Mispredicting the weights of cannabis stock is forgivable. Second, the ARH portfolio
       has a lot of hysteresis. The figures have shown that many weights are stable over more than
       a year. Thus, short-term variables (like recent rates of return) are unlikely to help explain
       much of the investment weights. Third, it is not useful to attempt to explain changes in
       ARG weights, because we have neither any earlier ARH portfolio holdings nor occasional
       ARH holdings on which we could recalibrate predicted ARH portfolios weights. Fourth,
       regressions predicting ARH weights should not so much be judged by their ability to predict
         18
           Good performance by stocks purchased by retail investors over a short horizon was also the case in
       Barber, Odean, and Zhu (2008), Kelley and Tetlock (2013), and Grinblatt and Keloharju (2001). However,
       the focus there was on changes in holdings. The focus here is on levels of holdings. As already noted, this is
       more akin to the buy-and-hold benchmark in Barber and Odean (2000).



                                                            17

       these weights, but by their abilities to produce portfolio returns similar to those displayed
       by the ARH portfolio. Thus it is not of great concern that the weight-predicting regressions
       below include many days for the same stock with similar weights and characteristics, or that
       its T-statistics would be misleading, or that the regressions are misspecified on a number of
       other dimensions (such as heteroskedasticity or codeterminants).19



       A         The Attributes Determining ARH Investment Weights

                              [Insert Table 7 here: Explaining ARH Investment Weights (in %)]


                With 1.7 million ticker-day observations, it is feasible to start with little theory and try to
       disentangle similar variables empirically. Table 7 begins with a large panel regressions with
       many variables in the pre-2020 sample, allowing the post-2020 sample to be a hold-out
       sample. This “kitchen sink” regression contains a set of variables inspired by earlier (largely
       behavioral) research, as well as some more ad-hoc variables:

       IPO Variables: IPO<1year, IPO<3years, Days Since IPO logged, days since IPO;

       Name: A dummy when the ticker starts with the letter ”A”;

       Share Volume, Dollar Volume, Marketcap: Basic value, a “transformed weight” (see ex-
                  planation below), a rank of weight, log of weight, squared weight; 5-day, 22-day,
                  252-day, and 504 day average weights, calculated as mean own value divided by
                  mean of total-across-stocks value; historical mean dollar trading volume divided by
                  current price (thus adjusting for stock splits);

       Further Marketcap: Dummies for being among the top-500 or top-100 stocks by market-
                  cap; a nonlinear option-like transform (500 - rank for big firms, 0 beyond);

       Share-Price: Plain, squared, and log; stock split measures; Price is below $1, $10, $50, or
                  $100.

       Min-Max Distance: the percent Distance to All-time Max, to 252-Day Max, to All-time
                  Min, to 252-Day Min; all plain and squared;
           19
            The measures in Lee and Ready (1991), Kelley and Tetlock (2013), Boehmer et al. (2019) track retail
       investor order flow. This is likely to be related to changes in investment weights, not to levels. It is simply a
       different and mostly unrelated measure.

       Various: the largest-mcap stock in the same month, the number of stocks in month, the
              crsp day index, and even the permno as a placebo.


           The “transformed weight” input variables will play an important role and require
       explanation. They map a raw variable into a variable that mimicks a portfolio weight,
       such that the cross-sectional sum adds to 1.0 on each day. The calculation is equivalent
       to that used for value-weighted portfolios. For example, if stocks A-D have attributes 2, 4,
       6, and 8, the investment weights would be 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%. The advantage of
       such weight-normalized variables is that their units are easily relatable to the dependent
       variable, the ARH portfolio investment weight.

           The regression fit can also be improved with a later-stage equivalent portfolio-weight
       procedure. The OLS model fits some negative weights and the fitted portfolio weights
       would no longer add to 1. Thus, I truncate fitted values to 0 and then rescale the weights
       to add to 1. The reported R2 (and portfolio returns below) are based on these rescaled
       investing weights. (These R2 s are not our measure of forecasting success, especially not
       in-sample.)

           There are other more sophisticated econometric techniques that could be used to allow
       the statistical model to enforce these restrictions itself. However, this would make it more
       difficult to replicate the analysis and be subject to a “specification search” critique. The
       simplicity of the linear procedure (with weight adjustments) here is appealing.

           The first row in Panel A shows that the pre-2020 kitchen-sink regression can explain
       about 66.60% of the variation in ARH portfolio weights. However, it is not likely that such
       an overfitted highly-collinear model would remain stable over other sample periods. A
       kitchen-sink model is useful primarily to identify important variables (two stick out) and to
       learn the limit of how well a model with the employed variables could fit.


           A simpler model is more likely to be more stable and thus more useful out-of-sample. I
       therefore employed a “forward-selection” regression procedure on the kitchen-sink variables.
       The second row shows that a minimalist two-variable model can explain 58.81% of the
       variation in ARH weights:

          1. The mean share trading volume over the last year for each stock, divided by the mean
              total share trading volume (transformed into a portfolio weight);

                                                        19

          2. the same for dollar trading instead of share trading volume.

       The coefficient estimate on the former is about twice that of the coefficient estimate on the
       latter. I shall refer to the (renormalized) weights from this model as the “Quasi RobinHood”
       (“QRH”) portfolio.

              The model’s two input variables are mechanically correlated with one another. The
       dollar-volume is also nearly mechanically correlated with the not-included marketcap.
       Moreover, empirically, these two variables also correlate well with many other omitted
       variables such as return volatility and distance to min/max price.

              Two alternative specifications are similar and nearly as good. A first does not use a full
       year’s worth of trading, but a shorter period (merely a month). A second does not use the
       mean number of shares trading, but the mean dollar-volume of shares trading divided by
       the last price. (This is a sensible adjustment for stock splits.)

              When explaining ARH weights with attributes, it is true that there are still many other
       variables that could add statistically significant power. The table shows the performance of
       a few of them (based on intuition-augmented forward selection). On the margin relative to
       the QRH variables, the ARH portfolio still underweights the biggest 100 stocks, the biggest
       500 stocks, and younger firms. However, these are correlations merely on the margin, with
       most of their (unconditional) positive relation having already been captured by the two
       trading variables. Most importantly, their marginal increase in fitting the observed ARH
       weights is modest.20

              Panel B shows that all models perform worse in the post-2020 holdout sample—perhaps
       not surprising given the continued large inflow of RH investors and the turbulent market
       conditions. The kitchen-sink model’s explanatory power declines to 61.87%. The QRH
       model explains only 49.45%. The larger 12% difference relates to primarily to shorter-term
       (say, weekly) trading volume, which was not important in the 2018-9 sample but did
       become more important in 2020. As to the two coefficients themselves, the past-year share
       trading volume gains in importance relative to the past-year dollar trading volume.

              Panel C shows that a model that fits to the entire sample is similar to the 2018-9 sample,
       if only because it shares most of its observations with the former.

         20
              Not shown, the rate-of-return performance of these models is also just a few basis points better.


                                                              20

             [Insert Table 8 here: Implication of QRH Model Differences For QRH Investment Weights]


           Even when models (and their coefficients) look different, it is difficult to assess whether
       their predictions are similar. Panel A of Table 8 shows that differences in the ultimate
       weight predictions between using the pre-2020 coefficients or the post-2020 coefficients
       are small. The fitted weight correlations from the two models are always 98% or higher,
       regardless of sample (and specifically also out-of-sample to the holdout sample).

           Panel B shows that this similarity does not necessarily extend to the difference between
       the kitchen-sink and the two-variable models. For example, on June 30, 20202, the fitted
       investment weights from two models had only 87% correlation in this pure cross-section.
       Again, the correlation was better in the 2018-9 sample than it was more recently.


           Again appropriate cautions to the meaning of crowd portfolios and their returns apply.
       It seems implausible that bigger retail investors would have behaved just like the “micro”
       RH investors. With a different age profile, larger retail investors with more to loose may
       have preferred more conservative holdings—although even the RH crowd portfolio was by
       no means as aggressive as often claimed.

           In sum, the ARH portfolio tilted heavily towards stocks with a lot of trading activity
       over the past year. Other variables, even when statistically significant, don’t add a lot of
       explanatory power in fitted values to the QRH model portfolio.

           I can speculate that the remaining 40% unexplained variation in investment weights
       relates to stock attributes for which there are no readily available (long-term) comprehensive
       proxies. These would be variables such as excitement about or visibility of products by retail
       customers, measures of the share of consumer expenditures spent on these companies, their
       brand values and advertising, the excitement and promise of new technologies, and/or
       perhaps even their recent performance. Such variables could potentially help explain why
       RH investors liked Delta and American Airlines more than United Airlines; why they liked
       Ford better than General Motors; why they liked Disney more in 2020 than in 2018; or why
       they liked Facebook more in 2018 than in 2020. This investigation is left to future research.

       B    The Return Performance of The QRH vs. the ARH Portfolio

       I can now evaluate the performance of a portfolio that is inspired by—but not the same
       as—the ARH portfolio. This QRH portfolio tilts towards high volume and high dollar-
       volume stocks, in accordance with the QRH model from Table 7. As already noted, its fitted
       investment weights are truncated to be above zero, and its holdings are rescaled to sum
       to 1 first (before the QRH portfolio rate of return can be calculated). Importantly, it was
       formed based only on trading volume. It was not formed in a way to take into account any
       correlation in rates of return.

                [Insert Table 9 here: ARH and QRH Portfolio Return Correlations, 2018 – mid-2020]


           Table 9 shows that it does not matter whether returns are calculated from coefficients
       based on the pre-2020 or the post-2020 sample. In particular, I calculated one full series
       with “IS” coefficients, where each investment weight is based on the model in the same
       period, and one full series with “OOS” coefficients, where each investment weight is based
       on the model not estimated in the same sample period. (That is, I use the pre-2020 model
       coefficients on the post-2020 stock attributes and vice-versa.) The two return series had
       99.99% correlation with one another.

           Panel B shows that there is some further slippage in association when the universe is
       expanded to include all CRSP stocks and not just the stocks in the RH sample. (Adding
       about 300 albeit often smaller stocks, this yields a slightly different rate of return series.)
       The correlation between the two QRH series is an imperfect but unconcerning 99.78%.

           Panel C shows that much of the 97.82% correlation between the actual and the quasi RH
       portfolio rates of returns was due to shared exposure to the market-factor. After subtracting
       out the market rate of return, the correlation drops to a respectable but much lower 85%.
       Pushing this return-factor analysis one step further, the correlation between residuals from
       the ARH and the QRH models on the 5-F benchmark model is about 79%.

           To put this 79% figure in perspective, the 5-F residuals between the CRSP S&P-500 rate
       of return and the value-weighted rate of return is only 27% in the same time-period. The
       correlation of the residuals for the equal- and value-weighted market-portfolio is only 72%.
       There is more association between the ARH and the QRH portfolio than there is between
       common but different overall stock-market portfolio return measures.

                                                        22




This preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3696066
           In sum, the QRH portfolio return series is a good but not a perfect substitute for the
       ARH portfolio return series.



                 [Insert Table 10 here: Return Performance of the QRH Portfolio, 2018 – mid-2020]


           Table 10 shows the performance of the QRH portfolio in the 2018-2020 sample. In
       Panel A, on a daily basis, the QRH portfolio performed well, earning an alpha of about 5.1
       basis points per day net of the risk-free rate, and 4.2 basis points relative to the FF 5-factor
       model. Relative to the CAPM market-model, QRH earned an “on-model” 0.4% appropriate
       rate of return.

           However, the QRH portfolio delivered about 4 basis points less than the actual ARH
       portfolio from Table 6, statistically significant. The RH crowd simply knew better how to
       invest than this naive two-attribute QRH model.

           Panel B shows that the same inference obtains when trading is restricted to be once-per-
       month and returns are compounded over the following month. The QRH portfolio had a
       positive adjusted rate of return of 1.035% per month above the risk-free rate, and a positive
       alpha of of 0.505% on the 5-factor model. On the market-model, it lost an insignificant
       9.7 basis points per month. Again, the actual ARH portfolio comfortably outperformed the
       naive QRH portfolio.


           With a reasonable mode, we can now ask how a portfolio (of a crowd of retail investors)
       with QRH-like preferences would have performed over a longer horizon.

                   [Insert Table 11 here: Return Performance of the QRH Portfolio, 1980 – 2020]


           Table 11 shows that from 1980 to 2020, the QRH portfolio would by-and-large have
       achieved a similar performance as it did from 2018 to 2020. It would have had positive
       excess and 5-factor abnormal return performance, with modestly negative (and statistically
       insignificant) abnormal 1-F market abnormal return performance.

                     [Insert Table 6 here: Return Performance of the QRH Portfolio After 1980]


            Figure 6 shows the year-by-year performance of the QRH portfolio, with daily returns
       summed over yearly intervals. 1999 and 2009 were spectacularly good years for QRH
       investors, with performance about 30% better than that of the market. The worst year was
       2000, the year of the collapse of the “1999-9 Tech bubble period,” with underperformance
       of about 20% below an already dismal overall market performance. This conforms to
       informal anecdotes from the era. In contrast, 1999 and 2009 were exceptionally good years
       (perhaps leading to more exuberance of retail investors in the following year).


            Of course, with respect to QRH as a proxy, appropriate caution to the interpretation
       of this portfolio’s track record apply, too. Small retail investors could have had evolving
       preferences over the longer samples, and/or they could have had better stock-picking
       abilities and wisdom than this naive QRH model would suggest—which is reinforced by
       the higher alpha of ARH over QRH in the overlapping sample.



       VI      Conclusion

       By and large, RH investors liked to hold stocks with high trading activity over the last year.
       There were exceptions. They fell in love with some obscure experience stocks, such as
       cannabis stocks, and some risky technology/gamble stocks. And they displayed some of the
       same behavioral-finance biases documented in previous literature, especially with respect
       to purchasing stocks experiencing extreme stock price increases or decreases.

            Nevertheless, on the whole, the ARH crowd portfolio was not greatly tilted toward
       these stocks. RH investors’ more obscure buys, sales, and holdings are better described as
       “curiosity ingredients.” Overall, the ARH portfolio seemed more tilted away from the very
       largest stocks and towards actively-trading stocks with whose products retail customers
       would have been familiar with. By mid-2020, RH investors had even actively pivoted
       towards familiar fallen old-economy stalwarts like airline companies.

            The ARH “crowd wisdom investment portfolio” performed reasonably well, earning
       positive alpha with respect to the risk-free rate, the market-model, and (statistically sig-
       nificantly) the Fama-French 5-factor model. And the ARH portfolio earned these positive

                                                        24

       abnormal returns while RH investors acted as a contrarian market-stabilizing force and
       without panicking during the 33% Covid drop in March 2020. They increased investment
       funding, as measured by the 3-4 day (bank-transfer-lag induced) increase in their number
       of holdings. This steadfastness was presumably rewarded in the market recovery, although
       this timing would not be reflected in the ARH portfolio performance measures reported in
       my paper.

           Further analysis shows that a simple two-variable attribute model can explain a large
       part of RH investor ARH preferences (and consequent ARH portfolio return). This QRH
       model weighs the share trading volume about twice as much as the dollar trading volume
       (properly normalized). Until there is a better model or actual data, this simple two-variable
       model can act as a proxy for the investment performance of small RH-like retail investors
       in some contexts.

           My paper shows that the resulting QRH return factor could plausibly capture much of
       the RH investors’ preferences. The evidence suggests that QRH’s returns associated with
       ARH’s returns about as well as different stock market indexes associate with one another,
       all quoted above and beyond the 5-F model.

           When my paper then tracked the performance of the ARH-inspired QRH portfolio
       beginning in 1980, QRH had positive 0-F and 5-F alphas, too. Overall, QRH investors
       would not have suffered poor performance over a longer timeframe—although they would
       have underperformed especially badly in the year of tech collapse (2000).

                              Explanations: Stock-days are first grouped by net-of-market stock returns into about 20
                              (non-equal-spaced) categories. Within each category, the y-axis presents mean statistics for
                              the full sample (dark) and two subsamples (light, pre-2020 and post-2020). The top plot
                              shows (a dummy for) increases vs decreases. The bottom plot shows the net change in the
                              ARH investment weight. This weights a larger number of investor changes more (common
                              in bigger stocks with more RH holders) and also takes other ARH changes on the same day
                              into account.
                              Interpretation: RHers preferentially purchase large movers. This confirms earlier work.
                              Contrarian increases are concentrated in small stocks with small increases relative to total
                              number of RH holdings.

                                           the percent change of the sum-total in RH holdings. The red line indicates zero growth.

                             Explanations: The dependent variable Y in this time-series
                                                                                    P regression is the percent change
                             in the sum-total number of RH holdings, Yt ≡ %∆ t i RHi t . The market rate of return
                             is the percent change in the S&P 500. The “positive market movement” variables assign
                             zero on days when the market declined. The “negative market movement” variables are
                             analogous, except that they use the absolute value of R M , as indicated in the header. The
                             T-statistics are adjusted for heteroskedasticity and two lags as in Newey and West (1987).
                             Interpretation: 1-day lagged and 3-4 day-lagged large market movements are robust
                             positive predictors of increases in the sum-total number of RH holdings. The 1-day spike is
                             stronger on positive than on negative rates of return days, but it occurs in both. The 3-4
                             day spike is roughly symmetric.
                                                                           35

                             Explanations: RH is Robinhood, VW is value-weighted (always according to CRSP’s
                             shrout × |prc|). The stocks listed in this table (log-)ranked more highly in the invest-
                             ment holdings of RH investors than in the VW market portfolio either on 2019/12/31 or
                             on 2020/06/30, such that they constituted at least 0.15% of the ARH investment weight.
                             (All stocks listed in this table constituted less than 0.005% holdings in the VW portfolio.)

                                     Explanations: Each point is one stock’s percentage investment weight in ARH against the log
                                     market-cap rank (from CRSP). For example, in 2019/12, AAPL was the biggest stock by marketcap,
                                     but it accounted for “only” 2.3% of the ARH portfolio. For stocks with unusually large weights and
                                     for the biggest stocks, the figures show ticker symbols instead of points. The black (loess) line fits
                                     the (RH) points. The blue line shows the line that a market-cap VW portfolio would have assigned
                                     (which would have been about 4% for AAPL).
                                     Interpretation: Retail investors overweight many consumer-related tech stocks, as well as fallen
                                     angels (like Ford, GE, UAL) that probably remain because investors were reluctant to sell them. Retail
                                     investors systematically underinvest in the biggest 500 stocks, with notable consumer exceptions.

                             Explanations: These are the companies with the largest (absolute) excess ARH weights over the
                             value-weighted marketcap (VWM) weights either on 2018/12/31 or 2020/06/30. The holdings
                             changes and rates of return in the last four columns are from 2018/12/31 to 2020/06/30.
                             Interpretation: Some companies increased their ARH minus VW weights through active RH pur-
                             chases, some due to less purchasing of other stocks, and some due to price drops affecting the VW

                              Explanations: These are alphas from factor regressions based on the implied performance
                              of the ARH portfolio (formed on the basis of RH participation, as in equation 1). For
                              example, if 200 RH traders held stock A and 100 RH traders held stock B, the ARH portfolio
                              invests twice as much in A as in B (regardless of share price differences). After forming the
                              ARH portfolio, I calculate the portfolio rates of return and evaluate its performance with
                              respect to different benchmarks. The 0-F benchmark is the mean (net of the prevailing risk-
                              free rate (about 0 in the 2018-2020 sample). The 1-F benchmark is the CAPM market-model.
                              The 5-F benchmark is the Fama-French 5-factor model.
                              Interpretation: In a sample this short, only the daily evaluation seems reasonable. The
                              ARH crowd portfolio performed quite well. It tilted towards small stocks that invested
                              aggressively.

                              Explanations: This table shows the performance of regressions explaining the ARH investment
                              weights in grand pooled regressions. R̄2 are based on residuals where fitted values were winsorized
                              at 0 and renormalized to add to 1.
                              Interpretation: A model with only two variables—trading volume and dollar trading volume over
                              the last year—can explain over 50% of the ARH investment weights. (Not shown, this is also the
                              case if the prediction is purely cross-sectional on one specific day only.)

                              Explanations: These are correlations between fitted investment weights implied by differ-
                              ent regression models (and/or their coefficient estimates). All model-implied investment
                              weights were truncated at 0 and renormalized to sum to 1.
                               Interpretation: Coefficient-estimate differences between the 2018-9 and the 2020 model
                               for the QRH model seem unimportant. Coefficient model-estimate differences between the
                               kitchen-sink model and the simpler two-model QRH are more concerning.

                              Explanations: Unlike earlier tables (such as Table 8), this table investigates correlations
                              not in investment-weight space but in rate-of-return space. The QRH portfolio weights are
                              from the two-variable model in Table 7 (based on one year of share volume and dollar
                              volume). The IS performance uses the estimated weight coefficients from the full sample,
                              the OOS performance uses the coefficients from the post-2020 model with the pre-2020
                              volume data (and vice-versa). Panel B shows that there is some slippage when we include
                              stocks on CRSP but not in the Robintrack data. Panel C shows that the correlation between
                              ARH and QRH returns remains respectable even after subtracting ohter important factors.
                              Interpretation: The QRH investment strategy has return performance very similar to that
                              of the ARH strategy. However, Panel C shows that a good part of this is due to common
                              stock-market movements.

                             Explanations: For methods, see Table 6. The QRH portfolio here was formed based on lagged
                             one-year share volume and dollar share volume, in accordance with Table 7 in the “OOS” way
                             (model coefficients from other part). The table here presents alphas and exposures from factor
                             regressions based on the implied performance of the portfolio return time-series. The daily series
                             allow daily portfolio readjustment; the monthly series do not.
                             Interpretation: The QRH portfolio performed reasonably well. Like the ARH portfolio, the QRH
                             portfolio tilted towards small stocks with weak profitability. Although the QRH return time-series
                             matched the ARH return time-series reasonably well in its factor exposures (except in its exposure
                             to CMA, where it was less aggressive), it could not quite match the ARH portfolio’s performance
                             (alpha).

                               Explanations: For methods, see Table 6. This table is like Table 10, but the QRH strategy
                               is extended to 40 years of data (from 1980 to 2020). (Not Shown: a delay of one day or
                               month is largely inconsequential.)
                               Interpretation: The QRH portfolio would have underperformed on the 1-factor CAPM but
                               outperformed on the Fama-French 5-factor model.

                              Interpretation: The performance of a QRH portfolio was different but not worse than that
                              of the market. It was spectacularly good in 1999 and 2009, but even worse than the stock
                              market in the already bad 2000.
