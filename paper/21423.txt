                                              ABSTRACT

There has been commentary on the seeming success of the world trading system responding to the
large shock of the 2008 financial crisis without an outbreak of retaliatory market closing. The threat
of large retaliatory tariffs and fears of a 1930s style downturn in trade have been associated with numerical
trade modelling which project post retaliation optimal tariffs in excesses of 100%. In the relevant numerical
modelling it is common to use the Armington assumption of product heterogeneity by country. Here
we argue and show by numerical calculation that the widespread use of this assumption gives a large
upward bias to optimal tariffs, both first step and post retaliation, relative to alternative homogenous
good models used in trade theory.

1. Introduction


    The reasons why the Armington assumption is so widely used in numerical

modelling are well documented (see Whalley (1975) and Srinivasan and Whalley

(1986)). First, there is the size of intra-industry trade, which for the US can run at 80%

of gross trade for 2 digit HS trade data. Netting out trade flows as would be implied

by use of a homogenous goods trade model in the Hecksher-Ohlin tradition seems to

unrealistically shrink the role of trade. Second comes the feature of conventional

goods and factors models that the implied production possibilities frontiers with

conventional (Cobb-Douglas, CES) production functions are close to linear (see

Johnson, 1966) resulting in specialization in production in the model for even small

changes in trade policies such as tariffs. Third comes the convenience of allowing for

model calibration via the elasticities of substitution in preferences among Armington

goods to literature estimates of import price elasticities.


    This paper explores how the use of the Armington assumption of product

heterogeneity by country influences the size of optimal tariffs projected from

numerical trade modelling. Optimal tariff literature can been traced back to Johnson

(1953-1954), Gorman (1958) and Kuga (1973). Studies numerically calculating

optimal tariffs using data and calibration are few. Hamilton and Whalley (1983) is the

earliest, optimal tariffs here are up to 300% under different assumptions. Markusen

and Wigle (1989) numerically explore the roles of country size, scale economies and

capital mobility in optimal tariff. Perroni and Whalley (2000) calculate


                                             3
post-retaliation Nash tariff by region numerically and relate them to analyze the

regional agreement and trade liberalization. Optimal tariffs in this paper are up to

1000%. More recently, Ossa (2011) calculates non-cooperative tariffs numerically in a

“new trade” theory and analyzes GATT/WTO negotiations. Optimal tariffs here

ranges are up to 30% for different preference elasticities. Whalley et al. (2011) use

inside money trade imbalance model structure to numerically calculate optimal tariff

for China. Optimal tariffs in this paper are up to 200%. Ossa (2014) incorporates

political economy factors in a “new trade” model structure to numerically calculate

optimal tariff, trade war equilibrium tariff and trade talk equilibrium tariff. Optimal

tariffs in this paper are mostly less than 100%. These studies use an Armington

structure in numerical computation, but none of them connects on the influence of the

Armington assumption on optimal tariffs.


    Our approach is to consider three groups of models which we treat as

observationally equivalent in the sense that all the models within groups can all be

calibrated to the same base case data set. We then compute optimal tariffs for each and

compare their size.


    The first group of models are pure exchange 2-country 2-good models. One

model is of the Armington variety with country goods being endowed exclusively to

countries with goods interpreted as manufacturing and non-manufacturing, and with

trade taking place in the country goods. The other is homogeneous goods models with

net trade appearing in the two goods.




                                           4
    The second group of models are similar general equilibrium models but with an

added production structure and a balanced trade assumption. Endowments of traded

goods in the pure exchange model are replaced by endowments of productive inputs.

One model is again of the Armington type with product heterogeneity by country and

two produced goods for each country and two factor inputs. Specialization is avoided

since specialization already occurs in Armington goods. The other model incorporates

homogenous goods in each country but uses production structures with fixed sector

specific inputs and diminishing marginal productivity of mobile across sector labor.

The model avoids specialization by using a construction in which the marginal

productivity of labor equals zero as output in the sector approaches zero.


    The third group of models are similar general equilibrium with production, but

trade is unbalanced. We use exogenous fixed trade imbalances in both homogeneous

and Armington good models. Structures in the third group are thus the same as in the

second group except trade imbalance assumption. In total there are six models (three

groups and two models in each group).


    We then construct a base case data set for calibration of all models which

identifies the US, the EU, China and ROW (the rest of the world) as separate entities.

We use trade and production data for 2013 taken separately from United Nations

Comtrade database and World Bank World Development Indicators database (WDI).

We adjust for trade imbalances to yield data sets in both adjusted form (meeting

country trade balance) and in unadjusted form incorporating trade imbalances.




                                           5
    We perform calibration of each model type to the relevant data set, assuming

CES preferences, CES technology in goods and factor (Armington) models, and

diminishing marginal productivity functions. We then use GAMS solutions software

to compute optimal tariffs for alternative groups of countries into pairwise categories

discussed in the text (US-ROW, EU-ROW, and China-ROW). The use of these

pairwise groups reflects the difficulties of computing post retaliation (Nash) tariffs in

higher dimensions than 2, and follows considerable earlier literature. We compute

both first step and post retaliation (Nash) tariffs.


    We report optimal tariff calculation results and these show optimal tariff in the

hundreds of percent (depending specifically on elasticity parameters) for Armington

type models which are much smaller for comparable homogenous good models.

Differences between Armington and non-Armington model results are similar for

models with production and models without production. Models with and without

trade imbalances yield similar optimal tariffs. Optimal tariffs post retaliation and first

step are not that different. The difference in results for Armington models reflects the

large terms of trade effects present in these models.


    Our analysis thus suggests that optimal tariffs in models using the Armington

goods assumption are significantly larger than the ones in homogeneous goods

assumption, and that the Armington assumption does produce a larger upward bias

regarding optimal tariffs. As computations for Armington type models have been the

basis for the belief that trade retaliation, if unchecked, will lead to both very high

tariff and a sharp decline of trade, the behavior of major global economies in the

                                              6
2008/2009 crisis is seen as hard to explain. Our results suggest a change in model

structure to homogenous goods goes a long way to accounting for this phenomena.

2. Groups of Models and the Experiments


       We use three groups of models to calculate optimal tariffs. Each group of models

includes alternatively the use of a homogenous goods assumption and an Armington

goods assumption of product heterogeneity by country. The three groups of models

are pure exchange models, balanced trade general equilibrium production models, and

imbalanced trade general equilibrium production models. The basic structure of our

models is two countries, two goods (manufacturing goods and non-manufacturing

goods) and two input factors (labor and capital), see Figure 1. Detailed model

descriptions are given in an Appendix1. We explore how the Armington assumption

influences the size of optimal tariffs.

       2.1 Pure Exchange Models


       The pure exchange models we use is a two-country and two-goods structure. In

the model group, two countries are sequentially and separately identified as the US

and ROW (Rest of the World), the EU (European Union) and ROW, and China and

ROW. The two goods are manufacturing goods and non-traded non-manufacturing

goods. Each country has an endowment of goods. We assume preference functions are

CES (Constant Elasticity of Substitution) style. In the homogenous goods models, one

country trades one good with the other country, and the same good in the two

countries has the same price. In the equilibrium, all goods will be consumed, each

country’s total export value equals its import value. For the Armington goods models,

goods from different countries are heterogeneous and there is an elasticity of

substitution, in the preference function which is two-level CES. In the equilibrium,

goods markets will clear, and goods prices are determined by demands and supply.


    2.2 With Production General Equilibrium Models (Balanced Trade)


     In this group of general equilibrium models, production and consumption are

both included. The models are again two-country two-goods and two-factor structures.

For the Armington models of this group, preference functions are again two-level

CES. The same goods from different countries are heterogeneous and so there are no

specialization problems. Production functions in the Armington goods models are

CES. In order to avoid specialization problems, we use fixed sector specific inputs

and diminishing marginal productivity production functions in which the marginal

productivity of labor equals zero as output in the sector approaches zero. In the

equilibrium, goods and factor markets in every country again clear. In this group all

structures have balanced trade, and every country’s total exports equals its total

imports in value terms.

    2.3 With Production General Equilibrium Models (Unbalanced Trade)


    This group of models have the same structure as the balanced trade models above,

the only difference being we capture unbalanced trade. We include an exogenous

fixed trade imbalance structure into the general equilibrium model, in which each

country’s trade imbalance is fixed and total world trade is balanced. All other model

features are the same as the balanced trade with production general equilibrium

model.


    Our simulation experiments use these three different groups of models, and

include both the homogeneous goods assumption and the Armington goods

assumption for each group. We separately compute optimal tariffs for all models. We

then compare optimal tariffs under homogeneous goods assumption to optimal tariffs

under the Armington goods assumption for each group of models, and we assess how

the Armington assumption influences optimal tariffs.

3. Data and Model Calibration


      We use 2013 as our base year and build a global benchmark general equilibrium

dataset for use in calibration and simulation following the methods set out in Shoven

and Whalley (1992).


      Our numerical models have three different country group datasets, which are

China and ROW (rest of the world), the US (United States) and ROW, the EU

(European Union) and ROW. Our benchmark datasets are all two country. ROW data

is obtained from total world values minus values for the other specific country. For

the two goods, we assume secondary industry (manufacturing) reflects manufactured

goods, and primary and tertiary industries (agriculture, extractive industries, and

services) yield non-manufacturing non-traded goods. For the two factor inputs, capital

and labor, we use total labor income (wage) to denote labor values for inputs by sector.

All data are in billion US dollars. We adjust some of the data for mutual consistency

for calibration purposes.


      All data are from the World Bank database (World Development Indicators).

These data are listed in Table 1. We use the agriculture and service share of GDP data

and    GDP data      to     yield   production    data   of   manufacturing   goods   and

non-manufacturing goods, and use capital/GDP ratios to yield capital and labor inputs

in production.


      Trade data for each pair of countries are from the UN Comtrade database. We use

individual country total export and import values to yield exports to and imports from

                                             11
the ROW. For China in 2013, exports are 2209.1 billion US$, imports are 1949.9

billion US$; for the US in 2013, exports are 1578.1 billion US$, imports are 2328.3

billion US$; and for the EU in 2013, exports are 2326.3 billion US$, imports are

2243.4 billion US$ (Comtrade, 2015). For the balanced trade structures, we use export

values to represent every country’s imports and trade. Using production and trade data,

we can then calculate each country’s consumption.

      Elasticities for individual countries on the demand and production sides of the

model are determined in two ways in our numerical models. We first use import

demand elasticities from literatures, and use these values to yield preference and

production function side elasticities of substitution. This is an indirect method to get

the preference and production elasticities. We assume that elasticities of substitution

in preference and production are equal. This is the usual process as calibration in

other models.


      We get elasticities of substitution directly from literatures. This is a direct usual


                                                                 12
way of numerical general equilibrium calibration for elasticities. Many of the

estimates of domestic and import goods substitution elasticity are around 2 (Betina et

al., 2006), so we again set all these elasticities in our models to 2.0 (Whalley and

Wang, 2010). We change elasticities to perform sensitivity analysis.


    The other way involves calculating preference and production elasticities from

import demand elasticities using a search methodology. We keep the elasticities of

substitution in preference and production equal. We then try different preference

elasticities to calculate import demand elasticities (the method uses a one percent

consumption price increase in the benchmark model to generate a new import demand,

and then calculating the implied import demand elasticity), and search for a elasticity

level that gives import demand elasticities equal to what we find in the literature.


    According to Kee et al. (2008), the import demand elasticities for China are -1.44,

the US are -2.09, the EU are -1.33 (mean of all OECD countries), and the ROW are

-1.20 (mean of overall countries). In Senhadji (1998) and Tokarick (2014), the results

are somewhat different, so we cannot get a uniform value for the import demand

elasticities. Thus we calibrate import demand elasticities of all countries to equal 2.0

in both models.


     With these data and elasticities, we can calibrate remaining model parameters.

When used in model solution these regenerate the benchmark data as an equilibrium

for the model. Using these parameters we use the models to calculate optimal tariffs.




                                           13
4. Optimal Tariff Calculations


     We compute and compare optimal tariffs using the homogeneous goods and

Armington goods models for the three different model structures discussed earlier.

The first model structure is a pure exchange model type, the second is a balanced

trade production general equilibrium model type, and the third is a unbalanced trade

production general equilibrium model type.


     In the calculation of optimal tariffs, we use the two methods to determine

elasticities of substitution in preference and production discussed above. The first is

the indirect method from calibration to import demand elasticities, which we call it

“indirect elasticities”. The second is the “direct method” from literature, which we

call it “direct elasticities”. We perform sensitivity analysis to presenting of preference

elasticities. We consider two different optimal tariffs following Hamilton and Whalley

(1983). One is “first step” optimal tariff, and the other is post retaliation optimal

tariffs.


     In computation, we need to assume a predetermined direction of trade which

remains unchanged in the face of tariff retaliation. We follow the process of retaliation

through which optimal tariffs are calculated by each country, and revised in light of

any changes in tariffs adopted by the other country. When no further retaliation occurs,

an approximation to the Nash equilibrium is achieved. In calculating post retaliation

optimal tariffs, we iterate over calculations of optimal tariffs by individual countries

to tariff settings of other countries subject to the constraint of full general equilibrium.


                                            14
We then iterate across country tariffs until convergence to a non-cooperative Nash

equilibrium is achieved. Convergence is rapid in all the cases we have examined.


       4.1 Pure Exchange Model Calculation


      Optimal tariffs for pure exchange models are reported in Table 2 under the

indirect preference elasticity determination scenario, Table 3 reports results under

direct preference elasticity determination.


      Using the indirect elasticity determination method, optimal tariffs for Armington

models are much larger for individual countries than optimal tariffs in homogeneous

goods models. This suggests the claim that the Armington assumption cause a large

upward bias to optimal tariffs.

      Taking the US and ROW country group as an example, the first step optimal

tariffs for the US under homogeneous goods and Armington goods are separately 12.5%

and 88%, and the post retaliation optimal tariffs are separately 7.6% and 78.7%. The

first step optimal tariffs for ROW under homogeneous goods and Armington goods

                                                               15
are separately 40.9% and 121.5%, and the post retaliation optimal tariffs are

separately 35.7% and 96.2%. Hence, optimal tariffs under Armington assumption are

clearly much larger than under the homogeneous goods assumption.


      Under the direct elasticity determination method, optimal tariffs of Armington

goods are again much larger than optimal tariffs under homogeneous goods. Bigger

countries have larger optimal tariffs and this trend is more significant in homogeneous

goods condition.


      Taking the China-ROW group as an example. China’s first step optimal tariffs

and post retaliation optimal tariff are separately 8.3% and 5.5% for homogeneous

goods, and are separately 109.8% and 103.8% for Armington goods. ROW’s first step

optimal tariff and post retaliation optimal tariffs are separately 41.9% and 44.9% for

homogeneous goods, and are separately 161.4% and 127.7% for Armington goods.

       Sensitivity analysis (results are reported in an Appendix) of optimal tariffs to

preference elasticities confirms that optimal tariffs under the Armington goods


                                                               16
assumption are always larger than under the homogeneous goods assumption.

Optimal tariffs are sensitive to preference elasticities, and have a negative relation

with preference elasticities i.e. bigger preference elasticities will generate smaller

optimal tariffs.


       4.2 GE with Production and Balanced Trade Model Calculation


      We next add production to pure exchange models and used a balanced trade

treatment. We again compute optimal tariffs separately with indirect elasticity

determination method and direct elasticity determination method, and report

sensitivity analysis to preference elasticities. Table 4 and Table 5 report these results.

      Using indirect elasticity determination, optimal tariffs under the Armington goods

assumption are again much larger than under a homogeneous goods assumption, and

bigger countries have larger optimal tariffs. Taking the EU-ROW group as an example,

the EU’s first step optimal tariffs for homogeneous goods and Armington goods are

separately 5.6% and 87.1%, and the post retaliation optimal tariffs are separately 3.8%

and 85.8%. ROW’s first step optimal tariffs for homogeneous goods and Armington


                                                               17
goods are separately 9.2% and 92.8%, and the post retaliation optimal tariffs are

       For direct elasticity determination, optimal tariffs under Armington goods are

significantly larger than of homogeneous goods, and bigger economic scale countries

have larger optimal tariffs.

       Sensitivity analysis of optimal tariffs to preference elasticities indicate that

optimal tariffs decrease as preference elasticities increase. Also, optimal tariffs using

the Armington goods assumption are much larger than optimal tariffs in homogeneous

goods (detailed results are reported in an Appendix2).


       4.3 GE with Production and Unbalanced Trade Model Calculation


       We next add trade imbalances to the balanced general equilibrium models with

production. We compute optimal tariffs with indirect and direct preference elasticity

determination methods, and compare optimal tariffs of homogeneous goods with

Armington goods. Results are reported in Tables 6 and 7.

optimal tariffs under Armington goods are larger than those under homogeneous

goods, and bigger preference elasticity generates smaller optimal tariffs.


                                                               19
5. Conclusions


     In this paper, we explore the influence of the Armington assumption on optimal

tariffs. Earlier optimal tariff theory is based on homogeneous good models, but the

Armington assumption has become a prevalent structure used in numerical

computation.


     We use three groups of models to numerically calculate optimal tariffs in

homogeneous goods and Armington goods models. These are pure exchange models,

balanced trade general equilibrium models with production and unbalanced trade

general equilibrium models with production. We use two different preference

elasticity determination methods in calibration and generate two different sets of

results in each group models. We also perform sensitivity analysis of optimal tariffs to

preference elasticities.


     Our simulation results suggests that optimal tariffs computed using the

Armington assumption are much larger than those using the homogeneous goods

assumption, and thus the Armington assumption has a significant upward bias to

optimal tariffs. Bigger countries have larger optimal tariffs, which means that country

scale has a positive influence to optimal tariffs. Optimal tariffs are also sensitive to

preference elasiticities, and larger preference elasticities generate smaller optimal

tariffs.

A. Detailed Model Structures

       We put model descriptions in this part, include pure exchange model, balanced

trade general equilibrium model and imbalanced general equilibrium model.

       A1. Pure Exchange Models

       In pure exchange models, we only need to take account of the consumption side.

One country’s endowment is a fixed amount of goods so that production is not

included in the model structure. Our pure exchange models are two-country and

two-goods structure. Two countries have three different groups, a China-ROW (rest of

the world) group, a US-ROW group and an EU-ROW group. Two goods are

manufacturing goods and non-manufacturing goods.


       A1.1 Homogeneous Goods Model


       Under the homogeneous goods assumption, same goods from different countries

are homogeneous. Both countries will use their abundant goods to exchange for other

goods with other countries. We assume the endowment of country i for goods l as

  l
Qi    , and it is exogenously given. For the consumption, we take the constant elasticity

of substitution (CES) utility function for each country

      We introduce import tariff t i (import tariff level of country i ) into the model.

This yields the following relation between consumption prices and domestic sale

prices ( p lj )


      pc i  (1  t i ) p j

      In the balanced trade, total income should equal to total expenditure, so that

Ei  I i .


      A1.2 Armington Goods Model

                                                                                            23
     In the Armington goods assumption, same goods from different goods are

heterogeneous so that the consumption has two levels. The first level is choosing

between two different goods, and the second level is choosing goods from different

countries under specific goods. We assume that only manufacturing goods are

tradable, so both countries only exchange with manufacturing goods.


     The same as in the homogeneous goods, We assume the endowment of country

i for goods l as Q il , and it is exogenously given. On the consumption side, we take


a nested CES utility function for each country

      A2. Balanced Trade Production General Equilibrium Models


     We add production part into pure exchange model and get the balanced general

equilibrium model. Our balanced general equilibrium models are two-country,

two-goods with factors structure. Two countries include China-ROW group, the

US-ROW group and the EU-ROW group. Two goods are manufacturing goods and



                                                                        26

is labor. In the Armington goods model, it has two factors which are labor and capital.

use the fixed sector specific inputs and diminishing marginal productivity production

      In the balanced trade assumption, total income equals total expenditure, so

Ei  I i .


      A3. Unbalanced Trade Production General Equilibrium Models


      We add an exogenous fixed trade imbalance assumption into the balanced

general equilibrium model and then get the imbalanced general equilibrium models.

All other parts of the model structure are the same as in balanced general equilibrium

models. Exogenous fixed trade imbalance assumption means that one country’s trade



                                                                          32
imbalance are exogenously determined and fixed in a level and do not change.


     In the homogeneous goods model, we have a two countries, two goods and one

factor structure. Two countries are China-ROW group, the US-ROW group and the

EU-ROW group. Two goods are manufacturing goods and non-manufacturing goods.

One factor is labor. Production function in the model is a fixed sector specific inputs

and diminishing marginal productivity type, consumption function in the model is a

CES type.


     In the Armington goods model, we use a two countries, two goods and two

factors structure. Two countries are China-ROW group, the US-ROW group and the

EU-ROW group. Two goods are manufacturing goods and non-manufacturing goods.

Two factors are labor and capital. Production function in the model is a CES type, and

consumption function is a two-level nested CES type.


     In the balanced trade general equilibrium models, total income equals total

expenditure. But in the imbalanced trade general equilibrium models, total income

will not equal total expenditure. We assume a trade surplus S i for country i , and

this trade surplus value are fixed and exogenously determined. If S i is bigger than 0,

it denotes trade surplus, and if S i is smaller than 0, it denotes trade deficit. In the

equilibrium, we have


     Ei  I i  S i                                                              (A45)


Additionally, total world trade surplus should equal to 0, so that

B. Sensitivity Analysis Results

       We report detailed sensitivity analysis results here. Three groups of models are

analyzed separately one by one.

      B1. Pure Exchange Models

       Sensitivity analysis of optimal tariffs to preference elasticities and check confers

optimal tariffs in Armington goods assumption are always larger than in homogeneous

goods assumption. Optimal tariffs are sensitive to preference elasticities, and have a

negative relation with preference elasticities (See Table B1 and Figure B1).

    B2. With Production Balanced Trade GE Models

     Sensitivity analysis of optimal tariffs to preference elasticities indicate that

optimal tariffs decrease as preference elasticities increase. Also, optimal tariffs using

the Armington goods assumption are much larger than optimal tariffs in homogeneous

goods (See Table B2 and Figure B2).

               Sensitivity analysis of optimal tariffs to preference elasticities indicate that

optimal tariff of Armington goods are larger than the ones of homogeneous goods,

and bigger preference elasticity generates smaller optimal tariffs (See Table B3 and
