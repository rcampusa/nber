Though previous studies have noted the role of skilled labor in the growth of the Indian software industry,
they have not empirically investigated its importance. In this study we study the effect of the supply
of engineers, measured by engineering baccalaureate capacity, on the regional growth of the software
exports between 1990 and 2003. We find significant effect of engineering baccalaureate capacity on
the growth of software exports even after controlling for other relevant factors. This conclusion is
especially interesting because much of this capacity is due to private, rather than publicly supported
colleges, and testifies to the private willingness to invest in human capital even in poor countries.

Non Technical Summary
        The importance of human capital -- skilled and creative workers -- to a “high-tech”
industry is routinely acknowledged but often public policy discussions tend to focus on more
trendy prescriptions such technology parks, venture capital, incubators and university industry
centers. Software relies intensively upon human capital, perhaps more so than any other high-
tech industry. Software services, the engine of the Indian software sector, is arguably even
more human capital intensive than software products. Thus, few would question the role of
human capital stocks in the rise of the Indian software industry. Indeed, one might argue that
the plenitude of engineers has created a comparative advantage for India in software service
exports.
        Between 1985 and 2003, undergraduate engineering baccalaureate capacity increased
from about 45,000 (59 per million) to about 440,000 (405 per million), even as the total
population increased from 765 million to 1086 million. What is less clearly appreciated is that
there are significant variations across Indian states in stocks of the relevant human capital,
engineers, and that these differences have played an important part in conditioning where the
software industry has flourished. Even less well understood are the reasons for this regional
disparity in human capital stocks.
        In this paper we empirically investigate how software exports by the fourteen major
states of India are conditioned by local levels of human capital, as measured by the state level
engineering baccalaureate capacity. Our research covers fourteen states of India, for the period
1990-20032. These fourteen states accounted for 83.47 percent of the country’s population in
2003, 78 percent geographic area of India, and 79.2 percent of the net domestic product in
2001-02.3
        We find that differences in software exports by states are related to the supply of human
capital even after controlling for factors such as how rich or large the state is, and measures of
industrial production, electronics production or telecommunication investment. Since
engineering education has been controlled and, in the main, provided by state funded colleges,
differences in the willingness of states to invest in engineering colleges could, but do not,
explain the bulk of the inter-state variation. Instead, it is the role of private engineering colleges
which is the key the puzzle. Simply put, states which allowed private engineering colleges to

enter early were able to get a head start and, this early advantage has persisted for nearly a
decade and a half.
       In other words, states were favored locations for software development because they
had higher stocks of human capital, and they had higher stocks of human capital because they
allowed private engineering colleges to operate earlier than other states. We test this hypothesis
using a new, hand collected data set of state level software exports and state level engineering
baccalaureate capacity in India for a fourteen year period that coincides with the rise of India as
a software power. Our identifying assumption is that initially demand for engineers from the
software industry was small, and changes in the number of engineers produced was
independent of the current or anticipated growth of the software industry. Indeed, a key source
of variation is that some states in India allowed the entry of private engineering colleges much
earlier than the rest. These tend to be the states that also subsequently became the major
poles of software exports.
       The number of engineering colleges in India increased from 246 in 1987 to 353 in 1995
and over 1100 in 2003. Eighty percent of new colleges added between 1987 and 1995 were in
the private sector and the share of private colleges was even higher at 94 percent for colleges
added between 1995 and 2002. Permitting privately financed colleges helped mitigate the
adverse effects of the lack of public investments in higher education. It did not completely
ameliorate the problem because, as noted earlier, there has been a marked fall in the
production of engineering PhDs, even as baccalaureate capacity has increased.
Knowledgeable observers of the Indian software industry, and the leading firms themselves, are
increasingly concerned about the divergence, which also points to the limits of relying solely
upon private financing for human capital development.

Introduction
       The Indian software industry, which was almost non-existent till late 1980s, grew at
tremendous pace after early 1990s. The Indian software exports were about $128 millions in
1990-91 and grew to $485 millions by 1994-95. By 2003-04 the software exports had increased
to $12.2 billions. Though differences in definition imply that US government figures show much
lower level of software exports from India, there is no denying that they have grown dramatically
over the last two decades, growing at an average of about 30% per year.
       India is not the only country to have succeeded in software exports. Israel and Ireland
are two other countries that have also achieved software success (Arora and Gambardella,
2005). One common element in all three countries is the role of human capital supply. The
importance of skilled manpower, of engineers in particular, to Indian software exports is widely
recognized (e.g., Lakha, 1994; Arora and Athreye, 2002). Between 1985 and 2003,
undergraduate engineering baccalaureate capacity increased from about 45,000 (59 per million)
to about 440,000 (405 per million), even as the total population increased from 765 million to
1086 million. Indeed, one might argue that the plenitude of engineers has created a
comparative advantage for India in software service exports.
       But the unasked question is – whence did plenitude arise? How did a poor country, with
a perpetual problem of financing public expenditure, create so many engineers? An important
part of the answer is that it was the private sector that fuelled this increase. For institutional
reasons, most of the additional engineering education capacity created in India was in the form
of new colleges, and the vast bulk of these colleges were private colleges, privately financed
principally from student tuition revenues. The number of engineering colleges in India increased
from 246 in 1987 to 353 in 1995 and over 1100 in 2003. Eighty percent of new colleges added
between 1987 and 1995 were in the private sector and the share of private colleges was even
higher at 94 percent for colleges added between 1995 and 2002. Software exports were also
growing rapidly during this period, and software exports and engineering education capacity
appear closely linked.
       One way to study this relationship is through its regional dimension. Arora et al. (2001)
suggest that large share of south and west region in engineering baccalaureate capacity,
spurred by the growth of private engineering colleges, was one of main reasons for growth of
software industry in those regions. In this paper we empirically investigate how software
exports by the fourteen major states of India are conditioned by local levels of human capital, as
measured by the state level engineering baccalaureate capacity. The simple point of the paper
is that some states were favored locations for software because they had higher stocks of
                                                                                                                  5

human capital, and they had higher stocks of human capital because they allowed private
engineering colleges to operate earlier than other states. We test this hypothesis using a new,
hand collected data set of state level software exports and state level engineering
baccalaureate capacity in India for a fourteen year period that coincides with the rise of India as
a software power. Our identifying assumption is that initially demand for engineers from the
software industry was small, and changes in the number of engineers produced was
independent of the current or anticipated growth of the software industry.
        Our research covers fourteen states of India, for the period 1990-20034. These fourteen
states accounted for 83.47 percent of the country’s population in 2003, 78 percent geographic
area of India, and 79.2 percent of the net domestic product in 2001-02.5. As well, the available
data require that our measure of software exports is a broad one, including not only the export
of software, but also affiliated IT services, including the so-called IT enabled service. IT enabled
services are relatively unimportant in terms of revenues for much of our sample and only
become significant after the turn of the century. As well, such services, particularly low-end
services such as call centers, rarely employ engineers. Their exclusion would therefore only
strengthen our results. These, and other issues related to our data are discussed in more detail
in the appendix.
        There are empirical challenges in such research. First, there may be unobservable state
characteristics that are correlated with software industry and engineering baccalaureate
capacity. Second, there is issue of endogeneity of engineering baccalaureate capacity. We
address this by using a panel dataset and controlling for state fixed effects. We also develop an
instrument, discussed in greater detail below, for engineering baccalaureate capacity.
        The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the
relevant literature dealing with the Indian software industry as well as the literature on
agglomeration. Section 3 describes the character, size and regional spread of software exports
industry. Section 4 describes the size, growth of technical education in India, its regional
dimension and importance of private sector. Section 5 develops a simple model linking the
baccalaureate capacity and software production and motivates the empirical specification.
Section 6 describes the data. We present results and alternative explanations in section 7.
Section 8 summarizes the policy implications and concludes.

II Literature review
        The first contribution of our paper is to document and explore the role of education policy
in the growth of Indian software exports. Specifically, it points to the importance of a human
capital producing sector that responds to market demands. In India, access to engineering
education was rationed for several years because expanding engineering education capacity
was a lower priority for state and federal governments. The slow economic growth in the 1970s
and 1980s meant that the social return to such investments was thought to be low. The private
return, however, was high, especially for those engineers that went to work overseas. Indeed, it
is widely believed that there was excess demand for admission to engineering colleges, with
periodic political and legal battles about the ability of privately run colleges to charge market
level tuitions.6 A key policy innovation was to allow privately funded colleges to satisfy this
latent demand. As the success of this policy became clearer, other states followed suit. This
variation in timing is the key variation that identifies the effect we seek to estimate.
        Our findings also speak to the issue of high tech clusters. The bulk of Indian software
industry is concentrated in a few clusters; indeed Bangalore has often been branded as the
Silicon Valley of India in press accounts. Following Marshall, Ellison, Glaeser and Kerr (2007)
argue that ultimately, firms agglomerate to save the costs of transporting either goods (inputs
and outputs), people, or ideas, and find support for all three.7 The literature on clusters and
agglomeration is huge and we refer the reader to overviews such as Fujita and Thisse (1996),
Fujita, Krugman and Venebles (2001), and Rosenthal and Strange (2004). Our paper is not
about clustering or agglomeration in general, but rather about the agglomeration of the Indian
software industry. Thus, we are interested in understanding not simply whether and why Indian
software exporting firms cluster, but principally where they cluster and the reasons for that.
        In seeking to understand where high tech industries cluster, stories inspired by the
Silicon Valley experience stress the role of an anchor university, labor mobility, venture
capitalists and networks of specialized firms (cf. Saxenian, 1994). Others highlight the superior
availability of infrastructure (Kapur, 2002). In 1990s many state governments in India set up
information technology (IT) parks, which provided physical infrastructure such as building space
and electrical power.8 Though infrastructure was undoubtedly important, our results suggest

6
  Since tuitions were regulated and fixed by the government, private colleges circumvented this by charging
“capitation fees”, which were, in effect, the capitalized value of the tuition they would have liked to charge.
7
  Ellison, Glaeser and Kerr (2007) use patterns of co-agglomeration to quantify the importance of these three
transaction costs. Audretch and Feldman (1996) seek to explain the extent to which R&D intensive industries are
more likely to agglomerate.
8
  The Software Technology Parks (STP) scheme in 1991 provided reliable internet connectivity and single window
clearance for various government permissions to software export firms. There were other schemes like export
                                                                                                                       7

that software exports are regionally agglomerated in significant measure because of clustering
in a key input, namely engineers.
         Klepper (2007) argues that industries cluster in regions which are home to the early
industry leaders. He argues that the semiconductor producers cluster in the Silicon Valley
because many are spin-offs of some of the early leaders. In particular, he documents that
Fairchild, a firm that pioneered the planar process and the integrated circuit, two of the
fundamental semiconductor innovations, spawned a number of the firms that would later
dominate the Silicon Valley and the semiconductor industry, including Intel, AMD, National
Semiconductors, Micron Technology and VLSI Technology. Interestingly, Klepper (2007)
argues that a similar process explains the concentration of the automobile industry around
Detroit and the tire industry around Akron Ohio. Our results are consistent with Klepper’s
explanation for industrial agglomeration, but our focus is not on the identities of the firms.
         Berry and Glaeser (2006) develop a theoretical model to explain their finding that US
metropolitan areas have diverged in terms of skill intensity over time. In their model,
entrepreneurs arise randomly from among those with high human capital. These entrepreneurs
are assumed to create firms in the cities where they live. If these firms are disproportionately
likely to hire high human capital workers, then if workers are mobile, over time cities with higher
initial levels of human capital will also disproportionately attract high human capital workers,
leading to a divergence across cities in the share of high human capital workers. We too
develop a simple model that motivates our empirical analysis. As in Berry and Glaeser,
graduating engineers in our model have varying levels of preference for the city in which they go
to college (which, in India, is often close to their birthplace). We ignore amenities and assume
that firms are price takers in both the product and the input market. It follows that cities with
more graduating engineers will attract or create more firms, resulting in these cities having
higher software exports.
         There are alternative explanations offered for the rise of the software industry in India,
some of which have implications for its regional location. The first is the presence of public
sector R&D units. Balakrishnan (2006), for instance, has argued that the presence of public
sector R&D institutions, including nine defense related laboratories, in Bangalore accounts for
the location of the software industry in Bangalore. Once in place, increasing returns would
reinforce the initial lead. In our estimations, state fixed effects should account for such


processing zones which offered similar incentives to firms locating in such zones. However, STP scheme offers
much higher level of flexibility to firms in their location choices and was targeted to software export firms. Firms
could locate anywhere and were required to register with designated STP office to avail various incentives.
                                                                                                        8

differences. We also control for electronics production to take into account potential knowledge
spillovers. Moreover, as we show below, the factual premise, namely that entrants were initially
mostly located in Bangalore is simply wrong.
       Srinivasan (2006) singles out telecommunication reforms and the creation of Software
Technology Parks (STPs) as key pieces of the puzzle. In our empirical analysis, we control for
industrial production and teledensity to control for physical and telecommunication
infrastructure. Further, initial software exports consisted of software programmers being sent
overseas on short term assignment, and physical and telecommunication infrastructure was less
critical than when such work began to be shifted to India. We cannot control for STPs directly.
However, as we discuss below, STPs were not important locations for software export prior to
1998 or so.
       Other explanations have to do with the role of the diaspora, and the role of
entrepreneurship. As we argue in greater detail later, these are complementary to the human
capital based explanation analyzed here. Simply put, if much of the diaspora also consists of
engineers, as is plausible, then regions abundant in engineers are also likely to be the source of
the diaspora, and hence, disproportionately likely to benefit from the diasporic connections.
Similarly, if entrepreneurs are more likely to have an engineering background, then regions that
produce more engineers will be home to more entrepreneurs.

III. The Indian Software Industry:
According to an early study, Indian software exports were a mere $4 millions in 1980 and rose
to $27.7 millions in 1985 (Heeks, 1996). Exports reached $128 millions in 1990. The industry
grew very rapidly in the 1990s and exports were over $12 billion in 2003-04.
       An important feature of Indian software exports has been the very high human capital
intensity, relative to other inputs. Initially, the bulk of the exports consisted of sending software
developers to work at the client site in America, on short term assignments. Later, teams of
software developers were sent overseas, and only by the mid 1990s, was there significant
software activity taking place locally. Initially, physical and communication infrastructure was far
less important than commonly believed for the growth of the Indian software exports. Instead,
the keys to growth were contacts with potential clients in America and Western Europe, and
access to high quality engineers. Indeed, the survey conducted by Arora et al. (2001) referred
to earlier found that 57% firms reported manpower shortages as among their most important
problems. The next highest problems were employee attrition (44%), market access (42%), and
                                                                                                                       9

getting visas (33%). Bringing up the rear were physical infrastructure (12%) and lack of
government support (10%).
           Thus, employment has closely tracked revenues in this industry. The number of
professionals was merely 6800 in 1985 and increased more than eight fold in the next five years
to 56,000 (Table 1). The growth was at smaller pace in next decade and number of
professionals rose to 841,500 in 2003. The number of professionals in the software exports
sector has increased more slowly in recent years in comparison to those in the IT enabled
services sector (ITES-BPO), from 110,000 in 1999 to 270,000 by 2003.

           Much of what Indian software exports consist of does not require an engineering
background, yet software exports from India rely very heavily on engineering graduates. A
survey of over 100 Indian software firms in 1997 indicate that 80% of the software professionals
employed had engineering degrees, while 12% only had diplomas from private training institutes
(Arora et al., 2001). A large fraction of these engineers were not electrical or computer
engineers. Instead, these included civil, chemical, textile, and industrial engineers with a 4 year
undergraduate degree, though often followed by specialized, non-diploma training in software
tools. 9
           There are some important reasons why firms prefer engineers. In interviews conducted
in 1997 and 1998, few firms admit to hiring non-engineers, principally due to apprehensions
about the signal it might send to potential customers and to other potential hires. The CEO of
the fourth largest software firm, interviewed in 1997 said that he hired only engineering
graduates from the best possible schools in India. However, this was not because engineering
training or knowledge was relevant, but because these students tended to be smart and their
backgrounds were useful in signaling quality to potential customers (reported in Arora et al.,
2001). Simply put, the undergraduate engineering degree acts a screening device, because of
the intense competition for admission to engineering colleges (Spence, 1984).


9
 In recent years, software firms have turned to non-engineers as well, particularly for serving the domestic market,
and for IT enabled services.
                                                                                                                     10

         To be sure, this is not a signaling story alone. Engineering graduates are also exposed
to the fundamentals of computers and learn basic programming and sometimes even advanced
programming language, reducing need for longer duration training. As well four years of
engineering education imparts a set of problem solving skills, methods of thinking logically and
learning tools that help quick adaptation to changes in technology, domains and tasks (Arora et
al., 2001). Perhaps equally importantly, initially the bulk of software exports consisted of
software professionals working on client’s site in the US on temporary work permits, or H-1 B
visas. US visa requirements meant that it was (remains) easier for engineers to qualify for H-1 B
visas.
         The software industry also tends to recruit younger workers. Older engineers, settled in
other jobs, were less willing to accept jobs with (then) unknown firms, and spend extended
periods away from their families.10 Perhaps equally important was their unwillingness to take on
the mundane and tedious tasks that were initially required, the most well known of were the Y2K
related projects, where someone had to go through the long lines of code, finding and changing
how dates were entered. The upshot of the foregoing discussion is that finding and recruiting
engineers was critical for a successful software exporter, and that most of the engineers would
be newly graduated, rather than experienced ones.

•    Uneven regional growth of the software industry:
         In the very early period of the 1980s, the software industry was concentrated in Mumbai,
the capital of the state of Maharashtra (Heeks, 1996) and also the leading commercial center of
the country. As exports grew, the industry spread to other cities and states. Bangalore attracted
many multinational companies after Texas Instruments set up its development center in 1985.11
By 1990 the states of Maharashtra (Bombay), Karnataka (Bangalore), Tamil Nadu (Chennai)
and Delhi were the ones with large share of exports and states of Uttar Pradesh (NOIDA),
Andhra Pradesh (Hyderabad) and West Bengal (Kolkata) also had software exports, albeit at
lower levels.
         Many multinational companies (MNCs) set up their subsidiaries after foreign investment
norms were liberalized by the federal government in 1991 (Athreye, 2005a). These MNCs’
locations were typically in the leading software centers such as Bangalore, Hyderabad,
Chennai, Bombay and Delhi (including NOIDA and Gurgaon). Indian software firms typically
also had a single Indian location, at least till the early 1990s. Therefore the states which had a

head-start continued to grow rapidly in 1990s. This resulted in very heavy regional concentration
of industry. Seven states contributed 95% of total software exports in 2002-03, but only 48% of
the country’s population, 47% of the net state domestic product (NSDP) and 57% of the
industrial production in the country. In the other seven states software exports are growing very
rapidly but the absolute size of software exports from these states is still small.

IV. Undergraduate Engineering Education in India
        In this section we discuss how India’s undergraduate engineering education sector has
evolved in past couple of decades. There are three main points to be made. First, there is
substantial regional variation in engineering baccalaureate capacity, especially at the birth of the
software export industry in the late 1980s. Second, this regional variation is mainly due to
differences in private engineering colleges. Finally, the differences in private engineering
baccalaureate capacity are are significantly affected by when the private colleges were allowed
in the state.

        In India, higher education, particularly technical education, had been provided mostly by
the government run institutions, except in last two decades. The majority of the institutions were
set up and funded by various state governments. The number of institutions offering
undergraduate degree in engineering has increased over the years as also the total intake
capacity of these institutions12. Table 2 shows the growth in engineering baccalaureate capacity
between 1951 and 2004. In 2004 the engineering baccalaureate capacity was 91 times that of
1951. Even accounting for population growth, the engineering baccalaureate capacity per
million of population grew thirty fold, from 13 in 1951 to 405 in 2004.

12
  The engineering college capacity of a college/institution is the number of students it can admit in a given
academic year in all the disciplines. There are discipline-wise upper limits fixed for each academic year by AICTE.
Any increase in the engineering college capacity requires approval of AICTE. The All India Council for Technical
Education (AICTE), set up in 1945 as an advisory body, was given statutory status in 1987 through an Act of
Parliament. The AICTE grants approval for starting new technical institutions and for introducing new courses or
programs.

•      Regional Variation in engineering baccalaureate capacity
           Table 3a shows the sanctioned engineering baccalaureate capacity by state and year, in
hundreds of undergraduate engineers. The last row of the table denotes the year in which
private colleges were first permitted (and entered). Table 3 shows large inter-state variation in
capacity. In fact share of four states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil
Nadu was almost 75% in 1990-9113 as compared to 29% of the population. As other states
added capacity, the share of these states has declined, but is still around 63% in 2003. As table
3a shows, the growth in capacity has varied over time and across states. Consider the period
from 1990 to 1993. Only three states, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were adding
capacity. In other states the capacity did not increase perceptibly during these years. Also
some states have experienced a sudden jump in the capacity, albeit in different years. These
variations are important for our empirical analysis.                     Finally, states that have significant
engineering capacity are those where private colleges enter early, though there are some
exceptions.        Orissa, for instance, permitted private colleges in 1986 but did not witness
significant growth in capacity.
•      Role of private self-financed colleges:
           The inter-state disparities in engineering baccalaureate capacity are mostly due to
differences in the timing and growth of the private sector colleges. Engineering baccalaureate
capacity in a state can increase by two ways: either by expanding capacity in existing
institutions or by opening new institutions. The new institutions can be in the public sector or the
private sector. Much of the actual increase has been through new private colleges.
           In 1981, the vast majority of engineering colleges were in the public sector i.e., funded
by the federal or state governments and bound by their rule regarding admissions, salary,
promotion and tenure. Tuition fees were very low and the vast bulk of the expenses were met
from the budgets of the respective state governments, with the exception of the few institutes
and colleges directly supported by the central (federal) government. Budget constrained state
governments faced severe limits on increasing capacity. Therefore capacity expansion in the
public sector has been infrequent, and mostly limited to accommodating new disciplines such as
computer science in 1990s and information technology in early 2000s.

     Their contribution to engineering college capacity was similar even in 1987-88.

           Furthermore, capacity expansion in existing institutions requires approval of All India
Council for Technical Education (AICTE). AICTE limits intake capacity of a college. For
example, according to the rules in force in 2005, the maximum capacity per discipline was 60
and a college could have maximum of 4 disciplines in first year of its operation. The total
capacity could increase by 60 to 300 in the second year and finally to a maximum of 420 in the
fourth year. Any increase beyond 420 requires that the institution meet very stringent quality
standards, which few do.14
           The effect of regulation on capacity expansion combined with states’ (public sector)
constraints in adding capacity means new private colleges have been the main source of
growth. Analysis of college-level data between 1981 and 2004 support this conclusion. The
number of colleges in the entire country increased from 246 in 1987 to 353 in 1995 and over
1100 in 2003. Eighty percent of new colleges added between 1987 and 1995 were in the private
sector and the share of private colleges was even higher at 94 percent for colleges added
between 1995 and 2002.
           Karnataka was among the first state to permit the private sector in undergraduate
engineering education. The first such college opened in Karnataka in 195715. Thereafter one in
1962 and two in 1963 started their operation in the state. Then a large number of private
colleges entered, beginning 1979, with nine colleges opening in 1979 and eleven in 1980. The
first private college started in 1977 in Andhra Pradesh and in 1983 in Maharashtra after the
government introduced policy permitting such institutions to operate. By 1986, only six states
had such institutions. Of these, only Madhya Pradesh and Orissa failed to develop leading
software clusters. Of the remaining eight states, only Delhi managed to develop a leading
software cluster.
           As a result, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu accounted for
almost 75 percent of total engineering baccalaureate capacity in the entire country in 1990.
Beginning in 1992, other states began to allow private self-financed institution and by 1999 all
fourteen states had allowed private engineering colleges. As a result the share of private
colleges has steadily increased over the years, from 62% in 1995 to more than 82% in 2002. In
software specific disciplines (principally, electrical and electronic engineering, and computer
science and computer engineering), the share is more than 90%.
           It is only to be expected that education quality should have suffered greatly during this
great expansion in capacity. Many of the new colleges are not up to the task of training

before they can be put to work. However, as briefly noted earlier, actual engineering skills may
be only part of the attraction of engineering graduates, especially in the 1990s. Innate
capabilities, a willingness to work hard, and structured problem solving abilities, all of which are
likely higher among the graduates of even poor quality engineering colleges, may be more
important.16 As well, in recent years, large Indian firms have undertaken substantial
investments in in-house training, in some cases spending 3-4% of revenues on training.
         Adding to the problem has been a marked decline in the production of engineering
PhDs. The number of engineering PhDs produced fell from 629 in 1991 to 298 in 1996, (AICTE,
1999). This decline in PhD production suggests that while there are strong private incentives to
invest in an engineering baccalaureate, these do not extend to investing in research degrees. It
also points to the limits of the private sector model for education.

V. Model and empirical specification
         This section presents a simple model of a two region economy to motivate our empirical
specification. The model shows that if firms are mobile but workers have idiosyncratic
preferences for a region, so that workers are imperfectly mobile, then regions with a higher
stock of workers will also have greater volume of production.
         Many studies have found that a region’s growth is influenced by the initial level of human
capital. Glaeser et al. (1995) find that human capital level in 1960 influences growth of the cities
between 1960 and 1990. Similarly, Simon et al. (2002) found that cities that have higher level of
human capital initially grow faster in the long run. Thus initial level of human capital seems to
advantage cities and regions, perhaps by attracting knowledge-intensive industries. The
regional differences in level of human capital also explain geographic differences in firm
formation rates with regions endowed with higher level of human capital having higher firm
formation rates (Acs, 2003).

•    A simple model of supply of engineers and size of industry:
         Our objective is to sketch out a simple model to structure our empirical analysis that
follows. In our model, both firms and workers choose where to locate. However, whereas firms
are profit maximizers and locate in the most profitable location, workers are assumed to have
idiosyncratic preferences for their existing location. Workers are homogenous in quality and
price taking behavior by firms implies that in any equilibrium where production is not

16
  It is also a tribute to the superior management capability of Indian firms that they were able to use such
inexperienced and poorly trained (but bright) young men and women.

concentrated in a single location, wages must be equalized across regions. In such a model it
is easy to see that regions with a greater stock of workers will also have more production
activity. 17
         Formally, we consider two regions, indexed as 1 and 2. Let N1 and N 2 be the

engineering stock in region 1 and 2 respectively. We assume that the elasticity of supply is
zero, i.e., that everybody joins the labor market and is willing to work at prevailing wages, w1 in

region 1 and w2 in region 2 . We further assume that the utility for engineer i from region 1 if

she works in region 1 is w1 . The utility in region 2 for i would be w2 − C i , where C i is the

migration cost (the migration cost includes whatever utility loss there is from moving). Similarly,
for engineer j educated in region 2 , the utility is w2 when working in region 2 and w1 − C j when

working in region 1 . We assume that C i and C j are all drawn from a distribution F. We do not

specify a lower bound for C so that it can take negative values as well. Then, the fraction of
workers moving from region 1 to 2 is F ( w2 − w1 ) , and the fraction moving from 2 to 1 is

F ( w1 − w2 ) . Let x = w2 − w1 . The total labor supply in region 1 is N 1 (1 − F ( x)) + N 2 F ( x) , and
N 2 (1 − F ( − x )) + N 1 F ( − x ) in region 2 .
         Labor demand: There are M firms, which are price takers. Since the good in question
is software for export, we also assume free transport of output. We assume that firms can locate
anywhere they want. This is sensible since software is a new industry and most firms are de
novo startups. Furthermore, a substantial fraction of the software exports from India are
accounted for by American firms and by firms set up by people of Indian ethnicity living in
America. All firms have the same production function Q (L ) . It is immediate that with output

price taking firms and labor as the only input into production, we must have w2 = w1 in

equilibrium. So, total labor supply in 1 is N 1 (1 − F (0)) + N 2 F (0) .
         Since the output price is determined in the export market and therefore the same across
regions, labor demand and supply will be equilibrated will be through the distribution of firms
across regions. If y percent of firms locate in region 1 , and if we normalize the price of the


17
   Blanchard and Katz (1992) analyze how shocks to labor demand and supply affect short term and long
term employment dynamics in the United States. Robak (1982) develops a model of the long run
equilibrium with local land and labor markets, with fixed location specific amenities and scarce land, and
where firms and workers are mobile. We focus on the long run equilibrium and assume that workers
stochastically prefer their existing location.
                                                                                                                       18

output p to 1, then each firm employs m (w) workers, given by Q' (m) = w / p = w (Recall that w

is same in each region). The labor demand is Mym in region 1 and M (1 − y )m in region 2 .
This yields two equilibrium conditions for the labor market to clear in both regions:
               Mym ( w) = N 1 (1 − F (0)) + N 2 F (0)                                               (1)

               M (1 − y ) m( w) = N 2 (1 − F (0)) + N 1 F (0)                                       (2)
         By adding (1) and (2), we get
               Mm( w) = N1 + N 2                                                                    (3)

              Equation (3) gives total demand. Substituting for Mm (w) in (1), we get

                      N1 (1 − F (0)) + N 2 F (0)
                 y=                                                                                 (4)
                              N1 + N 2

If we let N 1 = θ * N 2 , then (4) becomes

                    (1 − F (0)) * θ + F (0)
               y=                                                                                   (5)

•    Empirical Specification
         The simple model developed above suggests that as long as there is some “stickiness”
in the labor market, local endowments of human capital will condition the volume of software
production in a region. In other words, it suggests that we specify a model with software exports
as a function of the stock of engineers. We lack a measure of the stock of engineers in a state
over time. However, our measure of engineering baccalaureate capacity is arguably closely

18
   This simple model can be easily extended in a number ways. One way is that the idiosyncratic regional
preferences may not be symmetric across regions. Regional variations in employment opportunities, career growth
prospects and cost of living differences may result in the distribution of Ci being different for each region. Let Ci
be distributed with distribution function F (.) in region 1 and G (.) in region 2. In the equilibrium, the wages in two
                          dy 1 − ( F (0) + G (0))            dy
regions are same. Thus,       =                    , so that    > 0 if F(0) + G(0) < 1                        (7’).
                          dθ        (1 + θ ) 2               dθ
It is obvious from (7’) that holding F(0) and G(0) constant, an increase in θ would increase the share of firms y in
region 1 provided G(0) + F (0) < 1 .
                                                                                                     19

related to changes in the stock. Specifically, if there were no mobility of engineers across
states, then the growth in the stock of engineers in state i would be equal to the (lagged)
engineering baccalaureate capacity in the state.         Since the available anecdotal evidence
suggests that such mobility is in fact small, we use this as a proxy for a change in the stock of
engineers. To the extent that there is mobility, we have measurement error. As discussed in
greater detail below, we also explore the results of instrumenting for engineering baccalaureate
capacity to address biases due to measurement error, as well as problems posted by potential
endogeneity. In other words, if Sit are software exports in year t for state i, and Kit is the
corresponding stock of human capital, we have
Sit = ait + gt + βKit + εit .                                                                 (8)
By taking first differences over time (represented by Δ) we have
ΔSit = Δait + Δgt + βΔKit + Δεit                                                              (9)
Note that (8) allows for each state to have a different time trajectory for exports, so that the state
effect varies by time. For feasible estimation, we assume that Δait = αi i.e., the change in
exports per year (for a given state) does not systematically vary over time. Letting Δgt = γt yields
ΔSit = αi + γt + βΔKit + Δεit                                                                 (10)
         In other words, the expected annual increase in software exports is equal to a state fixed
effect, a year effect and β times the engineering baccalaureate capacity. This is our benchmark
specification. Later, we also report estimates from a related specification where we use as the
dependent variable the level of software exports rather than the change. Although the latter
specification is not theoretically grounded in our model, it is plausible that with rapidly growing
demand, the number of firms may depend not merely on the level of human capital stock but
also its growth. Both specifications find support in the data, as discussed below. Also, in both
specifications, we exploit the variations in state policy allowing private engineering colleges to
develop an instrument for engineering baccalaureate capacity.


VI Data
We obtain data on engineering baccalaureate capacity from the “Annual Technical Manpower
Review (ATMR)” reports published by National Technical Manpower Information System
NTMIS. These reports are prepared by a state-level nodal center of NTMIS and give details of
sanctioned engineering baccalaureate capacity and outturn for all undergraduate technical
institutions in the state. The Handbook of Engineering Education, a publication of the
                                                                                                                 20

Association of Indian Universities has also been used as a supplementary source.19 Data on
software exports are obtained from the Electronics and Computers Software Export Promotion
Council (ESC), which is the apex government trade promotion organization for this sector, for
the years 1998-2003. For 1997 and earlier, the ESC does not provide state level export data.
Accordingly, we used export revenues by NASSCOM member firms, allocating the export
revenues of each firm to the state where its headquarters are located. Till 1995, virtually all firms
were located in a single state.          Thus, this approximation is a reasonable one.                 As further
described in the data appendix, we verified NASSCOM figures where possible from Dataquest,
a trade magazine that has covered the Indian IT industry since 1982, and provides data on
sales, exports and employment for the leading firms. For two leading firms, which operated in
multiple states, we were able to obtain data on employment by state and allocated export
revenues in proportion.
        Combining data from two separate sources can lead to problems. For instance, the
growth of software exports between 1998 and 1997 yields odd results for some states,
particularly for the Delhi, because around this time, firms located in Delhi moved their operations
to Gurgaon in the state of Haryana, and Noida, in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Exploratory
analysis suggests that these problem are modest, at best. For instance, confining oneself to
data from 1998 onwards yields qualitatively similar results.                  The STPI is another potential
source of state level export data. However, for the earlier years only a small fraction of software
exports appear to be by companies registered through the STPI. For instance, in Mumbai, in
the state of Maharashtra, many of the leading firms were located in SEEPZ, an export
promotion zone, and apparently did not report their software exports through STPI. Towards the
end of the period, however, exports reported through the STPI are about over 90% of the
software exports as calculated by NASSCOM or reported in official Indian statistics.
        Carrying out the analysis at the level of the state raises some additional issues. In
particular, Delhi is bordered by the states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Software exports from
the latter two are concentrated very near their border with Delhi, in Gurgaon and Noida
respectively. Since firms can move across the three locations, this results in large jumps and
dips in software exports. We chose not to smooth the jumps and dips, principally because
doing so does not affect the results.




19
  In a few cases, the data from these reports are inconsistent, typically involving decreases or large increases in
capacity or where capacity is markedly inconsistent with the number of graduating engineers. In such cases the other
sources have been used to arrive at the acceptable figures of sanctioned intake.
                                                                                                          21

        Data on control variables like population, per capita power consumption, industrial
output, teledensity, per capita income and number of students graduating from high school
(passing the 12th grade) is obtained from various publications and websites of concerned
departments of Government of India as detailed in the data appendix. Table 4 shows the
descriptive statistics for the variables used in the regressions.                Software exports, industrial
output and per capita net state domestic product (NSDP) are in constant 1993-94 prices.
        The unit of analysis is state even though the industry we are analyzing is mostly located
in urban centers in India. To a considerable extent, our hand is forced by the availability of data,
since creating measures of the supply of engineers by the relevant metropolitan area, though
feasible, is very costly. Moreover, the major software exporting centers are locating at some
distance from each other and likely draw upon colleges in the state, at least until the late 1990s.
The one exception to this is Delhi, which, as noted already, draws upon Delhi, Haryana, and the
western part of Uttar Pradesh.

VII Results
We begin with some simple descriptive relationships. Figure 1, which shows the log of software
exports by state for three years, points the persistence of export leadership: states which were
the early export leaders retain their leadership even after nearly a decade and a half. Figure 2
shows the relationship between software exports and engineering baccalaureate capacity. For
all each of the three years, we see a positive correlation between a state’s engineering
baccalaureate capacity and its software exports (in logs). Finally, figure 3 shows the change in
software exports by state in various years against the year in which the state first allowed
private engineering colleges. As can be seen, states which allowed private colleges to enter
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 22

earlier are also those where the software exports have increased the most. Delhi, and its two
neighboring states, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, are outliers in that though they were late in
allowing private colleges they have shown rapid growth in software exports. Virtually all the
software export growth is due to two suburbs of Delhi, namely Gurgaon in Haryana, and Noida,
in Uttar Pradesh. It is possible that this is because Delhi, as the only center in the north of India,
may have been able to grow even without a large engineering supply of its own, by tapping
engineering graduates from virtually all parts of India except the south and the west.
                                               Overall, these figures suggest that states which allowed early entry by private
engineering colleges were also favored early destination of software exporters, and their
advantage appears to have persisted even as engineering baccalaureate capacity in other
states has rapidly expanded. Finally, figure 4 plots the share of software exports and
engineering baccalaureate capacity (not lagged), over multiple years. It shows a marked
positive relationship between these two shares.

        Notes: From tables 3a and 3b. Delhi, UP and Haryana are combined.
        We further explore these patterns through regression analysis. Consider first the long
term impact of initial engineering baccalaureate capacity. In table 5 we show the impact of
engineering baccalaureate capacity in 1987 on the increase in software exports between 1990
and 2003. It is worth pointing out that the total software exports in 1987 were $54 million dollars
(Athreye, 2005b) and therefore engineering baccalaureate capacity in a state in 1987 was
unlikely to be influenced by software exports industry. As table 5 shows, initial levels of college
capacity in the state have a significant and sizable effect upon software exports in 2003, nearly
a decade and a half later. The limited number of observations rules out the use of more
controls. It is possible, therefore, that this long lasting influence is merely a reflection of
unobserved state characteristics. Accordingly, we exploit the within state-variation in capacity
over time in table 6, which uses both year and state fixed effects. In addition, we control for per
capital income, and teledensity, and use the state’s population to control for size effects.

         In subsequent analysis, we control for several other factors that might have facilitated
growth of the software exports in the state. Electronics production in 1990 is the size of
hardware electronics industry in 1990, before the software industry achieved significant size.
We include it in our regression as it has been argued that in the initial years of its growth, the
software industry also relied on experienced professionals working in the electronics industry to
meet its manpower requirement (Lateef, 1997). This also controls for a variety of other
influences. For instance, Klepper (2007) has argued that related industries are more likely to
spawn successful firms. However, since firms in many sectors, such as banking, finance and
manufacturing are also significant producers of software (primarily for their own use), we control
for industrial production as well.
         Table 6 reports on the specification implied by equation (10). We lag engineering
baccalaureate capacity by four years as it takes four years to complete an undergraduate
engineering degree. This makes it unlikely that our effects reflect the feedback effect of software
growth, except possibly towards the end of our sample period. Other controls such as
electronic production, industrial output, per capita income and teledensity are also lagged, albeit
by one year. Further, the standard errors are cluster corrected to account for the non-

         Table 6 shows two specifications, with and without time varying state characteristics
such as per-capita income, population and electronics and industrial production. In specification
1, a unit increase in capacity increases exports by Rs 340,000 or about $8,000 per year. To put
this in perspective, the average revenue per employee in the software industry in India in the
mid 1990s was of the order of $15,000. If one takes into account the less than full capacity
utilization, students leaving prior to graduation, employment in industries other than software
exports, and migration to other states and overseas, the quantitative impact is highly plausible.
                                                                                                       27

As can be seen in column 2 of table 6, controlling for time varying characteristics reduces the
impact of engineering baccalaureate capacity on software exports, but the impact remains both
economically and statistically significant. Further, with the exception of electronics production,
none of the time varying characteristics added have statistically significant coefficients.

•   Potential endogeneity of engineering baccalaureate capacity
        The identification thus far relies on the fact that the vast bulk of the growth in engineering
baccalaureate capacity after 1990 in a state is privately financed, and that differences in the
extent of privately financed colleges is overwhelming reason for variation in engineering
baccalaureate capacity, both across states and over time. The principal source of variation in
the extent of privately financed colleges is when a state permits such colleges -- the earlier the
state permitted colleges, the more quickly capacity could increase. It was not until the 1990s
that Indian states actively began to compete to attract businesses to locate. Before that, states
frequently viewed private business with some suspicion. Though more business friendly states
might, prior to the 1990s, have offered tax concessions or regulatory relief, they were unlikely to
make significant policy changes in education policy to address business concerns. Moreover,
recall that these results control for state fixed effects, which implies that only time variation in
the extent to which a state is business friendly would be a source of problems.
        Despite this, it is possible that capacity is correlated with unobserved time varying
effects that condition software exports from a state. For instance, a growing software industry in
a state may create the expectation of growth in future demand for engineers. This will bias our
estimate of the coefficient of lagged baccalaureate capacity upwards. On the other hand, it is
likely that capacity is an imperfect measure for the change in the state level stock of human
capital, and the resulting measurement error would imply an attenuation bias to zero. To probe
the robustness of our results to both sets of concerns we present the estimates using an
instrument for engineering baccalaureate capacity.
        Our instrument is based on the year when neighboring states first allow private
engineering colleges to operate. Specifically, we create a dummy variable, “policy”, for each
state, which is one if private engineering colleges are operating in that state in that year, and
zero otherwise. Our instrument is the average of “policy” for neighboring states. Thus, the key
assumption underlying our identification strategy is that though a state’s decision to allow
private colleges may respond to anticipated demand for software workers in that state, the
decision of neighboring states is independent of the anticipated demand in the reference state.
Put differently, we assume that although state governments may respond to local software
firms, they are not responsive to software firms in neighboring states. However, states do
                                                                                                                   28

respond to policy changes in neighboring states. Thus, this is a plausible instrument, though we
acknowledge that such instruments have a “reflection” problem (cf Manski, 2000). Thus, we
view this as a way of probing the robustness of our results, rather than our benchmark
specification.

       Table 7a shows the results of the first-stage regression of college capacity on average
neighbor policy, with state and year fixed effects, with and without time varying controls.
Though the neighbor policy measure is significant, the F statistic is only around 4.5 with time
varying controls, and around 6 without them, after cluster correction. This implies that the
instrument is not very powerful. With this caveat, we proceed with the estimation, in part to
probe the sensitivity of our results.
       Table 7b presents the corresponding estimates where we instrument for lagged
engineering baccalaureate capacity using its predicted value, using a two stage least squares
procedure. Columns 1 and 2 present results where the dependent variable is change in
software exports over the previous year. Note that the estimated coefficient increases three fold
as compared to the OLS estimate, suggesting that upward bias was unlikely and that
measurement error is more likely. However, the coefficient is imprecisely estimated, possibly
because the instrument is weak. We also present analogous results where we use the log of
software exports, rather than the annual change in software exports, in columns 3 (OLS results)
and 4 (2SLS).       The estimated coefficient of capacity in this case also increases upon
instrumenting for it, although the increase is not as large. Once again, the estimated coefficient
has a large standard error. The other noteworthy point is that lagged electronics production
also has a positive and significant impact on the level software exports, but not on the annual
change in software exports. This may point to either knowledge spillovers from electronics, or
some sort of time varying state characteristics related to IT production. Other time varying
controls are statistically insignificant. Specifically, per capita income and industrial output do not
play any role in explaining software exports growth.

•   Alternative explanations
Infrastructure: To further probe the robustness of our findings, we briefly discuss possible
alternative explanations for our findings.      The first is that states such as Karnataka and
Maharashtra were better endowed with telecommunication or physical infrastructure (cf.,
Srinivasan, 2006). We control for state fixed effects, and also lagged state telecommunication
density, lagged state per capita income and lagged industrial production, which should control
for variation over time in these effects. Despite this, the ability of the Delhi region to emerge as
a significant software exporter despite only belatedly allowing private engineering colleges (and
thus having only a small stock of engineering baccalaureate capacity) may point to the
importance of an adequate infrastructure.       It is likely, however, that this also points to the
importance of a commercial infrastructure, including the supply of entrepreneurs.
                                                                                                   30

Early mover advantage and self-reinforcing effects: It is popularly believed that software
production is marked by significant agglomeration economies. Thus, states which get an early
start in software production are more likely to persist as leaders. Arguably, the governments of
these states would also be more sympathetic to the need to produce more engineers and the
academic entrepreneurs more willing to create private colleges to meet that demand. Such
dynamic explanations are not easy to test and in any event, this one has some measure of truth.
As figure 1 shows, states that were early software exporters continue to lead in software
exports. However, the advantages of an early start do not overwhelm other factors. As can be
seen from tables 3a and 3b above, in 1990, Maharashtra had three times the exports of
Karnataka, yet by 2003, Karnataka had twice the exports of Maharashtra. Moreover, even if the
time series results are driven by increasing returns, if human capital supplies provides the basis
for early leadership, an agglomeration economies based explanation need not be inconsistent
with a human capital based one.
        It is unlikely that the agglomeration economies are due to knowledge spillovers, given
the simple nature of Indian software exports. It is possible that a region such as Bangalore, well
endowed with research institutes and natural amenities, enjoyed a good reputation with
potential entrants, particularly multinational firms. This entry, directly or indirectly, increased
demand for labor and also the supply of engineering baccalaureate capacity. Since Karnataka
was also the leader in engineer baccalaureate capacity from the very beginning of the software
industry, and we lack a direct measure for reputation, we cannot definitively distinguish this
explanation from the engineering capacity based one. Insofar as Bangalore’s reputation related
largely to its supply of engineering talent, this explanation too ultimately supports the human
capital story, though not in all the details regarding the role of private engineering colleges.
        An under-explored but potentially important source of regional agglomeration is
entrepreneurship (Klepper, 2007). Athreye (2005: p 12) estimates that entrepreneurial firms
accounted for over a third of the employment and revenue in the Indian software industry in
2001.   Among the leading Indian software exporters, more than half were either de novo
startups or spawned from other leading software producers (including multinationals). If a state
got a head start and was home to successful firms, these firms are likely to spawn other firms,
which may reinforce the initial advantage of that state. Insofar as entrepreneurs in the software
industry are more likely to be trained as engineers themselves, the location of engineering
colleges may be an important source of variation in the supply of entrepreneurship, particularly
in the early years of the industry. Therefore, the human capital effects may work through the
supply of entrepreneurs.

Diaspora:      As noted earlier, the other key factor for export success is contacts with potential
clients. Kapur (2002) has pointed to the importance of the Indian diaspora in facilitating such
contacts, and Arora, Gambardella and Klepper (2005) provide some evidence of the role of the
diaspora in creating firms, including some of the top software exporters. It is possible that the
successful states were disproportionately the source of the Indian diaspora. The diaspora
explanation is indeed consistent with our results. Anecdotal evidence suggests that a large
fraction of the people of Indian ethnicity living in America have engineering undergraduate
degrees. If so, state with larger engineering baccalaureate capacity, particularly in the 1980s
and early 1990s, were more likely to have produced engineers who emigrated. Thus, though in
our discussion thus far we have focused upon the role of engineers as software developers, this
is not inconsistent with some fraction of these engineers also forming the diaspora which
connected Indian software exporters (in their home states) with their customers in America, or
themselves setting up software firms to service American clients.

VIII. Discussion and conclusions:
       The importance of human capital -- skilled and creative workers -- to a “high-tech”
industry is routinely acknowledged but often public policy discussions tend to focus on more
trendy prescriptions such technology parks, venture capital, incubators and university industry
centers. Software, perhaps more than any other high-tech industry, relies more intensively
upon human capital. Software services, the engine of the Indian software sector, is arguably
even more human capital intensive than software products. Thus, few would question the role
of human capital stocks in the rise of the Indian software industry. What is less clearly
appreciated is that there are significant variations across Indian states in stocks of the relevant
human capital, engineers, and that these differences have played an important part in
conditioning where the software industry has flourished. Even less well understood are the
reasons for this regional disparity in human capital stocks.
       We find that these variations exist even after controlling for factors such as how rich or
large the state is, and measures of industrial production, electronics production or
telecommunication investment. Since engineering education has been controlled and, in the
main, provided by state funded colleges, differences in the willingness of states to invest in
engineering colleges could, but do not, explain the bulk of the inter-state variation. Instead, it is
the role of private engineering colleges which is the key the puzzle. Simply put, states which
allowed private engineering colleges to enter early were able to get a head start and, this early
advantage has persisted for nearly a decade and a half.
                                                                                                     32

           Permitting privately financed colleges helped mitigate the adverse effects of the lack of
   public investments in higher education. It did not completely ameliorate the problem because,
   as noted earlier, there has been a marked fall in the production of engineering PhDs, even as
   baccalaureate capacity has increased.         Knowledgeable observers of the Indian software
   industry, and the leading firms themselves, are increasingly concerned about the divergence,
   which also points to the limits of relying solely upon private financing for human capital
   development.

            Private Self-financed Institutions:
            These institutions are privately founded and operated, with no financial support from the
   government. The government exercises no control on their day-to-day functioning though there are
   various regulations by regulatory body AICTE. The creation of new institution, an increase in the
   capacity of a discipline or the addition of a new discipline in an existing institution requires the approval
   of the AICTE (and prior to AICTE, approval from the relevant state government). Their principal activity
   is undergraduate education, and their operations are principally financed from tuition revenues.
            Tuition fees were set by state governments. The fee is same throughout state though there are
   inter-state variations, though the final structure awaits the resolution of court challenges. These
   institutions are affiliated to universities (universities are set up by an act of state legislature or by an act of
   parliament), which prescribes syllabi for various disciplines and conducts examinations. The degrees are
   awarded by the universities.

            Appendix B: Data Source:
            The main source of data is the “Annual Technical Manpower Review (ATMR)” reports published
   by National Technical Manpower Information System NTMIS. These reports are prepared by a state-level
   nodal center of NTMIS and give details of sanctioned engineering baccalaureate capacity and outturn
   (numbers graduating) for all undergraduate technical institutions in the state. The ATMR has information
   on sanctioned intake and outturn. The NTMIS publication “Directory of Technical Institutions” has
   institution level details of intake and outturn. Sometimes the data from these reports are inconsistent. That
   is the trend in the intake or outturn appear anomalous. In such cases the other sources have been used to
   arrive at the acceptable figures of sanctioned intake. The Handbook of Engineering Education, a
   publication of the Association of Indian Universities has also been used as a supplementary source. We
   have also used printed publications and web-published data of AICTE whenever needed. In certain cases
   the website of the institution has been useful in providing relevant information.
            The data on software exports are obtained from various reports published by NASSCOM and
   ESC20. ESC compiles state-wise software exports data for the post 1997 period. For the earlier period, we
   rely upon NASSCOM, which publishes the “Indian Software Directory” which have details of software
   exports, employment and company location. The Dataquest21 magazine carries a detailed survey of
   software companies and provides useful information about various software companies, which were used
   to verify NASSCOM data, and fill in where data on software exports were missing. Our dataset also
   includes variables like population, per capita power consumption, industrial output22, teledensity, per
   capita income and number of students passing 12th grade for each state and for each year. The information
   on these variables is obtained from various publications and websites of concerned departments of
   Government of India.

       ESC (Electronics and Computer Software Export Promotion Council) is India’s apex trade promotion
   organization. ESC is actively engaged in the promotion of India’s export of computer software and services,
   computer hardware, consumer electronics, telecom equipments and cables.
   21
      Dataquest covers information technology industry in detail since 1982. They provide details on exports, turnover
   and employees of software companies.
   22
      Industrial output is the net value additions by all manufacturing units in a given state in a given financial year. The
   data is taken from Annual Survey of Industries conducted by Government of India.
