Sacred Values? The Effect of Information on Attitudes toward Payments for Human Organs
Julio J. Elias, Nicola Lacetera, and Mario Macis
NBER Working Paper No. 20866
January 2015
JEL No. D47,D60,H80,I19,K32,Z10,Z18

                                            ABSTRACT

Many economic transactions are prohibited—even in the absence of health or safety concerns or negative
externalities—because of ethical concerns that cause these exchanges to be perceived as “repugnant”
if conducted through a market. Establishing a system of payments for human organs is a particularly
relevant example given its implications for public health; in almost all countries, these payments are
prohibited because they are considered morally unacceptable—a prohibition that societies seem to
accept despite the long waitlists and high death rates for people needing a transplant. We investigate
how deeply rooted these attitudes are and, in particular, whether providing information on how a price
mechanism can help alleviate the organ shortage changes people’s opinions about the legalization
of these transactions. We conducted a survey experiment with 3,417 subjects in the U.S. and found
that providing information significantly increased support for payments for organs from a baseline
of 52% to 72%, and this increase applied to most of the relevant subgroups of the analyzed sample.
Additional analyses on the support for other morally controversial activities show that attitude changes
in response to information depend on the type of activity under consideration and interactions with
other beliefs.

1. Introduction
In most modern societies, a number of economic transactions are prohibited or severely restricted.
Although the reasons for the restrictions are often related to health or safety issues, some transactions
are prohibited due to ethical concerns or because they are perceived as repugnant. That is, even when
transacting parties may be willing to engage in the trade, third parties oppose the idea of that
exchange occurring in the marketplace, and thus prohibit it. These limits vary over time and places.
For example, indentured servitude was once accepted in many countries, but is now universally
considered unacceptable and banned. Conversely, life insurance contracts were considered repugnant
in the past but are now widely allowed (Zelizer 1979). Varied activities such as same-sex marriage,
surrogacy, prostitution, the supply of cadavers for research or eating certain types of food (e.g., horse
meat) are regulated differently in different countries—and sometimes even within the same
country—mostly because of different moral considerations (Roth [2007, 2014], Anteby 2010).
    The heterogeneities and changes over communities, in particular, reveal that repugnance-based
prohibitions often derive from deeply-held, shared values that contribute to tying societies together,
are transmitted over generations, and affect economic outcomes (Alesina and Giuliano, forthcoming;
Bisin and Verdier 2010; Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales 2006).
    Repugnance-based prohibitions on some transactions, however, have important implications for
social welfare. This paper focuses on one such transaction: payments for human organs for
transplantation. In the United States alone, more than 120,000 people are on the waiting list for an
organ transplant. Every year, only about 29,000 transplants are performed, and over 10,000 people
die while waiting for an organ or leave the waiting list because they are too sick for a transplant. The
average wait time for a kidney transplant is about 4.7 years, up from 2.9 years only a decade ago
(Becker and Elías 2014, based on data from UNOS 2014). The cost of supply shortages is also given
by the financial burden of alternative procedures, such as dialysis in the case of kidneys, which have
an estimated cost of $250,000 per patient (Matas and Schitzler 2003).
    In light of these facts, it is not surprising that there is increasing interest in devising strategies to
reduce the organ supply shortage. In particular, some scholars have identified the prohibition of
monetary payments as one of the main reasons for the large gulf between demand and supply of
organs. According to recent estimates, payments between $15,000 and $30,000 would be sufficient to
“clear the market” for kidneys (Becker and Elías 2007). Yet, under current legislation, transfers of
human organs “for valuable consideration” are prohibited in the United States. Ethical considerations
and repugnance factors play a large role in the debate about the use of a price mechanism to increase
the supply of organs. For example, the design of organ exchanges through chain matches was devised
in a way to avoid the ethical objections typically associated with monetary payments (Roth [2007,
2014] Roth et al. 2004). In contrast, proposals in favor of regulated payments for organs (Becker and
Elías 2007, Gaston et al. 2006) have long received strong opposition. The objections are not limited
to such concerns as exploitation of the poor and coercion, which could in principle be mitigated by
appropriate policy design (Becker and Elías 2014), but include reference to “inalienable values” and
“fundamental truths” (Delmonico et al. 2002); the definitive words often used suggest that keeping
these transactions out of the marketplace is considered a “protected value”—i.e., a value that people
are unwilling to trade off no matter what the costs of doing so may be (Baron and Spranca 1997). In
fact, arguments against payments for organs often acknowledge the potential benefits of allowing
such trades; yet the moral basis of the opposition is considered strong enough to forego those benefits
(Delmonico et al. 2002; Sandel 2012). These and other considerations have sparked scholarly debates
and have also reached popular news outlets.1
    Although at any given time we may know what transactions are considered repugnant (and
where), there is limited understanding of the determinants of the repugnance towards a transaction
and of whether and how this changes over time. In recent years, in particular, the increased
availability of data and more reliable research methods have improved scholars’ ability to test or
estimate whether allowing the use of incentives (monetary or non-monetary) for certain transactions
leads to positive outcomes such as increased supply of safe blood (Lacetera, Macis and Slonim 2013)
or organs (Becker and Elías 2007); better health outcomes, changes in the prevalence of previously
illegal activities (Cunningham and Shah 2014), increased tax revenues, and so on.
    In this paper, we study whether empirical evidence and, more broadly, information on the
effectiveness of different ways to increase the supply of human organs for transplantation (based on
scientific research) affect attitudes toward allowing payments for organs, or, instead, anti-market
attitudes reflect values that cannot be sacrificed. The answer to this question has important
implications. First, it improves our understanding of the nature of moral beliefs about markets.
Second, it illuminates which policy levers are available for market design to solve pressing social
problems, and which are not because the majority of citizens oppose them. Third, it sheds light on
whether seemingly deep attitudes are affected by new evidence about the costs and benefits
associated with choices that, at a given time, are considered unethical (Gibson et al. 2013). Finally, it
contributes to the current debate as to whether at least some ethical principles can (or should) be

evidence-based (Stretch 2008, Leget et al. 2009, Molevich et al. 2014, Heath 2012), and how
cognition is affected by individual beliefs (Kahan 2003).
   On the one hand, studies have shown that some strongly held values may change when
individuals are asked to consider specific applications rather than broad principles, or think about
counterexamples and how to resolve conflicts between these values (Maio and Olson 1998, Seligman
and Katz 1996, Baron and Leshner 2000). On the other hand, because of the strong nature of views
opposing payments for organs, it is not obvious that additional information on the potential
effectiveness of these transactions would change attitudes in this specific case. In fact, some research
even showed that providing additional information, for example on the safety of a vaccine, might
lead individuals who are initially more skeptical about that treatment to become even less willing to
receive it, even if they trust the provided information (Nyhan and Reifler 2014; Nyhan et al. 2014).
   We also explore whether the likelihood that attitudes change in response to new evidence
depends on individual characteristics such as gender, religion, education, income, or political views.
Because views about payments for organs are potentially driven by other ethical beliefs, one might
expect that other individual features, such as gender, and other dimensions through which beliefs
manifest themselves, such as political views and religiosity might interact with the way information
is read, processed, interpreted, and acted upon. Studies show, for example, that political views might
affect mathematical problem-solving abilities of individuals, according to how the problem is framed
and the political beliefs of a subject (Kahan et al. 2011). Moreover, income or education might be
correlated with the pre-existing level of information and awareness, therefore potentially affecting
the degree to which a given piece of information affects opinions.
   The study was conducted through an online survey experiment with respondents residing in the
United States. Subjects were randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions. The subjects in
the treatment group received a short reading (approximately 500 words) describing the current state
of organ shortage in the United States and its consequences in terms of human lives lost, long wait
lists, and high financial costs. The text then reported on a few different strategies that have been
proposed (and in some case implemented) to alleviate the shortage, including kidney exchanges,
changing the default rule for cadaveric organ donation, as well as regulated payments to donors or
their families, with references to the academic studies that have evaluated these proposals (Beard and
Osterkamp 2013, Becker and Elías 2007). To encourage them to carefully read the text, the subjects
were informed that a comprehension question would follow. Finally, the subjects completed survey
questions; the first of these questions involved reporting their opinions about whether they would
favor the implementation of regulated payments for organ donors or their families. Because of the



                                                   3
sensitivity of these issues, this question was framed according to the Item Count Technique (or “list
experiment”) in order to preserve the privacy and anonymity of the responses and to limit social
desirability bias, which previous studies have shown can affect responses to “socially charged”
questions (Coffman et al. 2013, Miller 1984). The control group received neither the text to read nor
the comprehension question, and was only asked about support for payments for organs. The other
survey questions, common to all treatments, concerned different socio-economic characteristics of
the subjects. Our experimental design allows us to assess whether the approval for payment for
organs—a transaction that has long been considered repugnant— is affected by the provision of
scholarly and verifiable information about potential benefits, in terms of alleviation of the supply
shortage and cost reduction, of this market-based solution. We also conducted a set of additional
analyses to corroborate our interpretation of the findings.
      The next Section illustrates the conceptual framework that guided our study, and describes the
experimental design. The findings are in Section 3; a discussion and concluding remarks are in
Section 4.


2. Conceptual framework and research design
2.1 Conceptual framework
Figure 1 offers a graphical representation of the simple conceptual framework that guided our
experimental design and analysis. Line AB is a hypothetical “frontier” of combinations of moral
controversy and efficiency associated to different ways to establish and regulate a transaction; in the
case of organs for transplant, these different ways include presumed consent default rules and
payment for organs, among others. We assume that there is agreement on the “ranking” of the level
of moral controversy for different institutional choices; for example, payments to those providing
their organs for transplant is considered more ethically controversial than kidney exchanges, which in
turn are more controversial than a purely altruistic system of organ supply. 2 The case where there is a
trade-off between efficiency and ethical controversy (i.e., AB is upward sloping) is the interesting
one: greater efficiency (e.g., more lives saved) can be achieved only by means of mechanisms
associated with higher moral controversy (e.g., a market for organs). We assume that efficiency
enters as a good in the individuals’ utility functions, whereas ethical controversy is a bad. If all
solutions were ethically charged to the same extent, an individual would prefer the least controversial



2
    We are making the frontier line continuous for convenience.

combination. The indifference curves in the figure are upward sloping, with curves more toward the
upper left corner corresponding to higher utility.
    New information about the efficiency of a payment system can be modeled as an outward shift of
the part of the frontier that has a higher level of moral controversy, such that the new frontier is ACD;
that is, individuals now know that adopting certain morally controversial mechanisms would generate
greater efficiency gains compared to what was previously thought. For example, suppose that a pilot
study shows that monetary payments systematically attract more healthy donors. If preferences are
such that there is a high rate of substitution between efficiency and level of ethical controversy,
individuals are willing to relax their previously held moral rule (i.e., accept a more morally
controversial solution) only if this produces large increases in efficiency (or they are willing to
sacrifice high efficiency for even a small reduction in moral controversy); the indifference curves b
and b’ depict this case. Less steep curves imply lower rates of substitution (curves a and a'). If
attitudes toward paying for organs are closer to the former type of preferences, then new information
on the higher enhanced efficiency of price-mediated mechanisms should not change the support for
these activities (rb* is the utility-maximizing level of repugnance for individuals with indifference
curves of type b under both the AB and the ACD frontiers). Conversely, individuals who are more
willing to trade off moral acceptance and economic efficiency would respond to the new information
by choosing a policy option that is more ethically charged; for example, for individuals with type a
preferences, the newly chosen level of moral controversy is ra*'>ra*). Similarly, if a given society is
currently adopting a particular solution, for example corresponding to point C on the frontier,
individuals with preferences of type b will not tolerate further opportunities emerging from the shift
in the frontier, whereas individuals with preferences of type a will want to move from point C to a
combination lying within the CD segment of the frontier. Preferences of type b, therefore, consider
more morally charged solutions as repugnant. With the experiment described below, we hope to
make progress in understanding what kind of preferences characterize individuals when faced with
information on the effectiveness of ways to solve the organ shortage that are morally charged: Do
they consider these ways repugnant regardless of their efficiency, or are they willing to support them
if they promise to better solve a social problem like the shortage of organs? 3


3
  Another possibility is that different individuals may have the same preferences but different perceptions of the
frontier and how it changes when further information becomes available. In the experiment below, we controlled in
part for this by asking subjects about their perceived reliability of the provided information. The analysis of
heterogeneous treatment effects also provides some insights as to the relevance of this interpretation of our
framework. In the concluding section we discuss further direction of research to test for these different
interpretations.

2.2 Research design
We recruited 2,393 subjects in May 2014, and 1,024 subjects in September 2014, via Amazon
Mechanical Turk (mTurk), an Amazon Web Service platform that allows reaching a large number of
individuals to perform tasks online and is increasingly used for surveys and experiments (Buhrmester
and Kwang 2011; Mason and Suri 2012). Upon agreeing to participate in the study (described as a
“computerized questionnaire”) and to receive $0.75 upon its completion (the tasks altogether took
about 5 minutes, making the implied hourly wage slightly above the mTurk average for North
America), the subjects were randomly assigned to one of the following conditions:
 Control: For subjects in this experimental condition, we first elicited their attitudes toward
  legalizing payments for organ donors or their families in case of deceased donation; then, we
  administered a survey with questions about their demographics and socio-economic
  characteristics. Details on the survey questions and structure can be found in the Appendix.
 Organs text: Individuals in this treatment condition were first informed that they would be shown
  a text, followed by a reading comprehension question. The text (reproduced in full in the
  Appendix) reported information about the current organ supply shortage in the United States, and
  described a number of proposals that have been advanced or, in some cases, implemented to
  reduce such shortage, with references to the academic studies advancing or evaluating these
  proposals. These included kidney exchange programs (Roth et al. 2004) as well as studies
  estimating the effects of introducing monetary compensation for donors (Becker and Elías 2007).
  After the text, a comprehension question was given to the subjects. In the first experimental wave,
  subjects in this group were randomly assigned one of four different questions; the objective of
  proposing different questions was to assess whether further focusing attention on different parts of
  the text, and in particular on the effects of a market-based solution to reduce the organ supply
  shortage, would affect differently the support for the market-based solution. We did not find
  meaningful differences in support rate based on the questions that the subjects received (see
  Appendix Table A3); for this reason, we proposed only one comprehension question to all
  subjects in the subsequent experimental wave. In the analyses presented here, we pooled all
  subjects who were given the organs text in the same treatment group, regardless of the specific
  comprehension questions that they received. The remainder of the survey was the same as that the
  one presented to the control group, with elicitation of attitudes toward payments for donors, and a
  socio-economic survey.




                                                 6
 “Placebo” text: This condition had the same structure as the organ text treatment; however,
   instead of a text on organ supply shortage, an unrelated, morally neutral text concerning the causes
   of the flu and remedies for it, as well as a related comprehension question, was provided to the
   subjects. This treatment was implemented only in the May 2014 wave. The rationale for this
   condition was to test whether any changes in support for organ payments could be attributed to
   having read and reflected upon some topic-relevant information (as in the organ text condition
   described above) rather than to the subjects’ attention being heightened by the simple fact of
   having been asked to carefully read a text, irrespective of its content.

   We employed the “Item Count Technique” (ICT) to measure support rates for organ payments.
The ICT is based on not asking a question directly (e.g., “Would you support the implementation of
regulated payments for organ donors or their families?”); instead, respondents are shown a set of
statements and are then asked to indicate how many apply to them. The control group is given a list
of N “neutral” statements (i.e., non-sensitive in nature and not related to the research topic) whereas
the treatment group is given N+1 sentences, of which N is the same as for the control group, and the
additional item is the one of interest for the researcher. Thus the researcher cannot infer whether a
given respondent answered positively or negatively to a specific item; only the total number of items
that apply to an individual is identifiable. This preserves the privacy of the respondents and, together
with the anonymity of the online survey, allays the concern that the subjects might give what they
perceive to be the “socially correct” answer. In our case, the hypothetical framework might lead to a
downward bias if most respondents believed that paying for organs was generally considered morally
wrong. The random assignment of subjects to the experimental conditions, the choice of statements
that are not perfectly correlated (to avoid individuals agreeing with all or none of them, thus
effectively revealing their opinion on each statement), and the use of a large enough sample size,
make the difference in the average counts between treatment and control a valid estimate of the share
of individuals in the population under study to which the phrase of interest applied (Coffman et al.
2013, Miller 1984). In our study, within each of the experimental conditions, subjects were further
randomly divided in two subgroups of roughly equal size: one receiving four statements, and one
receiving five statements. The fifth statement was a sentence indicating that the respondent would
support the establishment of a regulated system of payments for organs and, overall, the statements
were chosen such that the majority of respondents would be unlikely to agree with either all of them
or none of them (see the Appendix for details). The distribution of responses (Table 1) confirms that
we achieved this goal. The sample sizes for each treatment condition (at the level of the split between



                                                    7
being assigned four and five statements) were chosen so that we would be able to detect, with 5%
confidence and 80% power, differences of at least 10 percentage points in support rate. Smaller
differences, even if precisely estimated, would be of relatively limited interest.
    Most of our analyses were conducted after pooling together the control and placebo text subjects,
because there was no difference in their responses (Table A3 in the Appendix reports estimates for
the more disaggregated analyses). The model that we estimated is as follows:

𝑌𝑖 = 𝛽𝐶4 + 𝛽𝐶5 𝐷𝑖𝐶5 + 𝛽𝑂4 𝐷𝑖𝑂4 + 𝛽𝑂5 𝐷𝑖𝑂5 + 𝛾𝑋𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖 ,          (1)

where 𝑌𝑖 is the count of statements with which subject i is in agreement, and the binary indicators
𝐷𝑖𝐶5 , 𝐷𝑖𝑂4 and 𝐷𝑖𝑂5 take a value of 1 if subject i is assigned to the control (or placebo text) group
with five statements, in the organ text group with four statements, and in the organ text group with
five statements, respectively. Thus, the estimate 𝛽̂𝐶4 indicates the average number of statements for
the control-group subjects who received four statements. The estimate 𝛽̂𝐶5 reports the difference
between the number of agreed to statements by subjects in the control group who had five statements,
and those who received four statements, or the percentage of subjects who would support the
establishment of regulated payments for organs. Similarly, the difference 𝛽̂𝑂5 − 𝛽̂𝑂4 is the estimate of
the approval rate for payments to organ donors for those who received a text about the organ supply
shortage. Finally, (𝛽̂𝑂5 − 𝛽̂𝑂4 ) − 𝛽̂𝐶5 estimates the difference in approval rate between the control
group and the treatment group, our main treatment effect of interest. The vector 𝑋𝑖 includes
covariates derived from the survey responses, as well as an indicator for the wave in which the
experiment was conducted. The experimental design is represented in Figure 2.


3. Results
3.1 Main findings
About 56% of the 3,417 respondents were men, and their average age was 31.6 years. The median
subject was not married, had no children, had a monthly income between $1,500 and $2,500,
volunteered or donated money to a charity in the previous two years, and had some college
education. About 53% were employees, 13.5% self-employed, and 15% students. Approximately
52% reported being religious and 48.5% had liberal political views. Table A1 in the Appendix
provides a full breakdown of these descriptive characteristics and shows that the sample was
balanced between experimental conditions.




                                                    8
    The values reported in Figures 3-5 and the associated standard errors derive from estimating
Equation 1 above without adding covariates other than the treatment indicators. As a baseline
finding, 52.6% of subjects in the control group expressed a positive opinion toward establishing
regulated payments for organ donors or their families. Although the mTurk sample used in this
research was not fully representative of the American population (see Table A2 in the Appendix), the
baseline approval rate that we obtained was similar to what found in previous studies based on
representative samples of the US population (Leider and Roth 2011).
    We focus on the difference in approval between the treatment group (i.e., the subjects who were
exposed to the text on organ shortages and potential solutions) and the control group. Figure 3 shows
that, for the treatment group, support for payment for organs increased to 72.8%, or 20.2 percentage
points over the baseline (s.e. = 6.3%). Another way to read this result is that about 38.5% of those
who would not initially support payments for organs changed their attitudes when given verifiable
information and researched considerations about the organ shortage and potential ways to solve this
problem. The estimates did not meaningfully change in regressions that included covariates for the
socio-economic characteristics of the respondents and a wave dummy; the estimates when controls
were added indicated a change in approval from 51.8% to 71.3%, or a difference of 19.5 percentage
points (p <0.01), as shown in Table 2.
    The overall effect of information was not driven by any specific sub-group (Figure 4). Women
and men had similar baseline levels of support and similar responses to information. Liberals and
moderates were slightly more sensitive to information than were conservatives. Subjects with lower
educational attainments had a larger response than those with at least a college degree, perhaps
because they were less knowledgeable about the topic; conversely, this result may raise concern that
less informed people may overreact to information. Similarly, subjects reporting a monthly personal
income below $2,500 (approximately the median level in the US) were marginally more reactive to
information than those with higher earnings, and generally displayed less support for a market-based
solution to alleviate organ supply shortages. Finally, people who reported being religious were less in
favor of payments for organs and slightly less impacted by the information than were those who
declared being atheist or agnostic. In general, as mentioned, all of these differences were small and of
limited or no statistical significance. Appendix Table A4 reports the heterogeneous effects estimates
from regressions that included the full set of controls.

3.2 Exploring mechanisms
We conducted auxiliary analyses to explore possible sources of the results, and in particular to
corroborate our interpretation that the changes in support for organ payments can be attributed to the
subjects having read and reflected upon the topic-relevant information we provided.
    First, pre-existing beliefs about payments for organs may have affected whether the subjects
found the provided information credible or not, and this could in turn have had an effect on how
people responded to information (Kahan et al. 2011). To explore this possibility, we asked the
participants in the treatment group whether they found the information supplied in the text reliable
(we did so after gauging their attitudes toward organ payments in order to not influence their
response). Table 3 shows that about 90% of subjects responded that they found the provided
information reliable; the perceived reliability of the placebo text about the flu was slightly higher.
Because the overwhelming majority of the subjects considered the text reliable, differences in beliefs
about the reliability of the information provided are not playing a role in our setting.
    Second, we replicated the study (in September and October 2014, with a total of 2,762 new
subjects) using two other activities prohibited by law in large part because considered ethically
repugnant. The first issue was the legalization of indoor prostitution. In this case, the subjects were
provided a text including information about recent academic work that showed that the legalization
of indoor prostitution in a US state led to large reductions in sexual violence and certain sexually
transmitted diseases (Cunningham and Shah 2014). We expected the case of prostitution to be
ethically charged to a comparable extent as payments for organs, with the subject population being
almost equally split between those in favor to it and those opposed. It is also reasonable to expect
heterogeneities in the population in the reaction to information for this activity. For example, there is
evidence that women and religious individuals are more opposed to legalizing prostitution (Brehman
2010, Jakobsson and Kotsadam 2009, May 2009). These different views may also affect how
information is interpreted. Evidence of greater heterogeneities as compared to the case of organ
payments would offer further support to the interpretation that the effects that we found derive from
actual reflection and specific reactions to the information supplied. The second topic that we chose
was a case for which we expected both very low approval rates and minimal impact of information
and cost-benefit considerations: the legalization of slavery contracts. In this case, subjects were
assigned a text that reported historical evidence about the relative condition of slaves and freed men
in the US before and after the abolition of slavery (Fogel and Engerman 1974), information about the
current presence of millions of de facto slaves in developing countries, and that suggested that




                                                    10
allowing slavery contracts might improve the living conditions of de facto slaves. Results from
comparing mean levels of support are reported in Figure 5, and a complete set of estimates from all
of these analyses can be found in Appendix Table A5.4
    A few patterns emerged from these data. First, the overall level of support for legalizing indoor
prostitution exceeded 60%, a little higher than payments for organs; by contrast, it was very low
(about 5% and statistically indistinguishable from zero) for the legalization of slavery. Second, in
both cases, there was no sizeable or statistically significant effect of the text on the support for
legalizing the activity. Third, the overall absence of a response to information masked considerable
heterogeneity across different sub-groups of subjects. For example, women and men had different
reactions to the information about the beneficial effects of legalizing indoor prostitution; the
information produced increased support among men, but decreased support among women. The
decrease for women may be due to this subgroup reacting to the additional focus on prostitution with
even more repugnance; alternatively, this may be due to women expecting even larger gains in
efficiency from legalization of the activity. Similarly, a relatively large proportion of men supported
the introduction of a regulated framework for slavery contracts as a result of being exposed to the
arguments presented in the text whereas the effect on women was small and in the opposite direction.
These responses were in contrast to those produced by the case of organ payments, for which the
effects were very similar between genders. Support rates as well as size and direction of responses to
information also differed based on whether subjects were religious in the case of legalizing
prostitution (religious subjects had lower support rates and minimal reaction to information), and on
political views in the case of legalizing slavery (although estimates were very imprecise and
generally not significantly different from zero; the few negative estimates should be attributed the
limited size of some of the sub-samples that created additional noise).5
    These findings reinforce our interpretation that the effects that we found in the case of organ
payments were not an automatic reflex of experimental subjects to any kind of information presented
to them; in other words, subjects were paying close attention to the actual content of the texts and
responded to the information provided.6 The results are also consistent with the presence of limited

  The Appendix also includes a graphical representation of these additional interventions (Figures A1 and A2) as
well as the texts and questions on legalizing prostitution and slavery that were administered to the subjects
5
  The differences in responses along other individual characteristics—such as income and education for both
prostitution and slavery, religiosity for slavery, and political views for prostitution— were limited in size and
statistical significance (we report these in the Appendix).
6
  An additional result from a companion paper (Elias, Lacetera and Macis 2015) provides further corroboration for
our interpretation of the findings here. We tested the effect of a generic text describing the beneficial welfare
properties of market exchanges. The text treatment had a statistically insignificant (directionally negative) effect on

heterogeneity in individuals’ preferences in the case of organ payments. For the case of prostitution
and slavery, the fact that there are some specific groups that are not sensitive to the information
provided implies, in contrast, that preferences heterogeneity is more relevant, and as a consequence
repugnance is more likely to persists.


4. Discussion
Whether an activity is perceived as morally acceptable is resolved by every society with variations
depending on time, location, and cultural norms; these choices are part of the social contract that ties
a community together. Because prohibiting an activity on the ground of its moral repugnance does
not necessarily have an objective, rational basis, differences are to be expected. Although these
attitudes may be very deeply held, investigations into whether logical arguments or empirical
evidence about the effects of allowing a given repugnant transaction affect these attitudes is valuable;
these studies may offer insights into whether it is possible to change the position of a portion or even
the majority of a population. This is particularly relevant when repugnance-based prohibitions limit
the possibility to implement life-saving solutions to such problems as the shortage of human organs
for transplantation, or to even empirically evaluate these solutions, for example in pilot trials.7
    In this study we found that, when provided with information about and arguments for different
strategies to address the organ shortage, including the potential benefits of payments to organ donors,
the share of individuals showing support for a market-based solution increased substantially.
Supplementary evidence regarding support for two other repugnant activities (slavery and
prostitution) showed that the role of information and cost-benefit considerations in changing attitudes
was heterogeneous and specific to each topic, and also interacted with deeply held beliefs and other
individual characteristics such as gender, religiosity, and political orientation. Thus, at any given
time, not all beliefs about which transactions are repugnant are equally strong and immutable, or
permeable to information. One further implication of these case-specific effects is that thinking about
market solutions does not necessarily “corrupt” moral values (Falk and Szech 2013, Sandel 2012) by
affecting people’s preferences; if this were the case, we would likely see similar responses across the
board. Instead (although we cannot provide direct evidence of this), thinking about tools to achieve




attitudes about organ payments and legalized prostitution, again suggesting that attitudes about payments to organ
donors were due to the information provided about costs and benefits specific to this transaction.
7
  See for example the correspondence between Delmonico et al. (2012) and Matas et al. (2012) on whether these
trials should be implemented.




                                                       12
more effective solutions (e.g., to the organ shortage problem) might shift the attention from the moral
judgement of a third party to the interests of the parties involved in the transaction.
    Our findings provide insights into the role of information and scientific evidence in how people
perceive activities and transactions that are morally charged and the importance of the choice set in
individuals decisions; supplying evidence and promoting studies on a number of sensitive topics
might therefore lead to greater awareness and improved policy design based on the actual preferences
of a population. In the case of introducing regulated payments for organ donors and their families in
particular, the evidence is particularly strong that informing society about the potential benefits of
economic incentives does impact the acceptability of this transaction. However, the heterogeneity
within and between activities described above points to the complexity of such interventions, and is
consistent with taking a case-specific approach to these issues.
    The results also relate to a number of related studies in several disciplines, such as research on
how beliefs affect individual analytical reasoning (Kahan 2003, Leget 2009), whether ethical
principles are, at least in part, evidence-based (Heath 2012), and whether ethical decisions and
actions depend on information about the costs and benefits of these choices (Gibson et al. 2013). The
findings, finally, are consistent with attitudes toward repugnant markets evolving over time in
response to changes in the costs and benefits of the underlying activities, for example due to
technological progress (Elías 2015).
    Further research to investigate the trade-offs that individuals face between rational (or evidence-
based) arguments and deeply-held moral beliefs appears promising for both scholarly advancements
and shaping public policy.

text, organ shortage text with question not related to payment for organs, and organ shortage text with question
related to payments for organs. The estimates are for the full sample as well as only for the May wave when these
more disaggregated conditions were run. Covariates include indicators for gender, job status, income level,
educational attainment, relationship status, whether the respondent has children, monthly income, political views,
religious beliefs, whether the subject donated to charity or volunteered in the previous two years, state of
residence, as well as age in linear and quadratic value. An indicator for the second intervention wave is also added.

PART 1: TEXT

The Current Situation of the Kidney Transplant System
In 2013, 99,500 Americans were on the waiting list for a new kidney (1). Yet, only about 16,900 kidney
transplant operations were performed in that year. The current average waiting time for a kidney transplant
is 4.7 years, up from about 2.9 years only a decade ago (2). A significant increase in the supply of kidneys
available for transplantation is required to reduce waiting times.
Kidneys for transplantation come from either deceased or living donors (people who can remain healthy with
only one kidney). Finding a compatible kidney is not easy. There are four basic blood types, and tissue
matching involves the combination of six proteins. Blood and tissue type determine the likelihood that a
kidney will help a recipient in the long run.
Most organ procurements efforts in the U.S. have focused on increasing the pool of altruistic donors, e.g. by
expanding living donor inclusion criteria and through organ donor awareness campaigns. In recent years,
kidney exchanges—in which pairs of living would-be donors and recipients who prove incompatible look for
another pair or pairs of donors and recipients who would be compatible for transplants, cutting their wait
time—have become more widespread. In 2013, 590 kidney transplants were performed through these
exchanges, accounting for 10% of live donations and 3.5% of all kidney transplants, including those with
after-death donations.
In an attempt to increase cadaveric organ donations, some nations have enacted the principle of “implied
consent”, whereby organs from cadavers are assumed to be available for transplant unless, before death,
individuals indicate that they don't want their organs to be used. However, even with the capture of all
potential deceased donor organs, the gap will not be closed. In 2013, the demand for kidney transplants was
25,500 (3). To satisfy demand, the system would need to generate about 50 deceased donors per million
people (pmp). Today, the donation rate is 26 pmp (4).
Another proposal to increase the supply of kidneys is to provide compensation to living donors and/or to the
families of individuals who agree in advance to donate a kidney after they die, within a regulated framework.
According to some studies (5), a sufficient payment to kidney donors could increase the supply of kidneys by
a large percentage. Estimates that consider the risk to donors from transplant surgery, the number of weeks
of work lost during the surgery and recovery periods, and the risk of reduction in the quality of life, indicate
that with a payment of about US$15,000 for a kidney (6), the total number of kidney transplants would
increase from 16,900 to 23,10 (7).

(1) Unless indicated otherwise, all numbers on the kidney transplant system are from the Organ Procurement and
Transplantation Network (OPTN) of the United States.
(2) Using data from OPTN, the average waiting time is computed by dividing the number of patients in the waiting list by the
total number of transplants and the number of deaths on the waiting list.
(3) Using data from OPTN, the annual demand is computed as the total number of kidney transplants plus the growth in the
waiting list and number of death in the waiting list.

PART 1: TEXT
The flu: basic facts and prevention guidelines
Influenza (flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses (1). Symptoms include fever
or feeling feverish/chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, and
fatigue (2).Especially older people, young children, and people with certain health conditions are at high
risk for serious flu complications.
Most experts believe that flu viruses spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough,
sneeze or talk. Less often, a person might also get the flu by touching a surface or object that has flu
virus on it and then touching their own mouth, eyes or possibly their nose. You may be able to pass on
the flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as while you are sick (3). Most healthy
adults may be able to infect others beginning 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days
after becoming sick.
The single best way to prevent the flu is to get a flu vaccine each season (4). Commonly available are
Traditional flu vaccines (5) made to protect against three different flu viruses (two influenza A viruses
(H1N1 and H3N2) and one influenza B virus), called “trivalent” vaccines, and those that protect against
four different flu viruses (two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses), called “quadrivalent”
vaccines.
Yearly flu vaccination should begin soon after flu vaccine is available, ideally by October. However,
getting vaccinated even later can be protective, as long as flu viruses are circulating. Although seasonal
influenza outbreaks can happen as early as October, most of the time influenza activity peaks in January
or later (6). Since it takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body that
protect against influenza virus infection, it is best that people get vaccinated so they are protected
before influenza begins spreading in their community.

Everyone who is at least 6 months of age should get a flu vaccine (7). This recommendation has been in
place since February 24, 2010 when CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted
for “universal” flu vaccination in the United States to expand protection against the flu to more people.
It is especially important for some people to get vaccinated, including people who are at high risk of
developing serious complications (like pneumonia) if they get sick with the flu, and people who live with
or care for others who are at high risk of developing serious complications.

Prostitution condition

PART 1: TEXT

Prostitution in the United States
Prostitution in the United States is illegal, except in some rural counties in Nevada. The prohibition is
enforced in different forms, such as incarcerating sex workers, charging individuals engaging in
prostitution with a felony, or implementing prostitution diversion programs. Prostitution, however, is
present in most parts of the country, in various forms. In the last 15 years, the American prostitution
market has shifted from a primarily outdoor (street-based) to an indoor market (massage parlors, escort
agencies, and much of the online activity) (1). The prostitution trade is estimated to gross over $14
billion a year in the US (2). A 2004 poll reports that 30% of single men over the age of 30 have paid for
sex in the US (3).
Disease transmission and victimization risks are associated with sex markets. The 1992 National Health
and Social Life Survey (NHSLS) reports that 22.9% of female prostitutes report they have had gonorrhea
relative to 4.7% of non-prostitute females. The spread of this and other sexually transmitted diseases is
a public health concern (4). Sex market-related violence is also common. One study finds that 68% of
women engaged in street-level prostitution have been raped by clients and another reports that one
third of all serial murder victims are prostitutes (5).
To reduce the potential costs associated with prostitution, some analysts have proposed decriminalizing
indoor sex work, but few governments have been willing to experiment with the policy. It has been
argued that indoor prostitution typically involves less exploitation, less risk of violence, more control
over working conditions, more job satisfaction, and higher self-esteem (6). Street prostitution has higher
rates of gonorrhea (7), rape and sexual assault than indoor prostitution (8).
A recent study (9) finds that the decriminalization of indoor prostitution in Rhode Island in 2003 caused
both forcible rape offenses and gonorrhea incidence to decline for the overall population. From 2004 to
2009, reported rape offenses decreased by 31% and the number of cases of female gonorrhea
decreased by 39%.

Slavery condition

PART 1: TEXT

Slavery in the modern world
Slavery is a system under which people are treated as property to be bought and sold, and are forced to
work (1). Historically, slavery was institutionally recognized by most societies; in more recent times,
slavery has been outlawed in all countries (2).
Slavery is officially illegal in all countries, but according to the International Labor Organization (ILO) 20.9
million men, women and children around the world are in slavery (3). Mauritania was the last
jurisdiction to officially outlaw slavery (in 1981/2007), but about 10% to 20% of its population is
estimated to live in slavery (4).
Contemporary slavery takes various forms and affects people of all ages, gender and races. Under
contemporary slavery people suffer mental or physical threat; mental or physical abuse or the threat of
abuse; dehumanized treatment, they are physically constrained or have restrictions placed on their
freedom of movement (5).
Although no country has experimented this, could the introduction of an institutional framework that
would legalize slavery (e.g., through “slavery contracts”) improve the living conditions and opportunities
of “de facto” slaves?
In the book Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery (1974) (6), Robert Fogel and
Stanley Engerman show that following emancipation and the end of the Civil War, the life expectancy of
freedmen declined by ten percent, and their illnesses increased by twenty percent compared to slavery
times. Fogel and Engerman asserted that slavery had a reciprocal economic benefit for slave owners and
slaves. They wrote, “[S]lave owners expropriated far less than generally presumed, and over the course
of a lifetime a slave field hand received approximately ninety percent of the income produced.” The
authors estimated the value of housing, clothing, food and other benefits received by the slaves and
argued that they lived as well in material terms as did free urban laborers; life was equally difficult for
both classes of individuals.
