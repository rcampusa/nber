                                            ABSTRACT

Gender disparities in academic performance may be driven in part by the interaction of teacher and
student gender, but systematic sorting of students into classrooms makes it difficult to identify causal
effects. We use the random assignment of students to Korean middle school classrooms and show
that the female students perform substantially better on standardized tests when assigned to female
teachers; there is little effect on male students.

                                      Abstract
         Gender disparities in academic performance may be driven in part by
      the interaction of teacher and student gender, but systematic sorting of
      students into classrooms makes it difficult to identify causal effects. We
      use the random assignment of students to Korean middle school class-
      rooms and show that the female students perform substantially better on
      standardized tests when assigned to female teachers; there is little effect
      on male students.


1    Introduction
Gender gaps in academic performance, with girls generally outperforming boys
in language arts and boys generally outperforming girls in math, have persisted
despite decades of effort to close them. Understanding the causes of these gaps
is crucial, especially at younger ages, as they may lead to gender differences in
later course-taking, occupational choices, and labor market outcomes (Lavy and
Sand, 2015).
    One possible source of gender-based disparities is whether a student and a
teacher share the same gender. These gender interactions may affect academic
performance through changes in the behavior of both parties. For example, role-
model effects predict that students will be more engaged in study when they
are taught by the same-gender teacher (Dee, 2007). A teacher might behave
differently when instructing students of different genders as well, for example,
assigning less difficult homework questions to girls if he or she believes that girls
are less capable in math than boys (Jones and Dindia, 2004).
    The primary threat to identifying the causal effect of teacher-student gender
matches is the nonrandom sorting of students that typifies classroom assignment

in most contexts. For instance, students with a lower propensity to achieve aca-
demically may be more likely to be assigned to a female teacher. Beginning with
Dee (2007), the standard approach in this literature, at least at the primary
and secondary school level, has been to use student interactions with multiple
teachers, generally across different subjects. By using estimates including stu-
dent fixed effects, unobserved student characteristics that are correlated with
student quality and teacher gender will not bias estimation. Dee uses the fact
that the National Education Longitudinal Survey of 1988 surveys two teachers
for every student to estimate within-student teacher-gender effects; he finds evi-
dence of substantial positive impacts on academic achievement of being assigned
to a teacher of the same gender. Moreover, he uses subjective evaluations of
both teacher and student perceptions to show that students are less likely to be
seen as disruptive when evaluated by a teacher of the same gender, and more
likely to report interest in that academic subject.
    On the other hand, Holmlund and Sund (2008) use Swedish secondary-
school panel data and identify the impact of same-gender teachers using teacher
turnover; once they control for subject-specific gender effects, they find no im-
pact of gender matching on student performance. Cho (2012) uses math and
science test score data from 15 OECD countries and, following Dee (2007)’s
identification strategy, shows that there is no significant effect of teacher-student
gender matching in eight of these countries, including the United States. Most
recently, Paredes (2014) examines role model and teacher bias effects with data
from Chile in which students took multiple exams. She finds small but statisti-
cally significant gender-matching effects for girls and no effects for boys, as well
as suggestive evidence that role model effects drive the result.
    However, this within-student estimation approach – even when including
teacher fixed effects – is insufficient if students and teachers are systematically
matched on characteristics correlated with gender. For instance, suppose fe-
male students who would benefit relatively more from having a female teacher
are more likely to be assigned to female teachers who, themselves, are better
role models for female students. In this case, a positive student-teacher gen-
der interaction effect reflects sorting. As Dee notes, “the internal validity of
such within-student comparisons could still be compromised by the nonran-
dom sorting by students with subject-specific propensities for achievement and
by unobserved teacher and classroom traits correlated with gender.” With a
number of indirect tests, like examining spillovers from having a female math
teacher onto science test scores, he finds some such evidence in the NELS:88,
particularly in the assignment of female math teachers. Other studies lacking
random assignment must also indirectly show that the identification strategy
holds; for instance, Paredes (2014) uses previous-year’s test scores to control for
achievement propensity.
    To address this issue, we exploit a unique feature of secondary education
in South Korea: the random assignment of students into a classroom, where
students remain throughout the school day. We provide evidence for our iden-
tifying assumption in a number of ways: first, as-good-as-random assignment
of students to classrooms is a strict policy in South Korea. We confirm that

                                         2
schools follow this policy by surveying a large number of them on the topic. We
also show that assignment to classrooms within a school is uncorrelated with
observable characteristics; that students assigned to same- and opposite-gender
teachers look similar in their observable characteristics; and that our results do
not differ when additional controls, student fixed effects, or teacher fixed effects
are included, as one would expect if assignment is truly random.
    Our reliance on random assignment obviates potential sorting issues that
have been a major concern in previous work.1 We also provide more recent
evidence from an age group similar to that studied in Dee (2007) and, impor-
tantly, our empirical setting is a culture with somewhat different gender norms
than those previously studied. South Korea is ranked 39th of 57 countries in
its residents’ attitudes towards gender equality, much lower than the countries
studied in the analyses above: 29th for Chile, 18th for the United States, and
2nd for Sweden (Brandt, 2011).2
    Our results show that female students’ performance is positively influenced
by having a female teacher, but that there is little same-gender teacher effect
for males. These effects are primarily concentrated in mathematics and English
language scores, as compared to Korean language scores. We also provide some
suggestive evidence on the mechanisms behind these impacts, with female stu-
dents reporting that their female teachers are more likely to encourage them
and to give them an equal opportunity to express themselves.


2     Data
We use cross-sectional data collected by the Korean Educational Development
Institute (KEDI) in July of 2004, at the end of the first semester of middle school
in South Korea. The target schools, covering 6.8% of the relevant population in
South Korea in 2004, were selected by proportionate stratified random sampling.
KEDI surveyed all teachers at the sample schools and all ninth grade students
from two classrooms that were randomly chosen from the sample schools. Our
initial sample consists of 197 schools, 777 Korean, English, and mathematics
teachers linked to surveyed classrooms, 14,372 students, and 11,944 parents. 35
of the schools had all-female students and 34 were all-male.
    In addition to an extensive set of questions, students’ responses were linked
to their scores on the Student Achievement Test, administered by the Seoul
Metropolitan Office of Education (SMOE). Students in the sample were tested
    1 In this way, our approach is most similar to that of Carrell, Page and West (2010), at

the higher education level. They use random assignment of cadets at the United States Air
Force Academy to compulsory math and science courses and show that female professors
significantly reduce the gender gap in performance for female students. Other evidence on
gender-matching effects on student grades, course-taking, and persistence in colleges is mixed;
see, for example, Canes and Rosen (1995), Bettinger and Long (2005), and Hoffmann and
Oreopoulos (2009).
    2 Our work is also related to the literature on the impact of single-sex schools. Park et

al. (2013) find significant positive impacts of single-sex schooling using random assignment
in South Korea, while Jackson (2012) exploits the nature of rules-based school assignment in
Trinidad and Tobago and finds little effect for most students.


                                              3
at the beginning of the second semester of ninth grade in three courses: Korean
language, English language, and mathematics; 12,363 students’ test results were
collected.3
    The teacher questionnaire includes information on teachers’ classroom as-
signments, which we use to link students with their subject teachers. Beginning
with 37,034 student-subject combinations with test score information, we first
drop 6,033 observations without classroom or teacher information. Of these,
42 observations from 14 students have missing classroom information and 5,991
observations from 224 classrooms do not have teacher information due to non-
response by teachers; this reduces the number of teachers in the sample to 777
and the number of students to 12,305.4 For our primary sample, we also drop
6,442 observations for students with multiple subject teachers, for which we
could not make a student-teacher match representing just one student and one
teacher; we also show results including these observations, which are unchanged
from those excluding them. This results in 24,489 student-teacher pairings rep-
resenting 11,659 students and 502 teachers. Among them, 33% of observations
correspond to a female student with a female teacher; 16% are a female student
with a male teacher; 32% are a male student with a female teacher; and the
remaining 19% are male students with male teachers.

2.1     Classroom assignment in South Korea
Elementary school graduates in South Korea are randomly assigned to middle
schools within their district, though since 1996, students in districts whose su-
perintendents allow it are permitted to list several preferred schools; they are
entered into a lottery for each school on their preferred list (Korea Legislation
Research Institute, 2011). At the beginning of each academic year (March 1st ),
middle school students in South Korea are assigned a classroom where they re-
main throughout a school day, and where each subject teacher visits to present
a lesson. Classroom assignment in South Korea is done through some form of
randomization; a typical approach is to order students by their academic per-
formance in the previous year and then place them across classrooms. As an
example, the top ranked student would be assigned to the first classroom, the
second-ranked student assigned to the second classroom, and so on.5 Be it pri-
   3 This exam is administered to 9th graders in Seoul every September; these students would

have taken the test regardless. Students living outside of Seoul but in the KEDI sample took
the same exam on the same day.
   4 A concern is that teacher non-response could somehow be correlated with their impact on

students of different genders. While we cannot completely exclude this possibility, students
dropped from the sample due to teacher non-response have similar test scores (p = 0.77) as
those remaining in the sample. There were also no statistically significant differences in the
other student characteristics we examined.
   5 Kang (2007) uses this same random assignment feature and a different data set on the

performance of Korean students to examine peer effects. As mentioned above, Park et al.
(2013) examine the effect of single-sex education on college-going behavior using data from
Seoul, in which students are not allowed to list preferred schools. Lee et al. (2014) examine
schools in the Seoul metropolitan area to study the effects of single-sex versus co-educational
schooling on academic performance.

vate or public, schools in South Korea use some form of random assignment to
classrooms due to strong social norms (Kang, 2007).6 In Section 3.1, we fur-
ther examine whether random assignment holds in our data based on students’
observable characteristics.


3       Methodology
3.1     Tests of Random Assignment
3.1.1    Pearson’s χ2 Tests
While the institutional setting we study is clear that students are randomized
across classrooms without respect to teacher gender, we also provide empirical
evidence to support our identification strategy. We begin by testing whether
students are randomly assigned to classrooms with respect to their observable
characteristics, conducting a series of Pearson’s χ2 tests for independence of a
variety of characteristics and the classroom to which they are assigned. Tested
characteristics include student’s gender, parents’ marital status, parents’ educa-
tion, as well as whether parents own their own home and whether student’s home
has access to the Internet, as proxies for family resources. Parents’ education
has seven categories and the other variables are indicator variables.
    We perform 2,082 Pearson’s χ2 tests across six characteristics and 453 school-
subject combinations.7 115 of these p-values are lower than or equal to five
percent, rejecting the null hypothesis of independence for 5.2% of the tests.
Therefore, there is little evidence of nonrandom assignment of students into
classroom with respect to student’s observable characteristics.
    To check whether the rejections are concentrated in particular schools, we
examine distributions of the number of rejections by school. Figure 1 shows
the distributions for all subjects and each subject. Two schools have a total of
six rejections in all subjects combined and one school has five rejections. Only
one school has as many as three rejections in one subject, suggesting that no
schools that are failing to comply with the random assignment of students to
classrooms. Further, omitting the three schools with five or six total rejections
from our estimates does not affect the results.

3.1.2    Difference in Mean Characteristics
Another approach is to compare the groups of students taught by same- and
opposite-gender teachers. If the students are randomly assigned to the teachers
of the same and opposite gender, then the two groups should look similar in
terms of observable characteristics.
   6 To confirm this point, we surveyed local Offices of Education on schools’ rules for classroom

assignment for the 197 schools in our sample. Every one of the 181 schools which responded
reported that they used some form of random assignment, excepting one school which only
had one classroom for each grade.
   7 Some combinations cannot be tested due to missing variables, only a single classroom

from the school remaining in the sample, or the school itself being single-sex.

  Figure 1: Rejections of Classroom-Characteristic Independence by School


    Table 1 presents sample means from our data, with each observation as a
student-teacher pair. Recall that the randomization in our sample is within
schools, though even when looking across schools, the results are fairly well-
balanced. In Panel A, the characteristics for female and male students are
presented separately by teacher gender, demonstrating that students are not
more likely to be assigned to a teacher of the same gender based on observable
characteristics. For male students, there is a statistically significant difference
for home ownership, but it is economically small; moreover, since random as-
signment was done within schools, adjusting for school fixed effects eliminates
the significance of this difference. We also show the mean standardized test
scores by group as a preview of our results. Female students perform substan-
tially better than male students overall, but particularly when they have female
teachers; meanwhile, male students are not greatly affected by the gender of
their teacher. In Panel B, we compare teachers’ characteristics when assigned
female and male students. As in most schools around the world, female teachers
are much more prevalent in our sample, but there are no significant differences
in the types of teachers assigned to students of different gender. These results
further show that students and teachers are randomly assigned to classrooms
irrespective of gender matches.

3.2    Specifications
To analyze the effect of teacher-student gender interaction, we estimate the
following linear regression equation:

       yijsb = β0 + β1 f si + β2 f tj + β3 f si f tj + Xij γ 0 + αs + αb + εijsb ,   (1)

where yijsb is the test score of student i who was taught by teacher j in school s
for subject b. The test scores are normalized in each subject to have mean zero
and variance of one. Because the scores in Korean language, English language
and math are pooled together, we also include subject fixed effects αb . f si and
f tj are indicator variables having value of one when student i and teacher j,
respectively, are female. Xij is a vector of student and teacher characteristics
including indicators for married parents and parental education; teacher charac-
teristics include indicators for graduate degree and graduation from a teachers
college, and indicators for teacher experience of two years or below, two to
three years, three to four years, four to five years, and five years or more. αs
are school fixed effects, included since random assignment of students is done
within schools.
    We estimate the equations by ordinary least squares (OLS), which produces
unbiased estimates given the random assignment of students and teachers to
classrooms. Standard errors are clustered at the school level to accommodate
correlations among students within the same schools; we obtain similar standard
errors clustering at the classroom level or with two-way clustering at the student
and teacher level.
    β1 is the average difference in academic achievement for female compared
to male students with male teachers, while β2 indicates the impact of a female
versus male teacher on performance for male students. The total effect of having
a female teacher for female students can be obtained by adding β2 to β3 , with
β3 as the differential effect on female students, as compared to male students,
of having a female teacher. This last coefficient is the change in the gender
gap between female and male students when switching from a male teacher to
a female teacher.


4     Results
4.1    Main Effects
Table 2 presents the coefficients from estimating variations of Equation (1). All
columns include school fixed effects because random assignment is done within a
school, as well as subject fixed effects. In Columns 3 and 4, student fixed effects
subsume the school fixed effects; in Column 4, teacher fixed effects subsume the
subject effects.
   In Column 1, the coefficient on the female student variable indicates that
female students perform better than male student by about 0.15 of a standard
deviation on average across Korean language, English language, and math when


                                           8
paired with a male teacher. The change in the performance gender gap between
females and males when switching from a male teacher to a female teacher, as
indicated by the interaction effect between female student and female teacher,
is 0.097 standard deviations. This total effect is comprised of a small and statis-
tically insignificant decrease in male performance of 0.021 standard deviations
and an increase in female performance of 0.076. This widening of the gender
gap is substantial, representing more than a third of a year of schooling based
on the general rule of thumb that 1% of a standard deviation of performance is
roughly equivalent to 10 days of schooling (Carlsson et al., 2012).

 Notes: Each column represents a separate regression. Column 1 through 4 are for students taught by a single subject teacher,
 with each variable as a binary indicator. Column 5 includes students taught by either single or multiple subject teachers, with the
 female teacher variable representing the fraction of the student’s subject teachers who are female. School and subject fixed effects
 are, respectively, subsumed by student and teacher fixed effects. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at school level.

     Including teacher background controls in Column 2 does not change the co-
efficients of our interest much.8 We include student fixed effects in Column 3 to
test for the presence of unobserved student characteristics correlated with the
variables of interest. They do not change the gender gap appreciably. Finally,
in Column 4, we add teacher fixed effects to specification in Column 3 to test
whether unobserved teacher characteristics are driving our results, despite ran-
dom assignment. The teacher-student gender interaction coefficient remains the
same size and is statistically significant at p = 0.056. Taken together with the
evidence in Section 3.1, the stability of this coefficient strongly suggests that
the random assignment to classrooms in South Korea is, indeed, in place. As
such, the interpretation of our results is free of the potential problems caused
by sorting on unobservable characteristics.

nonresponses in the data reduce the sample substantially.



                                                                      9
dropped due to students having multiple subject teachers, we include them in
Column 5. This specification corresponds to that in Column 1, but the female
teacher variable represents the fraction of the student’s subject teachers who are
female. About 90% of these additional observations are groups of two teachers;
nearly all of the remaining ones have three teachers. The results are essentially
unchanged, with the gender gap increasing by 0.10 standard deviations when
all of a female student’s teachers are female themselves.

4.2    Effects by Subject
The gender gap differs substantially by subject, with female students generally
performing substantially better than males in language arts but about even or
slightly worse in science and mathematics (OECD, 2015). Teachers’ impacts
may be greater in mathematics, given negative stereotypes about female math-
ematical ability; for example, Spencer, Steele and Quinn (1999)’s experimental
study shows that negative stereotypes regarding the mathematical ability of
female students negatively affects their test scores.
    To test whether our results vary by subject, we fully interact the specification
in Column 1 of Table 2 with indicators for English and mathematics. The
coefficients, in Panel A of Table 3, show the full set of interactions. We note
that female students perform far better than male students in Korean (0.34
standard deviations) and English (0.20 standard deviations), and about evenly
in math (-0.04 standard deviations), with the last of these differences being
statistically insignificant. In Panel B, we combine the relevant coefficients to
calculate the change in the gender gap between female and male performance
when switching from a male to female teacher. For Korean language courses, the
gender gap between girls and boys does not widen significantly, though it does
for English and math; however, there are no statistically significant differences
between these effects.

4.3    Evidence on Mechanisms
To investigate the mechanisms underlying the positive impact of female teachers
on female students, we examine a series of student responses about classroom
interactions, as well as questions about private tutoring asked of parents. There
are numerous such questions in the KEDI data, but we chose to focus primar-
ily on those relating to the student’s behavior in class and perceptions of the
teacher. Columns 1 to 5 correspond to the specification in Column 1 of Table 2,
in which the dependent variable is an indicator for whether the student agrees
or agrees strongly with the following sentiments: I feel comfortable asking the
teacher a question; the teacher provides students with equal opportunity to par-
ticipate in class; the teacher encourages students to express themselves; this is
my favorite subject; and I ask many questions in this class. In Column 6, the
dependent variable is a continuous measure of hours of study in that subject
(excluding hours spent at tutoring). Column 7, asked of parents, reports the
likelihood of receiving tutoring in the subject; note that over 60% of students

receive tutoring. In Column 8, we examine the effect on the log of tutoring
expenditures, conditional on reporting any. This variable, reported by parents
as well, provides an indication of tutoring intensity, both in terms of time and
personal attention.
    It is interesting to note that all students report greater comfort in asking
questions when the teacher is female, but there is no additional effect on female
students. Female students are significantly less likely to feel as if they have an
equal opportunity to participate or are encouraged with male teachers, but this
negative outcome is eliminated when the teacher is female. Female students are
also significantly more likely to report that the subject is their favorite when
the teacher is female, though interestingly enough, they are less likely to report
asking many questions. There is no effect on hours of study, nor on either
tutoring outcome variable.
    Taken together, these results provide some suggestive evidence that the in-
crease in female student performance with female teachers is driven by teacher
rather than student behavior. Female students do not report increased effort as
reflected in studying or tutoring, but they do report feeling that female teachers
provide a more inclusive learning environment. We are careful not to draw too
strong of a conclusion, though. After all, if female students are learning more
effectively in classrooms with female teachers due to role model effects, they are
less likely to need to put forth additional effort outside of the classroom.


5    Conclusion
Understanding the effect of teacher-student gender interactions on student’s
academic achievement is important not only for evaluating policies to close the
gender gap in academic achievement, but also to enhance understanding of the
education production function. However, it is difficult to estimate a student-
teacher gender match effect free of selection bias because of the nonrandom
sorting of students.
    In this study, we estimate the impact of teacher-student gender matches
on academic achievement using the random assignment of students in South
Korea. We find that the performance gender gap between female and male
students increases dramatically when switching from male to female teachers.
Male students do not appear to benefit from a teacher of the same gender, but
female students’ performance increases by about 8% of a standard deviation
when they are taught by a female teacher. This effect is large, and driven
primarily by performance in English and mathematics courses. We provide
suggestive but not conclusive evidence that teacher behavior drives this increase
in student achievement. Our findings are consistent with previous results that
find that gender interactions matter. Given the random assignment nature of
our data, we conclude that these interactions reflect genuine changes in the
classroom environment rather than sorting on unobservables.
