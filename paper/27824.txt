                                         ABSTRACT

We survey over 1,000 institutional and corporate venture capitalists (VCs) at more than 900
different firms to learn how their decisions and investments have been affected by the COVID-19
pandemic. We compare their survey answers to those provided by a large sample of VCs in early
2016 and analyzed in Gompers, Gornall, Kaplan, and Strebulaev (2020). VCs have slowed their
investment pace (71%of normal) and expect to invest at 81% of their normal pace over the
coming year. Not surprisingly, they have devoted more time to guiding the portfolio companies
through the pandemic. VCs report that 52% of their portfolio companies are positively affected or
unaffected by the pandemic; 38% are negatively affected; and 10% are severely negatively
affected. Overall, they expect the pandemic to have a small negative effect on their fund IRRs
(-1.6%) and MOICs (-0.07). Surprisingly, we find little change in the allocation of their time to
helping portfolio companies relative to looking for new investments. In general, we find only
modest differences between institutional and corporate VCs.

1      Introduction

Many of the most innovative young companies depend on a steady inflow of venture capital (VC)
money. The sudden arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected many facets of
the global economy, and many commentators worry this shock will choke off venture capital flow.
VCs have variously described COVID-19 as the “Black Swan of 2020”2 and claimed the “global VC
market has completely locked up.”3 If such dire predictions are true, that would have important
consequences for the innovation ecosystem. In this paper, we explore the impact of COVID-19 on
the VC industry by surveying a large fraction of active VCs in the United States and abroad.


VC investing is normally subject to a great deal of uncertainty about the future. This uncertainty
typically entails issues related to the quality of the management team, the development of nascent
markets, or the potential of new technologies. VC practices have evolved to manage these sources
of uncertainty. The shock of the COVID-19 pandemic introduced a massive amount of a new form
of uncertainty into the economy and, potentially, into VC investing. The nature of this uncertainty
is likely substantially different from the type of uncertainty that VCs have historically evaluated.
A natural question to ask is whether the uncertainty introduced by the COVID-19 crisis has
changed the nature of the way VCs operate or whether the industry is immune to the type of
uncertainty that the pandemic has created.


In this paper, we explore that question and others using a survey of more than 1,000 VCs. We
explore the extent of the shock on VC investments and how VCs have responded to the shock.
We also gain insight into how VCs perceive the impact of the crisis and their views on the expected
duration of the shock. Our survey allows us to explore differences across different types of investors
(institutional VCs vs. corporate VCs), stage of investment (early-stage vs. late-stage VCs), as well

as information technology vs. healthcare VCs. We also consider differences in the severity of the
pandemic.


Our survey builds on a prior survey of institutional VCs conducted in late 2015 and early 2016
by Gompers, Gornall, Kaplan, and Strebulaev (2020), henceforth GGKS (2020). GGKS (2020)
provide detailed information on VCs’ practices in pre-investment screening (sourcing, evaluating,
and selecting investments), structuring investments, and post-investment monitoring and
advising.4 GGKS (2020) also examine internal VC firm management issues, e.g., how VCs allocate
their time and manage their relationships with the limited partners (LPs) who provide them
capital.


Like GGKS (2020), we survey many VCs who make up a significant fraction of the industry. We
obtained responses from more than 1,000 VCs and complete responses from over 800. Unlike
GGKS (2020), we include responses from corporate VCs in addition to institutional VCs. We do
this because the numbers of corporate VCs have increased substantially over the last several years
and they are not so heavily researched.


We received responses from over 900 institutional VCs at over 800 VC firms and over 100 corporate
VCs representing over 100 corporations to learn how their decisions and investments have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We compare their survey answers to those provided by a
large sample of VCs in early 2016 and analyzed in GGKS (2020).


First, we consider how the pandemic is affecting new investments. VCs report that during the
first half of 2020, their investment pace is 71% of their normal, expected activity. They expect
that their investment pace will be 81% of their normal pace for the rest of the year. Roughly one-
quarter report that they have struggled to evaluate new deals. This is consistent with the behavior
of VC investment in past recessions, as shown by Howell et al. (2020). The extent of the decline,
however, is expected to be more modest than in the dotcom bust of 2001 and 2002, when

                                                     3
investment declined by more than 50% and the financial crisis, when investment declined by 30%
in 2009.


Next, we asked the VCs about their investment terms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although
the VCs expect investment terms to become more investor friendly, the terms they reported using
were actually more founder friendly than the terms reported by GGKS (2020).


We also asked VCs about the status of their existing companies. They report that 52% of their
portfolio companies are positively affected or unaffected by the pandemic; 38% are negatively
affected, but not in critical condition; and 10% are severely negatively affected or in intensive
care. Consistent with this, the VCs expect the pandemic to have only a small negative effect on
their fund internal rates of return (IRRs), down 1.6%, and cash-on-cash returns (MOICs), down
by 0.07. The VCs also remain optimistic about their own performance, with 91% believing they
will outperform public markets, and overall VC performance, with 75% believing the VC industry
as a whole will outperform.


Finally, despite nearly half of the VCs’ portfolio companies being affected in some way by the
COVID-19 pandemic, we find surprisingly little change in the allocation of their time to helping
portfolio companies relative to looking for new investments. GGKS (2020) found that VCs tended
to be active in their portfolio companies and the VCs in our current survey remain active in their
companies, albeit not substantially more so. Throughout, we find modest differences between
institutional and corporate VCs. This suggests the corporate VCs have incorporated many of the
practices of institutional VC firms.


Overall, we conclude that the most dire predictions of the impact of COVID-19 on venture capital
have not materialized. Although the pandemic has not yet run its course and a lot of uncertainty
remains, our evidence suggests that the VC industry and its portfolio companies have reduced
their activity less than in previous recessions and have been more resilient than many other sectors
of the global economy. Our conclusions have important implications for the state and development
of the innovation ecosystem and high-growth companies.

statistics. In Section 3, we outline how VCs’ investing activities have changed due to COVID-19.
In Section 4, we describe the impact on deal structure. In Section 5, we report VCs’ perspective

In Section 8, we conclude.


2      Methodology

2.1    D esign

In this section, we describe the research design of our survey. We begin with the survey we used
in GGKS (2020). We eliminated more technical questions and added questions regarding the
COVID-19 pandemic. The final version of the survey is available as an Internet Appendix.


We administered the survey using Qualtrics and we solicited all the survey respondents via e-mail.
We used several sources to compose our mailing list. First, we used alumni databases from the
Chicago Booth School of Business, Harvard Business School, and Stanford Graduate School of
Business. The MBA graduates of these schools constitute a disproportionate number of active
VCs. A study by Pitchbook identified those schools as three of the top four MBA programs
supplying VCs, with more than 40% of VCs holding an MBA from one of the three schools.5 We
identified alumni related to VC and manually matched them to VentureSource, a database of VC
transactions that is maintained by Dow Jones, and PitchBook., a database of private capital
markets maintained by Pitchbook. We ended up with 92, 801, and 1,005 individuals from Chicago,
Harvard, and Stanford business schools, respectively.


Second, we partnered with the Kauffman Fellows Program, which trains VCs and maintains a
vibrant network of past Fellows. The Kauffman Fellows Program emailed the survey to 680 alums


5See http://pitchbook.com/news/articles/harvard-4-other-schools-make-up-most-mbas-at-pe-vc-firms.
Accessed July 30, 2020.


                                                   5
on our behalf. Third, we used contact information on VCs from two large VC datasets,
VentureSource and PitchBook. After excluding the people from the four samples identified above,
we first arrived at a sample of 7,945 VCs identified in the PitchBook sample. Finally, after
excluding the people from all the above samples, we identified further 7,028 individuals in the
VentureSource sample. We believe our survey encompassed the overwhelming majority of
individuals who are active VCs in the United States as well as many non-U.S. VCs.


Our sample construction raises several issues, and we attempted to address them in the survey
design. One is that some of the people we emailed may not be VCs. Our first criteria for deciding
whether individuals were VCs was their identification as such either by the organizations that
provided us their information or by our analysis of VentureSource and PitchBook. We emailed
only people we positively confirmed as VCs.


As a further filter, at the start of the survey, we asked respondents whether they worked at an
institutional VC fund, a corporate VC vehicle, or neither. Supporting the notion that our initial
screen worked well, 87% of our respondents identified as working at either a corporate VC vehicle
or an institutional VC fund. The remainder were angel investors, private equity investors, or
family office investors.


For our analyses, we exclude any respondent who did not identify as working at an institutional
VC or corporate VC fund. While the identification is self-reported, in conjunction with other
questions in the survey that are specific to the VC industry, we are confident that our final survey
respondents are active in the VC industry. We also acknowledge that there may be a gray area
that separates late-stage growth-equity VC funds and some private equity funds. We do not believe
that this distinction in any way affects our analyses.

A second potential issue is that our population of VCs may not be representative of the broader

industry. While this is possible, it is important to note that our sample, like the sample in GGKS

(2020) represents a large fraction of all VCs. Based on Pitchbook data, our U.S. VC respondent

have a total of $340 billion in assets under management, about half the total for U.S. VCs. We



                                                  6
had respondents from 70% of the top fifty, 85% of the top twenty-five, and 90% of the top ten VC

firms (ranked by number of investments in PitchBook). At worst, then, we can say that our results

represent the practices of a large fraction of the industry.


Two factors may bias our sample toward more successful VCs. First, a disproportionate part of
our sample comes from the graduates of top MBA programs and the Kauffman Fellows. Because
of our connections, we explicitly targeted Chicago, Harvard, and Stanford MBAs and Kauffman
Fellows. We received relatively high response rates from those groups. Given that both top MBA
programs and the Kauffman Fellows program are extremely selective, these alumni are potentially
more successful than average VCs.6 Second, we include only the VCs who responded to the survey.
It seems plausible that poorly performing or failed VCs would be less likely to fill out the survey.
To the extent that we want to learn about best practices in the VC industry, a positive selection
bias would strengthen our results.


We administered the survey between June 29 and July 15, 2020, a period in which the COVID-
19 pandemic was controlled or slowing in Western Europe and most of Asia but was still active
and growing in the United States. To encourage completion, we offered those who completed the
survey an early look at the results—after the survey was closed but before the results were released
to the public. The survey is fully confidential and all the reported results are based on the
aggregation of many responses to exclude the possibility of inferring any specific respondent’s
answers. However, the survey was not anonymous to us and we matched the survey respondents
with VentureSource, Pitchbook, and other data sources.


Our final response rates are 42%, 14%, 15%, 6%, 6%, and 6%, respectively, from the Chicago,
Harvard, Stanford, Kauffman, PitchBook, and VentureSource samples. Compared to the survey
we administered in 2015 and 2016, the response rate is slightly lower in some of the samples. One
of the reasons is that the time horizon of the present survey was compressed to just 17 days, less


  6   Gompers, Mukharlyamov, and Xuan (2016) show that VCs who are graduates from top colleges and
top MBA schools perform better.



                                                   7
than half the time allowed in GGKS (2020). At the same time, the response from the VC databases
(VentureSource and Pitchbook) was higher than the VC lists we used previously (VentureSource
and the list provided by the NVCA), likely because of our improved ability to filter VCs. Like last
time, we received a much higher overall response rate from the schools with which we are
connected.


Our survey has up to 30 questions and the median survey respondent took 11 minutes to complete
it. The time per question is similar to the previous survey we administered. The 25% percentile
of the time for completion was eight minutes, suggesting that, as five years ago, our respondents
took the survey seriously. As last time, we also enjoyed a high completion rate of 78%.


2.2      Sum m ary statistics

In this section, we provide summary statistics of the sample and introduce the subsamples that
we use in our analyses. We received 1,181 individual responses overall. Table 1 describes how we
filter the responses. We exclude the 148 respondents (13%) who did not self-report they were
institutional or corporate VCs.7 These investors are private equity investors, angel investors, or
family office investors. The second part of Table 1 reports the composition of the final sample of
1,033 institutional and corporate VC respondents. We use all the answers from our 1,033 VC
respondents, with 804 (78%) of those respondents finishing the survey in its entirety. This exceeds
the 885 responses and 565 completions in GGKS (2020). Only 29 (3%) respondents in this sample
indicated that they completed the survey on behalf of someone else.


In many cases, we received multiple responses from different individuals at the same VC firm and
so we have 915 VC firms for our 1,033 respondents. For VC firms where we had more than one
respondent, we averaged the responses of the individual VCs to get a firm-level response.




  7   Institutional VC firms are independent partnerships that manage VC funds on behalf of investors. VCs
who manage funds are traditionally called general partners (GPs) and their investors—limited partners
(LPs).



                                                      8
We were able to match 97% of the firms to PitchBook. As mentioned above, our sample includes
thirty-five of the top fifty and nine of the top ten VC firms (ranked by number of investments) in
PitchBook. This is consistent with the possibility, noted earlier, that our sample is biased towards
more successful firms.


Our first questions concerned the VC firm’s investment focus. We asked respondents whether their
firms specialized in a specific stage of company, industry, or geography. For example, we asked
participants on which stages they specialized (seed, early, mid, late). Firms can specialize along
multiple dimensions at the same time. In our sample of VC firms, 59% specialize in seed- or early-
stage; 9% in mid- or late-stage. Geographically, our sample of VC firms is evenly distributed
among California, the rest of the United States, and foreign locations.


VC firms also often specialize by industry. Over 22% specialize in what can be broadly defined as
the information technology (IT) industry, including software, IT, and consumer internet (“IT”
subsample). Some 9% specialize in healthcare (“Health” subsample). These were also two most
important subsamples in GGKS (2020).


We also consider separately institutional VC (“IVC” subsample) firms and corporate VC (“CVC”
subsample) firms, as they have different structures and often pursue different strategies. In recent
years, CVCs have been playing a more prominent role in the innovation ecosystem. About 10% of
our sample is from corporate VC, the rest is from institutional VC.


We asked our respondents whether they anticipate that COVID-19 will ultimately increase or
decrease the cash-on-cash multiple their existing funds return to LPs. 43% of the VCs who
answered that question report that COVID-19 will decrease their cash-on-cash multiple (the
“Hurt” subsample), while 24% report that COVID-19 will increase their cash-on-cash multiple (the
“Help” subsample). The median VC reported that cash-on-cash returns would be unchanged while
IRRs would fall. This was not an unusual view – one-quarter of the VCs who expected cash-on-
cash returns to be unchanged expected IRRs to decline. This is consistent with a view that exits




                                                  9
will not be lower but simply delayed, due to either a reduced appetite for acquisitions or the
closing of the IPO window.


3      Investment activities

In this section, we report results on VC investment activity and decisions. As discussed in GGKS
(2020), many VCs in our prior survey indicated that deal sourcing and deal selection were the
most important determinants of their investment success. As such, understanding how lockdowns
and other restrictions imposed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic affected these activities is
important.


First, we asked VCs how the pandemic had affected and was likely to affect their investment pace.
Had they made fewer investments so far and did they anticipate making fewer investments for the
rest of the year? GGKS (2020) found that VCs spend a significant amount of time sourcing deals,
reviewing more than 100 opportunities for each deal they close. While not reported in the paper,
GGKS (2020) found that pre-COVID-19, VCs took an average of 83 days to close a deal, spent
118 hours on due diligence, and called ten references for each deal they close. This type of deep
due diligence may be hindered by the restrictions COVID-19 has put on travel and in-person
meetings.


Table 2 reports the VCs’ responses on their investment rate so far in 2020 (roughly half of the
year) and their expected rate for the remainder of the year relative to their expected rate of
investment. Through the first half of 2020, VCs say they have invested at just over 70% of their
normal investment pace. Late-stage and IT investors report a larger decrease in their investment
pace. Two-thirds of our respondents are making fewer investments. Late-stage investors and
investors in IT are more likely to have reduced the pace at which they make deals. Looking forward
to the second half of the year, VCs anticipate that their investment pace will be roughly 80% of
normal, with IT investors, again, showing the largest reduction.




                                                 10
For investors who are making fewer investments, the most common reason is the current difficulty
of evaluating deals. This is particularly important for those who are most affected by COVID-19
and certainly makes sense given the results of GGKS (2020) and the amount of time and effort
required to give due diligence to a deal. In our current survey, late-stage investors indicate that it
is more difficult to evaluate deals. This is surprising because GGKS (2020) found that early-stage
investors put more weight on the management team than late-stage investors. Given the difficulty
of meeting teams in person, it would be reasonable to have expected early-stage investors to have
more trouble evaluating deals. Investors, particularly corporate VCs, also are concerned with
conserving capital and making sure they have dry powder available for follow-on investments.
Finally, IT investors are concerned about meeting fewer quality entrepreneurs. This is likely driven
by the fact that for IT investors, the management team is the most important factor and
evaluating entrepreneurs during the COVID-19 restrictions is much more challenging than
evaluating other components of the investment proposition, such as the business model or the
market.


It is clear from Table 2 that the pandemic has depressed and likely will continue to depress VC
investment activity. This is consistent with the behavior of VC investment in past recessions, as
Howell et al. (2020) showed. The extent of the decline, however, is expected to be more modest
than in the dotcom bust of 2001 and 2002 when investment declined by more than 50% and the
financial crisis when investment declined by 30% in 2009. Our respondents also perceive the effect
of the pandemic on their investment pace as relatively short-lived. One potential explanation is
that the current crisis is not expected to depress earnings in technology-related sectors significantly
or that certain technology areas may be boosted by the pandemic.


Geographic measures of COVID-19 impact were not associated with any of our impact measures.
VCs in states or countries with relatively high COVID-19 case rates, death rates, lockdown
periods, or year-over-year unemployment increases did not report a larger impact on using any of
the measures in Table 2. This is consistent with the impact of COVID-19 coming through national
and international economic disruption and uncertainty, rather than regional channels.



                                                   11
We also were interested in understanding how VCs adjusted their required financial metrics to
different factors and whether their method of adjusting those metrics changed between GGKS
(2020) and the current survey. The current survey repeated a question we asked in the prior
survey, and it provides an indication of how the pandemic might be affecting decision making.


Table 3 reports that over 40% of the VCs use the same financial metric to evaluate all investment
opportunities. This is greater than the 23% who reported this in GGKS (2020). It is a bit
surprising from the perspective of an economist or financial economist that the percentage is so
high and has grown over the last five years. Among those VCs for whom financial metrics vary,
investment riskiness and time to liquidity are the primary considerations, although the
adjustments based upon the investment’s riskiness and the time to liquidity have fallen the most
since the last survey. Industry and financial market conditions also matter, but less so. This result
almost exactly matches the results in GGKS (2020). Healthcare investors, consistent with our
prior results, are more likely to adjust the required financial metric for the investment’s riskiness
than are IT investors. Corporate VCs are reacting more to industry conditions. Overall, this might
indicate that the increase in uncertainty has meant that VCs have decided to embed general
uncertainty equally across all deals.


4      Deal structure

The second stage of the VC process is deal structuring. As in GGKS (2020), we ask VCs how
frequently they used different contractual terms. Specifically, we ask about terms related to cash
flow rights (anti-dilution protection and cumulative dividends); control rights (other special
investor rights); and liquidation rights (liquidation preferences, participation rights, and
redemption rights).


Anti-dilution protection gives the VC more shares if the company raises a future round at a lower
price. Full ratchet anti-dilution is a particularly onerous form of this term. Cumulative dividends
allow the annual dividend to accumulate, whereas non-cumulative dividends effectively amount to
no dividend. The liquidation preference gives investors a senior position in a sale or liquidation.



                                                  12
Participation rights allow VC investors to combine upside and downside protection in a sale or
liquidation (so that VC investors first receive their downside protection and then share in the
upside). Redemption rights give investors the right to redeem their securities, or demand from the
company the repayment of the original amount.


Given the increase in uncertainty due to the pandemic, one might expect these terms to be
stronger, i.e., more VC friendly. Table 4 reports the results of our survey, with higher numbers
corresponding to more use of VC friendly terms. As Figure 1 shows, respondents to the current
survey actually indicate that the terms are more founder-friendly than respondents to our prior
GGKS (2020) survey. Perhaps this reflects the past five years of VC activity and competition that
has led to a general increase in founder-friendly terms. The current COVID-19 pandemic does not
appear to have caused the terms to “revert” to the same investor-friendly level. Participation rights
are used most frequently in our current survey, but in fewer than half of deals. In unreported
results in GGKS (2020), participation was utilized 53% of the time. As in our prior survey,
healthcare VCs were significantly more likely to include participation. Redemption rights and
cumulative dividends are used, respectively, by 27% and 17% of the VCs, with late-stage VCs

using both more frequently. Again, the prevalence of these terms was substantially lower than in
GGKS (2020) in which 45% of respondents stated that they used redemption rights and 27% said
they used cumulative dividends. Finally, VCs make some use of full ratchet anti-dilution and
senior liquidation preferences, albeit again, these frequencies are lower than the frequencies we
find in the earlier survey. In unreported analysis, we find that people who responded to both
surveys show the same significant decreases in the frequency of participation, redemption, full-
ratchet antidilution, and high liquidation preferences.


5      Portfolio company performance and activities

A great deal of research, including Lerner (1995), Hellmann and Puri (2002), Kaplan and
Stromberg (2004), Amornsiripanitch et al. (2016), and GGKS (2020), indicates that VCs are
actively involved in managing their portfolio companies, frequently meeting with their portfolio




                                                     14
companies’ management and playing an important role in critical hiring and strategic decisions.
In this section, we consider the effect of the pandemic on the VC portfolio companies and the
actions that VCs have taken in response.


5.1    Effect of the pandem ic on p ortfolio com panies

We first asked the VCs about the impact of the pandemic on their existing portfolio companies
and their existing funds. Table 5 indicates that VCs felt that 52% of their portfolio companies
were not affected or positively affected by the pandemic. VCs felt that 38% of their companies
were negatively affected, but okay. Finally, VCs felt that 10% of their companies had been very
negatively affected. Unsurprisingly, VCs who reported being more hurt by COVID-19 also
reported that more of their companies were doing poorly. Healthcare VCs indicated that their
companies were less likely to be severely negatively affected (7%) than did IT VCs (11%). These
percentages are substantially more positive than we had expected, particularly the small number
of very negatively affected companies.


Overall, consistent with this evaluation of their portfolio company health, the institutional VCs
expect the pandemic to have a median impact on their fund IRRs of -2% and a median impact
on the fund cash-on-cash multiples of 0.0. This is consistent with the same exit values for
investments, but a longer investment holding period. IT VCs expect a -2% effect on fund IRR at
the median while Healthcare VCs expect no effect.


Although in aggregate VCs have not been much impacted, that aggregation hides significant
heterogeneity. The median VC who expects COVID-19 to improved the cash-on-cash multiple
expects it to increase the cash-on-cash multiple by 1 and IRR by 5%, while the median VC who
expects COVID to decrease the cash-on-cash multiple expects it to decrease the multiple by 0.50
and IRR by 5%. This dispersion suggests that the turbulence produced by the pandemic has
created winners and losers, with the winning companies offsetting the losing companies for the
typical fund.




                                                15
Going forward, the VCs do expect to see an effect of the pandemic on the financing market. They
expect to see declines in follow-on round valuations of roughly 20%, and most expect to see more
investor-friendly terms. Again, there are no meaningful differences between sub-groups, apart from
the COVID-19 impact subgroups, where the “Hurt” sample was more pessimistic. VCs in regions
hit harder by COVID-19 (as measured by case rates, death rates, lockdown periods, or year-over-
year unemployment increases) did not report a larger impact on their companies.


Although VCs expect subsequent valuations to fall, as shown above, they do not expect a large
long-term effect on returns. This is consistent with companies developing new technology today
that have long-term prospects and are immune to short-term market movements. The time horizon
and opportunity may be far enough in the future to insulate the expected payoff of current
investments, regardless of interim market turbulence. Consistent with that view, one-quarter of
the VCs who expected cash-on-cash multiples to be unchanged also expected IRRs to decline.
This suggests that even investors who do not expect exits to be lower expect them to be delayed.


5.2    Involvem ent w ith p ortfolio com panies

We also asked the VCs how they were interacting with their portfolio companies during the
pandemic. Table 6 indicates that half the VCs meet with their portfolio companies once a week
or more frequently while almost 30% meet multiple times per week. There are no significant
differences across subgroups, although institutional VCs meet slightly more often. The high level
of involvement is consistent with previous work and anecdotal evidence.


Table 7 examines VCs’ interaction with their portfolio companies at a more granular level by
asking what the VCs actually do for the companies. The most common activity is providing
strategic guidance, which VCs report doing for almost 68% of their companies. VCs provide
operational guidance for 46% of their companies, connect customers with 43%, and connect
investors with 41%. Table 7 also reports on pandemic-specific activities. Consistent with roughly
half of their companies being sick or in intensive care, they help almost half of their companies to
reduce their burn rate. They help roughly one-third of their companies connect with liquidity,



                                                  16
connect with COVID-19 relief, and connect with equity investors. We also paired questions around
whether VCs were helping portfolio companies to hire or fire employees. Nearly 25% of VCs were
involved with helping portfolio companies to hire new employees, which is higher than the 15% of
portfolio companies in which VCs are helping to fire employees. We find that late-stage VCs are
more likely to be helping their companies to fire employees (17%) than are early-stage VCs (11%).


There is some variation across sub-groups. Corporate VCs are more active in providing
connections to customers, but less active in connecting new hires and providing operational
guidance. Early-stage investors are more active in connecting to new investors. Interestingly, the
responses of those most and least affected by the pandemic are very similar.


Overall, then, the results in this section are consistent with the VCs taking actions to help their
portfolio companies and with those actions having changed somewhat in response to the pandemic.


6          Time management and management of the venture capital firms.

As in GGKS (2020), we asked the survey respondents to describe the structure of their normal
work-week.8 Table 8 shows that VCs report working an average of 58 hours per week, with U.S.
VCs reporting more than 60 hours. Healthcare VCs report spending more time working than IT
VCs (61 hours vs. 56 hours). The 59 total hours compare to 55 total hours reported in GGKS
(2020), suggesting that VCs are working somewhat harder in the pandemic than they did five
years ago.


VCs of all types spend the single largest amount of time working with their portfolio companies
– 19 hours a week. This is consistent with the typical respondent holding five board seats.
Institutional VCs spend more time helping their companies and have more board seats than
corporate VCs. Overall, the amount of time and involvement in portfolio companies is consistent
with their reporting that they add value and help their companies. Surprisingly, the 19.4 hours




    8   Hoyt, Gouw, and Strebulaev (2012) and Rust (2003) present some earlier evidence on VCs’ time use.



                                                       17
            Figure 2: Institutional VC time use in 2015/16 and the COVID-19-era

   This figure reports the average hours per week institutional VC respondents spent on
   each activity in the current survey and compares that with respondents in the 2015/16
   survey by GGKS (2020).




per week for institutional VCs is only one hour greater than the 18.3 hours reported in GGKS
(2020).


VCs still spend an appreciable amount of time sourcing and selecting potential deals despite the
difficulties of traveling and in-person meetings that the pandemic has caused. Sourcing and
networking are the second and fourth most important activities, at 14.4 and 6.4 hours per week,
respectively, for a total of 20.8 hours per week. This is consistent with the VCs’ expectations that
they will continue to invest in new deals this year. The combined 20.8 hours per week for
institutional VCs is modestly lower than the 22.6 hours reported in GGKS (2020).


As Figure 2 shows, the additional hours spent by institutional VCs in this survey appear to have
gone to managing the VC firm and meeting with LPs. These come in at 10.1 and 5.2 hours,
respectively, compared to 8.5 and 3.0 hours in GGKS (2020). This indicates that there are real,
non-investment activities within a VC firm that must be managed by partners and that the
COVID-19 pandemic has increased the time devoted to those activities. Most firms have had to




                                                  18
spend time adapting to remote work and restriction imposed by the current pandemic, and VC
firms are not immune to those challenges.


7      Looking to the future

We conclude our survey with two questions about the future. First, we asked the VCs about their
performance expectations for themselves and VC overall. Table 9 indicates that VCs remain
extremely optimistic about their future performance. Some 91% of institutional VCs expect their
investments to outperform the stock market. Almost 75% expect the VC industry overall to
outperform the stock market. These expectations are largely unchanged from five years ago, when
GGKS (2020) found that 93% of the VCs expected to outperform and 71% believed VC as a whole
would outperform. These expectations are consistent with the relatively positive assessment of
their portfolio companies. Interestingly, Healthcare VCs have slightly lower expectations for their
own performance beating the stock market (85%) than do IT VCs (93%). Even the VCs most
affected by the pandemic hold upbeat views.


Also, consistent with expected outperformance, Table 10 indicates that VCs still maintain a
healthy required return of 32%. This is very similar to the 31% found in GGKS (2020). Corporate
VCs have a significantly lower required IRR hurdle (23%) than do institutional VCs (34%). This
is consistent with CVCs taking strategic (non-monetary) returns into consideration when making
their investment decisions.


Finally, given the volatility in the financial markets, we asked the VCs about the potential concern
that their LPs would want to conserve liquidity and would prefer the VCs not to call so much
capital. Table 10 shows that this is a concern, but likely a minor one. Only 16% of VCs report
that their LPs want fewer capital calls.




                                                  19
8      Conclusion

In this paper, we survey over 1,000 institutional and corporate VCs at over 900 VC firms to learn
how their decisions and investments have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We compare
their survey answers to those provided by a large sample of VCs in early 2016 and analyzed in
Gompers, Gornall, Kaplan, and Strebulaev (2020).


The pandemic has clearly had an impact. We find that VCs have slowed their investment pace
and have spent time guiding portfolio companies through the pandemic. They also report that
10% of their portfolio companies have been very negatively affected.


At the same time, there is some evidence that the pandemic has had only a modest overall impact.
VCs report that 52% of their portfolio companies are positively affected or unaffected by the
pandemic; and 38% are negatively affected, but okay. Overall, they expect the pandemic to have
a small negative effect on their fund IRRs (-1.6%) and MOICs (-0.07). We find surprisingly little
change in the allocation of their time. As several VCs stated in their comments at the end of our
survey, it may be too early for them to appreciate the full extent of the pandemic.


Our data suggest that the VC industry is less affected by COVID-19 than many other parts of
the world economy. This is consistent with two possible stories. First, VC-backed companies may
have been spared from the worst of COVID-19 due to the nature of their businesses. These
companies may be immunized to the negative impact of lockdowns by being more able to pivot
to remote work (Ding, Levine, Lin, and Xie, 2020) and by having large cash reserves and little
debt (Papanikolaou and Schmidt, 2020). Second, VCs’ portfolios may gain in value in disruptive
and volatile environments. If portfolio companies are real options on innovative technologies and
business models, an increase in volatility may increase the value of those options and thus the
value of a VC’s portfolio (Fluck, Garrison, and Myers, 2006; Peters, 2018). Regardless of the
channel, VCs’ relatively strong performance during the pandemic is consistent with much lower
systematic risk than the VC industry exhibited in the dotcom crash and the global financial crisis
earlier this century.



                                                 20
Given the importance of the VC in the global innovation ecosystem and economy, it will be
interesting to see whether these impacts persist and important to follow subsequent industry
developments.
