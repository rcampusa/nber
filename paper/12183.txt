                                         ABSTRACT

Fama and French (2002) estimate the equity premium using dividend growth rates to measure the
expected rate of capital gain. We use similar methods to study the value premium. From 1941 to
2002, the expected HML return is on average 5.1% per annum, consisting of an
expected-dividend-growth component of 3.5% and an expected-dividend-to-price component of
1.6%. The ex-ante HML return is also countercyclical: a positive, one-standard-deviation shock to
real consumption growth rate lowers this premium by about 0.45%. Unlike the equity premium, there
is only mixed evidence suggesting that the value premium has declined over time.

1     Introduction

Value stocks (stocks with high book-to-market ratios) earn higher average returns than

growth stocks (stocks with low book-to-market ratios). (See, for example, Graham and Dodd

1934; Rosenberg, Reid, and Lanstein 1985; Fama and French 1992; Lakonishok, Shleifer, and

Vishny 1994). We study the value premium—the difference between the expected returns of

value stocks and growth stocks—from a fresh angle by constructing an ex-ante measure of

the value premium from cash flow fundamentals.

    Our economic question is important. Following the seminal contributions of Fama and

French (1992, 1993, 1996), the value premium has become arguably as important as the

equity premium in portfolio allocation decisions, estimation of the cost of capital, and many

other applications. Moreover, most previous studies use average realized returns as proxies

for expected returns. But as expected-return proxies, average returns are extremely noisy

(e.g., Elton, 1999; Fama and French, 2002). Specifically, the average return might not con-

verge to the expected return in finite samples. As pointed out by Elton, there are periods

longer than ten years during which the stock market return is on average lower than the risk

free rate (1973–1984), and periods longer than 50 years during which risky bonds underper-

form on average the risk free rate (1927–1981). Fama and French also argue forcefully that

the estimates of expected returns from fundamentals, especially those from dividend growth

are more precise and have lower standard errors than the estimates from the average returns.

    Our estimation methods follow Blanchard (1993) and Fama and French (2002). The idea

is simple. A rearrangement of the Gordon growth model says that:

                                             D
                                        R=     + g,                                       (1)
                                             P


                                             2
                                D
where R is the equity return,   P
                                    is the dividend-to-price ratio, and g is the dividend growth

rate. From equation (1), the expected return can be decomposed into the expected dividend-

to-price ratio and the expected dividend growth. To estimate these two components for

value and growth portfolios, we regress their future dividend-price ratios and future dividend

growth rates onto a set of conditioning variables. The expected value premium can then be

calculated as the expected return of the value portfolio minus that of the growth portfolio.

   Our ex-ante perspective provides fresh insights into the magnitude and components of the

value premium. First, the expected HML return is on average 5.1% per annum from 1941

to 2002, consisting of an expected-dividend-growth component of 3.5% and an expected-

dividend-to-price component of 1.6%. The results are similar for the 1963–2002 subsam-

ple: the expected HML return is on average 5.1% per annum with an expected-dividend-

growth component of 2.8% and an expected-dividend-to-price component of 2.3%. Some-

what surprisingly, a large portion of the value premium comes from the expected-dividend-

growth component. This component is even more important in magnitude than the expected

dividend-to-price component. This evidence suggests that cash flow fundamentals are more

important than mean-reverting valuation ratios in driving the value premium.

   Intriguingly, this result does not contradict the conventional wisdom that growth firms

have more growth options and grow faster than value firms. The crux is that our evidence

is obtained from portfolios rebalanced annually as in the Fama and French (1993) portfolio

approach, while the conventional wisdom is based on portfolios with fixed sets of firms

without rebalancing as in the event-study approach. Using the event-study approach as

in Fama and French (1995), we document that growth stocks have higher real dividend

growth rates than value stocks for ten years around the year of portfolio formation. For



                                                3
example, from the double, 2×3 sort on size and book-to-market, the spread in real dividend

growth between the small-growth and the small-value portfolio is about 15% at the portfolio

formation year. However, with annual rebalancing, the firms in the growth portfolio next

year are not the same as those in the portfolio this year. Because growth rates are measured

using different sets of firms, there is no particular reason to expect the dividend growth of

the growth portfolio to be higher than the dividend growth of the value portfolio.

   And the expected value premium is countercyclical. From 1941 to 2002, the correlation

between the expected HML return and the default spread, a well-known countercyclical vari-

able, is 0.39 with a p-value of 0.00. The correlation between the expected HML return and

the growth rate of real investment, a well-known procyclical variable, is −0.28 with a p-value

of 0.03. The results are similar for the sample from 1963 to 2002. Moreover, the expected

value premium responds negatively to positive shocks to real consumption growth and real

investment growth rates. A positive one-standard-deviation shock to real investment growth

lowers the expected HML return by 0.25–0.30% per annum. And a positive one-standard-

deviation shock to real consumption growth lowers the expected HML return by 0.45–0.50%

per annum. The link between the expected value premium and macroeconomic variables

lends support to the risk-based interpretation of the value premium.

   Finally, purged from its countercyclical fluctuations, the expected value premium exhibits

a downward trend to some extent. But the evidence is somewhat mixed. Schwert (2003)

shows that the magnitude of the value premium has declined in the 1990s following the publi-

cation of Fama and French (1992, 1993), and argues that academic research has made capital

markets more efficient. Our evidence lends some support to this argument. More generally,

however, our evidence suggests that the reversion in profitability of the value strategies in



                                              4
the 1990s is more likely to be driven by the countercyclicality of the expected value premium

rather than by a more permanent downward trend.

    Our paper adds to the growing literature that uses valuation models to estimate expected

returns (e.g., Claus and Thomas 2000; Gebhardt, Lee, and Swaminathan 2000; Campello,

Chen, and Zhang 2005). Our methods follow those in Blanchard (1993) and Fama and

French (2002), who study the properties of the equity premium. We differ from all these

papers because we focus exclusively on the value premium. Our analysis is also connected to

Fama and French (2005), who break average value-minus-growth returns into dividends and

three sources of capital gain including reinvestment of earnings, convergence in market-to-

book ratios and general upward drift in market-to-book. We simply use long-term dividend

growth to measure the rate of capital gain.

    Our story proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes our estimation methods. Section 3

documents descriptive statistics for the ex ante value premium and its two components, the

expected dividend-to-price ratio and the expected dividend growth rate. Section 4 studies

the trend and cyclical properties of the premium. Section 5 deals with a variety of remaining

issues. Finally, Section 6 summarizes and interprets our results.


2     Research Design

Section 2.1 discusses the basic idea underlying our methods, and Section 2.2 presents details

of our sample construction.


2.1    The Basic Idea

We follow Blanchard (1993) and Fama and French (2002) to construct expected returns.

The basic idea is simple. We estimate expected rates of dividend growth and expected

                                              5
dividend-to-price ratios, and then combine them to obtain expected returns.

   To be precise, let Rt+1 be the realized stock return from time t to t+1, i.e., 1+Rt+1 =

(Dt+1 +Pt+1 )/Pt , where Pt is the stock price known at time t, and Dt+1 is the real dividend

paid over the period from t to t+1; Dt+1 is unknown until the beginning of time t+1. If we

assume that the dividend-to-price ratio is stationary, we can solve for Pt as the present value

of future dividends discounted by the sequence of realized rates of return. As in Blanchard

(1993), we next divide both sides by Dt , take conditional expectations at time t, and linearize

to obtain the expected return at time t, denoted Et [Rt+1 ], as:

                                                        
                                                    Dt+1
                              Et [Rt+1 ] = Et              + Et [Agt+1 ],                     (2)
                                                     Pt

where Agt+1 is the long-run growth rate of dividends defined as the annuity value of the

growth rate of future dividends

                                              ∞       i
                                       r̄ − ḡ X 1 + ḡ
                             Agt+1   ≡                      gt+i+1 ,                          (3)
                                       1 + r̄ i=0 1 + r̄

with ḡ and r̄ being the average growth rate of real dividends and the average real stock return,

respectively. Finally, gt+1 denotes the growth rate of real dividends from time t to t+1.

   The interpretation of equation (2) is simple. Expected returns equal expected dividend-

to-price ratios plus expected long-run dividend growth rates. And the expected value pre-

mium equals the sum of the difference in the expected dividend-to-price ratios and the dif-

ference in the expected long-run dividend growth rates between value and growth portfolios.


2.2    Estimation Details

We now discuss the details of estimating expected returns based on equations (2) and (3)

for value and growth portfolios.

                                                     6
Sample Construction

We obtain relevant data from three main sources.                    The first source is the Center

for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP) monthly stock file that contains information

on stock prices, shares outstanding, dividends, and returns for NYSE, AMEX, and

Nasdaq stocks.        The second source is the COMPUSTAT annual research file that

provides accounting information for publicly traded U.S. firms. To alleviate the potential

survivorship bias due to backfilling data, we require that firms be on COMPUSTAT for

two years before using the data. The third source is Moody’s book equity information

used in Davis, Fama, and French (2000), available from Kenneth French’s web site at

http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data-library.html.

       Our sample goes from 1941 to 2002. In earlier periods, only a few firms have data on

dividends once we classify them into value and growth portfolios. As discussed in Cohen,

Polk, and Vuolteenaho (2003), potential problems with disclosure regulations also affect our

choice of the starting date of the sample period.1 We construct value and growth portfolios

by sorting on book-to-market ratios. We implement both a one-way sort to obtain five book-

to-market quintiles and a two-way, two-by-three sort on size and book-to-market to obtain

six portfolios following Fama and French (1993).

       Our timing in portfolio construction differs slightly from that commonly used in the lit-

erature. Instead of in June, we form portfolios in December of each year t. We use book

equity from the fiscal year ending in calendar year t−1 divided by market equity at the end

of December of year t. This method avoids any look-ahead bias that might arise because

accounting information from the current fiscal year is often not available at the end of the
   1
    Specifically, before the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, there was essentially no regulation to ensure
the flow of accurate and systematic accounting information. The act prescribes specific annual and periodic
reporting and record keeping requirements for publicly traded companies.

                                                    7
calendar year. Portfolio ranking is effective from January of year t+1 to December of year

t+1. We choose this portfolio timing to facilitate the interpretation of our test results be-

cause this timing is better in line with the timing of dividend growth which goes from the

beginning to the end of the calendar year. Our different timing convention is not a source

of concern, however. Using more lagged information on book value makes it harder for us to

find an ex ante value premium. Moreover, using the more conventional timing as in Fama

and French (1993) yields quantitatively similar results (not reported).

   Our definition of book equity follows that of Cohen, Polk, and Vuolteenaho (2003). In

particular, book equity is defined as the stockholder equity plus balance sheet deferred taxes

(item 74) and investment tax credit (item 208 if available) plus post-retirement benefit

liabilities (item 330 if available) minus the book value of preferred stock. Depending on data

availability, we use redemption (item 56), liquidation (item 10), or par value (item 130),

in this order, to represent the book value of preferred stock. Stockholders’ equity is equal

to Moody’s book equity (whenever available) or the book value of common equity (item

60) plus the par value of preferred stock. If neither is available, the stockholder equity is

calculated as the book value of assets (item 6) minus total liabilities (item 181).

Estimation

There are three basic steps in our estimation procedure.

   First, for each portfolio, we construct the real dividend-to-price ratio from the time series

of value-weighted realized stock returns with and without dividends and the time series of

the consumer price index from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as follows:

                                                          
                              Dt+1           X
                                                  CPIt
                                   = Rt+1 − Rt+1                                             (4)
                               Pt                   CPIt+1


                                               8
                                                                     X
where Rt+1 is the nominal return with dividends from time t to t+1, Rt+1 is the nominal

return without dividends over the same period, and CPIt is the level of the consumer price

index. And we calculate the real dividend growth as:

                                                           
                                   Dt+1 /Pt  X
                                                    CPIt−1
                          gt+1   =          Rt + 1            −1                           (5)
                                   Dt /Pt−1           CPIt

The resulting real dividend growth rates are quite volatile even at the portfolio level. To

control for the effects of the outliers, we replace any annual observations of dividend growth

higher than 50% with 50% and those lower than −50% with −50%.

   Second, we construct the long-run dividend growth rate, Agt+1 , given by equation (3),

for each portfolio. Following Blanchard (1993), we estimate r̄ as the sample average of the

realized real equity returns, and ḡ as the sample average of the real dividend growth rates.

Agt+1 is an infinite sum of future real dividend growth rates. In practice we use a finite sum

of 100 years of future growth. We assume that the future real dividend growth rates beyond

2002 equal the average dividend growth rate during the 1980–2002 period. We also use the

full-sample average and find the results to be quite stable (not reported). The focus on the

1980–2002 period intends to pick up the more recent trend of dividend growth.

   Third, we regress Agt+1 and Dt+1 /Pt on a set of conditioning variables. The fitted values

from these regressions provide the two components of the expected returns, and the sum of

these components gives the time series of expected portfolio returns. The set of conditioning

variables includes four aggregate variables and one portfolio-specific variable. Our choice

of the four aggregate conditioning variables is standard from the time series predictability

literature. These variables include: the aggregate dividend yield, computed as the sum

of dividend payments accruing to the CRSP value-weighted portfolio over the previous 12



                                              9
months, divided by the contemporaneous level of the index (e.g., Fama and French 1988);

the default premium, defined as the yield spread between Moody’s Baa and Aaa corporate

bonds from the monthly database of the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis (e.g., Keim and

Stambaugh 1986; Fama and French 1989); the term premium, defined as the yield spread

between a long-term and a one-year Treasury bond from Ibbotson Associates (e.g., Campbell

1987; Fama and French 1989); and the one-month Treasury bill rate from CRSP (e.g., Fama

and Schwert 1977; Fama 1981).

    Previous studies find that the log book-to-market spread, defined as the log book-to-

market of portfolio ten minus the log book-to-market of portfolio one from ten deciles sorted

on book-to-market, can predict future value-minus-growth returns (e.g., Asness, Friedman,

Krail, and Liew 2000; Cohen, Polk, and Vuolteenaho 2003). We therefore also use the log

book-to-market spread to predict the long-run dividend growth rates and the dividend-to-

price ratios of book-to-market portfolios. We obtain data on the returns and the year-end

book-to-market ratios of all book-to-market deciles from Kenneth French’s web site. From

January to December of year t, the book-to-market of a portfolio is calculated by dividing

its book-to-market ratio at the end of December of year t−1, where book value and market

value are both measured at the end of December, by its compounded gross return from the

end of December of year t−1 to the current month of year t.


3     Descriptive Analysis

Our method is basically a dynamic version of the method used by Fama and French (2002)

to compute the equity premium. Before we examine our results on the value premium, it is

interesting to compare the properties of the equity premium constructed in our sample to

those constructed by Fama and French.

                                             10
3.1    The Equity Premium

Our estimates on the equity premium are close to those from Fama and French (2002).

During the 1951–2000 period studied by Fama and French, our estimates of the expected

long-run real dividend growth rate, the expected real dividend yield, the expected real eq-

uity market return, and the average realized real market return are 0.84%, 4.07%, 4.91%,

and 10.21%, respectively. These values are fairly close to their counterparts, 1.05%, 3.70%,

4.75%, and 9.62%, respectively, reported by Fama and French. The differences are likely a

result of our different sample construction. Consistent with Fama and French, the equity

premium that we estimate is much lower than the average realized real equity return. The

expected equity premium from 1941 to 2002 is 4.25% per annum, which is only about 55%

of the realized real equity premium, 7.76% per annum, for the same sample period.

   More important, our estimates show that the equity premium has declined over time,

again consistent with Fama and French (2002). Figure 1 shows that the equity premium

reaches its peak of about 10% in the early 1950s, declines over the next two decades to about

2.5% in the mid 1970s, climbs up to about 5% in the mid 1980s, then declines over the next

one and half decades to about 1% in the early 2000s. Using the equity premium in a time-

trend regression yields a negative slope of −0.077% per annum (t-statistic −8.46) in the 1941–

2002 sample. The slope is only an insignificant −0.021% (t-statistic −1.65) in the post-1963

sample, but it increases in magnitude to −0.142% (t-statistic −7.73) in the sample after 1980.


3.2    The Value Premium

Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for returns, dividend growth rates, dividend yields, both

realized and expected, for value and growth portfolios. We report the results for the full sam-

ple from 1941 to 2002 and the subsample from 1963 to 2002. When we use the one-way sort

                                              11
on book-to-market, we denote the resulting five portfolios as Low, 2, 3, 4, and High. Port-

folios Low and High represent the two extremes. The difference between the returns of High

and Low, denoted p5-1, represents the value-minus-growth strategy for the one-way sort.

We denote the six portfolios from the two-way sort on size and book-to-market as S/L, B/L,

S/M, B/M, S/H, and B/H. For example, portfolio S/L contains stocks with the bottom 30%

book-to-market ratios and the bottom 50% market capitalizations. The value-minus-growth

strategy for the two-way sort, denoted HML, is defined as (S/H + B/H)/2 − (S/L + B/L)/2.

Average Returns

The first two rows of all panels in Table 1 show that value-minus-growth strategies are

profitable in our samples. The average realized return of portfolio p5-1 is 5.8% per year

(t-statistic 2.72) in the full sample, and 4.6% per year (t-statistic 1.94) in the subsample.

Similarly, the average realized annual return of HML is 6% in the full sample and 5.9% in

the subsample, and the t-statistics are 4.02 and 3.62, respectively.

Dividend Growth Rates

Rows three and four in all panels of Table 1 show that the realized real dividend growth rate

of value portfolios is on average higher than that of growth portfolios, albeit the difference

is mostly insignificant. For example, the real dividend growth rate, gt+1 , of portfolio p5-1 is

on average 4.5% per annum in the full sample. Controlling for size increases the growth rate

further to 5.6% for HML. And from the middle two rows of all panels, the expected long-run

real dividend growth, Et [Agt+1 ], follows largely the same pattern. Except for p5-1 in the

subsample, the value portfolio has significantly higher expected long-run dividend growth

than the growth portfolio. The average expected long-run dividend growth of HML is 3.5%

per year in the full sample, and 2.8% in the subsample, and their t-statistics are 9.42 and

                                              12
14.22, respectively, even after we control for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelations.

   More important, our evidence does not contradict the conventional wisdom that growth

stocks have higher proportions of growth opportunities and grow faster than value stocks.

The reason is that our evidence is obtained from portfolios rebalanced annually, while the

conventional wisdom is based on portfolios with fixed sets of firms without rebalancing.

   To illustrate this point, we study the event-time evolution of profitability (defined as

earnings divided by lagged book equity), the rate of dividend payment (defined as dividends

divided by lagged book equity), and the real dividend growth rate for value and growth

stocks for 21 years around the portfolio formation year. Our test design follows closely that

of Fama and French (1995). We define value and growth portfolios both from book-to-market

quintiles and from six size and book-to-market portfolios. As in any event studies, the stocks

in the value and growth portfolios are held constant throughout the event years.

   Our sample goes from 1941 to 2002. As explained in Section 2.2, we back out data

on dividends from value-weighted portfolio returns with and without dividends. Because

earnings data are not available in the pre-COMPUSTAT years, we follow Cohen, Polk, and

Vuolteenaho (2003) and use the clean-surplus relation to compute earnings from data on

book equity and dividends, i.e., earnings(t) =book value(t)−book value(t−1)+dividends(t).

To be consistent, we use this method to compute earnings throughout our sample.

   Figure 2 reports the results. First, Panels A and D confirm the main result in Fama and

French (1995) that growth firms are persistently more profitable than value firms. Panels B

and E show that growth firms also have higher rates of dividends than value firms. The spread

in dividend rates appears even more persistent than the spread in profitability, especially for

the two-way sort. This pattern is perhaps not surprising because firms are likely to be more


                                              13
flexible in adjusting earnings through discretionary accruals than in adjusting dividends.

   More important, Panels C and F of Figure 2 show that the real dividend growth rates of

growth stocks are higher than the real dividend growth rates of value stocks. For the one-

way sort, the spread is about 10% at the portfolio formation year, and remains positive for

almost ten years afterwards. For the two-way sort, the spread in dividend growth between the

small-growth portfolio, S/L, and the small-value portfolio, S/H, is about 15% at the portfolio

formation year, but the spread is much more short-lived and converges in about three years.

   However, when the portfolios are rebalanced annually, the firms in the growth portfolio

next year are not the same as the firms in the growth portfolio this year. And there is no

particular reason to expect the dividend growth of growth portfolios to be higher than the

dividend growth of value portfolios because growth rates are measured using different sets of

firms. Consistent with this observation, Figure 3 plots the time series of the annual realized

real dividend growth rates for portfolios five and one in the book-to-market quintiles (Panel

A), portfolio five-minus-one (Panel B), portfolios High and Low from the six portfolios sorted

on size and book-to-market (Panel C), and HML (Panel D). From Panels B and D, the real

dividend growth rates of growth portfolios are frequently lower than those of value portfolios.

Estimates for Expected Returns

The expected value premium is reliably positive in our sample. From the seventh and eighth

rows in all panels of Table 1, the average expected dividend-to-price ratio, Et [Dt+1 /Pt ], is

higher for value firms than for growth firms. Because the expected long-run dividend growth

rate and the expected dividend-to-price ratio are both higher for value firms, their expected

returns are higher than the expected returns of growth firms. The last two rows of Panels

A and B show that the expected return of p5-1 is 3.7% per year (t-statistic 7.74) in the full


                                              14
sample, and 2.8% (t-statistic 7.74) in the subsample. Similarly, from the last two rows of

Panels C and D, the expected HML return is 5.1% (t-statistic 27.80) in the full sample, and

5.1% (t-statistic 20.76) in the subsample.

   From Table 1, the expected return for each portfolio in the one-way and two-way sorts is

substantially lower than the average realized return of the portfolio. Previous studies have

documented similar results for the market excess return. For example, Fama and French

(2002) report that for the sample period 1951–2002 the expected equity premium is 4.32%

per year, while the average realized equity premium is 7.43% per year. Fama and French

conclude that average stock returns are a lot higher than expected. Our evidence suggests

that this result also holds in the cross section of portfolios sorted by size and book-to-market.

However, the expected value premium within each sorting procedure is not far away from

the average realized return, suggesting that the difference between the expected return and

the average realized return is similar in magnitude across value and growth portfolios.

   Figure 4 plots the sample paths of the expected p5-1 return, the expected HML return,

as well as their respective expected long-run dividend growth rates and expected dividend-

to-price ratios. Panels A and C show that the expected p5-1 and HML returns are positive

throughout the sample. Both series of expected returns display positive spikes during most

of the recessions in the sample. The expected returns also covary positively with the default

premium, a well-known countercyclical variable (e.g., Jagannathan and Wang 1996). This

evidence suggests that the expected value premium is countercyclical.

   From Panels B and D of Figure 4, there has been a noticeable decline in the expected

long-run dividend growth from the early 1940s to the early 1980s, but an increase thereafter.

The expected dividend-to-price ratios display the opposite long-term movements. Accord-


                                               15
ingly, there is no obvious trend in the expected value premium, although the expected p5-1

return appears to decline slightly over time.

Predictive Regressions

We now report the predictive regressions used to construct the expected dividend growth and

the expected dividend-to-price ratio, the two components of the expected value premium.

Specifically, we regress the long-run dividend growth, Agt+1 , and the dividend-to-price

ratio, Dt+1 /Pt , on conditioning variables including the aggregate dividend yield, the default

premium, the term premium, the log book-to-market spread, and the one-month T-bill rate.

We also regress the value premium defined as the sum of Agt+1 and Dt+1 /Pt on the same set

of conditioning variables. To adjust for the small-sample bias in the slopes and their standard

errors (e.g., Stambaugh 1999), we use the simulation method of Nelson and Kim (1993).

   These regressions are of independent interest. Previous studies (e.g., Asness, Friedman,

Krail, and Liew 2000; Cohen, Polk, and Vuolteenaho 2003) document that the realized value

premium is predictable using the log book-to-market spread, suggesting that the expected

value premium is time-varying. Our analysis provides additional insights into this issue.

   Table 2 reports the results. The first three rows of all panels show that the value premium

is indeed predictable. The adjusted R2 clusters around 30% except for the HML return in the

1941–2002 sample that has an adjusted R2 of 15.60%. Although not reported in the table, the

null hypothesis that all the slopes are jointly zero is strongly rejected in all cases. The results

suggest that the aggregate dividend yield has reliable predictive power with positive slopes,

except for the HML return in the period from 1941 to 2002. Further, the term premium has

significant predictive ability for the expected value premium with negative slopes in all cases

and across both sample periods. Panel B shows that, consistent with previous studies, we


                                                16
find that the log book-to-market spread is largely a positive predictor of the value premium,

except for predicting the p5-1 return in the post-1963 sample. However, our results also show

that its predictive power is relatively weak because all corresponding p-values are close to

0.20. The default premium and the short-term rate do not have significant predictive ability

for the expected value premium in the presence of the other conditioning variables.

    The rest of Table 2 reports the results of predicting the two separate components of

the value premium including the dividend growth rate and dividend-to-price ratio. These

conditioning variables do an overall better job in predicting the separate components than

the value premium itself. This is reflected in much higher adjusted R2 s; in some cases the

goodness-of-fit coefficients are more than doubled.

    We also study the robustness of our benchmark results with respect to alternative sets

of instruments. We first exclude the log book-to-market spread from the list of conditioning

variables. Alternatively, we include the cay and cdy variables from Lettau and Ludvigson

(2001a, 2005) in the set of conditioning variables used to predict the dividend growth rates

and the dividend-to-price ratios. In general, our results are largely unchanged. Details are

not reported for brevity but are available upon request.


4     Dynamics of the Expected Value Premium
4.1    Trend Dynamics

There is some evidence for a downward trend in the low-frequency movements of the expected

value premium, but the evidence is somewhat mixed. We use two methods to isolate the

cyclical component of the expected value premium from the low-frequency, trend component.




                                             17
The first method is to regress the expected value premium on a time trend:


                               Value Premiumt = a + b t + εt ,                              (6)


where the fitted component including the intercept is defined as the trend component and

the residual is defined as the cyclical component. The second method is to pass the expected

value premium through the Hodrick-Prescott (1997) (HP) filter that separates the trend and

the cyclical components of the premium.

   The time-trend regressions suggest that the expected p5-1 return exhibits a downward

trend in the 1941–2002 and the 1963–2002 samples, but the expected HML return does not.

The expected HML return exhibits a slight downward trend in the 1980–2002 sample, but the

expected p5-1 return does not. Specifically, the slope coefficient, b, is −0.078% per annum for

the expected p5-1 return (t-statistic −8.01) in the 1941–2002 sample, −0.052% (t-statistic

−2.83) in the post-1963 sample, and −0.091% (t-statistic −1.86) in the 1980–2002 sample.

The slope is −0.010% (t-statistic −1.47) for the expected HML return in 1941–2002, −0.011%

(t-statistic −0.76) in 1963–2002, and −0.097% (t-statistic −3.12) in the 1980–2002 sample.

   Panels A and B in Figure 5 plot the trend components of the expected p5-1 return and

the expected HML return estimated from trend regressions and the HP-filter, respectively.

Panel A shows a downward trend for p5-1 and but no clear trend for HML. Panel B shows

a downward movement in the HP-filtered trend components for both p5-1 and HML.


4.2    Cyclical Dynamics

The expected value premium is countercyclical. We use two additional methods to study

the cyclical properties of the expected value premium. As an informal test, we first report

the lead-lag cross-correlation structure of the expected value premium with a list of cyclical

                                              18
indicators. We then supplement the cross-correlations with a more formal VAR analysis.

Cross Correlations

Table 3 reports the cross-correlations. The list of cyclical indicators includes the default pre-

mium, the NBER recession dummy, the real investment growth rate, and the real consump-

tion growth rate. Among the four variables, the default premium and the recession dummy

are countercyclical, while the real investment and consumption growth rates are procyclical.

   From the middle column in Panel A of Table 3, the contemporaneous correlation between

the expected p5-1 return and the default premium is 0.49 and that between the expected p5-

1 return and the recession dummy is 0.50. Both are significant at the 1% level. Further, the

contemporaneous correlation between the expected p5-1 return and real investment growth

is −0.36 and that between the expected p5-1 return and real consumption growth is −0.32.

The middle column in Panel B shows that using the expected HML return yields similar

results. This evidence suggests that the expected value premium is countercyclical.

   Panels C and D of Figure 5 plot the cyclical components of the expected p5-1 and HML

return along with the NBER recession dummy. Panel C is based on the residuals from the

time-trend regression, and Panel D is based on the HP filter. The expected p5-1 and HML

returns peak in most recessions, suggesting that the premiums are countercyclical.

VAR Analysis

We next supplement the lead-lag correlations with a more formal VAR analysis. The VAR

contains one measure of the expected value premium (either the expected p5-1 or the HML

return) and one cyclical indicator. We use two cyclical variables separately in the VAR, the

investment growth and the real consumption growth. Using other cyclical variables yields


                                               19
largely similar results (not reported). The lag in the VAR is one, which is chosen according

to the Akaike information criterion. In some specifications, we also include the one-month

T-bill rate in the VAR to isolate real business cycle shocks from monetary policy shocks.

   Table 4 reports the results. Panel A shows that the coefficients of real investment growth

in the VAR are negative and mostly significant. This result holds with and without control-

ling for the T-bill rate. Panel B shows that the coefficients of real consumption growth rate

are all negative; they are all significant for both the long and the short sample periods. These

results suggest that the expected value premium responds negatively to aggregate shocks.

   To interpret the economic magnitudes of the VAR slopes, we study the impulse response

functions from the estimated VARs. Panels A to D in Figure 6 plot the responses of the ex-

pected value premium to a positive one-standard-deviation shock to real investment growth,

and Panels E to H report the responses to a positive shock to real consumption growth. From

Panels C and D, a positive one-standard-deviation shock to the real investment growth re-

duces the expected HML return by 0.30% per annum without controlling for the T-bill rate

and by about 0.26% with the T-bill rate. From Panels G and H, a positive one-standard-

deviation shock to the real consumption growth reduces the expected HML return by 0.45%

and 0.50% per annum with and without controlling for the T-bill rate, respectively. Using

the expected p5-1 return yields similar results, although the magnitudes are somewhat lower.

   Our evidence on the countercyclical expected value premium lends support to the argu-

ment that value stocks are riskier than growth stocks in bad times when the price of risk is

high (e.g., Jagannathan and Wang 1996, Lettau and Ludvigson 2001b, Ang and Chen 2005;

Petkova and Zhang 2005). Zhang (2005) provides a theoretical underpinning for this argu-

ment. See also Lewellen and Nagel (2006) who, using short-window market regressions, find


                                              20
little evidence that value-minus-growth betas covary positively with the expected market

risk premium in the context of the conditional CAPM.


5     Incorporating Stock Repurchases

In this section, we redo all our tests after adding net stock repurchases as a part of total pay-

out along with dividends. We find that incorporating stock repurchases increases the magni-

tudes of the value premium; intuitively, value firms repurchase more shares than growth firms.

The expected value premium continues to be countercyclical. And incorporating stock re-

purchases further weakens the evidence on a downward trend in the expected value premium.

    Incorporating stock repurchases is important. Fama and French (2001) document that

the proportion of firms paying cash dividends falls from 66.5% in 1978 to 20.8% in 1999.

Moreover, firms have become less likely to pay dividends regardless of their characteristics.

Grullon and Michaely (2002) also show that stock repurchases have become the dominant

form of payout in recent years. Because of the importance of repurchases in total payout, it

is necessary to evaluate its quantitative role in our measurement of the value premium.

    To measure net stock repurchase, we follow Stephens and Weisbach (1998) in using the

monthly decreases in shares outstanding as reported by CRSP adjusted for non-repurchasing

activity affecting shares outstanding such as stock splits and dividend reinvestment plans.

We also adjust for new stock issues following Jagannathan, Stephens, and Weisbach (2000).

Let St denote the number of shares outstanding at month t and Pt denote the stock price.

If St−1 > St , we define repurchase return as the decrease in value of shares outstanding from

month t−1 to t as a proportion of the market value of equity at month t−1. Formally:

                                           (St−1 − St )Pt−1
                Repurchase returnt−1,t =                        if    St−1 > St              (7)
                                              St−1 Pt−1

                                               21
We then add repurchase returns and stock returns with dividends together as stock returns

with total payout. Finally, as in the benchmark estimation, we aggregate monthly returns

into annual returns to avoid seasonality. And we back out payout growth rates from the

difference between stock returns with total payout and rates of capital gain.

   Table 5 reports the descriptive statistics for stock returns, dividend growth rates, and

dividend-to-price ratios, both realized and expected, for value and growth portfolios. The

value-minus-growth strategies are even more profitable after including stock repurchases. For

example, the average realized return of portfolio p5-1 is 6.4% per annum in the full sample

and 5.7% in the subsample, which are higher than 5.8% in the full sample and 4.6% in the

subsample, respectively, in the benchmark case without repurchases. The realized returns

of HML follow the same pattern. Including repurchases also increases the expected value

premium. Specifically, the expected p5-1 return is on average 4.5% per annum in the full

sample, higher than 3.7% in the benchmark case. The expected HML return goes up from

5.1% without repurchases to 5.5% with repurchases in the full sample. The results from the

post-1963 sample are quantitatively similar. Finally, comparing Tables 1 and 5 reveals that

the increase in the expected value premium from including repurchases is mostly derived

from the expected-payout-to-price component. In particular, the expected-payout-growth

component of the expected value premium is largely similar in magnitude to the expected-

dividend-growth component in the benchmark estimation.

   Panels A and B of Figure 7 plot the trend components of the expected p5-1 and HML

returns after including stock repurchases. Based on time-trend regressions, Panel A shows

a slight downward trend for p5-1, but a slight upward trend for the expected HML return.

And from Panel B, there is no noticeable downward or upward trend in the HP-filtered, low-



                                             22
frequency component of the expected HML return. The expected p5-1 return shows some

dramatic decline in earlier periods, but remains relatively stable after the mid-1950s. Overall,

a comparison between Figures 5 and 7 shows that the evidence suggesting a downward trend

in the value premium is further weakened after including stock repurchases.

    Turning to the cyclical properties of the value premium, Panels C and D of Figure 7 show

that the countercyclicality of the value premium persists after we include stock repurchases.

This informal evidence is further supplemented by Table 6 that reports the VAR results for

the expected value premium with stock repurchases. From Panel A of the table, the slopes

of real investment growth in the VARs are all negative and significant with and without

controlling for the T-bill rates. And the magnitudes of the VAR coefficients are quantitatively

very similar to those in the benchmark case reported in Table 4. Using real consumption

growth yields largely similar results, as shown in Panel B. This evidence suggests that the

expected value premium continues to respond negatively to aggregate shocks.

    Finally, the impulse response functions reported in Figure 8 implied by the VAR analysis

are again quantitatively similar to those reported in Figure 6 for the benchmark estimation.

In all cases, the expected value premiums respond negatively to good news about real

investment and consumption growth rates.


6     Summary and Interpretation

Fama and French (2002) estimate the equity premium using dividend growth rates to measure

the expected rates of capital gain. We use similar methods to estimate ex-ante measures of

the value premium from cash flow fundamentals.

    We report three main findings. First, the value premium is reliably positive ex-ante.


                                              23
From 1941 to 2002, the expected HML return is on average 5.10% per annum, consist-

ing of an expected-dividend-growth component of 3.5% and an expected dividend-to-price

component of 1.6%. Second, the expected value premium is countercyclical—a positive, one-

standard-deviation shock to real consumption growth rate lowers the expected HML return

by 0.45–0.50% per annum. Third, unlike the equity premium, there is only weak evidence

suggesting that the value premium has declined over time. These basic findings are robust

to a variety of perturbations in test design such as including stock repurchases into the cal-

culations of cash flows, using alternative instrumental variables to estimate expected growth

rates and expected dividend-to-price ratios, and using alternative portfolio constructions.

   Our evidence contributes to our understanding of the driving forces behind the value

premium. Three competing explanations coexist in the current literature. The first story

says that the value premium results from rational variations of expected returns (e.g., Fama

and French 1993, 1996; Lettau and Ludvigson 2001b). The second story argues that in-

vestor sentiment causes the high premium for value stocks (e.g., De Bondt and Thaler 1985;

Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny 1994; Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam 1998). The

third story argues that the value premium results spuriously from sample-selection bias (e.g.,

Kothari, Shanken, and Sloan 1995; Schwert 2003) and data-snooping bias (e.g. MacKinlay

1995; Conrad, Cooper, and Kaul 2003).

   We show that more than one half of the value premium is expected to come from the

expected-dividend-growth component. This evidence lends direct support to Davis, Fama,

and French (2000), who argue that the value premium is real and is unlikely to be driven

purely by statistical biases. This interpretation is further buttressed by our large-sample

evidence that there is no noticeable downward trend in the value premium. While largely



                                             24
consistent with the evidence in Schwert (2003), our evidence suggests that the reversion in

profitability of value strategies in the 1990s is more likely to reflect the countercyclicality of

the expected value premium rather than a more permanent downward trend.

   In addition, our evidence that the expected-dividend-growth component is higher in

magnitude than the expected-dividend-to-price component in the composition of the value

premium suggests that cash flow fundamentals, rather than mean-reverting valuation ratios,

are more important driving forces behind the value premium. This evidence casts doubt on

the overreaction story of De Bondt and Thaler (1985) and Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny

(1994) because this story works primarily through mispricing in valuation ratios and its slow

correction in the long run, rather than cash flow fundamentals.

   Finally, our evidence that the expected value premium is countercyclical lends support to

the argument that value is riskier than growth in bad times when the price of risk is high (e.g.,

Jagannathan and Wang 1996; Lettau and Ludvigson 2001b; Ang and Chen 2005; Petkova and

Zhang 2005; Zhang 2005). However, the magnitude of the negative response of the expected

HML return to a positive, one-standard-deviation shock to real consumption growth rate

is only about 0.50% per annum, which is less than one-tenth of the total magnitude of the

value premium. This evidence lends support to the argument in Lewellen and Nagel (2006)

that the role of conditioning information in driving the value premium is limited and that

unconditional drivers are potentially more important (e.g., Fama and French 1993, 1996).

        Table 1 : Descriptive Statistics for Realized Returns, Realized Dividend Growth, Expected Long-run Dividend
          Growth, Expected Dividend Yield, and Expected Returns of Value and Growth Portfolios (1941 to 2002)

     This table reports the sample averages of the realized return, Rt+1 , the realized dividend growth, gt+1 , the expected long-run dividend growth,
     Et [Agt+1 ], the expected dividend yield, Et [Dt+1 /Pt ], and the expected return, Et [Rt+1 ] for various value and growth portfolios. The corresponding
     t-statistics adjusted for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelations of up to six lags are reported in the rows below the sample averages. The results for
     both the full sample from 1941 to 2002 and for the subsample from 1963 to 2002 are reported. Panels A and B contain the results for five quintiles
     sorted on book-to-market, while Panels C and D contain the results for six portfolios based on a two-by-three sort on size and book-to-market. In
     Panels A and B, p5-1 denotes the difference between portfolio High and portfolio Low in the five book-to-market quintiles. In Panels C and D,
     portfolios are denoted by two letters, for example, portfolio S/L contains stocks with the bottom 30% book-to-market ratios and the bottom 50%
     market capitalization.

                                        Growth Rate and the Dividend-to-Price Ratio
     This table reports predictive regressions for the value premium, Agt+1 + Dt+1 /Pt , and its two components—the long-run dividend growth rate,
     Agt+1 and the dividend-to-price ratio, Dt+1 /Pt . We report results for both portfolio p5-1 from the one-way sort on book-to-market and HML from
     the two-way sort on size and book-to-market. We use five regressors, (i) dividend yield, div, computed as the sum of dividends accruing to the
     CRSP value-weighted portfolio over the previous 12 months divided by the current index level; (ii) default premium, def, which is the yield spread
     between Baa and Aaa corporate bonds; (iii) term premium, term, computed as the yield spread between ten-year and one-year government bonds;
     (iv) log book-to-market spread, ls, defined as the log book-to-market of decile ten minus that of decile one from ten book-to-market portfolios; and
     (v) one-month Treasury bill, rf. To facilitate comparison of coefficients, all regressors are standardized to have zero mean and unit variance. We
     report intercepts, slopes, bias in slopes, adjusted R2 s, and p-values adjusted for small-sample problems using the Nelson and Kim (1993) method.

     This table reports the results from a first-order VAR that includes the expected value premium and one of two cyclical indicators including real
     investment growth, gINV , and real consumption growth, gCON . The table reports the equation for the expected value premium for the 1941–2002
     and 1963–2002 samples. We also report the results with and without controlling for monetary policy as captured by the one-month T-bill rate.
     The lag in the VAR is one, which is chosen based on the Akaike information criterion. p-values associated with Newey-West t-statistics adjusted
     for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation of up to six lags are reported in the rows below the coefficients.

     payout includes dividends and net stock repurchases. The corresponding t-statistics adjusted for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelations of up to
     six lags are reported in the rows below the sample averages. The results for both the full sample from 1941 to 2002 and for the subsample from 1963
     to 2002 are reported. Panels A and B contain the results for five quintiles sorted on book-to-market, while Panels C and D contain the results for
     six portfolios based on a two-by-three sort on size and book-to-market. In Panels A and B, p5-1 denotes the difference between portfolio High and
     portfolio Low in the five book-to-market quintiles. In Panels C and D, portfolios are denoted by two letters, for example, portfolio S/L contains
     stocks with the bottom 30% book-to-market ratios and the bottom 50% market capitalization.

                                      Table 6 : Including Repurchases: VAR Analysis (1941 to 2002)

     This table reports the results from a first-order VAR that includes the expected value premium and one of two cyclical indicators including real
     investment growth, gINV , and real consumption growth, gCON . The computation of payout includes dividends and net stock repurchases. The
     table reports the equation for the expected value premium for the 1941–2002 and 1963–2002 samples. We also report the results with and without
     controlling for monetary policy as captured by the one-month T-bill rate. The lag in the VAR is one, which is chosen based on the Akaike
     information criterion. p-values associated with Newey-West t-statistics adjusted for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation of up to six lags are
     reported in the rows below the coefficients.

                                       for Value and Growth Portfolios (1941–2002)

     This figure plots the event time evolution of dividend growth rates and the ratios of dividend and lagged book equity for value and growth portfolios.
     We construct value and growth portfolios using a one-way sort on book-to-market into five quintiles and using a two-by-three sort on size and
     book-to-market into six portfolios as Fama and French (1993). Panel A plots profitability defined as earnings divided by lagged book value, E t+1 /Bt ,
     for portfolios five (value) and one (growth) from the quintiles, and Panel D does the same for four portfolios including small-high (S/H), big-high
     (B/H), small-low (S/L), and big-low (B/L) from the six portfolios sorted on size and book-to-market. Panel plots the dividend-lagged book equity,
     Dt+1 /Bt , for portfolios five and one from the quintiles, and Panel E does the same for S/H, B/H, S/L, and B/L. Panel C plots the real dividend
     growth rates, gt+1 , for portfolios five and one from the quintiles, and Panel F does the same for S/H, B/H, S/L, and B/L.

    Figure 3 : Times Series of the Annual Realized Real Dividend Growth Rates of
                      Value and Growth Portfolios (1941–2002)

This figure plots the sample paths of the annual realized real dividend growth rates of value and growth
portfolios. We construct value and growth portfolios using a one-way sort on book-to-market (into five
quintiles) and using a two-by-three sort on size and book-to-market (into six portfolios). Panel A plots the
annual real dividend growth rates for portfolios five and one from the quintiles, and Panel B plots that for
portfolio five-minus-one, p5-1. Panel C plots the annual real dividend growth rates for portfolios High and
Low defined from the six portfolios after controlling for size as in Fama and French (1993). Panel D does the
same for HML. In Panels A and C, the solid lines represent the value portfolios, and the broken lines represent
                                                                          Dt+1 /Pt
the growth portfolios. The real dividend growth is measured as gt+1 = D     t /Pt−1
                                                                                    (RtX + 1)(CPIt−1 /CPIt ) − 1,
where RtX is the nominal value-weighted portfolio return without dividend from year t−1 to t, and CPI t is the
                                                                                             X
consumer price index at year t. The dividend yield is constructed as Dt+1 /Pt = (Rt+1 −Rt+1    )(CPIt /CPIt+1 ),
where Rt+1 is the nominal value-weighted portfolio return with dividend from year t to t+1.

                          Dividend-to-Price Ratio (1941–2002)

This figure plots the times series of the expected value premium, Et [Rt+1 ], and its two components–the
expected long-run dividend growth, Et [Agt+1 ], and the expected dividend-price ratio, Et [Dt+1 /Pt ]. Panel
A plots the expected return of portfolio five-minus-one, p5-1, and Panel B plots its two components–the
expected long-run dividend growth and the expected dividend-price ratio. Panel C plots the expected HML
return, and Panel D plots its two components–the expected long-run dividend growth and the expected
dividend-price ratio. In Panels A and C, we also plot the scaled default spread defined as the Baa yield over
the Aaa yield scaled by two. In all panels, the shadowed rectangles represent the NBER recession dummy,
which takes the value of one in recessions and zero otherwise.

                                         (1941–2002)

This figure reports trend and cyclical components of the expected value premium including both that from
a one-way sort on book-to-market (broken line) and that from a two-way sort on size and book-to-market
(solid line). Panel A reports the time trend and Panel B reports the trend components from a Hodrick
and Prescott (HP) filter. Panel C reports the cyclical component after the time trend is removed from the
expected value premium, and Panel D reports the cyclical component from the HP-filter. In all panels, the
shadowed rectangles represent the NBER recession dummy, which takes the value of one in recessions and
zero otherwise.

     Figure 6 : Impulse Response Functions for the Expected Value Premium After A One-Standard-Deviation Positive
                           Shock to Real Investment Growth or the Real Consumption Growth

     This figure plots the impulse response functions for the expected return of p5-1 and the expected HML return in the presence of a one-standard-
     deviation positive shock to real investment growth, gINV (Panels A–D), and to real consumption growth, gCON (Panels E–H). We report the results
     with and without controlling for the one-month T-bill rate in the VAR. In all panels, a two-standard-error band is also plotted.

Figure 7 : Including Repurchases: Trend and Cyclical Components of the Expected
                           Value Premium (1941–2002)

This figure reports trend and cyclical components of the expected value premium including both that from
a one-way sort on book-to-market (broken line) and that from a two-way sort on size and book-to-market
(solid line). The computation of payout includes dividends and net stock repurchases. Panel A reports the
time trend and Panel B reports the trend components from a Hodrick and Prescott (HP) filter. Panel C
reports the cyclical component after the time trend is removed from the expected value premium, and Panel
D reports the cyclical component from the HP-filter. In all panels, the shadowed rectangles represent the
NBER recession dummy, which takes the value of one in recessions and zero otherwise.

                          One-Standard-Deviation Positive Shock to Real Investment Growth and Real Consumption Growth

     This figure plots the impulse response functions for the expected return of p5-1 and the expected HML return in the presence of a one-standard-
     deviation positive shock to real investment growth, gINV (Panels A–D), and to real consumption growth, gCON (Panels E–H). The computation of
     payout includes dividends and net stock repurchases. We report the results with and without controlling for the one-month T-bill rate in the VAR.
     In all panels, a two-standard-error band is also plotted.
