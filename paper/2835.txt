Techniques   of regulated Brownian motion are used to analyze the behavior of

the exchange rate when official policy reaction functions are subject to

future stochastic changes.    We examine exchange-rate dynamics in alternative

cases where the authorities promise (i) to confine a floating rate within a

predetermined range and (ii) to peg the currency once it reaches a predeter-

mined future level.   Similarities between these and several related examples

of regime switching are   stressed.

1. Introduction

    The typical forward-looking variable in an economist's model is driven by an exogenous forcing

process whose form is fixed for all time. Yet in the real world, there are many examples in which
the forcing process is subject to change once a certain event occurs. When variables such as interest
rates, current accounts, inflation or exchange rates reach extreme values, authorities may not only

change their policies — they may also change their policy reaction functions.
    A number of papers examine the behavior of forward-looking variables when           an otherwise
passive policy maker intervenes to keep the variables from moving out of a predetermined range.
In this spirit, Krugman (1988a) and Miller and Weller (1988) study exchange rate target zones,

and Dixit (1988, 1987), Dumas (1988) and Krugman (1988b) study the allocation of capital. In

all these models, the authority acts in a way to keep the forward-looking variable within a desired

range or band. These papers also share a useful technical approach to these problems, that of

regulated Brownian motion, which often gives simple and intuitive answers.
    A related literature studies the effects on forward-looking variables of once-and-for-allchanges

in regime. Flood and Garber (1983), for example, study a case in which the exchange rate floats

freely until it reaches a pre-announced level,   at which time the government intervenes to keep the
exchange rate (Ixed thereafter. Because rational investors anticipate   the transition to the peg, the
level and dynamics of the rate will be different than under a permanent float. Flood and Garber
(1983) apply a first-stopping-time methodology to this regicoe-switcliingproblem. Unfortunately,

they are uoable to derive a closed-form solution using that noatheinatically cumbersome approach.
    In this  paperwe apply techniques of regulated lirowniao motion to (i) clarify the relationship

between the newer target-zone results nf Krugman (1988a) and Miller and Weller (1988), and the
                                                                              and intuitive results to
process-switchingmodel of Flood and Garber (1983); aod (ii) present simple
a number of interesting cases in stochastic process switching including the one posed (but not solved
in closed form) by Flood and Garher (1983). In section 2 below, we lay out the general exchange

rate model. Section 3 contains the solutions to several specificprocess-switching examples. Section
4 concludes.


2.   The Model
      To keep the analysis simple, we use the standardflexible-pricemonetary model of the exchange

rate.1 In this framework, the (log) spot exchange rate                 at time I, z(t),      is   the sum of a set of

macroeconomicfundamentals, k(t), plus a speculative term proportional to the expected percentage

change in the exchange rate:


                                      x(t) = k(t) + rxE(dx(t)/dt I         (t)).                                   (1)


                                                                                         demand with
 Above, the parametera can be interpreted as the semi-elasticity of domestic money
                                                                        is the time-t information set,
                                                                                (t)
 respect to the interest rate, E is the expectations operator, and
 which includes the current value of fundamentals, k(t), as wellas any explicit or implicit restrictions

 the authorities have placed on the future evolution of fundamentals. (For example, the authorities
                                                                                            certain
 may have announced that they intend to keep the exchange rate from moving outside

 limits, or that they will fix the exchange rate once it reaches a certain level. This information
 about future policies would be incorporated into (t).) Included among the fundamental factors

 that affect k(t) is a variahle measuring relative national money supplies, which are assumed to be
 controlled directly by monetary authorities. Included as well are other, exogenous determinants of

exchange rates that the authorities cannot influence.2

     The monetary authoritiesmay intervene to influence exchange rates by altering the stochastic

process governing (relative) money-supply growth. This in turn                              will alter the process driving the

fundamentals, k(t). A regime of freely floating exchange rates is said to be in effect when the

authoritiesrefrain from intervening to offset shocks to fundamentals. Under a free float, we assume

the fundamentals to evolve according to the process:


                                                   dk(t) = t7dt + cdz(t),                                                  (2)

where s is the (constant) expected change in k, dz is astandard Wiener process, and e is a constant.

Equation (2) is just the continuous-time version of a random walk with trend.3 As noted above,
the authorities can control k through intervention, so k need not follow (2) under regimes other

than a free float.

      In a rational-expectations equilibrium with no speculative bubbles, there is a unique exchange-

rate path that satisfies (1). This path has the integral representation:


             x(t) = E(&1       j      e(t_Vok(B)ds I        (t)) = a1j                   e(t—°)1°E(ic(s)   4(t))ds,

a representation valid under any policy regime or sequence of policy regimes. In words, (3) equates

the current exchange rate to the present discounted value of expected future fundamoentats(the

discountrate is 1/n). Below, the equilibriumexchange-rate value given by the present-value formula

(3) is called the exchange rate's sadd/epath value.

     Other solutions to (1) exist, of course, but these involve extraneous bubble terms, which                         are


driven by self-fulfilling expectations. In the present model, a bubble /3(t) is a random variable that

can be added to the saddlepath solution in (3) to produce a new solution. The bubble, j3(t), is

                                                            it                            of

We sssume that sucbbubblesolutions are ruled out by market forces, so that the exchange rate is

on the saddlepath defined by equation (3) in equilibrium.4

      Given (2) and the types of regime changes we will consider,                      it is reasonable to suppose that
the saddlepath solution for the exchange rate can be written as a twice continuously differentiable
function of a single variable,the currentfundamental:


                                                    z(t)    = S(k(t)).                                                  (4)


Naturally, the precise form of the function5(k) depends (as is demonstrated below) on the typesof
                                                                                  case is the one in
regime shifts (if any) that the market thinks are possible.5 A well-known special

which the authoritiesare committedto a permanent exchange-rate float, so that fundamentals are

expected to follow process (2) forever. In this case, the conditionalexpectations
                                                                                                      in (3)   are easy to

                                                                         on possible future regime
evaluate, since they depend exclusively on current fundamentals, and not

shifts:

                                                     z(t)   = S(k(t))

      If, however, the market expects the authoritiesto intervene iii the fut.urc, fundaineiitals will
not always follow (2), so the exchange rate will not follow (5), even while floating freely. In such

cases,direct computation of the sequence of conditionalexpectations in the present-value formula

(3)   that   defines S(k)    is likely to     be burdensome. We therefore follow an alternative, two-step

approach     to determine S(k) when a regime switch from (2) to some other process is possible. First,
we characterize the family of functions of form z = G(k) that satisfy the equilibrium condition

(1) so long as fundamentals evolve according to (2). Second, we find the member of this family

that satisfies boundary conditionsappropriateto the stochastic regime switch under consideration.

This last function is the saddlepath solution,S(k).

      A more detailed justification for this two-step procedure is offered in context below. The

method is, however, analogous to one commonly used for diagrammajicallyanalyzing a one-time

step change in fundamentals in deterministicasset-price models. In those models, one first observes

that before the disturbance occurs, the asset price is given by some member of the class of general
solutions to the differential equation defining asset-market equilibrium. (This general solution

corresponds to the solution G(k) mentionedin the previous paragraph.)                              Next, one pins down

the economically relevant pre-disturbance solution, which generally differsfrom the saddlepath, by

two boundary conditions: one of these forces the asset price to                    be continuous       at the moment the

disturbance occurs, and the other forces the asset price to be on the saddlepath afterward.°

      To implementstep one of the procedure outlined above — finding the general solution z                             G(k)
—   use Ito's lemma and equation (1) to express expected depreciation during the float as:7



                                       I       = E(dG(k)/dt              =   ,1G'(k)   + -G"(k),                           (6)

where we have assumed G(k) is twice continuously differentiable. Combining (1) and (6) yields a

just discussed, a single member of the family that                (8) defines will turn out to be equivalent to the

        The nonlinear part of (8) defines additional solutions to (1), all of which depend only on

current fundamentals. When the market expects the exchange rate to float freely forever, these

solutions can be viewed as bubble paths, since along them, the exchange rate differs from the

 present discounted value of expected future fundamentals,
                                                                            k + aq. The nonlinear         term in (8), like

 any other bubble, is expected to grow exponentially                 at the rate 1/a if a switch       from the free-float

 regime is a probability-seroevent. To see why, consider how the term A5eMt                             in   (8) affects the

                                                                             value of this term at
 exchange rate's behavior. Under a permanent free float, the time-t expected

 time    r>     relative to   its value at t is:

second component of (10) would remain constant at           1   forever. Under these circumstances,         it   is

easy to see that (10) would grow at rate 1/cs, the rate at which the conditionalmeans of all bubble

solutions to (1) grow. When     o >   0, however, (10) still must grow at rate 1/cs (because           )' is a
root of the quadraticequation (9)); but if a > 0, then          A1   <   1/csii. This implies that the variance

of fundamentals (through Jensen's inequality) contribute more and the deterministic growth of

fundamentals contributes less to the overall growthrate of (10). The same reasoning applies to the

second nonlinearterm in (8).

      Although the nonlinearterms in (8) can be viewed as defining bubble solutions to (1) under a

permanentfree float, we do not wantto throw themaway in solving for the saddlepath exchange rate
under   a free float that couldterminate. When   there is some type ofregime-switching, fundamentals

may   not remain permanently    a random walk, and the present-value formula (3) therefore is not

equal to the simple linear expression (5). Under the possibility of a regime switch, the exchange

rate'a saddlepath value prior to the switchwill necessarily depend on the nonlinearterm in (8). Just

which   initial conditionsA1 and A2 are appropriate      depends on the boundary conditions associated

with the regime switch, conditions to be determined in step two of the two-step solution procedure

outlined above.

      Before proceeding to this second step -in the next section, however, we introduce a diagram

that will aid in visualizing the various boundary conditions that are derived there. Figure 1 shows

the family of paths given   by (8) for the symmetric     case in which A1       = —A2, and where ii > 0. On
the horizontal axis is the value of the fundamental, Ic, and on the vertical axis is the value of the

exchange rate, x. The line labelled FF indicates the linear solution given by (5), which corresponds

to the case Aj = A2   = 0. (FF is     also the saddlepath under          a permanentfree-float   regime.   It   has

a 45-degree slope and passes through the point     Ic   = 0, z = csm.) As described above, the curvature

3. Examples

       This section carries out the second step of the solution method outlined in section 2. The dis-

cussion takes up sequentially the boundary conditions implied by several possible regime-switching

scenarios. In terms of the mathematics, all that is involved is the appropriate choice of the two

arbitrary constants in (8), A1 and A2. A key implication of the discussion is that the same unifying

principle leads to solutions for all of the problems considered.

3.1. Exchange Rate Target Zones

       Suppose the authorities want to keep the exchange rate from penetrating the upper and lower

levels, x and E. When the exchange rate reaches one of these boundaries, the authorities do to
fundamentals what is necessary to keep x from moving outside of its target zone. However, they

do not prevent a movement of z back into the interior of the zone. Exchange-rate behavior within

a target zone wss studied originally by Krugman (1988a), whose analysis has been extended by
Miller and Weller (1988).

        One way for the authorities to enforce the target zone is to place lower and upper limits, k and

      on the fundamentals. If the fundamentals are prevented from moving outside the range                          [k,   1,
 and if (as turns out to be true in equilibrium) S(k) is monotonically increasing in k, the exchange

 rate will be confinedbetween the lower and upper values g = S(k) and                  i = S(). (As usual, S(k)
 is   the saddlepath     value of the exchange rate within      the target zone.) For the exchange rate to be
 free to move back within the zone after it has touched one of its edges, the bounds 1k' 1 must be

 reflecting barriers on the fundamentals process. Clearly, the authorities can enforce any desired

 exchange-rate target zone by choosing appropriate reflecting barriers on the fundamentals.

       Before solving the model under the arrangements just described,                 it is worth considering just
how the authorities' policy should be conveyed to the market. One possibility is that the authorities

announce, "Wewill let the exchange rate float freely within the range                [, ], but when it roaches the
band's edge we will intervene to keep         it from going further." While this may be the most intuitive
way to announce an exchange-rate target zone, it introduces                   a potential for multiple equilibria by
not givingmarket participantsenough information about the future behavior of fundamentals. For

example, at the moment the authoritiesfirst announce that the exchange rate will be confined within

bands, the market could set         x=       if the authoritiesrespond by setting k =            k immediately. An

initial exchange rate of is an equilibrium when k =                 provided the authoritiessubsequently allow

k to move downward according to (2), but not upward. Similar reasoning, but based on different

market anticipations about the management of fundamentals, shows that an initial exchange rate

of z   =    could also occur. The point is that multiple values of z can be supported as equilibria

through accommodating adjustments of the fundamentals.10
       Because announcing exchange-rate objectives without specifying the accompanying policies

may not be enough         to determine      a unique equilibrium exchange rate, we stay with the initial

formulation offered above: Momentary interventionprevents fundamentals from rising above the

upper bound k or belowthe lowerbound              , but   no interventionoccurs otherwise. As we will show in

a moment,    a policy of credibly announcing that            and     are reflecting barrierson the fundamentals

accomplishes the objective of keeping the exchangerate within the range                     = S(k), = S()].    And

because the policy does not allow market expectations to influence the evolution of fundamentals

inside the band, problem of multiple equilibriadoes not arise.

       To determine exchange-rate behavior within a target zone, we therefore solve for the exchange.

rate path that satisfies (1) given fundamentals evolving according to (2) within reflecting barriers

k and   .   The solution can be expressed as a special case of (3):

                   z(t) = S(k(t)) = E(a'          f     c('')Ik(a)ds      I   k(t),k(s) E fk,k,.J),            (11)

where the r subscript indicates that the barriers on fundamentals are reflecting. As noted in section

2, direct evaluation of the conditional expectation in        (It) is much more difficult than in (5)   (the

case   of a   permanent free float): the bounds on fundamentals imply that the saddlepath exchange
rate S(k) will no longer be a purely linear function of k.
       We have already taken   the first step in solving the problem by deriving the general nonlinear

solution x      =
              G(k) given by (8). Some member of this family of solutions must characterize

exchange-rate behavior when k is in the interior of[kr,.], where (1) and (2) simultaneously hold.
A nontrivial logical gap must be bridged, however, before concluding that equation (8) is also

relevant at the boundary of this interval, that is, at the barriers k =       ,   and k   = k,..   The needed

bridge is supplied by the fact that the saddlepath solution S(k) is continuous on the entire interval

[,k,j.   Continuity ensures that if S(k) coincides with a function of form G(k) on the interior of
that interval, S(k) coincides with the same function at the edges.
     All that remains, then, is to determine the boundary conditions on C(k) implied by the re-

flecting barriers. These conditions deliver unique values for the undetermined coefficients A1 and

 A2 in (8), and therefore   tie down uniquely the member of the class G(k) that coincides with S(k)
 when k lies between the reflecting barriers.

       The appropriate boundary conditions on G(k) are the "smooth-pasting' conditions discussed
 in Dixit (1987), Dumas (1988), and Krugman (1988a,b):

                                                 G'L) = 0,                                 .               (12)


                                                 G'() = 0.                                                 (13)

 The intuition behind these conditions is straightforward, as the following argument shows. Consider

 equation (12), for example. If (h,.,    ) is   an equilibrium point under the target zone, equilibrium

 condition (1) must hold     at that   point. At the boundary, however, investors have a one-sided bet

 on fundamentals. Investors know that from k =         Ic,,   k can move only upward. Suppose (contrary

 to (12)) that the function G(k) describing the saddlepath under a zone passes through (k,, with       )
 a negative slope, that is, with G'(k,) < 0. Point I in Figure 2 shows a function G(k) for which
  this is the case. The inequality G'(k,.) < 0 states that under a hypothetical free float with the
                                                      10
exchange rate given by x = G(k),            the positive-probability         event that k falls below k, would cause

x to rise above x. But then (k, x) cannot also be                an   equilibriumpoint (and thus satisfy (1)) when

k,   is a reflecting lower barrier: in the        latter case,      the downside risk is exactly the same as under

a free float (the exchange rate can             still move down       along G(k) if   k rises), but there      is no longer

any upside exchange-rate risk (from a fall in k). A similar argument disposes of the possibility

that G'(k,) > 0 (imagine that point 2 in Figure 2 is vertically below k,, and repeat the line of

reasoning just presented). The contradictionis avoided only if G'(k,) 0, so
                                                                     =       that under the free

float described    by G(k), a small downward            move in k from k, doesn't affect the exchange rate.                At
the lowerbarrier, the saddlepath must therefore look like                   5(k) in the figure, that is, it must be at a
local minimum.       A   parallel argument establishes the second smooth-pasting condition (13), which

states that the saddlepath has a local maximum at                   k,"
      Using (8), we can write the smooth-pasting conditions                   as:



                                            1   + A,.A1eA + A2A2e" = 0,                                                   (14)


                                            1+    A,A1e"' + A2.A2e' = 0.                                                  (15)

Equations (14) and (15) yield the following proposition:12

       If we let the lower barrier, k, go to minus infinity, (16) simplifies to:

                                            = S(k)       k+    q      —

       If iii addition we let the upper barrier, 1,   go to infinity, (17) becomes the linear saddlcpatb in

(5):
                                                r=k+rstj.                                                (18)

Only when both boundaries are infinitely distant is the exchange rate a linear function of funda-
mentals.


       Notice that the saddlepath solution given in (16) is of the form hypothesized earlier:          it is a
function of the current state k and the two barriers.        It is   also straightforward to verify that S(k)

is monotonically increasing over its domain of definition, as claimed earlier.

       Figure 3 illustrates two possible exchange rate paths described by (16). Tbe paths share a
common upper barrier,       ,   but differ with respectto the lower barrier. Path 1 in the figure sbows

the behavior of the exchange rate when there are finite reflecting barriers at k and L This path has

several noteworthy features. First, its shape reflects the influenceof expected policy changes at the
fundamental barriers. In the oeighborhood of Ic, for example, the exchange rate is below FF, the

saddlepath under a hypothetical free float. This bending away from              FF near k reflects a greater
expected fall in z compared with a situation without boundaries. Second, the equilibrium solution
behaves much like the saddlepatb when the exchange rate is within the band but not close to either

boundary. When the band is wider, the equilibrium solution is close to             FF for a greater range of
fundamentals. Path 2, for example, shows the casein which the lower boundary is infinitely distant

(equation (17)). This graphical intuitionis made precise in (18), which shows that the equilibrium
solution converges to the saddlepath when both barriers are infinitely distant. The implication is

that for a narrow band, the free-float solution FF will almost never be a good approximation to
 the true equilibrium path.

 3.2. Dual AbsorbiugBarriers

        Suppose now that the authorities wish to let the exchange rate float until it reaches a lower
 or an upper level, x or     ,   at which time they plan to fix       x permanently.   To keep the spot rate

                                                                                              at k =
 fixed   at one of these levels, the   authorities must hold the fundamentals constant                 5'Lr)

or k    =   S'(), respectively.         This class of problems is a generalization of that posed by Flood

and Garber (1983) who are concerned with the behavior of a tloattng exdiange rate when the

authoritiesplan to switch to a fixed-rate regime at a single, predetermined level                      of the exchange
rate,   .   We discuss the Flood and Garber example               in   more detail in the next section.

        Once again, there is the issue of how the authorities' intentions are conveyed to the public. In

order to avoid potential multiple equilibria, we assume that the authorities inform investors that

fundamentals      will follow   (2)   until k reaches k or   . At      that time the authorities will fix k, thereby

fixing the exchange rate at           = S(/t) or = S(k), respectively.
                                  k and k, the saddlepath solution is:

                                                  f
        Given the boundaries,


                   z(i)    S(k(t)) = E(cs'            e(°k(s)ds I               k(1),k(s) E       ,                (19)

where the a subscript denotes that the barriers on fundamentals are absorbing. As before, direct

evaluation of (19) is very cumbersome. The methods used above apply directly, however, and lead

to a simple answer.

        Thefirst step once again is to examine the exchangerate's value at the boundaries. Fortunately,
the boundary values of integral (19) are easy to evaluate. They are:


            =   S() = E(a'        f     ()I5k(8)d8 I     k(t)      =        =   ' e'ds ,.

In words, once fundamentals are fixed permanently, the spot rate is just the capitalized value of
                                                                                                                   (21)




current fundamentals, either          L or
        At the boundaries,      (8) and either (20) or (21) must hold. Together they imply:


                                             a' + A1e" + A2eA = 0,                                                 (22)


                                             at + A1e)k + A2e = 0.                                                 (23)

These two equations lead to a unique solution for the two constants                       in   (8), and to the following

proposition:

    Propositioss 2. When fundamentals         follow (2) within   the ahsorhing harriers k and k, the
saddlepath solution (t9) is:
                                      A3k+A1k —   A2ktAIk +              —
                    x=k+csq(I+                          -        -
                                                            — 8A3k+A,k
                                                                                     1
                                                                                     I                    (24)


If we let the lower bound, k, go to minus infinity, (24) simplifies to:

                                      z = k + oq (i — eAI_).                                              (25)


If in addition the upper bound, k, goes to infinity, we again get the familiar linear solution in (5).



    Figure 4 illustrates equation (24).     It shows two    exchange rate paths that share the same

upper bound, but that have different lower bounds. Path           1   shows the behavior of a when the

absorbing barriers are tbe points k and        in the figure. Path 2 is drawn to correspond to the

extreme case in (25), where the lower bound is at minus infinity. It is clear from the figure, as

well as from (18), that the exchange rate must lie on the 45-degree line through the origin at both

absorbing barriers. When both boundaries are infinitely distant,the saddlepath isjust the free-float

saddlepatb,   FF.   Notice also from the proposition that if there is no trend growth in fundamentals,
  = 0, all solutions correspond to the 45-degree line (which then coincides with FF), regardless of
the boundary values.

     The intuition behind the saddlepath solution in Figure 4 is as follows. On the saddlepatb, the

exchange rate is the present discounted value of fundamentals, and the evolution of fundamentals is

governedin part by their deterministic trend growth rate, which depends on q. Suppose that q > ll

(the case shown in the figure). As k approaches either         or k, the probability that the exchange

rate will still be floating on any given future date declines; and since mj    is set permanently   to zero
at the moment of pegging, the expected rate of monetary growth on            any future date also declines

as either absorbing barrier is approached. As a result, there is a progressive currency appreciation

relative to EF as k movestowards one of the barriers. For q < 0, FF would lie below the 45-degree

line and the saddlepath solution would be the mirror image of the one in Figure 4. When              mj   =0
the bending effects are absent because absorption of        I has no effect   on the expected change in

                                                   14
fundamentals (which remains zero). 'l'hink of the saddlepath as being trapped between                            FF and
the 45-degree line, which, as noted in the last paragraph, coincide when q                      = 0.

3.3. Single Barrier Problems

     The path given by (25) has additional              significance in        the exchange rate literature: it    is   the

unique path for the stochastic-process-switchingproblem posed by Flood and Garber (1983). Flood
and Garberattempt to solve directly the integral representation for the exchange rate under a single

absorbing barrier     at k:

                              x(t) =   E(cr'   f      e(t_0k(s)ds          I   k(t), k(s) <   ,).                       (26)


Since they do not arrive at a closed-form solution, it is worth some additional discussion to see why

the simple formula (25) is the solution to this problem.
     With a single absorbing barrier at k, we know from (8) and (21) that the exchange rate must
satisfy:
                              = k + ati(1 —                + Az(e2k            —
                                                                                   ee—fAk),                             (27)

where A2 is an arbitrary constant to be determined. Clearly, there will be                          a unique value for A2
which makes (27) equal to the integral representation in (26).

    Figure 5 shows the family of solutions given by (27). We graph six different paths by setting
A2 in (27) to positive (paths 1-3) ar,d negative (paths 5 and 6) values. It is clear that for k <

the spot rate can take on any value below !. (In keepingwith the spirit of this model, we show

in Figure 5 only paths along which the exchange rate and fundamentals strike the peg for the first

time from below and the left: z(O) <               and k(0)

     It is easy to see that       the solution to (26) must be (27) with A2                   = 0.   Note first that as k

becomes infinitely small, the presence of the barrier /c, has a negligible effect on the conditional

expectation of future levels of k in (26). For such small k, the exchange rate should therefore be
 "Thi, translate. into a restriction os the free parameterA,. We conaideronly those cases in which:
                                                           1o,1A1      —.
                                                              —   As)r5L

approximately linear in the fundamentals (as in the no-boundary solution, equation (5)). Next,
note that (27) becomes linear in k as k —s —cc if and only if A2 = 0. 'l'hus, equation (26) and

(27) can be equivalent only when A2 = 0; but setting A2          = 0 just gives solution (25), which was
found by letting the lower bound on k go to minus infinity. Path 4 in Figure 5 thus gives the value
of (26).

    For finite values of   ,   the price-fundamentals relationship     must lie below path 4 in Figure 5.

(This can he seen in Figure 4, where path 2 lies everywhere helow path 1.) Figure 6 shows that
                                                                                               a

path such as 5 corresponds to the equilibrium fork and k0. Some paths, such as 6, lie everywhere
below the 45-degree line, and therefore cannot be solutions to (3) for any value of A,,. Similarly,

the paths that lie above 4 in Figures 4 and 5 cannot be solutions for any A,,.
     The logic of this section can of coursebe applieddirectly to the case of a single reflecting

barrierat L In that case it is straightforward to show that the exchange rate follows equation          (17)

above, so that:


              z(t) = E(cr'                                             = k + csq — A11eA(k.
                             J   e1''1'k(s)ds   I   k(t), k(s)                                          (28)


3.4. Mixed Barriers

     Suppose that the authoritiesexpect eventually to peg the exchange rate             at the   depreciated

value,   ,   but that meanwhile they will not permit arbitrarily large appreciations. They mightagree
on a lower bound,      a, at which they would intervene, selling domestic       assets in order to prevent

the exchange rate from appreciating further. They would not, however, peg the exchange rate at
the appreciated level, a. This is a case where it is sensible to think       of policy as providing a lower
reflecting barrier, fr, as well as an upper absorbing barrier k,,. Using the techniques above, the
solution to this more complex problem is immediate.

     With these mixed barriers, the exchange rate is given by the integral expression:

                        z(t) = E(cs' J et'l/k(s)ds           I   k(t),k(s)   Ikr,L]).                   (29)


 Using (8) and the boundary conditions (12) and (21), we have the proposition:
                                                      16
    Proposition3.        When fundamentals follow (2) between a reflecting barrier          arid an absorbing
barrier k, the saddlepath solution      (29) is:

                                            —   o   A2e   t4A +
                                                               -—   alet+
                                                                      -                                    (30)
                                                                    .A1e'                         -




    Figure 7 shows that the      paths satisfying (30) correspond to those above Path          4. Path 2, for

example, tracesout (30) with a lower reflecting barrier         at k.   Naturally, the path "pastes"   at k and
meets the upper absorbing barrier according to (21). A path such as               I would be the equilibrium
for a higher reflecting barrier, while a path such as 3 would be the equilibrium for a lower one. As

the point of intervention k —p —, the exchange rate path converges to path 4                  (given again by

equation (25)). Paths such as 5 and 6 cannot satisfy these boundary conditions, since along them

G'(k) is strictly positive at all k >   .
3.5. More Complex Forcing Processes
    The techniques above are practical only when the driving process in (2) is relatively simple; it

is usually impossible to find closed-form general solutions         to the analogues of (7) when k follows a
more complicated forcing process. Nonetheless, some special cases do have solutions. Suppose, for

example, that fundamentals are mean reverting:


                                    dk(t) = (t — Ok(t))dt       + odz(t),                                  (31)

where s, 0 and      are known constants. Use of (1) and application of Ltd's lemma lead to the
differential equation:

                                 G(k)    = k + (t — Gk)G'(k) +                                             (32)
                                                                    -G"(k).
The following proposition gives the general solution to (32):


    Proposition 4.       When fundamentals follow (31), any solution to equation (1) must satisfy:


     = G(k) = .±!L +
                             A1M(,        ,   2(rl_Ok)z) + A2M(j-,                                         (33)

                                                          17
where 'ti and A2 are arbitrary constants and M(                 ) is the confluent hypergeoinetric function.'4


     Using the procedures discussed above, it is straightforward to rederive all the above proposi-
                                                                                                the
tions when fundamentals evolve according to (31). Naturally, for values of Jr such that Ok q

mean-reversion component of (31) is unimportant, so that the solutions appear qualitatively very

similar to those shown in the graphs. For values of Jr where mean reversion is important, the mean
                                                                                           into the
reversion introduces a new source of bending (toward the unconditional mean of k, ,j/O)

paths above.

4. Conclusions

     This paper has shown how techniques of regulated Brownian motion can be applied to models
of exchange-rate determination under a variety ofpossible future regime switches. The techniques

used above are far          and more intuitive than the "brute-force" method of calculating the
                       simpler
exchange rate directly as the expected present discounted value of fundamentals. In particular,
our techniques yield an explicit, closed-form solution to the Flood and Garher (1983) example;

 and despite the complexities of solving the relevant conditional expectations directly, the answer

 derived here is surprisingly transparent. With such solutions in hand, the next step is to turn the

 data to determine     the empirical importance of stochastic regime switches.
