1.      Introduction

        The theory of international trade has long been relatively disjoint from the theory of direct

foreign investment, the latter traditionally viewed as part of the macroeconomic theory of capital

flows. The foreign investment ‚Äúregime‚Äù (e.g., restricted, liberal) could of course affect trade in

this view, but only through changing the host country‚Äôs capital stock. This conceptual approach

to direct investment began to break down in the 1980's as researchers noted direct investment

seemed more related to firm-specific assets than to measures of aggregate capital. Firms in the

developed countries penetrated each other's markets with intra-industry direct investment, and

the directions of investment did not seem to bear any particular relationship to interest rates or

other measures of returns to capital. Other studies refined the evidence by showing that direct

investment was closely related to knowledge-based and other intangible assets and not related to

physical capital intensity.1

        We have now come to appreciate direct investment as quite different from portfolio

capital flows, and our theoretical understanding of FDI has become more closely related to real

trade theory than to international finance. It might be best to think of a firm‚Äôs decision to build

or acquire a foreign factory as a ‚Äúreal‚Äù side decision, with the decision of where and how to raise

financial capital for the factory as a separate and distinct decision. Financial capital sometimes

comes from the parent country, sometimes from the host country, and sometimes it is raised on

world markets in a manner that makes it difficult to define its origin.

        In this paper, we will concentrate on the ‚Äúreal‚Äù side of direct investment; that is, decisions

on the location of production and sales by firms. We will try to integrate these choices with a

trade model, permitting firms to serve foreign markets by either exports or branch-plant


                                                  1
                                                  2

production, or indeed to serve the home market by exports from the foreign branch plant. This

permits a much-needed integration of trade and investment theories and is particularly important

in discussions of intra-industry trade and the ‚Äúnew trade theory‚Äù (the industrial-organization

approach to trade). These two literatures have generally ignored the role of multinational firms,

even though most of the industries that are widely cited as examples of the new trade theory are

dominated by multinational firms.

       The next section of the paper provides a few statistics on intra-industry trade and intra-

industry affiliate sales (sales by the foreign affiliates of multinational firms). We use real

affiliate sales rather than investment stocks or flows, because the latter are a conceptual

mismatch when compared to trade flows.

       Section three of the paper outlines a formal general-equilibrium model with endogenous

multinational firms, and notes how Grubel-Lloyd intra-industry trade (IIT) indices and intra-

industry affiliate sales (IIAS) indices depend on country characteristics and the restrictiveness of

the trade and investment regimes.

       The results of section three provide hypotheses for econometric testing and estimation in

section four. We relate IIAS and IIT indices to their theoretical determinants, including joint

market size, differences in market size, differences in skill endowments, and the costs of

engaging in investment and trade. The IIAS regressions fit the theory very well. The index

grows higher as two countries become more similar in size and in relative endowments. The IIT

regressions fit somewhat less well, but generally support the theory. A final set of regressions

use the ratio of the IIAS to the IIT index as the dependent variable. The results suggest that

‚Äúbalanced‚Äù (high index) affiliate activity, much more so than trade, is encouraged by higher
                                                        3

incomes and country similarity in terms of size and labor-force composition.



2.      IIT and IIAS indices

        We will use indices for trade and affiliate activity following the formula developed by

Grubel and Lloyd (1975). The IIT index is defined as follows, for industry i and countries j and

k. Exportsijk are exports from j to k and importsijk are imports into j from k in industry i.


                            | exportsijk       importsijk |
        IITijk      1                                         100                                 (1)
                             exportsijk        importsijk


The IIT index ranges from a low of zero, when trade in one way only, to a value of 100 when

trade is perfectly balanced. The IIAS index is similarly defined, where ASijk are industry i

affiliate sales by affiliates in country k of country j parent firms


                             | ASijk       ASikj |
        IIASijk         1                            100                                          (2)
                               ASijk       ASikj


        Our data set covers the United States and ten countries or regions: Canada, France,

Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, the UK, Australia, Japan, Other Asia-Pacific, and Latin

America. The industrial sectors are total manufacturing and seven broad sub-categories: food

and kindred products (FOOD), chemicals (CHEM), primary metals (PRIM), machinery

(MACH), electrical machinery (ELEC), transport equipment (TRAN), and other manufacturing

(OTHE). In the econometric estimation in Section 4 we employ data for three years: 1988, 1991,

and 1994. The affiliate sales data are from the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis. One
                                                   4

unfortunate feature of these data is that all observations are bilateral with the United States. Thus,

for example, Germany-UK activity is not available and the United States is always one side of

each observation.

       Table 1 presents the IIAS and IIT indices for 1987 and 1997 (TMFG is total

manufacturing). Because these are highly aggregated industrial sectors and the figures are

averaged across all countries, the indices are quite high. For most sectors intra-industry sales

ratios exceeded intra-industry trade ratios in 1987, except for machinery and transport equipment.

The sales and trade indexes came closer together by 1997.

       Because we are interested in the evolution of intra-industry activity, in Table 2 we present

some comparative statistics. In the top panel of Table 2, we show the change in the IIAS and IIT

indices between 1987 and 1997. The IIT index for total manufacturing rose more than its

counterpart IIAS index and substantial variation across industries is shown.

       The bottom section of Table 2 shows the percentage change in the IIAS index minus the

percentage change in the IIT index between 1987 and 1997 and then shows a similar statistic for

the changes in the levels of total (two-way) affiliate sales and total trade. The statistics indicate

that the IIAS index grew somewhat slower than the IIT index over the period except in

machinery and transport equipment. However, the right-hand numbers indicate that the level of

affiliate activity grew faster than the level of trade for total manufacturing. Considering the

results at the bottom of Table 2, we can say that affiliate activity grew faster than trade over the

period, but trade became somewhat more balanced than affiliate activity. It is thus important to

keep in mind that the indices of intra-industry activity measure proportions and say nothing about

volumes. Affiliate activity in the food, electrical machinery, and transport equipment industries
                                                  5

grew much faster than trade, but affiliate activity became more balanced relative to trade in the

machinery and transport equipment industries.



3.     A General-Equilibrium Model of Trade and Affiliate Activity

       Consider the two-country, two-good, two-factor general-equilibrium model developed in

Markusen (1998b) as an extension of Markusen and Venables (1998, 2000). The principal

features of the model are as follows. First, there are two homogeneous Goods, X and Y, two

countries, h and f, and two factors, unskilled labor L and skilled labor S. Second, the Y sector is

competitive, has constant returns to scale, and is L-intensive. Third, the X sector is imperfectly

competitive, has increasing returns to scale, and is S-intensive overall. In this good,

"headquarters and "plant" may be geographically separated. Thus, firms may have plants in one

or both countries

       Fourth, there are six firm types, with free entry and exit into and out of firm types.

Permit regime to denote a set of firm types active in equilibrium.

Type mh -      horizontal multinationals that maintain plants in both countries and headquarters
               are located in country h.

Type mf -      horizontal multinationals that maintain plants in both countries and headquarters
               are located in country f.

Type nh -      national firms that maintain a single plant and headquarters in country h. Type h
               firms may or may not export to country f.

Type nf -      national firms that maintain a single plant and headquarters in country f. Type f
               firms may or may not export to country h.

Type vh -      vertical multinationals that maintain a single plant in country f and headquarters in
               country h. Type vh firms may or may not export to country h.

Type vf -      vertical multinationals that maintain a single plant in country h and headquarters
                                                  6

               in country f. Type vf firms may or may not export to country f.

       Fifth, good X is homogeneous, firms engage in Cournot competition, and the h and f

markets are segmented. Sixth, a firm‚Äôs markup over marginal cost is decreasing in its market

share. This creates a ‚Äúreciprocal dumping‚Äù motive for intra-industry trade and investment.

Seventh, there are firm-level scale economies arising from the joint-input (‚Äúpublic good‚Äù) nature

of knowledge-based assets, as well as plant-level scale economies. Finally, the factor-intensity

assumptions of the various activities, ranked from most skilled-labor-intensive to least skilled-

labor-intensive, are:

       [headquarters only] > [integrated X] > [plant only] > [Y]

       The firm-level scale economies create a motive for horizontal multinationals, which

spread the fixed costs of knowledge capital across multiple plants. The different factor

intensities between activities combined with the different factor endowments (and prices) across

countries create a motive for vertical firms. We now describe circumstances under which one

firm type is encouraged relative to another in equilibrium.

National Firms

       National firms wish to locate in the larger market (to save transport costs) and/or the

skilled-labor abundant country (for factor-price motives). The number of firms in the two

countries will be relatively balanced, and hence the IIT index higher, if the countries are

relatively similar, or if the smaller country is skilled-labor abundant, and trade costs are low.

Horizontal Firms

       Horizontal multinationals will be more important when trade costs are high, the countries

are relatively similar in size and in relative endowments, and total income is high (for then firms
                                                  7

bear the fixed costs of branch plants instead of the variable costs of exports). The location of a

firm‚Äôs headquarters depends only on factor prices (but these are influenced by the location of

production in general equilibrium). Intra-industry affiliate sales should be highest when the

countries have very similar endowments (headquarters‚Äô locations are balanced) and when the

countries are relatively similar in size and trade costs are high (type-m firms are important).

Vertical firms

       Vertical firms will be important when the countries have very different relative

endowments and trade costs are relatively low. We have included a small cost to fragmenting the

headquarters and plant, so that other things equal, a type-v firm has higher costs than a type-n

firm. The consequence of this is that there will never be type-v firms operating in both countries.

One type-v firm from each country could be replaced by one type-n in each country, and the same

output could be generated with lower costs. Combining this notion with the previous result, we

do not expect intra-industry affiliate sales when the countries have quite different relative factor

endowments.

       What do these general results imply about the relationship of the IIT and IIAS indices to

each other and to country characteristics? Clearly, if countries are quite similar and trade costs

are moderate to high, then we would expect type-m firms to substitute for trade. Similarly, if

countries grow in total income, we expect horizontal firms to substitute for trade (due to plant-

level scale economies).

       Figures 1 to 6 illustrate contours for the levels of IIT and IIAS indices over the ‚Äúworld‚Äù

(two-country) Edgeworth box. On the horizontal axis is the total two-country endowment of

unskilled labor and the vertical axis is the total two-country endowment of skilled labor. The
                                                    8

origin for country h is at the southwest (SW) corner of the box and the origin for country f is at

the northeast (NE) corner of the box. For points along the SW-NE diagonal, the countries differ

in relative size but not in relative endowments. The line of approximately equal incomes, in

which countries differ in relative endowments but not in size, is steeper than the NW-SE

diagonal, and runs from approximately column 9 to column 11 through the center of the box.

       We simulate the model repeatedly over a grid of endowment values, solving for the

equilibrium regime and trade pattern for each point in the box. Then we compute IIT and IIAS

indices for each solution. These are then plotted in Figures 1-6. Four different combinations of

trade and investment restrictions are considered.

1. NL involves no liberalization and includes high trade costs (20%) and a prohibition on FDI.

2. TL involves trade liberalization, adopting low trade costs (1%) and a prohibition on FDI.

3. IL involves investment liberalization, permitting FDI but maintaining high trade costs (20%).

4. FL involves both trade and investment liberalization.

       Figure 1 shows the intra-industry trade index under NL (trade costs 20%, multinationals

prohibited). Intra-industry trade occurs when the countries are very similar, or when the smaller

country is skilled-labor abundant. Because good X has increasing returns to scale and is skilled-

labor intensive, size and skilled-labor abundance are both sources of comparative advantage in

that sector. These results will be used in the specification of the regression equations in the next

section.

       Figure 2 shows the IIT index with trade costs reduced to 1% and multinationals still

prohibited. The effect of trade liberalization is to increase the areas where intra-industry trade

occurs, but the same general pattern holds: the IIT index is high when countries are similar or
                                                  9

when the small country is skilled-labor abundant.

        Figure 3 plots the IIT index under the investment liberalization (IL) experiment, retaining

high trade costs. Intra-industry trade almost entirely disappears. Near the center of the box, type-

n firms are replaced by type-m firms so that there is in fact no trade in good X. In the region

where the small country is skilled-labor abundant, type-v firms headquartered in that country

dominate. Thus, headquarters are located there and plants are located in the large, unskilled-

labor-abundant country.

        Figure 4 plots the IIT index under the full liberalization (FL) scenario. Due to plant-level

scale economies, type-m firms are not active near the center of the box, and there is once again

intra-industry competition between type-n firms located in the two countries. The other regions

where the index is high are where one country is very skilled-labor abundant, and of similar size

or smaller than the other country. Consider the N-NW region of Figure 4. In this region, the

dominant firms are type-nh and type-vh. Thus all firms are headquartered in country h, but there

are plants in both countries and intra-industry trade occurs while (as noted below), intra-industry

affiliate activity does not.

        Figure 5 show the IIAS index under investment liberalization (IL) and trade costs at 20%.

Positive IIAS occurs where countries are similar in relative endowments, and not too different in

size. As the countries become very different in size, type-n firms headquartered in the large

country come to dominate. Figure 6 shows the effect of doubling the world factor endowment.

The region of intra-industry affiliate sales stretches to include countries that are more different in

size, but not more different in relative endowments.

        No intra-industry affiliate sales occur under the full liberalization (FL) scenario, so we
                                                 10

have not shown the IIAS index under FL. There are regions in which type-v firms are dominant

under FL, but they are always headquartered in the skilled-labor abundant country. Thus there

are no intra-industry affiliate sales, even though the level of multinational activity is high. As

noted earlier, it is important to remember that the IIAS index is a measure of the balance of

activity, not its level.

        What are the general conclusions from the theory? Trade liberalization can increase the

IIT index for many country pairs (compare Figure 1 to Figure 2). However, investment

liberalization can largely eliminate IIT if trade costs are high (compare Figure 1 to Figure 3) or

reduce IIT if trade costs are low (compare Figure 2 to Figure 4). We expect IIT to be highest

when, on the one hand, the countries are similar in size or the small country is skilled-labor

abundant and, on the other hand, when trade costs are low and investment costs are high.

        We expect the IIAS index to be higher when the countries are similar in size and in

relative endowments, trade costs are high, and investment costs are low. One final hypothesis

not shown in a diagram relates to total world income. As the two-country total income rises, we

expect a shift from intra-industry competition by type-n firms to intra-industry affiliate sales

competition by type-m firms at points near the center of the box. Thus there is a hypothesis that

a growth in total world income should increase the ratio of the IIAS index to the IIT index.



4.      Empirical Results

        The theory suggests hypotheses about how IIT and IIAS should be related to country

characteristics. Thus, in our regression equations the dependent variables are the IIT index, the

IIAS index, and the ratio IIAS/IIT. The country characteristics identified by our theory include
                                                 11

the following. First, SUMGDP is the sum of U.S. and country j GDP. This is a measure of joint

market size. Second, GDPDIFSQ is the squared difference between U.S. and country j GDP. It

captures similarity in size between partners and is squared in order to capture non-linearities in

the indexes as we move toward the Northeast in the endowment box.

       Third, SKDIFSQ is the squared difference between the share of the labor force that is

skilled in the United States and the same share in country j. Differences in skill endowments

play a strong role in the theory. Fourth, GDPDIF*SKDIF is an interaction term that is important

in the IIT regressions. Next, INVCJ is an index of costs of investing in country j and TCJ

        is an index of the costs of overcoming trade barriers in country j.

       Data for the estimation form a panel of cross-country and cross-industry observations for

the years 1988, 1991, and 1994. Again, the countries and regions involved are Canada, France,

Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, the UK, Australia, Japan, Other Asia-Pacific, and Latin

America. We take real sales volume of non-bank manufacturing affiliates in each country to

indicate production activity. The U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis

(BEA) provides annual data on sales of foreign affiliates of American parent firms and on sales

of U.S. affiliates of foreign parent firms. Because the focus of our inquiry is intra-industry sales,

we use the sectoral breakdown indicated in Table 1. Clearly it would be better to investigate data

with far greater industry disaggregation but when BEA data on both outward and inward sales

activity are combined the resulting number of sectors and partner countries or regions becomes

severely limited.

       The data are bilateral with the United States, which is either the parent country or the host

country in every observation. Annual sales values abroad were converted into millions of 1990
                                                 12

U.S. dollars using an exchange-rate adjusted local wholesale price index, with exchange rates

and price indexes taken from the International Financial Statistics (IFS) of the International

Monetary Fund.

       In our theory, intra-industry trade emanates from country characteristics. Thus, the

appropriate usage is bilateral trade by sector rather than intra-firm trade. For this purpose, figures

on bilateral U.S. exports to each trading partner, and U.S. imports from each trading partner,

were compiled from the COMTRADE database, using the Standard International Trade

Classification, version 2, and were aggregated to our sectoral classification.2 Details of this

aggregation are available on request. The exports and imports data were in current U.S. dollars

and we converted them into millions of 1990 U.S. dollars.

       Real gross domestic product is measured in billions of 1990 U.S. dollars for each country.

For this purpose, annual real GDP figures in local currencies were converted into dollars using

the market exchange rate. These data are also from the IFS. Skilled labor abundance is defined

as the sum of occupational categories 0/1 (professional, technical, and kindred workers) and 2

(administrative workers) in employment in each country, divided by total employment. These

figures were compiled from annual surveys reported in the Yearbook of Labor Statistics

published by the International Labor Organization. In cases where some annual figures were

missing, the skilled-labor ratios were taken to equal the period averages for each country. The

variable SKDIFFSQ is the squared difference between relative skill endowment of the parent

country and the affiliate country.

       The cost of investing in the affiliate country is a simple average of several indices of

perceived impediments to investment, reported in the World Competitiveness Report of the
                                                  13

World Economic Forum. The investment barriers include restrictions on the ability to acquire

control in a domestic company, limitations on the ability to employ foreign skilled labor,

restraints on negotiating joint ventures, strict controls on hiring and firing practices, market

dominance by a small number of enterprises, an absence of fair administration of justice,

difficulties in acquiring local bank credit, restrictions on access to local and foreign capital

markets, and inadequate protection of intellectual property. The resulting indices are computed

on a scale from zero to 100, with a higher number indicating higher investment costs.

       A trade cost index was taken from the same source and is defined as a measure of

national protectionism, or efforts to prevent importation of competitive products. It also runs

from zero to 100, with 100 being the highest trade costs. All of these indices are based on

extensive surveys of multinational enterprises. It should be noted that both the investment-cost

and trade-cost indices are ordinal and qualitative in nature. Thus, regression coefficients

represent the partial effects of a change in the average perceived costs of investing and trading.

       The variables suggested above form the basic specifications we estimate. However, there

is likely to be heterogeneity in effects across sectors and investment partners. Thus, we add

industry effects in a second specification and industry effects and dummies for Japan and Canada

in a third specification. Finally, due to the bilateral nature of the data the United States is one

partner in each observation. Thus, the U.S. values of INVC and TC are constant for all

observations and cannot provide independent information. Accordingly, impacts of the U.S.

trade and investment costs are subsumed into the constant term.

       In the IIT and IIAS regressions the dependent variable is limited in range from 0 to 100.

Accordingly, ordinarily least squares is an inappropriate estimation technique. For this reason we
                                                  14

employ the standard logit approach for those equations. However, the equations involving the

ratio IIAS/IIT are not so constrained in principle and we use OLS.

       Table 3 shows the results for the regressions with intra-industry affiliate sales as the

dependent variable. There were a number of industry-country cells for which data were

suppressed, leaving a sample size of 181. For the IIAS regressions, the hypothesized sign on

SUMGDP is positive following Figure 6. The hypothesized signs on GDPDIFSQ and SKDIFSQ

are negative from the results in Figures 5 and 6. INVCJ should have a negative sign if two-way

affiliate sales are relatively balanced at low investment costs. TCJ should have a positive sign, as

type-m firms should substitute for type-n firms as trade costs in the host country rise.

       In Table 3 there are six regressions listed. The first is the basic model without investment

costs, trade costs, or industry and country effects. The second adds industry dummies and the

third adds dummy variables for Japan and Canada. The final three regressions repeat this

structure but include INVCJ and TCJ.

       The results in Table 3 give good support to the theory, both in terms of correct signs and

statistical significance, with coefficients that achieve at least 90 percent confidence shown in

boldface. It is evident that market size, as captured by SUMGDP, exerts a positive and

significant impact on IIAS. Thus, increases in size raise the ratio of two-way affiliate sales to

total affiliate sales. In virtually all specifications GDPDIFSQ has a significantly negative effect

on IIAS, as anticipated. Thus, the greater the dissimilarity in sizes the smaller the share of intra-

industry sales. In the regressions without cost variables, SKDIFSQ also has a significant and

negative effect on IIAS, consistent with the theory. The signs and significance of the central

variables SUMGDP, GDPDIFSQ, SKDIFSQ are robust to the inclusion or exclusion of the
                                                  15

industry dummies and Japan and Canada dummies. We should note that the coefficient on the

Japan dummy is always negative and usually significant, while that on the Canada dummy is

always positive and significant. Industry fixed effects are also typically significant.

       When the trade and investment cost variables are added, the results on SUMGDP and

GDPDIFSQ remain intact. SKDIFSQ retains its appropriate sign but loses its statistical

significance. Skill differences are positively correlated in our data with investment costs, which

are higher in the developing countries. This collinearity explains the reduction in magnitude and

significance of SKDIFSQ. As for INVCJ and TCJ themselves, their coefficients generally have

the right signs. Investment costs clearly reduce incentives to engage in intra-industry affiliate

activity. Overall, these results are very positive for the theory.

       The IIT regressions in Table 4 have 264 observations because there are no missing

observations in the trade data and we include total bilateral trade in addition to the sectoral flows.

The results are less supportive of the theory. In principle, SUMGDP should have a negative sign

as type-m firms replace type-n firms when total two-country income grows, and this holds in four

of the six regressions. GDPDIFSQ and SKDIFSQ each should have negative signs. However,

GDPDIFSQ comes out positive in four specifications. Note that it takes on the correct sign when

idiosyncracies in the IIT flows with Japan and Canada are controlled with country dummies. As

is well known, Japan displayed markedly low IIT ratios in its trade with the United States during

our estimation period. Controlling for this unusual case we find that differences in GDP

negatively affect intra-industry trade. Skill differences have consistently negative signs but do

not achieve statistical significance in the explanation of IIT.

       The interaction term GDPDIFF*SKDIFF should be negative. Figures 1, 2 and 4 suggest
                                                 16

that IIT should be high when one country is small and skilled-labor abundant, implying that IIT

should be large when GDPDIFF*SKDIFF is negative. The interaction term always has the right

sign and achieves statistical significance in three cases. Note that this variable performs better

when investment and trade costs are included.

       The INVCJ variables should be positive and the TCJ variable negative, and these

hypotheses are generally confirmed in the data. Without controlling for Japan and Canada, we

find that an increase in host-country investment costs significantly expands intra-industry trade.

Again, however, Japanese history suggests an anomaly: it is costly to invest in Japan but there is

relatively little IIT between the United States and that country.

       In Table 5, the ratio IIAS/IIT is the dependent variable and there are 181 observations.

Again, these are OLS regressions because the dependent variable may range without limit. Joint

market size, or SUMGDP, should be positive as type-m firms displace type-n firms. This result

is robust and powerful in the econometric estimates. The diagrams discussed above suggest that

the impacts of SKDIFSQ should be negative, as they are. Thus, intra-industry sales rise in

comparison with intra-industry trade as countries grow richer and are more similar in size.

       However, the theory does not suggest a very sharp hypothesis with respect to

GDPDIFSQ. An increase in the size difference should lower the ratio when countries have

similar endowments (the numerator falls, the denominator is constant) but raise the ratio when

the countries have different relative endowments (the numerator is constant, the denominator

falls). Yet in spite of some theoretical ambiguity, the signs are consistently negative, even if

significance levels are low. Thus, the IIAS index seems to grow relative to the IIT index as

countries become more similar in relative endowments.
                                                 17

        A puzzle is why the trade and investment cost variables have the wrong signs in Table 5

(although they always have very large standard errors) since they do well in the IIAS and IIT

regressions and have opposite signs in those regressions. The results in tables 3 and 4 lead us to

expect that the coefficients on INVCJ should be negative, and those on TCJ should be positive,

in Table 5. Why they are not is unclear to us at this point.



5.      Summary and Conclusions

        The purpose of this paper is to present a unified model of intra-industry trade and intra-

industry affiliate production and sales where the pattern of firm location, production, and trade

are simultaneously and endogenously determined. This model is then used to generate

predictions about how IIT and IIAS indices should be related to country characteristics and to

trade and investment costs. The principal conclusions of the paper are as follows.

        The IIAS regressions fit the theory very well. The index is higher as the two countries are

richer and more similar in size and in relative endowments.

        The IIT regressions fit less well. The sign on GDPDIFSQ is inconsistent, though it works

as hypothesized when trade with Japan is controlled for. The interaction term between

differences in country size and differences in relative endowments always has the correct sign is

generally statistically significant.

        While the theory regarding the ratio IIAS/IIT does not always give sharp predictions, the

positive sign on the SUMGDP coefficient is robust. The ratio regressions suggest that balanced

direct investment, much more than trade, is encouraged by higher incomes and country similarity

in terms of size and labor-force composition. Note that skill differences could be considered also
                                                 18

a proxy for per capita income. This last result complements earlier findings in Carr, Markusen

and Maskus (2001) and Markusen and Maskus (2001) that the level of affiliate sales rises with

country incomes and with their similarity in size and in relative endowments. Combining the

findings of those papers with the current analysis, we conclude that increased incomes and

increased similarity in size and in relative endowments increases both the level of affiliate

activity and the balance of affiliate activity between country pairs.
